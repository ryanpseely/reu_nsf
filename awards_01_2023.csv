The categories used within different systems of classification group the entities, processes, and systems that are the subject matter of the science, and determine how one differs from another. Agricultural science is a particularly important focus for studying systems of classification because social norms such as farm productivity, environmental quality and the economic competitiveness of farmers have long been explicitly recognized as values that influence the content and methods in agronomy, horticulture, and animal science. The project will apply analytic methods from the philosophy of science to improve understanding of how social, economic, ethical, and political values interact with biologically-oriented science in the agricultural sciences. <br/><br/>This project will advance the clarity and quality of social and political debates that are currently shaping the practice of plant and animal food production with respect to issues such as environmental sustainability, food justice, adjustments to agriculture in response to climate change, and the welfare of livestock in intensive production systems. The core research team will identify categories and classification methods that proved decisive in steering the direction of research, or its subsequent application in several case studies on the agricultural sciences. A larger community including scholars working on agricultural science and veteran agricultural researchers will be created to steer, critique, and work collaboratively with the PIs. Research from the project will be published and will serve as the basis for a course designed for Colleges of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Colleges of Arts and Letters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with understanding how the solutions to such equations behave. The Laplace equation is the prototypical elliptic PDE, and it is used to model steady-state homogeneous systems. This equation is studied in the fields of PDE, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, geometry, and engineering; and therefore, the behavior of its solutions (known as harmonic functions) is very well-understood. However, many questions remain regarding the behavior of solutions to more complicated equations like those that model quantum behavior, systems with microscopic structure, and systems that are changing in time. The investigator?s knowledge of harmonic functions will be used to answer these questions, thereby advancing knowledge in the areas of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Motivated by the goal of increasing participation from underrepresented groups, as well as addressing common issues with retention in academia, this project integrates an inclusive workshop in PDE and harmonic analysis. The target workshop audience will include junior mathematicians who are at difficult transitional stages in their careers, especially those from historically underrepresented groups. Speakers will be chosen to reflect the demographics of the student participants and the potential for greater diversity in our discipline.<br/><br/>The Laplace equation is a PDE that models steady-state phenomena in a truly uniform environment. Since the world that we live in is not an isotropic vacuum, the mathematical equations that govern many natural phenomena are often more complicated than Laplace?s equation. For example, the Schrodinger equation describes the behavior of quantum-mechanical waves, while its generalizations describe even more complex settings. As such, there is a need to understand the properties of solutions to general elliptic PDEs. One component of this research project revolves around using known properties of harmonic functions to gain a better understanding of solutions to elliptic equations. Specifically, the investigator will explore how the presence of variable coefficients and lower-order terms affects the behavior of solutions to elliptic equations. This line of inquiry will be addressed through the perspectives of unique continuation and homogenization theory. Given that parabolic equations like the heat equation model the evolution of systems that are changing in time, it is also important to understand how the solutions to such PDE behave. Therefore, in another direction, the investigator will use elliptic theory to tackle problems related to parabolic PDE. More specifically, the investigator will construct a framework for using elliptic theory in high-dimensional settings to understand the properties of solutions to parabolic equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This requires these systems to quickly and accurately solve motion planning and control problems. Unfortunately, many state-of-the-art algorithms used to solve these problems today are too slow to run in real-time, limiting such systems. This project helps alleviate these issues by leveraging parallel computing and machine learning to develop new solvers that accelerate the computation of optimization-based algorithms used for planning and control. This project addresses critical scientific needs for practical online planning and control for field robots and results in open-source solver artifacts that can be used in wider scientific computing domains such as operations research. This project also directly feeds into the development of new open-source robotics courses and, as the project is located at an undergraduate women?s college, this research also provides opportunities for a number of women undergraduates to participate in research - many for the first time.<br/><br/>This project addresses the computational challenges of mixed-integer trajectory optimization problems, which are crucial for motion planning and control in autonomous systems operating in unstructured environments. The project builds on recent research that has shown that these algorithms can be accelerated through parallelism using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and machine learning. The project develops an open-source GPU-accelerated mixed-integer solver architecture. A learned parallel search heuristic that accelerates the outer branch-and-bound layer of the overall solver is developed by leveraging domain knowledge and machine learning. A GPU-accelerated direct trajectory optimization solver is also developed for the underlying continuous problem. This underlying solver takes advantage of the block-tridiagonal structure of the Schur Complement of the trajectory optimization problem through a novel symmetric stair preconditioner, a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, and a block-factorization-based solver. The overall solver is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art approaches through simulation and on a physical quadruped robot to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating dynamic locomotion behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, traditional graph algorithms are often no anymore viable because graphs in modern applications like?the internet/traffic/social networks are always evolving. To address this issue, dynamic graph algorithms research aims to design efficient methods for maintaining useful information (e.g., connectivity, shortest paths, matching) on graphs undergoing updates through time without wastefully recomputing answers from scratch after each update. In the last few years, several breakthroughs in dynamic graph problems reveal promising connections to other areas which are still unexplored and only known among experts. The goal of the project is to deepen, broaden, and popularize the theory of these connections, and continue attacking fundamental barriers in the field, as they will likely lead to even more exciting tools and connections. This research direction goes hand-in-hand with educational plans, such as developing a new undergraduate course on the principles of dynamic algorithms, publishing online educational videos, and bringing together researchers from related areas to exchange ideas and techniques through workshops. <br/><br/>More concretely, this project aims to investigate the following connections between dynamic graph algorithms and other areas. The first direction is to develop generic techniques for dynamic algorithms robust against an adaptive adversary by using connections to differential privacy, cryptography, and fine-grained complexity theory. The second direction is to develop new sublinear time algorithms, graph sparsification, and graph decomposition techniques that will lead to breakthroughs in dynamic algorithms. The third direction is to dynamize continuous optimization methods and develop optimization tools for dynamic problems. Via these connections, the investigator aims to obtain optimal algorithms for fundamental dynamic graph problems, including dynamic matching, max flow, and reachability problems. These are the holy-grail problems that have exponential upper and lower bound gaps. Hence, even partial progress should advance our understanding of the field and be useful as a subroutine for future algorithms. The multi-disciplinary approach above should naturally make impacts beyond dynamic graph algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sadly, the underlying technology is changing, making continued scaling difficult. Thus, recent work has examined combining multiple smaller chips (chiplets) into a larger, aggregated system. Chiplet-based heterogeneous systems avoid the challenges of modern, large monolithic heterogeneous systems, enable continued performance and energy scaling, and allow closer integration of components than was previously possible. Unfortunately, chiplets also introduce new challenges: how to schedule computation across the computational resources and how to coordinate data movement between resources. The control plane in modern, monolithic heterogeneous systems utilizes a centralized embedded, programmable core, a command processor (CP), to perform these tasks. However, chiplet-based heterogeneous systems introduce an additional layer of hierarchy, causing indirection and non-uniformity that clash with the centralized CP. This project will fix these problems and advance science by creating a distributed, fully featured, programmable, programmer-transparent control plane that will significantly improve the efficiency of future chiplet-based heterogeneous systems. Moreover, this project will open new areas of research and enable chip designers to efficiently design and integrate future chiplet-based heterogeneous systems. To broaden the community and reduce barriers to entry the project will (1) release the developed software artifacts, hardware designs, and interfaces, (2) work with industry collaborators to influence subsequent products, (3) develop new courses to teach the next generation of students how to use and accelerate chiplet-based heterogeneous systems, and (4) work with underrepresented communities in Madison to help increase their STEM participation.<br/><br/>To realize these opportunities, this project partitions the centralized CP into local, per-chiplet CPs which, in concert with a global CP, coordinate communication and computation across accelerators. The local CPs provide dynamic, microsecond-scale information about the current behavior within each chiplet, while global CP possess a global view across chiplets by synthesizing information from the local CPs. Given this partitioned design, the project?s key tasks include improving accelerator utilization by identifying and harnessing algorithmic parallelism in the global CP, creating novel local and global CP schedulers that transparently and efficiently divide work across chiplets to meet real-time deadlines and retain data locality and placement benefits, and designing an innovative coherence protocol that monitors and tracks dependence information in the local and global CPs, and performs expensive inter-chiplet implicit synchronization operations only when necessary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is now a vital and growing area of research in mathematical analysis with connections to a broad range of subjects, including geometry, number theory, and combinatorics.  The main purpose of this project will be to develop new tools in harmonic analysis and combinatorics to investigate questions central to ergodic theory and convex geometry.  In ergodic theory, the PI will consider a variant of the widely studied Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture, for dynamical systems with the underlying structure of nilpotent groups.  In harmonic analysis, maximal operators over high-dimensional convex bodies will be investigated in connection with the isotropic constant conjecture, a major open problem in convex geometry.  The educational component of this CAREER project will contribute to the training of students and postdoctoral fellows while promoting mathematics to the broader community and encouraging the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups.  The PI will continue to supervise undergraduate and graduate students and run his widely subscribed Ergodic Theory and Analysis online seminar series.  The PI will also organize five online, one-week workshops, which will combine research training with professional development for undergraduate and graduate students interested in pursuing further education and academic careers in mathematics.  <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project aims to develop new methods in harmonic analysis, number theory, and probability to understand central problems in ergodic theory and convex geometry.  The primary focus in ergodic theory will be to understand norm and pointwise convergence phenomena for linear polynomial ergodic averages, toward the goal of proving a linear variant of the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture in the context of all nilpotent groups.  The project will also investigate the maximal functions corresponding to the Hardy-Littlewood averaging operators associated with convex symmetric bodies.  The longstanding question of whether dimension-free estimates may be obtained for these maximal functions is related to the isotropic constant conjecture in high-dimensional convex geometry, which in turn has inspired deep and unexpected connections to many challenging questions in convex geometry, Banach space theory, and beyond.  Describing the optimal constant in the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality in this setting would establish a new link between the dimension-free conjecture and the isotropic constant conjecture, and a new point of view on the latter problem, which has not yet been explored using tools from harmonic analysis. In addition, the project will develop tools in Fourier analysis and additive number theory toward a study of Weyl-type inequalities in the nilpotent setting and their applications to a nilpotent Waring problem as well as to a dimension-free variant of the classical Waring problem for squares.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A power management unit is a mainstream circuit that manages the power flow in systems-on-chip using various power converters, including switched-capacitor circuits. With the increasing demands for higher performance and multifunctional systems-on-chip, designing efficient, compact, and integrated power management unit faces many challenges. First, an accurate and fast behavioral model for switched-capacitor circuits is required to assist designers in optimizing various parameters at the early design stages. Second, there is a critical need for better switched-capacitor circuits that can achieve both high power and area efficiency. Third, efficient control circuits are required to support switched-capacitor circuits and other power converters to enhance power efficiency. The broad goal of this CAREER proposal is to pursue innovative research directions in mixed-signal design at modeling, converter architecture, and circuit levels to address these challenges and pave the way for ground-breaking innovations in modeling and circuit implementations. This CAREER proposal will significantly impact the research front by advancing the knowledge in power management design and providing the research community with new models and circuits that can be applied to various applications. The educational aspects include filling the gap in the electrical and computer engineering curriculum related to mixed-signal circuit design. The outreach activities include developing a summer course for K-12 students through collaboration with the K-12 Educational Outreach Office at Wayne State University. Also, the activities will include collaborating with industry to train students on chip design tools and provide them with timely and relevant skill sets.<br/><br/>This CAREER explores new design directions at the modeling, converter architecture, and control circuit levels toward efficient power management units. At the modeling level, a new resistor-network behavioral model is proposed to describe the electrical characteristics of generic switched-capacitor circuits over the entire operating frequency range, unlocking new possibilities to optimize switched-capacitor circuits quickly and accurately. At the architecture level, a new stacked charge pump is proposed that provides a high voltage conversion ratio and superior area efficiency by reducing the number of pump capacitors while maintaining high power efficiency. At the circuit level, a new circuit family is proposed that can be used to design power and area-efficient control circuits for various power converters, including multi-stable analog memory for maximum power transfer, a low-power clock generator that enables frequency and pulse width modulation and zero current switching circuits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications and websites rely deeply on their efficient operation to serve millions to billions of users. To improve the useful utilization of cloud servers and ease application development, cloud platforms have recently developed a new design paradigm known as serverless computing. New serverless applications are made of very small pieces of code, which often run for just milliseconds, in contrast to traditional applications. This research project investigates the implications of this change on microprocessors which have been historically designed for long-running applications. The project explores how to modify the cores of the microprocessor to improve their energy efficiency when running such serverless applications. Improving the efficiency of serverless computing in cloud data centers will enable cost savings and a reduced environmental footprint across economic sectors while lowering the barrier to entry for new entrants with novel applications. In addition, this project integrates an education plan featuring a new change of major pipeline and participation in equitable and inclusive teaching practices workshops to broadly enhance the diversity of the growing cloud computing and computer science workforce.<br/><br/>This project investigates the impacts of emerging, short-lived applications like serverless computing on the prediction structures embedded into microprocessors designed with long-lived applications in mind. Serverless applications waste significant energy and time running on today's server processors, but they have been adopted to improve overall server utilization and developer productivity. Saving the contents, or microarchitectural checkpointing, of structures like branch predictors and caches thus has the potential to drastically improve the efficiency of serverless and supercharge traditional applications by eliminating microarchitectural training time. This project investigates which structures are best to checkpoint, implements checkpointing mechanisms into commercially-adopted, open-source processors, designs the user and operating system software interfaces to the programmer, and proposes new security protections needed to make the checkpointing adoptable.

For particularly complex models, such as those used in automotive crash or those of national defense interest. Current techniques to achieve these analyses consume significant computational resources, approximate the geometries of intended objects for analysis, and do not leverage modern high-accuracy computational tools for the finite element method. Even though research has progressed to show that so-called isogeometric finite element methods are more accurate than traditional finite element methods for computational analysis, the scientific and engineering community lacks the tools necessary to generate computational models suitable for such analyses. This research creates a framework through which scientists and engineers can convert a computer-aided model or mesh of a geometry or potential design into a three-dimensional representation that directly represents the intended domain without approximation and that leverages spline-based isogeometric tools for more accurate physics-based simulations. This work supports national security interests by providing access to higher-fidelity analysis results and by streamlining the process by which engineers arrive at these results. It also helps develop more accurate models for use by the automotive industry such as in simulating crash, resulting in safer and more sustainable vehicles. The developed toolset is made publicly available for use and continued enhancement. The research helps train and diversify the US cyberinfrastructure community through mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and underrepresented groups in STEM fields.<br/><br/>In particular, this work defines a technique to create a well-structured hexahedral decomposition of a computer-aided design geometry or a surface mesh that can be output for use either using traditional finite element methods or more structured isogeometric methods. The framework relies on concepts from differential geometry and Morse theory, and mathematically guarantees a valid volumetric discretization of the geometry from a surface parameterization. Both the theory and the computational tools constructed from the theory are validated by reconstructing (a) a vehicle of interest to the United States Army and (b) a left ventricle of a patient-specific heart model. Finally, both academic and industrial communities are provided access to the developed software through a permissive license that invites use and future development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This versatile framework includes a vast array of models in the natural sciences, for example, the dynamics of populations of animals and plants in an ecological system, and the shape and form of a turbulent wake behind a passing ship. The work in this proposal concerns chaotic behavior of dynamical systems, signified, for instance, by sensitive dependence on initial conditions ? a phenomenon also known as ?the butterfly effect,? in which tiny changes to the initial preparation of an experiment lead to drastically different outcomes as time progresses.  Chaos is nearly ubiquitous in systems of practical interest.  An example from everyday life is weather prediction: sensitive dependence explains, for instance, why the predicted path of a hurricane widens as one forecasts further into the future, as small imprecisions in our measurements of the present weather system are ?amplified? as time progresses. This CAREER grant will integrate the PI?s research work into educational programs, including directed reading programs and research opportunities for undergraduate students; the introduction of new undergraduate and graduate courses on the treatment of chaotic dynamical systems using tools from probability theory; and a summer school for graduate students in mathematics helping to bring them to the research front of this compelling and rapidly evolving field.  <br/><br/>Chaos is a nearly ubiquitous feature of dynamical systems of practical interest, from low-dimensional toy models to high-dimensional systems, including a wide variety of infinite-dimensional dynamics proscribed by evolutionary PDE such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations governing the motion of a viscous fluid.  The tools of smooth ergodic theory provide an abstract framework for understanding chaotic behavior in dynamical systems through the study of their statistical properties, such as the decay of correlations.  However, it remains a major challenge to apply this collection of abstract tools to many systems of practical interest.  For instance, despite considerable supporting numerical evidence, it remains an open problem to prove that the Chirikov standard map has a positive Lyapunov exponent on a positive-volume subset of phase space.  Recent work of the PI and others has uncovered that a small amount of nondegenerate noise is ?amplified? by the presence of stretching in phase space, rendering tractable the problem of determining whether the dynamics is chaotic.  This principle has been applied by the PI to a variety of dynamical systems relevant to practical applications, such as fluid dynamics.  For instance, it was shown by the PI and collaborators that passive tracer (Lagrangian) flow in an incompressible fluid ? such as the motion traced out by a mote of dust suspended in a fluid ? is chaotic in the above sense. This led to a mathematical proof of Batchelor?s law, a quantitative prediction of the formation of small-scale structures in the concentration profile of a solute, such as the billowing patterns formed by drops of milk poured into a cup of coffee.  This project seeks to build off these successes by applying smooth ergodic theory to more complicated dynamical systems, e.g., the evolution of an incompressible velocity field by the Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of noise (the so-called Eulerian dynamics of a fluid). A long-term goal along these lines is a detailed, mathematically rigorous investigation into the transition from laminar and ordered behavior to chaotic and unpredictable dynamics seen in many fluid systems as Reynolds? number is increased.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop a framework for robust computational-imaging system design, where the data acquisition and data processing are jointly designed in tandem to address the mismatch between the idealized performance of physical systems and their real-world behavior. The research aims to enable reliable imaging in dynamically evolving clinical and scientific-research settings, for example by reducing acquisition times, imaging moving objects, and compensating for system imperfections.

Superconductivity is a collective quantum mechanical state of electrons that can conduct electricity with zero electrical resistance. Topological superconductors additionally possess special quantum mechanical states on their surfaces called Majorana modes. Owing to these Majorana modes, topological superconductors could be a platform for quantum computing that is highly resistant to the environmental noise that spoils the quantum states leading to errors. However, a key challenge that hinders experimental progress is the difficulty in discovering actual superconducting materials that unambiguously exhibit Majorana modes. To predict new topological superconductors, the PI aims to harness recent experimental breakthroughs that provide new opportunities to realize predicted topological and other quantum phases through manipulating stacked atomically thin layers of materials known as van der Waals materials.<br/><br/>The PI and her group will develop fundamental guiding principles for identifying and designing materials and materials systems exhibiting topological superconductivity and various quantum phases self-organized through strong electron interactions. In particular, the PI will focus on how to achieve targeted phases in Van der Waals material systems using experimentally accessible ?knobs?, such as the relative orientation between layers and the structure and composition of the individual layers.

The rareness of materials that are topological superconductors has been one of the key challenges in the field, which hinders experimental investigations and applications of first- and higher-order topological superconducting phases in two and three dimensions. Recent experimental breakthroughs in engineering few-layer Van der Waals systems provide new opportunities to realize topological and correlated phases. Nonetheless, the huge multi-dimensional parameter space of material species, lattice structures, twist angle, and other experimental tuning knobs invites theory guidance for designing target-oriented new systems. The proposed research seeks to obtain theory derived guiding principles and predict concrete candidate systems hosting topological superconducting and correlated phases in few- layer Van der Waals materials. To achieve these goals, the PI will employ or develop mathematical frameworks for higher order topological superconductivity protected by crystalline symmetries, techniques treating single particle and many-body moire physics, as well as novel machine learning methods. This research is aimed to mobilize experimental efforts by (1) deriving comprehensive recipes for material design of higher-order topological superconductivity in Van der Waals systems, (2) developing a systematic four-stage approach for searches of topological superconductors using material databases and machine learning methods, and (3) proposing new twisted and untwisted Van der Waals systems that could host various correlated phases by designing renormalization group flows.<br/><br/>This award supports education and outreach programs that target parents of pre-K children, academic mothers, and female researchers. Activities include initiating the programs: <br/>1. A Hundred Thousand Whys in Nature: a public multi-media channel for parents of pre-K children. <br/>This channel will publish podcasts that provide short and correct explanations for physics-related ?popular? questions kids often ask using toddler-friendly language. Polls and questionnaires will be held to collect suggestions and feedback from the parents.<br/>2. Coffee Breaks for Mothers in Academics: Support groups for female researchers. <br/>Support groups will be formed for female students, postdocs, and faculty who are of child-bearing age, are expecting or have children in the South Bend area. The mentor-mentee relationships and experience of sharing are aimed to provide emotional and career support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematically, many such wave propagation phenomena can be described in terms of nonlinear dispersive equations. While waves typically spread out and decay, a striking feature of these nonlinear evolution equations is that they may admit particle-like solutions, often called solitons, whose shapes persist as time goes by. The mathematical understanding of their dynamics is still far from complete. The main research goal of this project is to investigate, in the context of classical topological field theories that arise in mathematical physics, how nonlinear waves can form particle-like structures and how these structures interact with each other. The educational component of the project seeks to enhance the training of graduate students and postdocs by organizing minicourses and workshops related to the research of the project and by providing professional development opportunities with an emphasis on presentation skills.<br/><br/>This project focuses on soliton dynamics for several well-known classical topological field theories in mathematical physics. Three prime examples of topological solitons are at the center of the investigation: kinks, vortices, and skyrmions in one, two, and three space dimensions, respectively. Heuristically, these solitons owe their stability to their topological underpinnings. However, the mathematical justification of this intuition is still rather poorly understood and mostly open. The overarching goal of the project is to establish asymptotic stability results for these classical topological solitons, and thus to rigorously justify the heuristics for their stability. Over the course of the project the investigator also plans to move towards studying multi-soliton configurations in these and related settings. Beyond the intrinsic interest in the fundamental problems at the center of this project, their resolution will have significant impact on the analysis of strong nonlinear interactions between solitons and radiation in the context of many other nonlinear dispersive equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) consist typically of septic tanks connected to leach fields to enable the transport and disposal of liquid effluents in the surrounding soils via networks of drainage pipes. OWTS are predominantly designed to provide primary treatment during which organic wastes and suspended solids in household sewage settle to the bottom of septic tanks where they are partially degraded by microorganisms. Because OWTS are not designed to effectively remove nutrients,  the liquid effluents of septic tanks are among the largest sources of nitrogen (N) pollution for shallow groundwater aquifers as they leak into the surrounding subsurface soils. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to explore the development and validation of the next generation of biofiltration systems for nitrogen (N) removal from OWTS. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator proposes to test the hypothesis that biofiltration systems based on the integration of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) microbiomes with sorbents such as biochar could provide efficient and cost-effective solutions for N removal from the liquid effluents of septic tanks. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to support the development and deployment of more efficient and sustainable solutions to manage and mitigate N pollution from households and other facilities that are not connected to centralized wastewater treatment systems. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student and one undergraduate student at Stony Brook University.<br/><br/>Soil-based biofiltration systems have emerged as promising add-on modules to onsite wastewater treatment systems for the removal of nitrogen (N) from the effluents of septic tanks. However, current soil biofilters require a large footprint and an external carbon source (e.g., woodchips) to stimulate and support the growth and metabolic activity of denitrifying microorganisms. This CAREER project will explore the development of novel soil biofilters for N removal based on a hybrid physical/chemical and biological treatment process that integrates biochar sorbents with anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) microbiomes. The proposed research builds upon the results of previous investigations that have established that anammox microbiomes play a critical role in the conversion of N compounds to dinitrogen (N2) gas in soils, wetlands, and marine/freshwater sediments. The specific objectives of the research are to: 1) investigate the partial denitrification/anammox (PDN/An) of N compounds in model biofiltration units using biochar as sorbents and microbiome carriers; 2) evaluate the effects of operational changes and environmental parameters on the efficiency of PDN/An biofiltration units and, 3) investigate and optimize the operation of a modular biofiltration system for efficient N removal and evaluate the system?s long-term performance using molecular tools and kinetic modeling. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to advance the development and implementation of more efficient soil-based biofilters for removing N from the liquid effluents of onsite wastewater treatment systems. To implement the educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to leverage existing programs and resources at Stony Brook University (SBU) to develop and deliver new learning opportunities in environmental engineering (EE) for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students with a focus on engaging female students. The proposed education and outreach activities will include 1) a one-week summer program to provide Long Island middle school students (7-9th Grade) with hands-on learning activities in engineering and technology and 2) a 10-week outreach program during the academic year to host 5-10 female students and introduce them to the science and engineering of soil-based biofiltration systems for onsite wastewater treatment.

Thus, HfO2 is today's most promising material for next-generation non-volatile, high-density, and high-speed ferroelectric memories. However, the microscopic origin of HfO2's ferroelectricity remains elusive, hindering the development of HfO2-based ferroelectric devices. Recent theoretical work suggested that HfO2's ferroelectricity may originate from exotic flat polar phonon bands, and these flat bands are directly associated with the atomic-scale separation of polar and space layers, which can enable atomic-scale manipulation of polarization. This project aims to fill the important gap: utilize the laser floating zone crystal growth method to stabilize the metastable ferroelectric phase in large bulk crystals and the inelastic neutron scattering technique on the crystals to validate the scenario of flat polar phonon bands. The inelastic neutron scattering method can detect phonon bands in a wide range of wavevectors and energies. Flat bands in quantum materials, such as flat bands of electrons, have been known to cause various novel quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity. However, the function of flat polar phonon bands is poorly understood. This project would reveal the effect of flat polar phonon bands on ferroelectricity, which can be directly relevant to atomic-scale ferroelectric manipulation. The results would also provide a new approach for improving the ferroelectric properties of HfO2-based materials, e.g., fine tunning the ferroelectric properties by engineering the flat polar phonon bands. The PI effectively integrates the research activities with education at all academic levels (K-12 students, undergraduates, and graduates) to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Central in this subject is the study of knotting and linking of circles in three-dimensional spaces, called knot theory. For instance, knots and links can be used to construct three- and four-dimensional spaces. Low dimensional topology and knot theory have various connections to cosmology and physics (the shape of the universe and string theory), and biochemistry (the knotting behavior of DNA molecules). Unintuitively, many classification questions in topology are harder in dimensions three and four, and over the past three decades, topologists have developed modern tools (with roots in physics) for studying these questions. Two examples of such tools are Heegaard Floer invariants, which grew out of gauge theory, and Khovanov homology, which has roots in representation theory. This project will further develop these invariants and investigate their similarities and relations. Moreover, it will harness their power to study symmetries of surfaces (two-dimensional spaces), in connection with hyperbolic geometry and dynamics, and will investigate several fundamental questions in low-dimensional topology such as finding the minimum number of times a knot must cross itself to become unknotted. In parallel, this project aims to make mathematics and in particular topology accessible to a broad audience, through educational activities at all levels with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion. These activities include, establishing a Math Circle program in the Athens-Clarke County public library and organizing summer Math Camps for high school and middle school students, running a summer research experience project for undergraduate students and a topology summer school for graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The major goals of this research program are organized around four areas. First, developing new invariants for studying spatial graphs and graph concordance. The main tool will be a generalization of (minus) Heegaard Floer homology called, tangle Floer homology. Studying spatial graphs up to concordance has applications in studying equivariant concordance between knots, and strong concordance between links. Second, studying mapping class group and extensions of surface diffeomorphisms over handlebodies using another generalization of Heegaard Floer homology, called bordered Heegaard Floer homology. Third, further developing the bordered Heegaard Floer homology tools by generalizing and refining the contact invariant defined by the PI and her co-authors and use it to address open questions in contact topology. Lastly, the PI focuses on connections and similarities between Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer invariants, with the three major goals of defining new concordance invariants to study smooth 4D Poincare conjecture, finding new lower bounds for the unknotting number and developing new invariants for transverse knots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Number theory deals with properties of whole numbers, such as quickly factoring large numbers into primes, and underpins computer security and behavior of black holes. Harmonic analysis can be viewed as mathematically making a sculpture out of unformed clay; this field takes a complicated function and breaks it up into simple pieces ? its harmonics ? and is central to medical imaging and quantum states. Imagining and building a new landscape where areas sometimes perceived as disconnected can harmonize is at the forefront of this project: Instead of exploiting known connections, new ones will be created centered around three distinct areas. Firstly, quantitative behavior of discrete operators with curvature will be undertaken; while relevant to many applications, the novelty here will be developing the infrastructure to use both analysis and number theory from the perspective of both fields. The second part will be a continuation of the discovery of hidden number theoretic properties in the framework underlying harmonic analysis, furthering this mathematical grid system in both areas. Finally, determining the behavior of a random object of algebraic interest, such as a polynomial, is a central problem in mathematics. By integrating Fourier analysis into this playing field, will enable a better prediction of this randomness in a wide variety of ways. Undergraduates will be heavily involved in research, especially in the second part, via a summer and semester research and training program. The multifaceted and network-building education plan further includes the teaching of a graduate class intitled ?Widening the margins: the experience of URMs in the mathematical sciences,? which will be developed in collaboration with the institution?s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office.<br/><br/>The project consists of three main programs, all on the intersection between harmonic analysis and number theory. Firstly, operator bounds for discrete operators involving integration over curved submanifolds will be obtained. This is a delicate topic in continuous analysis and the discrete setting introduces new challenges and obstacles. A development of number theoretic tools in tandem with the analysis will dramatically push forward understanding of these objects. Additionally, these bounds are connected to lattice point counts and information on this front will be quantified via refined analysis of exponential sums, including discrete restriction problems for a variety of surfaces that are translation dilation invariant. Secondly, a continued uncovering of a hidden number theoretic structure and techniques in the realm of dyadic analysis will be pursued, leading to a myriad of structure theorems. Thirdly, the program in Fourier analytic techniques in arithmetic statistics will use novel insights from analysis to improve a variety of counts of algebraic interest, such as fields and polynomials. Prior investigations here have already been successful as recent results include a major step in resolving a conjecture of van der Waerden on Galois groups of random polynomials and counting number fields of bounded discriminant. Investigations along these lines will be continued.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although stream ecologists have recognized the critical ecological role of floodplains for decades, and hydrological, geomorphic, and biogeochemical research now increasingly emphasizes the importance of floodplains, floodplains do not receive the legal protection of navigable water and have been extensively altered throughout the US. Consequently, one of the issues now at the forefront of river management and restoration is how to effectively re-connect altered channels and floodplains. Reconnection requires multiple changes of differing importance in specific settings. Large wood (LW) reintroduction or retention falls within this scope, but guidelines have not been developed regarding how much LW to reintroduce, in what configuration, and where. This research will address an important gap in knowledge regarding the quantitative impacts of LW jams on channel-floodplain hydrologic connectivity and how these impacts can inform river restoration design. <br/><br/>Large wood can be a dominant driver of channel and floodplain complexity. LW can alter the local distribution of hydraulic forces, sediment dynamics, hyporheic exchange flows, channel cross-sectional and planform geometry, and channel-floodplain connectivity. These effects operate in a nonlinear fashion as accumulations of LW in a logjam and in progressively larger and more closely spaced logjams create emergent patterns in these response variables. However, thresholds can not yet be predicted for the magnitude of change in response variables with respect to LW quantity or spatial distribution. This is important in the context of river restoration, which reintroduces LW in channels despite inability to predict hydraulic, geomorphic, or ecological responses. This knowledge gap of quantitatively predicting the physical effects of LW on channel-floodplain hydrologic connectivity will be addressed by by (i) measuring LW and associated connectivity in diverse field settings; (ii) assessing threshold responses in connectivity due to river morphologic and LW characteristics; and (iii) developing guidelines for representing LW characteristics and associated hydraulic responses in numerical models. In this context, the project defines channel-floodplain hydrologic connectivity as being present when flow overtops the morphological channel banks and spreads onto the adjacent floodplain. The project objectives are to: (1) collect data from natural channels on LW jam characteristics and associated influences on channel-floodplain connectivity; (2) use these data to develop guidelines for calibrating LW characteristics and hydraulic responses in numerical hydraulic models; and (3) co-generate knowledge and best practices with river restoration practitioners for long-term monitoring of LW jam benefits. The project will integrate new knowledge of how LW jams influence channel-floodplain interactions with ongoing and future investments in river restoration projects, and planned activities are aimed to advance the sustainability of river restoration design, promote restoration monitoring and citizen-science learning to diverse stakeholders and restoration practitioners, and improve STEM education focused on sustainable and resilient natural systems. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Environmental Sustainability program in CBET/ENG and the Hydologic Sciences program in EAR/GEO.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The projects utilize atomically thin two-dimensional materials as building blocks.  A typical two-dimensional material is graphene, which consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in the form of honeycomb. Inside the material, many electrons move together and strongly interact with each other.  Combination of quantum effects and strong correlations between electrons can lead to novel phases with interesting material properties and potential technology applications. For example, a superconductor material can conduct electric current with zero resistance when it is cooled to sufficiently low temperature. Some quantum materials may be utilized to build a quantum computer.  The PI will develop various strategies to realize new quantum phases by stacking two dimensional materials together to form multilayer systems.   The multilayer materials not only have new properties unseen in the single layer case, but also enable better experimental control and characterization of the material properties.<br/><br/><br/>This award also supports the PI?s education and outreach activities.

These projects will take advantage of the recent capability to exploit the layer degree of freedom in such materials. Various theoretical and numerical methods will be utilized, including parton mean field theory, quantum field theory and density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. The studies will work closely with on-going and near future experiments in the three different platforms: (1) Novel phases of matter and their experimental signatures in bilayer moire superlattices; (2) Quantum criticality and non-Abelian fractional phases in quantum Hall bilayers; (3) Enhanced Superconductivity and Kondo transition in bilayer optical lattice.<br/><br/>The project will develop new theoretical frameworks and numerical methods for strongly correlated models, benchmarked and refined by ongoing and near future quantum simulation experiments.

Through this design, the project seeks to improve the impact of LAs on students? sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and science identity as they move through the first term of introductory biology and chemistry. LAs are undergraduate students with prior experience in a course who work with an instructor to provide support for their peers currently in an active learning classroom. While LAs have been found to increase students? belonging in gateway science courses on average, it is not known whether or how LAs can specifically support belonging and confidence for students from underserved groups. This project will advance understanding of practices that enhance the impact of LA programs for students in three groups: women, students in racially and ethnically marginalized groups, and first-generation students. Importantly, gaining a deeper understanding of how to structure an equitable LA program that serves students in large introductory courses has the potential to have a positive impact on overall student retention and success in these courses. Moreover, providing the STEM education community with equitable approaches within an LA program is likely to have implications across STEM disciplines and institution types.<br/> <br/>This project will pursue a multi-staged effort within the chemistry and biology programs of a large university to address the call for equity in STEM education. The project team will pursue three specific aims. The first is to assess the impacts of incorporating Learning Assistants (LAs) on students? sense of belonging, science self-efficacy, and science identity across student populations in gateway STEM courses. The second is to characterize the mechanisms students from groups that have been underserved describe as important for LA impacts on belonging and science self-efficacy. The final aim is to adapt the LA program to support mechanisms that promote belonging and science self-efficacy in students from groups that have been underserved. The project will use a mixed methods approach that includes validated surveys, regression approaches to determine whether incorporating LAs has different impact on different populations of students, focus group interviews, and thematic analysis to identify patterns. Using the results from the focus group interviews, the LA program will be adapted to support structures and behaviors likely to be impactful for students from groups that have been underserved. The incorporation of these changes will be assessed using instructor reports and LA field notes. The project will be evaluated by the leadership team in collaboration with an external advisory board. Findings will be shared through conferences and publications for undergraduate STEM educators to allow the adoption and adaptation of these practices. This project has the potential to expand knowledge about mechanisms by which LA programs can reduce social and psychological barriers for students from groups that have been underserved, thereby increasing belonging in gateway courses and STEM more generally. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

Nanoparticle pollution is a contemporary public health concern.  For the foreseeable future, production and application of engineered nanoparticles and exposure to incidental nanoparticles produced through human activities are expected to increase. Thus, the development of analytical tools to accurately measure, characterize, and monitor these species is critical to understanding the extent?and predicting the impact?of nanoparticle pollution.  The Gundlach-Graham group will advance the use of trace-element mass spectrometry as a tool to detect, quantify, and classify anthropogenic nanomaterials at extremely low concentrations.  They will develop novel instrumental approaches and open-source software tools to improve the throughput and accuracy of particle measurements.  As part of this project, the team will also generate and implement new educational materials to teach advanced data analysis strategies as part of analytical chemistry curricula.<br/> <br/>Nanoparticles in environmental samples are difficult to detect because they are small (hundreds to millions of atoms), dilute in terms of total mass concentration, and are often present in complex, particle-rich matrices that contain naturally occurring particulates. The aim of this research is to develop a robust high-throughput measurement system for the quantification and classification of metal-containing nanoparticles and microparticles from diverse sample types. To meet this goal, the Gundlach-Graham group will develop novel calibration approaches and data-processing strategies for the analysis of nanoparticles by single-particle inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (spICP-TOFMS). Specifically, the team will advance the use of multi-element fingerprints to separate natural NPs from anthropogenic NPs, investigate unsupervised machine learning approaches to identify novel particle classes, and create open-source software tools for the accurate and robust quantification of particle types by spICP-TOFMS.  These developments are expected to improve the ability of scientists to track nanoparticulates and to understand the fate and transport of contaminating particles in the environment. In the educational component of this proposal, the team will develop computer-based learning modules to teach basic concepts of computer programming, Monte Carlo simulation, and data analysis strategies to analytical chemistry students; these resources will be freely available and published open access.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, just like traditional software, DNNs can have ""bugs"" and be attacked. This naturally raises the question of how DNNs should be tested, validated, and ultimately verified to meet the requirements of relevant robustness and safety standards. To address this question, researchers have developed powerful formal methods and tools to verify DNNs.  However, despite many recent advances, existing approaches and tools still have challenges in achieving good precision and scalability. Moreover, they could produce unsound results and do not apply to DNNs such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This project aims to address these challenges. The project's novelties are the integration of learning and abstraction ability in modern constraint solvers for accurate and scalable DNN verification, stress-testing DNN verifiers and certifying their results, and tackling GNNs through the lenses of other DNN approaches. The project's impacts are the development of new theories, advanced methods, and practical tools to ensure the accuracy and quality of DNN systems.<br/><br/>The project has four technical research components. The first component develops NeuralSAT, a constraint-solver for DNNs that combines the conflict-driven clause learning ability of modern SAT solving and abstraction-based theory solver in SMT solving.  The second component makes NeuralSAT more precise and efficient at scale by developing non-convex abstractions and leveraging heuristics and optimizations in modern SAT solvers. The third component uses clause learning and metamorphic testing to help developers find bugs in their DNN verifiers during production and certify their results during deployment.  The fourth component explores GNNs, a powerful model in deep learning but with few existing formal techniques and tools by reducing GNN to Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), which allows for the applications of FNN analyzers to GNNs. The project will benefit society by improving the reliability of systems embedding DNNs.  The research contributes to ML by developing effective techniques to verify DNNs, allowing AI/ML researchers and users to improve their DNNs and deploy them with confidence.

The principal investigators aim to resolve the temporal and kinematic relationships among structures by (1) determining the timing and magnitude of deformation in the Eastern Precordillera thrust front and (2) interrogating how spatial patterns in exhumational cooling and subsidence coincide with predictions based on the various structural geometries and kinematics proposed for the region. Their research plan will integrate geologic and structural mapping, basin analysis, geo- and thermochronology, and flexural thermokinematic modeling to discriminate between hypothesized structural models. Evaluating spatial-temporal relationships among the seismically active, structural domains in Argentina will inform models of subsurface structural geometries, how shortening transfers from lower to upper crustal levels, and the long-term interactions between frontal thrust structures and foreland-basin sedimentation. New results will quantify the effects of enhanced mechanical coupling between the subducting and overriding plate during flat slab subduction, which dictates the thermo-tectonic evolution of orogenesis and topographic growth and decay of mountain belts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) connect physical devices to the Internet and to each other. This research explores the marriage between edge computing and CPS, namely edge-based CPS. It has attracted a tremendous amount of attention from both academia and industry because it is expected to fundamentally change the way people interact with engineered systems. One essential element ?the study of fault-tolerant distributed primitives? is still missing in the literature. This research is focused on distributed consensus primitives that allow a collection of nodes to work as a coherent entity in the presence of various failures and cyberattacks. Concretely, there are three interrelated tasks: (i) identifying fundamental properties, limitations, and trade-offs in the context of edge-based CPS; (ii) designing algorithms that automatically adapt under changing conditions and varying cyberattacks to maintain good performance; and (iii) designing and implementing a realistic simulator to study performance under practical scenarios. The expected outcomes will enable efficient and fault-tolerant services for edge-based CPS, allowing more innovation in CPS applications. This research is expected to advance the state of knowledge by identifying a set of principles, fault-tolerance tools, and analyses for designing distributed fault-tolerant primitives. The work will emphasize models and primitives that allow for practical implementation, with plans for realistic demonstrations of their fault-tolerance and performance advantages. <br/><br/>Edge computing and CPS are expected to be key components of next-generation infrastructure, so making edge-based CPS fault-tolerant can yield large-scale benefits. Conversely, missed opportunities for improvements caused by a lack of foundational understanding could have significant performance and fault-tolerance consequences. This research helps address these issues by identifying trade-offs and limitations. The proposed research also plans to develop new pedagogical material on distributed systems that the PI plans to teach, both through courses at Boston College and in online tutorials made available to the public. In addition, the research and outreach work will benefit society by providing principles to help industry and academia design fault-tolerant primitives for edge-based CPS; increasing partnerships between academia and industry; involving women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented groups in STEM; and increasing public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over 1.4 million people live with SCI-related disabilities, which leads to lower participation and gives rise to substantial individual and societal costs. Most of the current neurotechnology for the spinal cord system relies on directly injecting electricity into the tissues. However, this type of electrical approach is inadequate to find out which type of cells contributes to injury recovery because electricity affects all the neurons in certain areas without selection. To overcome such limitations, this CAREER project seeks to develop a new soft device technology to study the spinal cord system using light, electricity, drug, and virus gene carriers. The development of this neurotechnology requires knowledge from multiple disciplines. Therefore, this project opens various educational opportunities for students with a broad interest in STEM. The investigator aims to launch an interdisciplinary neuroengineering program across the engineering and neuroscience departments at UMass Amherst. This program will combine research and educational activities through the development of a curriculum inclusively designed for students with disabilities, an interactive online hub, and a series of student-centered neurotechnology-themed outreach activities for K-12 students.  <br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term career goal is to establish engineering platform methodologies to investigate the nervous system and ultimately develop therapeutics for nervous system dysfunction. Using the knowledge of materials engineering and neuroscience, the investigator hypothesizes that the development of a new multifunctional soft neural probe technology can advance a holistic understanding of neural pathophysiology in SCI. The research goals will be accomplished through four specific tasks: (1) Developing a new multifunctional soft neural probe technology with polymer engineering approaches. The optical and mechanical properties of hydrogel materials can be fine-tuned by tweaking their underlying nano- and micro-scale structures. Optimizing the material properties of the hydrogel component allows the probe to transmit light to the spinal cord target areas for optical neural modulation and recording, and to adapt to the spinal cord tissue movement in vivo. (2) Testing the multifunctionality and long-term viability of the soft neural probes in vivo. The soft neural probes are designed to allow optical stimulation and photometric recording, electrical recording, drug infusion, and virus delivery within miniaturized devices without constraining natural movement.(3) Investigating spinal locomotor circuits with soft neural probes using a series of locomotor behavioral tests to assess SCI functional recovery.

They offer many advantages over traditional mesh-based methods, particularly for problems with complex or moving geometries, large deformations of materials, or other singular behaviors of solutions. The goal of this project is to investigate an innovative approach for designing and analyzing meshfree and particle methods through the study of continuum nonlocal models and their robust discretizations. A central idea is to design ""asymptotically compatible schemes"" with respect to the nonlocal/integral relaxation scale of PDEs so as to advance the stability, accuracy and efficiency of meshfree and particle methods. The proposed research will advance the theoretical understanding of meshfree and particle methods and enhance their practical performance and functionality. Central to the project is an integrated plan of educational goals, and these include promoting the engagement and retention of female and underrepresented groups in math and science, enhancing applied and computational mathematics curricula, and disseminating new scientific discoveries. The PI proposes a variety of activities that aim at promoting computational thinking in middle/high school students and teachers, inspiring and preparing undergraduates for early research experience, and contributing to a more connected and inclusive intellectual environment. <br/><br/>The project primarily focuses on three objectives. The first is the development of monotone meshfree methods for elliptic equations via nonlocal relaxation. This includes the study of linear and nonlinear elliptic equations in Euclidean space and on manifolds. The central theme is to preserve the monotonicity in the discretization while keeping a compact selection of nearby points. The second subject is meshfree methods for systems of equations via the study of nonlocal vector calculus. The study of well-posed nonlocal models through nonlocal vector calculus is crucial for designing of stable numerical discretizations, without which instabilities are often observed (e.g., in the SPH method and peridynamics correspondence model). In the last subproject, we focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of Lagrange type particle methods for nonlinear time-dependent PDEs through nonlocal analysis. The discussion includes aggregation equation, degenerate diffusion, and convection-diffusion equation. The study of Wasserstein gradient flows will also be needed for rigorous convergence studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EMFs are nanometer-sized soccer ball-shaped carbon molecules that encapsulate metal ions within their cages.  Electronic, energy, quantum materials, catalysis, electronics, and biotechnologies are potential applications where EMFs show promise. However, realizing their full potential will require a better understanding of their behavior in aqueous solution. Typical approaches to making water-soluble EMF derivatives do not yield structurally defined molecules; they invariably disrupt the structure of the EMF cage and downgrade its electronic properties. This project will use a modular synthetic approach to create a family of water-soluble EMFs with precisely defined structures and study the correlation between their structural parameters and electro-optic properties. In the course of conducting this project, students will be trained in a multidisciplinary research environment. Active learning techniques with real world experiments that are integrated with the research results will be developed.  Outreach activities targeting a diverse population in local community colleges will be  carried out to introduce economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students future career paths in science.<br/><br/>This project will utilize a modular ?metallobuckytrio?

Thus, they are as fundamental as the physical laws of gravity in physics, shredding insight into models in their applications. Therefore, it is paramount to construct robust convergent estimators when the data size increases to reveal the intrinsic laws that are not sensitive to the data. <br/> <br/>This project will develop a unified computational approach for the nonparametric learning of kernels/functions in operators from high- or infinite dimensional data, and the products are scalable algorithms with performance guarantees in a unifying variational framework.

Furthermore, this theory builds the mathematical foundations for a general framework, making the algorithms and theory applicable to inverse problems far beyond those studied in this proposal.

A major question that remains unanswered is how self-perpetuating biological cycles are first initiated. This project has the advantage of being able to trigger one such cycle reproducibly, generating a rare opportunity to understand how a biological cycle is originally initiated. This project uses cutting-edge techniques to understand the mechanism of the first trigger responsible for initiating a feed-forward cycle that regulates DNA newly introduced into plant cells. By placing new DNA into cells, this project will experimentally dissect the mechanism of the earliest stages initiating regulation. The results of this project will inform academics and industry on how to improve plants while avoiding the initiation of troublesome cycles of unwanted regulation. This project will also directly train the next generation of scientists, providing them with thorough mentoring to prepare them for careers in biology, data analysis and technology. In addition, this project will perform outreach to a new audience at the Jackie Joyner Kersee Center in East St. Louis. This program will benefit groups that have traditionally not seen themselves as eligible for a career in science due to lack of representative models in science, and is perfectly suited for the after school programs run by the Jackie Joyner Kersee Center. <br/><br/>The establishment of chromatin modifications is an essential first step that leads to the long-term heritable epigenetic silencing of transposable elements and some transgenes. Once initiated, chromatin modifications such as cytosine DNA methylation, are replicated and, in plants, can be propagated at specific loci across generations for centuries. However, the mechanisms dictating how DNA methylation is first targeted to a locus is poorly understood. The preliminary data in support of this project involved building the tools to study the first round of new (de novo) chromatin modification, and these data demonstrate that the production of scaffolding, non-coding RNAs at a locus is the key, milestone event required for de novo DNA methylation. This kind of event can be best studied in plants due to the recruitment of a specific RNA Polymerase (Pol V) to generate these scaffold RNAs. The overarching goals of this project are to understand how scaffold RNA target regions are selected and how Pol V is first recruited during de novo DNA methylation. This work utilizes cutting-edge techniques to dissect, at the molecular level, an unknown mechanism responsible for establishing de novo DNA methylation and triggering the long-term biological cycle of heritable, epigenetic silencing of transposable elements and transgenes.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division and by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Integrative Organismal Systems Division.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental question, for example, is how many whole number solutions does a particular system of equations have? This is often a very difficult question and engages with techniques from a wide variety of different areas of mathematics. Galois theory, introduced in the 19th century, studies groups of symmetries of polynomial equations and is central to modern number theory. In the 1970s, Langlands introduced a far-reaching web of conjectures which connects Galois symmetries with other symmetric structures appearing in analysis (modular forms). Building bridges between the arithmetic world (Galois theory) and the complex analytic world following Langlands conjectural framework has been a formidable task and a driving force in modern number theory. This project aims to prove new instances of Langlands? conjectures. This project will open up and engage a number of new questions and concrete problems that will provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. The project will also provide mentoring and online training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, a major breakthrough in the Langlands program was the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem which was accomplished by proving a two-dimensional conjecture connecting arithmetic objects (elliptic curves) to analytic objects (modular forms). A key idea in the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem and in many other important results is the study of congruences modulo a prime p between modular forms. This proposal will systematically construct congruences in higher dimensions by connecting them to new geometric structures in Galois theory. This circle of ideas led to the resolution of Serre?s conjecture for modular forms in the early 2000s, another major achievement in the progression of the Langlands program. The weight part of Serre?s conjecture, which classifies congruences between modular forms, has been generalized in a number of directions as part of the growing field of the p-adic Langlands program. This project will resolve major gaps in progress on these generalizations including the lack of a conjecture for wildly ramified representations and the branching problem for potentially crystalline deformation rings in dimension greater than three. The project will also prove new modularity lifting theorems by studying the geometry of moduli spaces of Galois representations in intermediate weight.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists, businesses, governments and independent organizations want to learn from this data so they can understand basic biological mechanisms, invest capital, allocate aid and design coherent policy in a changing world. Evolutionary contagion (Evo-Con) models seek to identify and predict viral variants with heightened rates of spread by jointly modeling viral contagion and evolution. Analyzing spatial patterns of viral contagion is an area of immense scientific interest, but the task requires accounting for the nature of transportation networks that shape the global economy. As a result, big data applications become computationally intensive and benefit from high-performance computing. The project advances knowledge and utility of Evo-Con models in the context of massive amounts of complex, dynamic and geographically distributed data. In lockstep with these developments, the investigator will develop ""Statistical Learning Goes Viral"", a free-access MOOC (Massive Open Online Course).<br/><br/>The investigator will combine theory, methods and computing in a way that facilitates high-impact data analysis and easy measurement of success. The PI will (1) develop a class of nonlinear and multivariate phylogenetic Hawkes processes that use autoregressive neural networks to maintain both flexibility and scalability. Nonlinear phylogenetic Hawkes process development will capitalize on experience building heavily hierarchical models for joint data, but a pragmatic approach will depart from previous Bayesian implementations to enhance scalability and prediction; and (2) adapt these stochastic process models to complex transportation patterns in a way that responds to spatial data precision by combining nonlinear dimension reduction with convolutional neural networks (CNN). When travel networks explicitly present themselves, the PI will leverage experience building spatial models that account for network structures by incorporating nonlinearities through graph CNNs. More radical within phylogeography, the PI will eschew explicit network representations with the help of spherical CNNs that build implicit representations of global spatial dependencies to model viral contagion with increased flexibility. By hierarchically combining (1) and (2) within the same factor graph, the joint data neural model will fully integrate spatial, genomic, and temporal data. Finally, the investigator will (3) construct high-performance computing techniques that leverage conventional and quantum resources to fit complex, multimodal and high-dimensional model geometries. Computational developments will go well beyond track-record inventions of parallelized Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that use graphics processing units and quantum computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their state-of-the-art performance, however, remains poorly understood, brittle, and resource-intensive to obtain. In particular, their good generalization properties, or their ability to make accurate predictions on previously unseen data, are largely unexplained. Especially unusual is that, in contrast to classical machine learning models, state-of-the-art neural networks are frequently heavily overparameterized; that is, much ?larger? than their training data set. Recent research has revealed a better understanding of the possible benefits of such overparameterization, but only in elementary model families. The ramifications of overparameterization in deep neural networks, which exhibit complex and distinct behaviors, present many unknowns. In the absence of a first-principles theory, outstanding failure modes in deep neural networks remain unmitigated or unnecessarily costly to solve, and architecture selection is conducted in a wasteful trial-and-error manner that involves repeated train-and-test cycles. This limits deep learning technology from reaching its full potential, particularly in high-stakes and resource-limited applications.<br/><br/>This project will bridge the gap between the recent theory of overparameterized linear models and real-world neural networks through a diversity of mathematical techniques spanning signal processing, information theory, and online decision-making. In particular, the project will: 1) examine the implications of overparameterization on the test regression and classification performance of deep neural networks; 2) characterize the robustness of overparameterized models (both linear and nonlinear) to adversarial perturbations and significant shifts in the data distribution; and 3) design robust principles for data-driven model selection in modern machine learning. Ultimately, this project aims to establish foundational mathematical principles to explain not only the successful generalization of modern machine learning, but also its failure modes---in turn paving the way for developing efficient and principled solutions. This project will also create and disseminate educational resources at the high school and undergraduate levels on elementary signal processing, machine learning, and data science that underlie and complement the described research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biologging, i.e., the use of animal-attached sensors to collect data on animal behavior, physiology, and their surrounding environment, has become an important input for many climate change and ocean assessment models, providing environmental data on regions of the ocean that would be otherwise inaccessible. However, a major limitation of biologging is that it only provides data at locations where the animal actively swims or is passively carried. Biohybrid robotic control, or the ability to steer a living animal along a desired trajectory, would address current limitations in both biologging and traditional robotic sensing systems. Recent technology developed at Caltech has demonstrated the ability to robotically control the unidirectional swimming of a moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) in the laboratory and ocean. A small microcontroller with two electrodes inserted into the center of the jellyfish induces electrical stimulation that allows for these biohybrid robotic jellyfish to swim on command and at speeds 3 times their natural abilities. These biohybrid robot jellyfish have to the potential to expand vertical ocean profiling missions in particular, where existing technology is especially constrained. The deep ocean is vastly under-sampled due to limitations associated with immense pressure and depth and their associated technological expense. However, deep sea measurements are extremely important for understanding the interplay between the ocean and climate. Jellyfish are naturally suited to the harsh conditions of the deep, and biohybrid robot jellyfish swim at speeds an order of magnitude larger than background vertical currents due to upwelling and downwelling. Biohybrid robotic jellyfish platforms would address many of the limitations of current ocean profiling technologies, due to their: 1) low cost, 2) global animal availability and open-source technology, 3) energy-efficient, long-duration propulsion, 4) limited environmental disturbance (small size and minimal wake), and 5) potential for deployment in large swarms. The societal broader impacts for this work include the creation of a more economically accessible, vertical profiling ocean sensing platform. Once the performance envelope of this platform is characterized in this project, new biologging tags with additional sensors, antennas, and GPS can be incorporated. Because this technology will be open source, other researchers will be able to modify and further optimize this platform. On a local scale, this research will engage with the community through the direct mentorship of underrepresented students, as well as researcher participation in workshops focused on increasing the diversity of this research community.<br/><br/>The first-generation prototype of the biohybrid robotic jellyfish has demonstrated significant but unrealized potential to act as a future ocean sensing platform that can supplement and enhance existing ocean sensing technologies. However, further research and development is needed to optimize the protocol for equipping biohybrid jellies with environmental sensing tags for long-term, vertical ocean profiling under realistic field conditions. This project will characterize the capabilities of a modified version of biohybrid robotic jellyfish for the specific application of vertical ocean profiling. Research activities will include: 1) simplifying the swim controller interface for a more plug-and-play, globally scalable controller, 2) quantifying the scaling of maximum payload versus body size for biohybrid robot jellyfish, 3) integrating an off-the-shelf biologging tag (iTAG) with the swim controller interface, 4) assessing the achievable measurement duration and spatial range of biohybrid jellyfish for long-term deployments, and 5) demonstrating successful onboard control and data retrieval of equipped biohybrid robot jellyfish for vertical ocean profiling in coastal and open ocean environments in southern California.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, many evidence-based structured observation protocols have been developed to understand and measure components of teaching and classroom activities. This project intends to advance understanding of how university instructors use data from structured and unstructured protocols to inform their teaching. To this end, the project will provide 48 instructors with classroom observations focused on evidence-based teaching practices, including active learning; a comparable group of 12 instructors will receive the results of traditional unstructured observations. The instructors span two institutions, the University of California San Diego and University of California Riverside, and will represent various STEM disciplines. As a result, the project plans to investigate multiple contexts for the impact of examining classroom observation data on instructor motivation and change in teaching practices. The project hopes to generate new knowledge about how instructors interpret observation data, which could result in more efficient and effective faculty professional development and benefit student learning.  <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to 1) identify how college STEM instructors make sense of classroom observation data, 2) measure the extent to which interacting with their own classroom observation data affects instructor motivation to change their teaching practices, and 3) establish the extent to which instructors use observation data to change their teaching. Data from four structured observation protocols and one informal protocol will be collected and shared from each instructor?s course. The project will study the efficacy of this approach through data collected from surveys, interviews, and classroom observations to explore changes in teaching practices and conceptions of teaching. These data will allow the project team to identify best practices for sharing observation data with instructors.

Preference and metric learning using judgment from humans have emerged as powerful tools to learn such representations. Most of these learning algorithms, however, are limited to studying models that are averaged over the population and do not capture the variations among the diverse set of people comprising the population. This project aims to close this gap by developing novel models, analyzing their fundamental limits, and designing algorithms with guarantees that can be learned at different scales of granularity. The results of this project have the potential to usher in a new paradigm in preference and metric learning. This project will also have significant educational and outreach impact through course modules for graduate and undergraduate students, research mentoring for undergraduate students, and public outreach programs.<br/><br/>From biological sciences to social sciences, many scientific studies involve societal-scale datasets collected over heterogeneous populations, e.g., different ages, demographics, etc. Such datasets also usually have only a few observations per individual (small data regime). In general, off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms are not built with consideration to the statistical challenges arising from issues like heterogeneity and small data. This project addresses the challenges that arise when learning from heterogeneous populations in small data regimes in preference and metric learning by developing novel models, theoretical foundations in terms of fundamental limits, and practical algorithms with guarantees for learning from heterogeneous data at different levels of granularity. Specifically, the project aims to establish fundamental limits, develop models and algorithms with theoretical guarantees for (1) learning distribution of preferences over a population, (2) learning metrics at subgroup levels, and (3) learning individual variability by leveraging common structures and priors learned over the population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to use foliation theory to extract information about these symmetry groups and to apply recently developed techniques around the study of diffeomorphism groups to generate new results on the structure of foliations.

Despite this diversity of traits and interactions, forests within specific biomes or habitat types (i.e., tropical rainforests, temperate forests), show striking similarities in forest structure across the globe. It is likely that these similarities are due to the commonalities of the importance of access to light for individual trees and the ubiquity of competition among trees for that light. In this project, researchers leverage the Smithsonian?s Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO), from the tropics to the temperate zone, to develop models and test hypotheses regarding the drivers of forest structure within and across biomes. As models are refined, the researchers will incorporate different plant strategies and explore the implications for biome-specific outcomes. The results of this work will be incorporated into the earth system models used to predict carbon sequestration and thus the role of forests in slowing or accelerating climate change. The project also offers training opportunities for early career scientists to develop and implement new tools for integrating empirical data and theory. <br/>The structure and dynamics of tropical and temperate forest biomes differ, but the causes and consequences of these differences are not well characterized. Recently, the researchers found that a simple model of tree competition for light that includes stochastic stand-level disturbances nicely captures qualitative and quantitative features of the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The model, however, requires the addition of decreased performance of the largest trees to capture the structure of the temperate forest of Wind River, WA. This research will scale up, using an extensive global ForestGEO dataset, to test the generality of the differences between tropical and temperate forests. Moreover, this project will identify the likely causal differences in forest dynamics between these two biomes. With the refined model, the researchers aim to contribute new insights into how dynamic interactions among trees within forests will better predict stand structure over time, and how these models can improve earth system models.  Further, the researchers will then draw new hypotheses about the commonalities and differences of selective pressures on key plant strategies and the potential for these differences in forest dynamics to result in differing opportunities for generating and/or maintaining species coexistence. As the integration of theory with data is critical to this research, the education plan of this CAREER project focuses on the integration of theory training into standard undergraduate and graduate coursework. Further, the inclusive teaching methodologies will be used to foster further integration of theory and empirical work within the early career community of ForestGEO researchers through a training and collaboration program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups are fundamental objects in mathematics that also emerge in various applications such as in computer science and physics. The algebraic notion of a group associates to a set a binary operation, like multiplication, which satisfies a list of axioms. Groups emerge naturally as symmetries of various types of concrete or abstract spaces in mathematics. There is an intricate relationship between the geometric properties of these spaces and the algebraic properties of their groups of symmetries. The PI will continue his investigation of the landscape of infinite groups that emerge as symmetries of the most natural spaces in mathematics, the circle and the real line. The PI will organize two research workshops aimed at graduate students, and two research experiences programs for undergraduates. These shall be aimed at training a diverse body of students to become future leaders in mathematics. These activities will incorporate computational methods into the students' mathematical exploration of the landscape of infinite groups.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Topology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The PI will investigate the relationship between the algebraic structure of left orderable groups and the topological and dynamical properties of their actions on 1-manifolds and the cantor space. One goal is to investigate the class of finitely presented, infinite, simple groups, and exhibit new conceptual phenomena. This involves investigating notions such as uniform simplicity, and whether there is a finitely presented infinite simple group that acts on the real line by homeomorphisms. Finally, the PI will investigate a family of closely interconnected open problems emerging in combinatorial group theory. This includes a systematic study of normal generation in the class of finitely generated perfect groups, the conjectured existence of non-abelian free subgroups in non-indicable finitely generated left orderable groups, and fundamental groups of subcomplexes of aspherical 2-dimensional CW complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop solid catalysts that have an active site ? the location of chemical reactions on a catalyst ? that is structurally understood. Solid catalysts are used ubiquitously in the chemical industry but understanding how they function is significantly challenging. Only with knowledge of the active site structure on a molecular level can one develop hypotheses on how to improve reactions.  In this project, active sites made of palladium will be installed on the surface of silica (the primary component of sand and glass) to synthesize solid catalysts, and their activities and mechanisms of action will be investigated. This research program sits at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry and homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and has the potential to contribute to a more sustainable future. Students working on this project will benefit intellectually and practically because of the interdisciplinary nature of the research. Mentorship, immersion of high-school students in chemistry labs, and increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion through outreach are also parts of the project. <br/><br/>Heterogeneous catalysis is vital in the chemical industry, where it is used in >90% of chemical processes. These catalysts are integral to sustainable practices, since they are robust and recyclable. Improvement of heterogeneous catalysts is often empirical and is hindered by a lack of structural understanding of the active site, precluding informative mechanistic studies. This project utilizes surface organometallic chemistry to control the structure and reactivity of metal sites on surfaces, specifically palladium sites supported on silica. There are three Aims: 1) Surface-supported (silyl)Pd(H) species will be formed and their reactivity as catalysts for alkene isomerization will be tested; 2) Oxidative addition of silyl halides to palladium complexes will be investigated; 3) Cationic, surface-supported palladium sites will be synthesized, and their catalytic activity in the Diels-Alder reaction will be demonstrated.  In addition to the research goals, there are several complementary educational goals: 1) educate through effective mentorship, 2) increase representation in STEM, and 3) increase awareness of contributions of chemists from underrepresented and marginalized groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While this assumption greatly simplifies the models, it is not always true. Under a standard linear control perspective, some systems with state-dependent observation noise, (which often manifests as multiplicative noise), would be considered uncontrollable. This CAREER project focuses on discovering new non-linear control strategies for such systems and providing provable guarantees for their performance. This research has the potential to reduce conservativism of designs by interactively extracting more useful information from multiplicatively-corrupted measurements. The ability to analyze and give guarantees for refined models can better characterize the risk for safety-critical systems where state-dependent noise terms cannot be ignored. The education plan for this CAREER project includes three structured interventions to improve inclusion in higher education. These include: (1) Recruit new students through the PI?s novel lower-division engineering course that showcases real-world applications of linear-algebra through hands-on hardware labs. This CAREER project will build pathways to disseminate this new curriculum to two-year community colleges. (2) Develop explicit support structures for students and build community through an automated, scalable and feedback-based process for student study groups. (3) Integrate accessible and structured research-at-scale experiences into regular coursework, which can reduce the barrier-to-entry and broaden research access for all undergraduate students.<br/><br/>State-dependent noise in systems can emerge through model linearization, parameter uncertainty or drift, and timing jitter. A key technical challenge posed by zero-mean multiplicative observation noise is that it can destroy sign information, and thus linear strategies can be unboundedly suboptimal. However, non-linear strategies that leverage the dual nature of control can do better. This CAREER project investigates such strategies through three steps. (1) Since the PI?s prior work suggests that control strategies with both exploration and exploitation elements can perform well, this project will first compute the probability distributions induced on the state by specific periodic non-linear control strategies. The shapes of these distributions will guide the search for new control strategies using computational approaches (e.g. maximum likelihood, policy gradient). (2) Regret-based formulations will be used to provide guarantees where optimality of strategies may be difficult to establish. Information-theoretic bit-level models will be used to extend to the case of slow-varying multiplicative noise and non-zero mean. (3) Finally, the project will explore approaches to augment local models with multiplicative noise in guided policy search for reinforcement learning frameworks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As society relies more heavily on statistical modeling to make decisions, it becomes imperative for statistical methods to be able to model heterogenous data so that different decisions that will lead to better outcomes for different subgroups can be made.  This is appealing in the big data era as data-rich settings allow statistical models to be trained to be more flexible and robust to heterogeneous data. This project focuses on developing a new class of statistical methods for modeling large-scale heterogenous data based on the super-quantile (tail average), also referred to as the expected shortfall or conditional value-at-risk. The methods under development will have the potential to answer questions that cannot be directly answered previously using existing tools in different fields such as climate science, neuroscience, finance, and health disparity research.  The project will allow undergraduate and graduate students to work on cutting-edge methods for modeling data heterogeneity.  In addition, a graduate-level course on data heterogeneity will be developed.  The investigator will also engage in K-12 educational outreach in collaboration with the Center for Educational Outreach at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/><br/>With the abundance of data, there has been growing interest in modeling large-scale heterogeneous data for decision-making.  Quantile regression is one representative statistical tool for modeling heterogeneous data, but one limitation is that it focuses on a specific quantile level and may not be the best approach for answering scientific questions that involve aggregate information of the lower/upper tail of the distribution of interest.  The investigator studies the development of a new class of super-quantile-based tools to help practitioners answer such questions.  There are three aims in this project: (i) establish theoretical foundations and develop scalable computational algorithms for fitting super-quantile regression in the big-data regime, high-dimensional regime, and data with outliers; (ii) develop super-quantile regression methods in the presence of unmeasured confounders; (iii) develop a series of super-quantile-based methods for analyzing different data types. The investigator will create a comprehensive platform, including software and e-book tutorials, to encourage using super-quantile-based methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does the brain work remain one of the most challenging scientific problems for humanity. For decades, scientists and engineers continually develop and refine new methods and techniques to advance our understanding of the brain. Out of these tools, imaging is essential for deciphering the brain because it allows us to directly visualize and investigate the complex brain tissues and their organizations and functional networks. However, even with the multitude of brain imaging technologies that are currently available, our ability to probe deep brain tissues beyond the cerebral cortex is still limited. This limitation can largely be attributed to the physics of imaging, which dictate the inevitable trade-off between how small of an object we can see and from how deep we can see them. This shortcoming ultimately limits our ability to explore beyond the superficial tissues of the brain and to understand how the human brain works in its entirety. The long-term objective of this CAREER proposal, therefore, is to overcome this shortcoming by developing a new ultrasound imaging technology that can probe deep brain functional neural activities at a microscopic spatial resolution. Our technique leverages the power of deep learning and ultrafast ultrasound imaging to break the barrier of imaging speed for conventional super-resolution ultrasound. If successful, this transformative new technology will become a paradigm-shifting imaging tool that provides functional brain mapping at a much finer spatial resolution with a much deeper and wider territory than ever before. The unique capabilities of this new imaging technology will also open new doors for many under-explored opportunities in both basic neuroscience research and in many neurological disease applications. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop a new and transformative functional brain imaging technology that allows continuous, real-time monitoring of neural activities of the entire brain at a micron-scale through intact skull. Thrust 1 will focus on improving the temporal resolution of conventional super-resolution ultrasound imaging by developing deep learning-based super-resolution imaging techniques. Thrust 2 will address the computational challenges associated with ultrasound image reconstruction by developing a new ultrafast ultrasound system based on modern high-speed FPGAs. Thrust 3 will concentrate on developing phase aberration correction methods based on deep learning and novel 3D ultrafast imaging techniques to achieve robust intact skull imaging of the whole brain. In vivo mouse brain imaging studies will be conducted throughout the technical thrusts to evaluate and validate the performance of the newly developed super-resolution imaging techniques. If successful, the proposed work will result in a new, radiation-free, low-cost, and widely accessible functional brain imaging technique that will be the first to enable noninvasive probing of in vivo, deep-brain neural activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. In addition to the technical thrusts, this CAREER proposal also includes educational and outreach programs aimed to instill in the new generation of students the desire to improve the standard of healthcare such that all patients have access to state-of-the-art treatment, diagnostic, and screening options. By providing research opportunities, creating ultrasound engineering labs, developing innovative teaching strategies, and establishing new courses, this CAREER proposal will provide these students with the knowledge and tools necessary to create actionable changes within the opportunities presented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prominent examples include secure multi-party computation and distributed ledger technology. A central goal in distributed cryptography is to avoid any centralized trusted party or single point of failure. Many protocols and systems today, however, still need to keep some degree of central trust, often in the form of an initial trusted dealer or trusted setup phase. These central trust assumptions go against the philosophy of distributed cryptography. The reason why they are still common is efficiency and convenience. More often than not, solutions without central trust are harder to construct and more costly than ones using central trust. This project seeks to invent and promote distributed cryptographic protocols without central trust by placing them on equal footing with their trusted counterparts in terms of simplicity and efficiency. <br/><br/>The project will study a series of fundamental problems including reliable broadcast, Byzantine fault tolerant consensus (the underlying technology of distributed ledgers), verifiable information dispersal, verifiable secret sharing, and distributed randomness beacons. For each of these problems, the goal is to design new solutions that do not rely on any central trust and can match the efficiency of their trusted counterparts, both in terms of asymptotic complexity and practical performance. The project will also design practical distributed key generation and setup generation protocols to help remove central trust from existing distributed cryptographic protocols. A crucial insight that inspired this project is that underlying all these important problems is a simple yet overlooked problem known as data dissemination. The project will systematically investigate data dissemination and apply it to many areas of distributed cryptography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To improve the design of key management, this project investigates how key management is used in the real world. Data from these studies help identify which designs best promote utility, usability, and security, which designs fail to do so, and what new designs are needed. This project can improve our understanding of how to design key management systems that can be integrated with security-related technologies to increase their chance of being adopted.

Data are gathered from users who have successfully adopted key management systems, such as developers using end-to-end email encryption and novice users adopting a key management system for the first time. The studies examine general usage, how usage changes over time, how users manage multiple cryptographic keys, how they synchronize keys between devices, and how they recover access to lost keys.

Recent studies demonstrate that coral reefs shifting from complex coral-dominated communities to macroalgae dominance are unstable and may enhance sponge-dominated reefs, a state becoming common in the Caribbean Sea. How do sponge-dominated reefs function and change the ecosystem structure? And how do they continue to respond to thermal stress? This project aims to answer these questions by evaluating the persistence of sponge-dominated reefs under thermal anomalies and their potential to sustain coral reef biodiversity or aid local extinction. Ecological principles of sponge-dominated reefs are integrated into education curricula to foster the growth of future scientists and/or citizen scientists at local, regional, and global levels. A high school curriculum on coral reef ecology principles in English and Spanish is developed for teachers to download and use in their classrooms. The outreach component includes open seminars for students and faculty to discuss the competitive myth, aiming to improve the student perception of high-level jobs in academia, research, and policy. <br/><br/>Species interactions alter how each species adapts to change and constitute one of the essential forces structuring ecological communities. However, most theories and experiments on coral reef dynamics do not provide enough information to predict coral reef benthos interactions, succession and evolution. The project evaluates and predicts how current and future Caribbean and Florida coral reefs (sponge-dominated) are changing with a central focus on benthic interactions such as: competition for space by evaluating current and future trends of coral reef benthic interactions under the effect of thermal anomalies; symbiosis, by disentangling how benthic species interactions and associated symbionts function in sponge-dominated reefs; facilitation by discerning to what extent sponge communities serve as habitat-forming animals and how can they sustain coral reef biodiversity; and education by using these ecological interactions as principles to develop teaching, mentoring, and outreach activities from high-school to post-doctoral levels. The project evaluates patterns through 15 years of severe and multi-year thermal anomalies in two locations and three years across the Caribbean Sea and Florida, from tropical latitudes in the southern Caribbean Sea (Panama and Barbados) to subtropical latitudes in the Florida Coral Reef Tract. Mathematical models are developed to predict future changes at a regional level. A new technological approach, The BeamSea True-Color Lidar and Fluorescence (TCLF) imager, is implemented in this project to discriminate among similarly colored species and automate the collection of species and species interactions data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such experiences are unevenly distributed and may not be available at institutions with fewer resources. Additionally, many students find accessing these opportunities difficult due to time and financial challenges. To address this challenge this project aims to assess the impacts of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) using digitized Natural History Collections (dNHC) data. These CUREs can be taught at all institution types, in online, in-person, and hybrid formats; and they have the potential to increase access to research experiences for all students. Faculty from four institutions (George Washington University, Widener University, Texas Tech University, and Westfield State University) will collaborate to measure the impacts of these CUREs on student learning and student science identity. Students who successfully complete the CUREs may apply to participate in a mentored and financially supported cohort-based scientific conference experience. How the conference experiences may further impact student learning gains will also be assessed. This study will produce a rich dataset from multiple institutions including minority serving institutions and community colleges. This will document the impacts of dNHC CUREs and connected conference experiences. This will help to encourage broader use of dNHC CUREs and supported conference experiences and help lead to a diverse and skilled STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Gaining broad institutional support for dNHC CURE implementation and student conference presentations requires clear evidence of student gains and the transformational impacts of these experiences on student science identity which contributes to persistence in STEM. This project will formally determine the impacts of dNHC CUREs and conference experiences on student learning in data science and geospatial skills, and student perceptions of science identity and self-efficacy across institution types and student populations. This will lead to better understanding of the differential effects of these experiences across demographic student populations and diverse institutional types. To refine best practices for mentoring undergraduates through national conference experiences, training materials for faculty and students will be created, and the impacts of undergraduate conference experiences where students present their CURE research will be assessed. This project will create a large multi-institutional dataset that will enable this project to make significant contributions to the broader undergraduate STEM education enterprise's understanding of the importance of CUREs and conference experiences while also encouraging and supporting efforts to make CUREs more widespread by providing strong evidence of their efficacy and impacts. Increased use of dNHC CUREs and including conference presentations and participation will improve undergraduate education and increase the accessibility of research for all students regardless of financial hardships, personal obligations, or physical abilities that may otherwise limit their participation. This project provides training for diverse early career scientists in skills critical to a highly skilled STEM workforce and opportunities for students to attend conferences to improve their sense of belonging in science.

Instead, van der Waals semiconductors (vdW-S) with atomic thickness become the leading candidates to further boost the trajectory of Moore?s law. After the successful synthesis of wafer-scale raw materials, the next milestone on this roadmap is the implementation of vdW-S integrated circuits with smaller sizes, higher density, faster speed, and lower energy consumption. However, established methods for bulk material integration, such as silicon, lead to performance degradation, high heat generation, and many other issues in vdW-S. Therefore, new fundamental principles and practical methods are in urgent need, and this project is designed to fill this gap. Considering the ultra-thinness of these emerging materials, their electronic properties are typically decided by the surface and interfacial conditions. With this entry point, the project makes efforts to explore surface/interface tailoring methods and study the corresponding electronic effects for the purpose of vdW-S integration in both planar and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. As a case study, a novel 3D active pixel image sensor (3D-APS) built upon the as-developed principles can provide better color-sensing accuracy, miniature device size, and higher sensitivity than conventional counterparts. As such, it showcases the transformative impacts of this project on a broader scope of applications, such as medical imaging, machine vision, and environmental survey. Along with the research, this project emphasizes the educational responsibility of Georgia State University (GSU) as a minority-serving institute. Graduate and undergraduate students receive systematic training in modern material science, electrical engineering, semiconductor process and characterization technologies, instrumentation design and manufacturing, and many more skills. In this process, they build their capabilities and career trajectories as next-generation workforces. The team shares the research experience and achievements via seminars, conferences, and publications, to bring nationwide impacts of this project. Regular open houses, K-12 school visits, and popular science activities are arranged to broadcast the latest research progress to our community, raising public awareness of modern science and technology. <br/><br/>The very large-scale integration (VLSI) of vdW-S devices is the next essential topic for their practical applications in computing, communication, medication, and other fields. But the long-standing challenges in selected area doping, contact resistance management, material stability, and characterization methods block the pathway toward these goals. In this regard, this project is arranged to systematically and profoundly investigate the solutions to these problems, and substantially promote the planar and 3D integration of these emerging semiconductor materials. The primary research activities include the following aspects. (i) The project insightfully comprehends the charge doping effects and stability of a surface modification reaction introduced by the PI, in order to facilitate a gentle, precisely controllable, and non-destructive selected area doping approach for planar vdW-S integration. (ii) Conventional metal-to-vdW-S inter-tier contacts are replaced by newly developed direct vdW-S-to-vdW-S (v-v) contacts with conditioned interfaces, which provide a scalable and low-resistance solution for inter-tier connections in 3D integrations. (iii) The research activities leverage the home-built in-situ and non-invasive electrical and optical characterization systems to examine the devices? stability and performance with convinced accuracy and precision. Beyond that, the 3D-APS delivered by this project can exhibit rich system-level physical and electronic behaviors that otherwise are intangible from single device-level studies, and in turn, deepen the understanding of the synergistic cooperation mechanism in complex vdW-S frameworks. The prototype devices also inspire succeeding innovations of high-performance microelectronics, as core functional units in future VLSI with smaller sizes, higher integration density, faster speed, and lower energy consumption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

BeeHive will provide a shared framework and modular components that implement common elements of network biology analyses including installation of algorithms, data pre-processing, cross-validation methods, and network visualization. The BeeHive infrastructure will enable running many network algorithms at scale from a single interface. This strategy will support rigorous benchmarking of network algorithms and greatly simplify testing multiple algorithms on a new biological dataset. The project will apply BeeHive to three representative applications, namely gene regulatory network inference, pathway reconstruction, and small molecule-protein target prediction applications. These problems are important in the genomics and bioinformatics research communities due to recent computational and biotechnological advances, such as graph neural networks and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Key components of BeeHive will include a modular and general purpose Python package that can be reused, a template Snakemake workflow to execute the shared steps of network biology analysis from data pre-processing through network visualization, a framework for continuous benchmarking that uses concepts from continuous integration in software engineering, Docker containers for tens of existing network biology algorithms, and datasets spanning yeast, mouse, human, and plants. Core objectives of BeeHive include advancing computational infrastructure for network biology analysis and benchmarking as well as creating an active and growing scientific community to create rigorous and standardized benchmarking frameworks and contribute methods and datasets to BeeHive. In the long term, the project will broadly generalize to other aspects of network biology and can catalyze analogous efforts in other domains in systems and computational biology.

On the other hand, AI is predicted to create new job opportunities, primarily in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). This project explores how more adults without college degrees can obtain these higher-paying STEM jobs created by AI and new technologies. Because employment is the primary way people gain social and economic mobility in the U.S.A., the goal is to develop new, holistic understanding about the factors that will help adults without college degrees to overcome labor market barriers to access, participate in, and complete STEM education and training for higher-paying jobs created by new technologies. The results will help develop grounded solutions for institutions, organizations, and policy makers to ensure the future of work will have more equitable societal outcomes, particularly for groups who have largely been left behind as jobs have transformed in the past few decades.<br/> <br/>The project pursues this objective in three ways. First, the project uses ethnographic methods to develop in-depth, grounded hypotheses about the organizational, social, and behavioral factors that adults without a college degree face when trying to obtain new STEM skills and jobs. Second, the project uses the insights from the first part to employ field experiments testing which grounded hypotheses lead to better organizational, individual, and employment outcomes.

It is one of the most basic tasks in unsupervised machine learning, and clustering algorithms are run numerous times each day across every field dealing with data. This research aims to develop efficient clustering algorithms with improved performance guarantees and study the limitations of efficient algorithms. These goals will be achieved by creating algorithmic techniques that advance the state-of-the-art and building new connections between various fields of computer science and mathematics, including optimization, complexity theory, geometry, combinatorics, and analysis. The outcome of this project will be integrated into various courses in data science and approximation algorithms at both undergraduate and graduate levels. The education plan also includes training graduate students and broadening the participation of undergraduate students in theoretical computer science. <br/><br/>The project is centered around two main directions, one for algorithms and one for hardness. The first algorithmic direction is to revisit the study of local search, a discrete analog of gradient descent. While the standard local search has been well studied, new types of local search algorithms incorporating convex optimization methods or Euclidean geometry were recently proposed. Understanding the power of these local search algorithms seems to require a new global analysis. Secondly, the investigator will study a recently introduced complexity hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis which, if true, will result in significantly better hardness results for clustering in Euclidean spaces. It already reveals exciting connections to other areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science that are worth further investigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to build an artificial perception system that goes beyond 2D visual understanding and focuses on parsing the time dynamics and 3D structure of human-object interaction. Thus, to allow real-world applications, the system for understanding 4D (3D + time) human-object interaction is designed to generalize to unconstrained environments of daily life. The developed technologies will enable household robots to predict, and assist humans and doctors to analyze the behaviors of the elderly for providing better care, etc. The education and outreach activities of the project will advance the theoretical courses in computer vision and robotics, and offer practical guidance for undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students to study in this field.<br/><br/>This research develops a 4D human-object interaction understanding system, with a focus on generalization to environments in the wild. Existing approaches are limited to operating within constrained labs or uncluttered scenes. This is mainly due to current computer vision methods heavily relying on detailed 3D/4D annotations, which are usually unavailable for unconstrained environments. To address this limitation, the project provides a framework that will (i) recognize objects from videos in an open-world setting using only text-supervision and self-supervision; (ii) reconstruct and estimate the human and object structures in 3D using minimum 3D supervision and manually defined priors; and (iii) perform 4D interaction and contact relation reasoning between humans and objects using a 4D Interaction Graph.

This project plans to investigate new methods for designing introductory physics courses to develop productive student beliefs about their own learning.  The target beliefs are correlated with students' learning, academic achievement, and well-being. This project hopes to advance the science of instructional design through the goal of producing clear design principles for developing these target beliefs.  Design efforts will focus on how course curriculum and policies can tacitly communicate and reinforce productive beliefs and promote student engagement. Because introductory physics is an early core course in many undergraduate STEM majors, the improvements developed through this project can improve early undergraduate persistence in STEM and seed future success of STEM students.	<br/><br/>This project will iteratively design the course structures of a large-enrollment introductory physics course to promote positive development of three key aspects of students' beliefs about their own learning: physics epistemology, growth mindset, and sense of belonging. Though approaches for positively impacting these educationally relevant beliefs have been developed in other projects, prior approaches often consider one kind of belief in isolation, providing little insight into how these beliefs and their development may be related. To investigate and improve students' beliefs about their own learning, this project uses a design-based research approach.  The project will iteratively develop instructional design principles centered on how these three beliefs can be coherently integrated with course activities and instructor messaging through three classroom practices: (i) valuing learning over time, (ii) talking about and resolving wrong ideas, and (iii) eliciting, sharing, and engaging with others' ideas.  Design iterations will be informed by a mixed methods approach using student reflections, classroom observations, interviews, and survey data.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

For example, a nurse feeding a patient might carefully consider individual morsels of food on a plate while picking them up, but afterwards devote his/her attention to the patient's mouth and facial expressions. By comparison, today's robots are rigid and inflexible in the ways that they observe, process, and interact with the world. They either focus on everything at the cost of becoming sluggish or instead cut corners indiscriminately and become prone to failures. This project will build innovative software technologies to allow general-purpose robots to flexibly adapt to task requirements, much like humans can, improving their agility and efficiency and making it easier for them to learn new tasks. This will enable applications of such robots not only in the household and hospital tasks which this project will use to develop the research, but also in many other socially relevant settings as farms, constructions sites, and small-scale manufacturing. Two graduate students and several undergraduate students will receive research training directly through this project. Further, this project will also draw from its research findings to improve graduate and undergraduate courses and summer outreach courses for high-school students.<br/><br/>This project explores the hypothesis that one key missing piece is agile and efficient perception-action loops that can evolve on-the-fly in response to task requirements. Consider a robot feeding a child food from a rice bowl. The locations and shapes of individual morsels of food, and the child's detailed pose and mouth configuration are all relevant over the course of the task and in each of the eating phases. Such time-varying task requirements are ubiquitous, yet they are poorly accounted for by the locked-in abstractions in today's standard computer vision algorithms and control loops. This project aims to advance visual recognition approaches in the context of embodied action, and to develop robot learning approaches in tandem that exploit these advances. It redesigns control loops to be flexible according to task demands, hierarchically factorized to permit novel compositions of the factor components, and self-learnable for scalability. To this end, it develops a staged but end-to-end differentiable control loop structure with interleaved task-specific, fine-tunable components and task-generic, reusable component stages. It further proposes novel active self-learning approaches that exploit the agent's own embodiment to teach it. These advances will enable improved sample efficiency for robot learning approaches as well as computational efficiency for task execution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they can suffer from catastrophic gaps in service when the program being edited is incomplete, i.e., when there are missing pieces or errors. The programmer is left to simulate program behavior on their own in these situations -- a difficult and error-prone task even for professional programmers, and a major barrier to entry for novices. This project's novelties are that it develops a new generation of programming environments that achieve maximal liveness, i.e., that never suffer from these gaps in service. Maximal liveness is achieved by developing a novel direct manipulation code editing interface, tile-based editing, that automatically inserts program holes to maintain a sensible syntactic and semantic structure, even when the program is incomplete. The project's impacts are expected to be measurable decreases in the cognitive demand of educational, professional, and creative coding tasks, which will contribute to lowering the barriers to entry into computing.<br/><br/>The key mechanism, tile-based editing, fundamentally restructures code editing to allow for direct manipulation of the linearized projection of a program tree, while maintaining maximal liveness by automatically managing holes and delimiter matching obligations to continuously maintain a syntax tree internally. From there, this project scales up the language-theoretic foundations developed in recent work by the investigator, integrating liveness with modern language features like pattern matching (in languages like Haskell and Elm) and borrowing (in languages like Rust). These target languages feature in the investigator's programming languages courses and in educational resources targeting diverse creative communities, where the research is evaluated. In support of these educational efforts, the project develops novel live tutoring and authoring services that leverage the maximal liveness invariant to provide several novel forms of live, contextualized feedback, assistance, and direct manipulation editing affordances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, neuroscientists often describe neural activity as representing and inferring. It is their way of describing the overall function of that activity, an abstraction away from detailed neural recordings. But, because there are no settled definitions, there are no objective grounds for these descriptions. As a result, they are treated as casual glosses rather than as rigorous analyses.

Instead of chasing after a completely new materials, the research team targets a novel twist, making currently existing materials to become flatter, thinner, and lighter. Back in 2017, the principal investigator invented remote epitaxy, which allows growing nanoscale materials on graphene-coated templates to be exfoliated afterwards. These thin freestanding materials can become building blocks for lightweight, flexible devices having unprecedented performance. Until now, studies on remote epitaxy have been mostly limited to empirical observations on materials such as gallium nitride and gallium arsenide typically used in semiconductors. To utilize remote epitaxy as an ideal platform for growth and hetero-integration between various materials systems, the research team aims to study the mechanism of remote epitaxy at a fundamental level. By exploring the mechanism on various two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) materials, the research team expects to create a wider range of materials systems available for remote epitaxy. Also, being able to combine different materials systems together can benefit the physical sciences by discovering new functionalities, bringing advancements in engineering sciences and industry by improving current device fabrication techniques and their performances. <br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>The research team plans to focus on answering three major questions to understand remote epitaxy further: (1) the nature of the adatoms interaction with the underlying 2D/3D substrates, (2) the impacts of 2D materials and interfaces on remote epitaxy, and (3) the dynamic processes involved in adatom/nuclei migration and defect formation on 2D surfaces. To answer these questions, the research team will first reveal whether the remote epitaxy truly occurs in a ?remote? sense, which is the most fundamental conundrum that precedes any other questions. This has been difficult to answer because one can easily observe only the results of epitaxy, not the nucleation of adatoms. This issue is tackled by intentionally patterning the 2D layer and employing various materials with different growth properties as the epilayers. Second, impact of 2D layers is explored by studying how the type, crystallinity, and thickness of 2D interlayers alter the remote interaction of adatoms and substrates. In order to show the intrinsic role of 2D layers, direct growth of 2D layers is attempted on various substrates having different ionicity. Third, thermodynamics and kinetics of adatoms, their mergence to form nuclei, and nucleus-nucleus interaction on 2D layers are studied by understanding the nucleation mechanism, performing defect analysis, and exfoliating epilayers. Based on these results, the research team plans to demonstrate high-quality ultrathin films grown by remote epitaxy on directly-grown 2D layers with engineered nucleation conditions. As remote epitaxy allows mixed dimensional heterostructures, further study is done on 3D/various 2D/3D sandwiched structures to investigate new physical couplings between electronic states and magnetic properties. To the scientific community, these results are expected to utilize remote epitaxy for studying multifunctional and coupled material platforms that were not achievable by conventional methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most prominent examples is superconductivity, where many electron pairs coherently move through the material without any resistance hence generating no heat loss. There are two ways for this to occur: two electrons first tightly bind into a molecule, then develop coherence with other molecules; or many electrons develop pairing and binding all at once. These two regimes are two limiting cases of how macroscopic coherent states can form, which are widely seen and used in cornerstone modern technologies such as lasers, superconducting qubits, and supermagnets. This project aims to realize tunable materials straddled between these two limits, exploring novel states of matter and their electronic structure during this crossover. Students from local middle and high-schools will be engaged in this project through interactive lectures and demonstrations of superconductivity and lasing. Local college undergraduate and graduate students will co-develop the curriculum and co-lead the sessions with the research team for broader participation.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mechanism and Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) are two limiting scenarios of one continuous route to realize macroscopic quantum coherent state of interacting fermions, where all particles in a system simultaneously occupy the same many-body ground state. Incarnated in solid state systems, these limiting scenarios can drive metal-to-superconductor and metal-to-insulator phase transitions. Despite immense theoretical interest, experimental realization of this crossover in solid state systems is scarce and controversial. In this research, the team aims to realize, understand, and tune BCS-BEC crossover in novel bulk and thin film solid state model systems, with a special emphasis on thermodynamic and spectroscopic investigations as the systems are tuned in situ through the crossover. This project not only sheds light on the crucial role of the wave function ""phase"" in macroscopic quantum states, but also develops new material platforms and novel thermodynamic techniques to investigate the phenomenon in both three and quasi-two dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of this interdisciplinary research are anticipated to lead to important advances in polymer design, synthesis and deployment in biological systems. As part of the broader impacts of the funded project, the PI and other members of the Kim research group will engage in educational outreach activities to help broaden participation in science fields by individuals from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. A highlight of these efforts will be an interactive workshop for local area high school students that will demonstrate important concepts such as bioorthogonal chemistry (an exciting frontier in science that was recently recognized by the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry) and reversible gelation in materials science.<br/><br/>The funded project will explore the use of associative and dissociative bioorthogonal click reactions based on enamine N-oxide motifs with allylic functionalization, to assemble and degrade hydrogels in biologically relevant contexts in a precise stimulus-induced manner. Hydrolytic or enzymatic degradation pathways are commonly used to dissociate polymers or hydrogels from their biological substrates in applications of synthetic biomaterials; however, the reliance on such spontaneous environmentally-driven mechanisms for degradation means that the physical properties of the biomaterial steadily deteriorate over time. This work instead focuses on the synthesis of permanent covalently linked polymer networks whose structural integrity remains intact and uncompromised until such time that removal of the biomaterial is desired: degradation is then triggered by a bioorthogonal chemical reaction. The research explores synthetic methods for accessing enamine N-oxide polymer crosslinkers of varying properties (typically formed by pericyclic group transfer between hydroxylamines and alkynes), strategies for the assembly of step- and chain-growth polymers containing these moieties, and the development of bioorthogonal chemical reactions to reductively cleave the covalent crosslinks. Methods to induce functional changes to the biomaterials of interest through the attachment and removal of various ancillary groups will also be investigated. Efficient chemical reactions that make and break molecular connections in complex biological environments are powerful.  As such, the fundamental findings of this work have the potential to impact both academic and industrial science in areas ranging from chemical biology to bioengineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In terms of outreach, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in advanced plant genomics and molecular biology in the context of this project. Additionally, it will provide opportunities for exposing underrepresented groups to STEM-related work through dissemination of the concepts, methods and societal implications of this work through publications, presentations and / or outreach videos geared towards the general public and, specifically, younger audiences.<br/><br/>The strategy entails targeting CRISPR to hand-picked sets of chromosomal sequences, so that ?immune? chromosomes survive, while targeted chromosomes are eliminated. This results in individuals with specific, desirable chromosome sets, such as those from a given parent. The objectives are to demonstrate and optimize accession-specific chromosome elimination and to engineer elimination of a parental chromosome set in tomato, effectively resulting in haploid induction. Using both the model arabidopsis and the crop tomato, the work involves development of methods for identification of accession- and chromosome-specific CRISPR targets, for rapid validation of these targets, and for engineering of genotype- and karyotype-specific drives. Genome-scale alterations of crop genomes through Targeted Elimination of Chromosomes (TEC), could potentially enable broad application of haploid induction, manipulation of allopolyploid genome, and selection of specific genome-wide haplotypic configurations in hybrid progeny.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alternatively, some species can reproduce either with or without male involvement facultatively. This combinatory reproductive mode presents a compelling opportunity for researchers to understand why reproduction that produces males is so widespread. The project will quantify the relationships between density, reproductive behavior, and reproductive mode among populations of a species with just such facultative reproduction in the group Opiliones (harvestman or ?daddy-longlegs?). In particular, the work will assess when reproductive mode changes occur, and whether they are in response to male harassment behavior. A novel genetic approach will be employed to identify whether offspring have been produced with or without the involvement of a male. In addition, the project will examine whether female resistance to mating affects the reproductive mode they ultimately use. Students involved in the project will be trained in observational and molecular research approaches as part of a new laboratory course on biodiversity and global applications. This research is being jointly supported by IOS Behavioral Systems and DEB Evolutionary Processes programs.<br/><br/>Although facultative parthenogenesis has long interested evolutionary biologists due to the opportunities presented by these systems to examine the evolutionary fitness benefits of alternative reproductive modes, locally adaptive mechanisms for the maintenance of reproductive alternatives, and detailed geographic patterns of reproductive mode have not been explored in natural systems. Additionally, models predicting the maintenance and pattern of multiple reproductive modes that are expressed facultatively commonly assume irreversibility of reproductive mode; an assumption that has not been established empirically. The local adaptation to sexual conflict (LASC) hypothesis was developed to predict when and where females would switch among reproductive modes. LASC predicts that females in habitats with high male density are adapted to frequent male coercion and will resist coercion by males and adopt parthenogenetic reproductive modes, particularly in the early breeding season. Alternatively, females from low-density, female-biased populations will be less likely to exhibit antagonistic behaviors towards males, and/or will be more easily overcome by coercive males. Thus, this study will characterize the geographic landscape of male density, reproductive behavior, and reproductive mode to evaluate this hypothesis. This study and the robust evaluation of the LASC hypothesis will make a valuable contribution to our understanding of the maintenance of reproductive mode variety, particularly in the understudied arachnid order, Opiliones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These spiking patterns exhibit a striking level of variability, even in neural network that are driven by identical sensory stimuli. Owing to this variability, neural networks have been thought to operate in the asynchronous state. In the asynchronous state, neurons fire independently from one another, so that the probability that a neuron experience synchronous synaptic inputs is exceedingly low. This neglect of synchrony has been further supported by the apparent weakness of spiking pairwise correlations. However, recent experimental and theoretical works seriously challenge this view. Specifically, large-scale spiking recordings have revealed weak but nonzero spiking correlations. At the same time, the levels of voltage variability observed in single-cell recordings cannot be explained without some degree of input synchrony, compatible with weak but nonzero spiking correlation. To address the challenge posed by these recent findings, the PI will characterize how synaptic synchrony can stably emerge in networks that are otherwise plagued with biological noise. Specifically, the PI will (1) model synchrony-based input correlations via jump processes, (2) elucidate how noisy spike-generation mechanisms can propagate synchrony to output neurons, and (3) characterize how synchrony-based correlations can stably emerge in limit neural networks. The payoff of (1) will be characterizing how activity correlations can explain the high degree of observed neural variability. The payoff of (2) will be estimating the temporal information content of a spike. The payoff of (3) will be identifying the network features stabilizing synchrony-based correlations. While reaching for his research goals, the PI will design an original undergraduate flipped course mixing mathematics and neuroscience audiences. Within the research center that he animates, the PI will also kickstart a service offering for affiliates who want to acquire theoretical support in their research project. <br/><br/>Cortical spiking patterns can exhibit exquisite time precision of behavioral relevance. This supports the prevalence of time codes for which neuronal spiking is synchronized. However, the maintenance of spiking precision is at odds with typically observed level of cortical noise. This supports the prevalence of rate codes, for which neurons spike asynchronously. That said, such a coding dichotomy is misleading as the same neuron can jointly acts as a synchronous coder and as an asynchronous coder. The PI will resolve the synchronous/asynchronous coding dilemma as a matter of degree rather than a matter of alternative, by characterizing collective dynamics in idealized neural circuits with nontrivial spiking correlations. Concretely, nontrivial correlations will arise from synaptic synchrony, whereby synapses to a neuron tend to coactivate over small timescales with respect to the neuron?s time constant. This is by contrast with most theoretical approaches which are rooted in mean-field approximations with trivial correlation structure. To resolve the synchronous/asynchronous coding dilemma, the PI will develop a novel theoretical and computational framework to model, quantify, and analyze the impact of synchrony on neural dynamics. The mathematical challenges at stake will be to perform (1) a stochastic analysis of biophysically-relevant neuronal models when driven by synchronous input, (2) an probabilistic analysis of the spike-generating mechanism viewed as a free-boundary problem, and (3) bifurcation and scaling analyses of the nonlinear partial differential equation capturing the so-called Poissonian mean-field dynamics. In all cases, the methodology will exploit modern analytical and probabilistic techniques in combination with advanced numerical methods.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS/DMS Mathematical Biology program and CISE/IIS Robust Intelligence program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These robots are attached to the user?s body and transmit assistive forces through physical attachments (i.e., belts and cuffs). However, current belts and cuffs cannot fully conform to the body or adapt to changes in body shapes (e.g., muscle atrophy). As a result, the assistive force is unevenly distributed, causing discomfort or even soft-tissue damage. The challenge of using belts and cuffs as the attachments is more profound in wearable robots where multiple parallel chains of linkages (i.e., parallel mechanisms) are used to connect the body attachments. The deformation of the cuffs and belts causes model errors, limiting robot performance and introducing risks of injuries. To address these challenges, this project will develop a new attachment system for parallel wearable robots to better conform to the user?s body and adapt to the body shape changes without compromising the model accuracy. This project offers an exciting opportunity to involve persons with mobility limitations (e.g., head drop, amputee) in research, fostered by close collaborations with medical professionals at the University of Utah Hospital. The project will provide convergence training to engineering students to also become experts in healthcare. Trainees will shadow physicians in a multidisciplinary clinic and conduct interviews with patients and their caregivers to learn the needs of persons with mobility limitations. Workshops will be organized at conferences to disseminate knowledge and raise awareness of research for persons with mobility limitations.<br/><br/>The overall objective is to develop a new strategy to attach wearable robots on the human body to improve comfort, adapt to body shape changes, and ensure accuracy. To attain this overall objective, jamming structures will be embedded within the design of the attachments to conform to the body shape when soft, and maintain that shape when hardened, by manipulating the internal pressure of the jamming structures. The specific knowledge products will include: (1) a design methodology for jamming embedded attachments; (2) a dataset to demonstrate jamming embedded attachment for body shape adaptation as a result of a disability (e.g., head drop in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis); and (3) a delineation of longitudinal user-robot interaction using jamming embedded attachments. The knowledge gained from this research is also expected to generalize to other biomedical devices (e.g., prostheses, orthoses, braces) and applications that use wearable devices (e.g., construction, manufacturing). This work challenges the conventional design paradigm for parallel wearable robots, emphasizing both the body and the machine.

Still, these methods exhibit an inherent trade-off between individual data privacy and data utility, i.e., strong data privacy for individual data contributors comes at the cost of reduced data utility  for the data collector, which has been hindering their broad adoption.

The project's broader significance and importance include  new tools for service providers to improve how they collect and utilize user data to drive their business decisions and growth while ensuring strong privacy guarantees to individual users as well as privacy-preserving data analysis techniques in various web, mobile, and IoT-based applications and services.<br/> <br/>This project develops novel LDP techniques to significantly improve the privacy and utility tradeoff by exploiting the correlation in multi-attribute data and the correlation that can be introduced into different users' random perturbations.

At sufficiently low temperature some materials can exhibit superconductivity, a state of matter where electrons self-organize into a cooperative state which can conduct electricity without dissipation. The search for superconductivity at high temperatures is driven by the potential of superconductors to transform the future of quantum technologies and human society, with applications in energy storage and transmission, medical diagnostics, and quantum computing. However, the microscopic reasons for superconductivity at high temperature remain mysterious. The research will be focused on a class of unconventional metals, which are the ?parent? states for high temperature superconductors. Unlike simple metals such as copper, whose properties can be effectively understood by considering the electrons one at a time, these unconventional metals are best described as a collective quantum fluid where the electrons are strongly entangled over long distances with one another. This research will develop the required technical framework to describe these entangled electronic liquids. This will pave the way for identifying the key microscopic mechanisms responsible for the origin of superconductivity at high temperatures.<br/><br/>The PI and his group will develop new theoretical methods building on recent theoretical developments across different subfields.

The goal of the research will be to address some of the key facets of the long-standing mystery of high-temperature superconductivity. Specifically, the focus will be on the unusual gapless metallic phases out of which superconductivity emerges in quantum materials. Experiments suggest that the quantum motion of electrons is frustrated and entangled over long distances in strongly correlated metals, and the microscopic degrees of freedom, namely electrons and phonons, are strongly intertwined with each other. This research activity will develop novel, non-perturbative theoretical approaches to solve the problem of electronic liquids entangled with other collective degrees of freedom, to expose universal aspects of gapless quantum many-body systems.<br/><br/>The PI will formulate new approaches for studying interacting gapless phases that do not rely on the existence of well-defined, electron-like (?quasiparticle?) excitations. To address their non-trivial dynamics, the PI will develop novel theoretical techniques that are based on technical advances in the study of frustrated magnets, thermalization in chaotic quantum many-body systems, and numerically exact algorithms that do not suffer from the fermion ?sign problem?. The PI will build on the following conjectures: (i) interacting frustrated liquids offer a non-trivial starting point for including the effects of quantum fluctuations and describing previously unexplored gapless phases; and (ii) the conventional theory for electrical transport in metals can break down over a wide range of intermediate temperatures for sufficiently ?chaotic? models with generic interactions. The PI will also exploit recent breakthroughs in the highly controllable moir systems, focusing on the problem of narrow electronic bands coupled to low-energy phonons using numerically exact methods. Analyzing these questions will offer an important conceptual framework for tying together a vast amount of existing experimental data on high-temperature superconductors, and help direct the search for new materials displaying similar phenomena.<br/><br/>The PI?s educational and outreach activities are integrated synergistically with the research.

Instead of chasing after a completely new materials, the research team targets a novel twist, making currently existing materials to become flatter, thinner, and lighter. Back in 2017, the principal investigator invented remote epitaxy, which allows growing nanoscale materials on graphene-coated templates to be exfoliated afterwards. These thin freestanding materials can become building blocks for lightweight, flexible devices having unprecedented performance. Until now, studies on remote epitaxy have been mostly limited to empirical observations on materials such as gallium nitride and gallium arsenide typically used in semiconductors. To utilize remote epitaxy as an ideal platform for growth and hetero-integration between various materials systems, the research team aims to study the mechanism of remote epitaxy at a fundamental level. By exploring the mechanism on various two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) materials, the research team expects to create a wider range of materials systems available for remote epitaxy. Also, being able to combine different materials systems together can benefit the physical sciences by discovering new functionalities, bringing advancements in engineering sciences and industry by improving current device fabrication techniques and their performances. <br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>The research team plans to focus on answering three major questions to understand remote epitaxy further: (1) the nature of the adatoms interaction with the underlying 2D/3D substrates, (2) the impacts of 2D materials and interfaces on remote epitaxy, and (3) the dynamic processes involved in adatom/nuclei migration and defect formation on 2D surfaces. To answer these questions, the research team will first reveal whether the remote epitaxy truly occurs in a ?remote? sense, which is the most fundamental conundrum that precedes any other questions. This has been difficult to answer because one can easily observe only the results of epitaxy, not the nucleation of adatoms. This issue is tackled by intentionally patterning the 2D layer and employing various materials with different growth properties as the epilayers. Second, impact of 2D layers is explored by studying how the type, crystallinity, and thickness of 2D interlayers alter the remote interaction of adatoms and substrates. In order to show the intrinsic role of 2D layers, direct growth of 2D layers is attempted on various substrates having different ionicity. Third, thermodynamics and kinetics of adatoms, their mergence to form nuclei, and nucleus-nucleus interaction on 2D layers are studied by understanding the nucleation mechanism, performing defect analysis, and exfoliating epilayers. Based on these results, the research team plans to demonstrate high-quality ultrathin films grown by remote epitaxy on directly-grown 2D layers with engineered nucleation conditions. As remote epitaxy allows mixed dimensional heterostructures, further study is done on 3D/various 2D/3D sandwiched structures to investigate new physical couplings between electronic states and magnetic properties. To the scientific community, these results are expected to utilize remote epitaxy for studying multifunctional and coupled material platforms that were not achievable by conventional methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising approach is quantum simulation, in which a quantum device with several tunable parameters is carefully manipulated to emulate the physics of various other systems of interest. Despite their promise, present-day quantum devices are still far from ideal, as their operations are noisy and the ability to control them is imperfect. The central challenges are (i) to understand how to optimally exploit such devices to explore the largest wealth of physics possible despite the restrictions and (ii) to extract physically meaningful information from potentially noisy and limited data. Here, the principal investigator proposes to address these challenges through novel ideas from theory leveraging recent advances in quantum information science and machine learning.

The first half of the research component aims to develop practical methods to achieve these goals, focusing on existing experimental capabilities. In particular, the PI and his team will develop methods to robustly engineer effective Hamiltonians of a given quantum hardware by means of optimized pulsed controls and to perform advanced measurements of arbitrary observables or nonlocal properties by utilizing information scrambling. These capabilities are otherwise difficult owing to limitations in quantum control of current devices, calling for novel theory ideas. Leveraging improved capabilities, the research team will pursue probing exotic emergent phenomena such as deconfined quantum criticality using existing quantum simulators. Deconfined quantum criticality may plan an important role in understanding high temperature superconductors and other quantum materials. Successful observations of exotic emergent phenomena using quantum simulators will allow the experimental investigations of them in greater detail, deepening our understanding of quantum phases and phase transitions. The second half of the research activities introduces a new perspective to study quantum matter using the language of quantum information theory. Specifically, the research team will develop quantum and classical algorithms to efficiently extract important information such as the phase of quantum matter from experimental data and investigate the fundamental limitations in computational power of these new algorithms.

For many applications, their electrical conductivity must be increased by adding positive (p-type) or negative (n-type) charges. This process is known as molecular doping. While there are many p-type organic semiconductors, n-type organic semiconductors are far rarer. Moreover, they are less stable in ambient conditions, and it can be difficult to control their electrical conductivity. Advancing the field of organic electronics will require development of new electronic materials and processes for n-type doping. The goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of n-type doping using a catalyst, a compound that enhances the speed of a chemical reaction. The investigator will combine synthetic strategies for new organic semiconductors with selection of n-type dopant-catalyst pairs to optimize the doping process. This research will result in a new class of n-type organic semiconductors with high-performance and enhanced stability. This research will also promote understanding on how the new n-type materials affect device performance. The PI?s educational goal is to foster a positive perception of organic electronic materials and devices.

For organic semiconductors, several strategies have yielded doped ?-electron solids with greatly enhanced optical and electronic properties as well as novel materials, physical phenomena, and device concepts. However, these advances were largely enabled by p-doped (hole transporting) materials, while useful n-doped (electron-transporting) materials have been limited in chemical accessibility, doping efficiency, and environmental stability. This limits their use in devices where both p-type and n-type semiconductors are required. Recently, the PI and coworkers discovered that metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au) can catalytically assist/accelerate the doping of representative organic semiconductors by molecular dopants. This research project will: 1) Elucidate the mechanism of the catalytic n-doping process and expand the scope to other type of catalysts. 2) Explore other dopants and semiconductors, implementing to date unexplored structural design and synthetic strategies. 3) Characterize catalyzed vs uncatalyzed doped film properties in terms of composition, electronic structure, morphology, microstructure, and opto-electronic response. Thus, this study plans to bring n-doped organics to unprecedented levels in terms of molecular/macromolecular materials designs, their accessibility in scale, and their useful opto-electronic properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award focuses on systems that display moir patterns with a wavelength much larger than that of the crystal periodicity of the individual layers.<br/><br/>Such systems received considerable interest with the discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene in 2018.

The research activities are structured in three complementary objectives. First, the PI will develop methods to compute effective moir potentials in complex, multilayer van-der-Waals structures using DFT and first-principles-parametrized force-field calculations.

These will be carried out by ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations based on the GW and GW combined with Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approaches, together with new methods to incorporate the effect of the moir potential without requiring large calculations on large supercells. The PI will systematically study the coherence and coupling of emergent excitonic states in such multilayer systems.

Soft matter is a group of materials including liquid crystals, colloids, polymers, surfactants, and biological matter, which structurally reorganize in response to even slight changes in temperature and other environmental conditions.  Scientists and engineers harness the unique properties of soft matter in applications ranging from drug delivery to organic solar cells to microfluidic devices. Fundamental to the REU site is intentional faculty mentoring through meaningful research experiences, which is shown to improve students? persistence in STEM careers and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in physics and engineering.  This promotes the progress of science through the retention of talented scholars in research careers.  REU students, benefitting from CSU?s focus on undergraduate research and ?engaged learning?, are mentored by experienced faculty and participate in well-established CSU professional development opportunities.  Students? scientific development is supported by soft matter science/characterization seminars and weekly cohort events (science colloquia, regional research centers visits, professional development seminars). Technical communication skills are developed with student presentations at CSU, a poster presentation at the regional summer undergraduate research conference, and scaffolded writing of project reports. The REU also funds student travel to present their research at a regional/national conference after the REU, providing further opportunities for scientific communication and networking.  Finally, long-term scientific relationships are developed within REU cohorts through cohort building activities including outreach at a local school, student coffee hours, and weekend social activities. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/><br/>The scientific focus of this REU is soft matter, a subfield of condensed matter that encompasses a large variety of materials, from polymeric gels that can be used for transport and for directing assembly of other materials, to polymers that can be used for electronic or mechanical applications, to biological materials studied to better mimic nature?s complexity and develop new pathways towards healing.  REU participants conduct original research projects within three main foci: 1) Understanding fundamental properties and phase transitions of polymers, proteins, gels, and microemulsions to harness the power of environmentally sensitive nanoparticles and gels; 2) Driving self-assembly of anisotropic soft matter to exploit its properties for applications from electronics to biomimetics; and 3) Striving to better understand and to improve mixing in liquid soft matter systems and use liquid flow to probe biological and physical phenomena. The REU students contribute significantly to cutting-edge soft matter research with potential applications ranging from drug delivery to organic solar cells to microfluidic devices.  The student?s research experience is supported by scientific and professional development seminars, oral/poster presentations, final report preparation, and development of a professional network of faculty and peers through social activities.

A prominent example is the rapidly expanding class of topological insulators, which are characterized by conductive edges that enclose an insulating interior. This project sheds light on exotic phenomena that can arise from the interplay of correlations and topology in two-dimensional (2D) materials and harnesses these novel phases to build the next generation of quantum devices. The key to our approach is use of a novel low temperature imaging technique, which detects the unique fingerprint of the conducting edge currents at high frequencies and spatially disentangles them from trivial states in the interior of the material. Emerging topological states in 2D materials could potentially be harnessed in the future to enable new quantum technologies, including exceptionally robust forms of quantum computing in which environmental noise is strongly suppressed. To train the next generation of scientists and engineers, this project also develops a new Quantum Materials and Devices teaching module, which equips students with an interdisciplinary toolbox spanning materials and device preparation, measurements in a cryogenic environment, data analysis, and technical writing skills. To integrate research and outreach, the principal investigator aims to organize a science-themed public art exhibit, which presents the microscopy of quantum materials as an exciting new frontier for scientific exploration.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: <br/>The aim of this project is to investigate the microscopic nature of collective phenomena arising from the interplay of interactions and topology in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and magnetic topological insulators.  By pushing the frontiers of microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) to ultra-low temperatures, this research strives to detect the unique signature of plasmonic excitations in magnetic topological insulators and construct a microscopic picture of dissipation along the edge. Building upon recent developments on the materials front, a complementary thrust focuses on engineering correlated topological states in vdW heterostructures by tuning the angular rotation between layers and the electrostatic environment. In particular, the project features a focused investigation of Moire superlattices in twisted bi-layer MoTe2, in which narrow bands are predicted to give rise to a family of many-body states, including quantum anomalous Hall and antiferromagnetic insulators. These experiments utilize electronic transport and microwave imaging methods to construct a comprehensive phase diagram of ordered states, shedding light on the key symmetry-breaking mechanisms. This research builds the foundation for GHz characterization of topological states in emerging quantum materials; it complements the materials discovery effort in the synthesis community by enabling fast characterization of chiral edge states in thin films, multi-domain systems, and devices.  In the future, this milliKelvin imaging capability could potentially be used for local readout of topological states in device platforms for quantum computing applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To enhance roadway safety and efficiency through driver-assistance and automated-driving systems, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is the globally preeminent technology to support connected vehicle services, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, and is set for expansion toward 6G cellular technology. In particular, V2V communication that allows vehicles to directly exchange messages beyond the perception range of on-board sensors has many tangible benefits to society with the potential to prevent a significant percentage of crashes, increase transportation system efficiency (reducing travel time, pollution, etc.), and enhance mobility for disadvantaged communities. Despite long-standing classical security protocols designed for C-V2X, however, this technology is vulnerable to imminent quantum attacks from emerging quantum computers threatening the ?integrity? of safety-critical messages, and to denial-of-service attacks at the currently unprepared communication protocols hindering possible mitigations for those quantum attacks. Countering these attacks, separately or jointly, is challenging, a significant risk to the safety of the growing connected vehicle services and future autonomous ones, especially as current hardware (with 12-15 year life expectancy on vehicles) is inefficient at running post-quantum algorithms fast enough.<br/><br/>This CAREER project refines and refocuses existing V2V communication and security protocols, without an overhaul, to support post-quantum algorithms, given the hardware and other practical limitations in the automotive industry. With novel security protocols and backward-compatible communication techniques to prevent, mitigate, and evaluate quantum attacks, this project transforms the current C-V2X ecosystem to become crypto-agile for a staged transition over the next two decades into a quantum-resistant one. The research and education agenda is framed around three thrusts: (1) Establishing a roadmap and a transition plan in designing specific interim security protocols for different stages of the transition (e.g., before and after compatible hardware is available); (2) Supporting post-quantum algorithms by optimizing the resource scheduling techniques at the MAC layer to accommodate more messages, and developing novel message sieving techniques at the physical layer to reduce the integrity verification loads on the security modules; and (3) Developing a unique prototype of a digital twin infused with software-defined radios by converting an open-source V2V security testbed to an interactive platform with interfaces to large-scale (NSF-funded) testbeds. As an integral part of this project, a digital twin will be used (instead of costly urban experiments) for comprehensive evaluation of the proposed techniques and development of a novel game for gamifying connected vehicle security education. It cultivates new interdisciplinary research among game design, wireless security, and the automotive industry, providing for synergistic research and education outcomes, and will also help broaden the impacts through inclusive mobility initiatives for disadvantaged (deaf and hard-of-hearing) communities and innovative educational pathways to train next generation of under-represented cybersecurity experts. The PI will disseminate new course modules, hands-on labs, and the new games through open-access lectures, academic/public exhibits, and various collegiate and K-12 competitions. The research outcomes will be shared with stakeholders for supporting safe innovations, standardization bodies (NIST, IEEE) for security standards, and 3GPP and automotive industry for 6G C-V2X specifications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project takes advantage of an on-going process of change from a fixed wage to a piece-rate wage system in one garment manufacturing plant to study the effects of piece-rate wage on productivity.  The researchers will study how piece-rate wage payment system affects productivity through increased performance monitoring, motivation of individual efforts, as well as recruitment and retention of more productive workers.

Consider, for example, that an encoded message has been passed through an imperfect communication channel and, as a result, was slightly corrupted. Can it be efficiently corrected? Often, looking at small windows ? namely small chunks of consecutive letters in the encoded message? makes complete sense, and they can be decoded (as the channel did not corrupt them), except for a few windows in which some letter has been corrupted. Despite affecting only a small number of windows, these corruptions may lead to a complete misinterpretation of the intention of the message: imagine a sentence in the English language, and compare it with the same sentence in which the word ""yes"" has been replaced with the word ""no"". To handle such cases, one would like to find ways to ensure that a perfect, efficient recovery of the uncorrupted message is possible. Is there a way to use the strong local consistencies in the good windows and the overall global structure of the encoded message to allow such recovery in an efficient way? To further the research's impact through education, the project includes activities such as the publication of expository materials and an educational program at a research institute involving several bootcamps.<br/><br/>Designing objects with this type of ""local recovery property,"" which often goes by the name ""local to global phenomenon"", is one of the prime objectives of theoretical computer science. The field of Analysis of Boolean functions (also known as discrete Fourier analysis) is often a vital tool in establishing such results in areas including complexity theory, learning theory, error correcting codes, and property testing. In these contexts, of particular interest are notions known as expansion, small-set expansion, and hypercontractivity, asserting that the object in hand is very well connected so that ""unfixable corruptions"" in it can never be contained in ""small windows."" Indeed, expansion, small set expansion, and hypercontractivity have been used to prove a large number of important results in theoretical computer science in the areas mentioned above and more. There are significant applications, however, that require working with objects that do not possess such strong expansion properties. This project aims to extend the theory to deal with these more challenging objects and to use it to make progress in crucial questions in complexity theory, error-correcting codes, probabilistically checkable proofs, and more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, due to high data processing demands, AI systems are typically run on power-hungry specialized computing hardware.  Quantization, or approximation to smaller numerical values, has been used to reduce computing requirements.  However, the fixed low bit-width DNNs may suffer losses in accuracy due to quantization errors.  Many existing software solutions for quantization are also fixed or limited in bit-width choices.  To address this trade-off and leverage data sparsity, the research team will investigate state-of-the-art methods and develop novel data quantization, encoding, and compression algorithms to integrate with existing AI systems.  The methods developed have the potential to not only improve performance but also to reduce power requirements and boost the energy efficiency of AI systems.  They will enable AI applications such as DNN inference on small devices, thus reducing the load on cloud infrastructure, improving user experience, providing data privacy, and avoiding security risks.  The work proposed in this project has the potential to push the boundaries in many AI applications that run on energy storage-constrained devices, such as smart sensing, wearable devices, and autonomous driving.

This project will use a new model to systematically investigate melt transport in heterogeneous environments under dynamic atmospheric conditions. The model resolves important physics missing in previous models that significantly influence the residence time of melt within snowpack during transport. Additionally, observations of melt transport through snow under controlled environmental conditions have only been made in 3D snow samples, rendering quantitative comparison with numerical models challenging. This project will design and perform controlled laboratory experiments to directly visualize real-time dynamics of melt transport and refreezing in quasi-2D flow cells.

This has negative consequences for birds and humans who handle soiled bird feeders, as they may acquire antibiotic-resistant bacteria from these feeders. Birds exhibiting strong immune responses may not be harmed by these microbes, but urban environments can stress birds and thereby impede their immune system. Also, urban development causes habitat fragmentation, which can decrease the spread of beneficial immune gene variants between rural and urban bird populations in species with limited dispersal. To explore these issues, the researchers will gather data across three sites along an urban-rural gradient for three finch species that routinely occupy bird feeders in California. The project aims are to (1) measure the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in birds and at bird feeders, (2) measure the birds' bacteria-killing ability in vitro, and (3) measure the variation between six immune genes in house finches. The researchers will involve the community through a regional birding society and scouting organizations. They will also have students in four courses at their minority-serving institution help collect, process, and analyze their data. Ultimately, their goal is to increase the participation of historically marginalized people in scientific research and connect with the public on the importance of how humans can impact avian health and how they can help protect local bird populations.<br/><br/>Along an urban-rural gradient near Fresno, California, the researchers will study the effect of urbanization on the innate immunity of three finch species (pine siskins Spinus pinus, lesser goldfinches Spinus psaltria, and house finches Haemorhous mexicanus) by performing bacteria-killing assays and analyzing leukocytes profiles. The researchers will measure immunogenetic diversity and differentiation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC; the cornerstone of the adaptive immune system) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs; innate immune genes) and at neutral loci in non-migratory house finches, which commonly occupy feeders in rural and urban environments. The researchers will quantify and characterize the prevalence of bacteria and their antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in these birds and on the bird feeders. To accomplish this, the researchers and their students will catch and sample finches along an urban-rural gradient to (1) measure constitutive innate immunity by running bacteria-killing assays against three bacteria species and analyze leukocyte profiles with light microscopy; (2) measure immunogenetic variation by genetically characterizing the hypervariable peptide-binding region of MHC class I and II using high-throughput sequencing, the pathogen-recognition domains of four TLRs, and measure neutral genetic diversity using 14 microsatellite loci; and (3) perform metagenomic analysis to characterize microbes and ARGs in the three finches and the bird feeders they use. Ultimately, this research will allow biologists to better understand how urbanization plays a role in the evolutionary ecology of the avian immune system and the spread of microbes containing ARGs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To quantify the stresses caused by plate tectonics, geologists examine the shape, size, and other microstructural characteristic of minerals such as quartz. From these characteristics combined with laboratory experiments geologists have developed mathematical equations that relate the applied stress to the rate of rock flow. These equations, known as flow laws, are valuable but the uncertainties remain significant. Here the researchers combine field-based data and modeling with laboratory experiments to develop a new method for extracting stress and flow-rate information from rocks that can be directly compared to results obtained from applying flow laws. They quantify how the roughness of mineral grain boundaries directly records stress and flow rate. They develop new protocols for measuring roughness using electron beam methods. The interdisciplinary project supports a postdoctoral associate, as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Maine. The developed codes and analytical protocols are made openly available through public portals. These outcomes can be applied beyond Earth Sciences in Material Sciences and Engineering, notably to engineer the strength of metals, ceramics, and advanced composite materials.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to: 1) Generate a new experimental calibration using quartz to refine the polynomial relations among temperature, stress, flow rate and grain-boundary roughness; 2) Obtain a complete set of quartz grain-boundary roughness data from the Sandhill Corner shear zone in the Norumbega fault system, Maine USA, to test and apply the new experimental calibrations; 3) Develop and refine methods for determining grain-boundary perimeters using optical and electron backscatter diffraction techniques, and provide optical and backscatter diffraction calibrations for the method. Addressing the above objectives provides an opportunity to quantify the relations between deformation conditions and resulting rock microstructures, and to develop a new method for estimating stresses and strain rates that can be used independently or in concert with flow laws. The chosen approach applies models and concepts that originate largely in the materials and engineering communities, and mostly constitutes novel research in the geosciences. Recognition of the importance of microstructure for macroscopic behavior and the ability to treat it quantitatively is growing in both Earth Sciences and Materials Engineering. Outcomes of this project will provide a framework for future efforts in both fields, and for collaborations between them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deep neural networks and their hardware will be commonplace in future in various systems ranging from simple tasks to safety and security-critical systems. Therefore, it is imperative to have specialized support to improve the robustness of deep neural network models so that users and developers can trust the predictions provided by those models. Towards that end, this project presents novel algorithms for robust deep neural networks.<br/><br/>The project aims at ensuring robust operations of deep neural networks. The project, called GuardiaNN, has two components - dynamic monitoring schemes and testing schemes. The goal of dynamic monitoring is to determine whether a deep neural network model can misbehave during inference at a production setting.  Two novel monitoring algorithms are considered in this project - neuron pattern and model-based monitoring. Neuron pattern-based schemes work by first extracting simple neuron activation patterns and then, later at runtime, checking whether those patterns are satisfied or not. Model-based schemes work by first determining a minimal set of data points to monitor and then, using an advanced model to detect if those data points show any anomalous pattern or not. The goal of testing schemes is to determine how the model might behave in corner case scenarios. Testing allows users to explore the behavior of the model without understanding the internal details of the model. Together the monitoring and testing approaches will provide trust in deep neural network operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Molecular information storage is a promising solution to this problem because it has key advantages over traditional storage media (e.g., magnetic tape and disk). These advantages include extremely high density, long shelf-life, and low energy costs. However, to make molecular information storage practical, several barriers must be overcome. Namely, the relatively high costs associated with reading and writing data in molecular form. This research is focused on harnessing the advantages of two promising technological areas originally developed for the life sciences (enzymatic DNA synthesis and nanopore DNA sequencing) by developing a new information storage medium based on synthetic polymers that can be synthesized at large scale and low cost, and can be quickly decoded with inexpensive laptop-powered nanopore readers. Together, these features will lower the cost, complexity, and latency of this system compared to traditional DNA-based data storage. As part of this award, the investigators are also committed to training students and professionals to be well versed in the intersection of biology and computing, which is a very promising new area of scientific and economic development. These research directions will be integrated into a new special topics course in which computer science students will be exposed to the concepts of molecular computing and information storage, while also gaining hands-on experience in molecular biology and computer hardware.<br/><br/><br/>This award aims to achieve the following goals: (1) Machine-guided design and chemical synthesis of new dNTP analogs; (2) Concatenation of these analogs into homo- and heteropolymer copolymers using enzymatic synthesis; (3) Demonstration of encoding digital information into copolymer sequences; (4) Computational models for predicting nanopore ionic currents from new analog sequences and for decoding new analog kmer signals into representative bits. Ultimately, the investigators expect to be able to demonstrate in their results that synthesis of an expanded polymer alphabet is possible as is encoding digital information using it. The ability to read this information out using nanopore technology will be a key driver of the system's high-throughput and low latency thanks to the portability and cost compared to mass spectrometry, which is the traditional readout for non-natural polymers. In its sum, this work represents a significant step forward in the feasibility of practical, large-scale digital data encoding in molecular form.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, the generation of crops with enhanced drought tolerance represents an urgent need for breeders, scientists, and governments. Excessive water loss is lethal for most plants, but a few plants, known as resurrection plants, have the remarkable ability to survive almost complete dehydration of their green tissues. This ability, known as vegetative desiccation tolerance (VDT), relies upon a combination of molecular processes that allow the plant to maintain its viability in the dry state. Interestingly, all genes involved in VDT are also present in desiccation-susceptible plants, as most plants produce seeds that can survive for long periods in the dry state without losing the capacity to germinate upon watering. Therefore, the difference between tolerant and susceptible plants must be in their capacity to activate the mechanisms that protect cells against desiccation in green tissues and not only in the seed. The objective of this project is to identify the mechanisms of how plants evolved to activate desiccation tolerance in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. Specifically, this study seeks to identify the genes that act as master regulators of desiccation tolerance. This collaborative project will use a multidisciplinary approach to identify common and specific molecular processes by comparing the dynamic responses of green tissues and seeds. The results of this project will serve to design molecular breeding schemes for improving crop resilience to climate change.<br/><br/>Excessive water loss is lethal for most plants, but a few species, known as resurrection plants, evolved the remarkable ability to survive almost complete dryness. This ability, known as desiccation tolerance (DT), relies upon a combination of physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses that allow the plant to preserve cell integrity in the dry state. Interestingly, all gene families involved in vegetative desiccation tolerance (VDT) are present in desiccation-sensitive plants, suggesting that this trait evolved primarily by changes in the regulatory networks coordinating the expression of DT genes rather than from the acquisition of new genes. The lack of accurate comparative analyses has hindered the identification of the regulators controlling VDT and the study of the evolutionary origin of this trait in vascular plants. Therefore, this collaborative project will determine the regulatory networks controlling VDT and infer its origin during vascular plant evolution by analyzing the DT response of key resurrection lineages using integrative methodologies. Specific objectives include (1) determining the kinetics of the global transcriptional changes in vegetative and reproductive tissues during the DT process, (2) performing kinetic analyses of the global metabolic changes in vegetative and reproductive tissues during the DT process, (3) performing in situ and single-cell type kinetic analysis of transcriptional and metabolomic changes of vegetative tissues during dehydration and recovery, and (4) conducting comparative analyses of the regulatory networks controlling DT in resurrection plants. This study will identify genetic-metabolic networks required to activate VDT, providing the basis for future crop breeding of enhanced drought tolerance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geoscientists rely on the sedimentary record of ocean basins to understand how the Earth and its oceans respond to geological and environmental change over long timescales. Ultimately, a better understanding of these feedbacks allows for predictions about how life on our planet has responded, or will respond, to external drivers such as climate or tectonics. This project will investigate links between physical surface processes, ocean oxygenation, and organic carbon burial during the establishment of the South Atlantic Ocean from 150-100 million years ago, a time period characterized by greenhouse to hothouse climate conditions. More broadly, this project will (1) generate new high school educational and professional development content; (2) enhance infrastructure for international research, collaboration, and community engagement in southern Patagonia; and (3) promote teaching, mentoring, and research with undergraduates in STEM.<br/><br/>Continental break-up facilitates suitable conditions (e.g., restricted incipient ocean basins) for organic carbon burial. It is less clear, however, when/how these conditions are reversed by continued continental breakup and ocean basin ventilation and circulation. This project aims to determine the depositional response to local basin setting, regional tectonics, and global climate changes associated with the opening of a major oceanic gateway in the South Atlantic during the Early Cretaceous breakup of Gondwana. Preliminary results from southern Patagonia show there are discernable lithologic and chemostratigraphic boundaries in the stratigraphy of southern ocean basins recording changing environmental conditions. Constraining the timing of deposition with high precision geochronology and the chemical environments of deposition allows for comparisons between this study in Patagonia with age-correlative basins elsewhere. Moreover, through collaborations with Chilean paleontologists, the project will inform ongoing paleobiology studies of the environmental influences on the distribution and behavioral patterns of Cretaceous marine vertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most materials have several different stable crystalline structures, each with a characteristic set of physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Carbon, which can form graphite (flaky, black material used in pencils) or diamond (hard, colorless gemstone) structures, is a well-known example. Solid-solid transitions that occur between different crystalline forms of the same compound are ubiquitous and important phenomena. They can lead to a wide variety of technologically important applications such as diamond and steel production, synthesis of ceramic materials, thermal energy harvesting and storage, rewritable optical data storage, and nonvolatile electronic memories. Historically, considerable progress has been made in understanding solid-solid transitions from thermodynamics concerning the relative phase stability (the ?driving force? for the phase transition), regardless of transition paths between the initial and final structures. However, the kinetics that dictates whether or not the transition can occur in practice under given environmental conditions and which path the transition likely takes place remain poorly understood. This project will advance the atomic-level understanding of kinetics underlying solid-solid transitions without using empirical data and develop an advanced artificial intelligence method for the fast and accurate prediction of kinetic barriers that control solid-solid transition in various environments.

Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous phenomena that play key roles in diverse technologies across physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and engineering. Despite having been studied for over a century, the fundamental understanding of phase transition kinetics remains largely qualitative or phenomenological; the atomistic mechanism of such transition processes and design rules for controlling kinetics are still crucially missing. This project will advance atomic-level understanding of kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions using a combined method of modern first-principles electronic structure theory calculations, quantitative chemical bond analysis, and machine learning. The specific objectives are to (i) identify physical principles and structural motifs that control kinetic barriers of polymorphic transitions from first principles, and (ii) develop a bottom-up physics-driven machine learning method for the fast and accurate prediction of transition barriers. The study will be carried on a set of select well-known phase-transition materials that are technologically important for energy and electronic applications. The research will accelerate the design and discovery of new functional phase-change materials where kinetics is essential.<br/><br/>Education and outreach activities are integrated in this project with the goal to inspire and develop a diverse, globally competitive next-generation STEM workforce in computational materials science that will benefit the State of Maine as well as the nation.

Parallelism offers the promise of high performance, and theoretical research is important in supporting high performance. However, there remains a significant gap between the theory and practice of multicore parallelism. First, many simple problems in the traditional (sequential) setting become more complicated in parallel and still remain open in theory. This creates difficulty in teaching and popularizing parallel algorithms to a broader audience. Second, some important practical ideas are not captured by existing theory, and researchers need to consider theory and practice separately. As a result, it is important to develop new theoretical results for parallel algorithms that are simple to understand and can better capture practice. The goal of this project is to study the theory of shared-memory parallelism, including designing new parallel algorithms with improved theoretical guarantees, studying new parallel models to better capture practice, as well as promoting accessibility (to a broad audience and in education) and practicality (with good performance) for parallel algorithms.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two thrusts. The first thrust is to design simple and efficient parallel algorithms from sequential iterative algorithms by carefully analyzing the true dependencies between iterations. A broader goal is to find conditions that make a sequential algorithm highly parallelizable and methodologies for exploiting parallelism. The second thrust is to design new models and algorithms to reduce synchronization costs. Although viewed as a constant cost in most existing parallel models, synchronizing threads is expensive in practice, and more accurate modeling is needed. This project will study new models to systematically understand the synchronization costs in parallel algorithms. This project places a strong emphasis on combining theory and practice. In addition to new theoretical bounds, the research team will also evaluate the practicality of the results for simplicity (are they suitable in the classroom setting) and programmability/performance (can they be implemented to achieve high performance).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When interacting with smart machines, such as robots, prosthetics, computers, or even virtual environments, such haptic feedback is crucial for efficient human-machine interactions. Remarkable progress has been made in developing skin-like sensors for users to control machines and for machines to learn about their surrounding environment. However, skin-compatible haptic feedback from machines to users is largely unexplored. This project seeks to develop haptic interfaces that can produce haptic cues compatible with the sensing capabilities and mechanical properties of the skin. The proposed skin-like multimodal haptic interface represents a significant opportunity to enable bilateral machine control. The resulting closed-loop human-machine interface is the enabling technology that can impact a wide range of applications, including robotics, prosthetics, teleoperation, smart manufacturing, entertainment, medical/military training, and virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR). The haptic interface can also benefit individuals with hearing and visual impairments by encoding and representing information using haptic feedback. The integrated research and educational activities will inspire and educate a diverse group of students in the fields of haptic devices and nanotechnology.

Modern solid-state sciences provide powerful tools to explore the design of materials with competing magnetic interactions that can result in non-collinear magnetic structures, such as helical, spiral, or skyrmionics spin textures. This project aims to develop rational pathways to such materials by implementing a concept of magnetic phase boundary mapping. The phase space between two collinear magnetic structures (e.g., ferro- and antiferromagnetic) will be probed by a range of structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic techniques, as well as by electronic structure calculations, to uncover the region of non-collinear spin textures that are highly sensitive both to chemical substitutions and to applied magnetic fields or pressure. The project will make active use of advanced large-scale research facilities at national labs for determination of magnetic structures and detailed structure-property correlations. The proposed research activities will provide versatile training to graduate and undergraduate students in materials synthesis, investigation of structural and magnetic properties, the use of neutron scattering methods, and studies of the electronic band structure. The students will be involved in active collaborations with researchers at neutron and X-ray scattering facilities.

Regions that once had regular snow cover during winter now experience warm spells and  rain-on-snow events that can cause snow to melt. Without consistent snow cover, soils will no longer be insulated from freezing temperatures or protected from water during the winter.

This research uses an experiment that will melt snow, along with observations along a snow-cover gradient in the New Hampshire mountains, to understand how changes in snow cover will affect soil processes. This project provides graduate and undergraduate education in winter ecology, experiments, and data analysis. This project also involves community members, including public school students, to help monitor snow and soil conditions in the New Hampshire mountains and to help the public learn more about the effects of changes in winter on their communities.<br/><br/>The loss of a persistent snowpack is increasing soil climate variability as snowmelt periodically raises soil moisture levels and leaves the soil vulnerable to episodic freezing. Recent measurements in upland forest soils indicate this winter variability is causing redox fluctuations. Increased redox fluctuations will have profound effects on soil biogeochemistry with implications for greenhouse gases, such as increased N2O fluxes and reduced CH4 uptake, and may increase nutrient exports to aquatic systems. This research will 1) construct a novel in situ experiment that manipulates winter climate with three treatments: melting 50% of snowfall, melting 100% of snowfall, and a control, where snow is not manipulated; and 2) use a natural gradient of snow conditions as a space-for-future-time substitution. Within the experiment and across the gradient, soil environmental variables (temperature, moisture, frost depth, O2, and redox potential), and biogeochemical fluxes, including greenhouse gas production (CO2, N2O, CH4) and the leaching of carbon, nutrients, and metals through the soil profile, will be measured. This research will generate the knowledge needed to fill the unaddressed gap of how midwinter snowmelt affects soil biogeochemistry through changes to moisture, temperature, and redox and quantify how this loss of snow affects soil.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However in the quantum realm, interaction between quantum particles can lead to daunting challenges - it enforces complex collective behaviour of the particles that appear very hard to study using current computational means. This project aims to pin down the nature of this complexity by investigating a series of fundamental questions. First, are the interactions themselves simple enough that their precise knowledge can be gained by a practical algorithm? Such an algorithm is also expected to benefit quantum technologies, facilitating learning and testing of quantum devices. Second, how computationally difficult is it to estimate physical properties of the quantum particles, even if the knowledge of interactions is available? This question will help understand the limits of near term quantum devices in probing quantum particles. Third, could the collective behaviour of particles be simple rather than complex, under some common assumptions on the interactions? This would allow efficient means to computationally simulate systems that respect the assumptions. The educational plan centers around computation and physics, encompassing a seminar series at Harvard University with a diverse list of speakers, development of a quantum computing curriculum at Harvard University for graduate and undergraduate students, and teaching quantum theory to students from Boston high-schools with limited access to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education.<br/><br/>This project will study local Hamiltonians - the quantum analogues of constraint satisfaction problems in theoretical computer science - that model interactions in quantum many-body systems. In particular, it will aim to make progress on three long-standing questions: Can a local Hamiltonian be learned efficiently from the Gibbs quantum states? What are the fundamental limits on the approximations to the ground energies of a local Hamiltonian (the quantum Probabilistically-Checkable-Proofs conjecture)? Does limited entanglement hold for the ground states of two-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians (the area law conjecture)?  These questions address the complexity of quantum many-body systems from the view of three well-studied measures: learnability, approximability and entanglement. This is inspired by three successful ways to measure complexity of a computation in theoretical computer science - time complexity, space complexity and randomness. In fact, ideas from theoretical computer science are expected to be crucial in making progress on the above questions. Furthermore, research will add to the knowledge in quantum technologies: Hamiltonian learning techniques will find use in the testing of programmable quantum devices and progress on the quantum Probabilistically-Checkable-Proofs conjecture will limit the efficiency of various near-term quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, we believe they are more amenable to treatment, intervention, and rehabilitation. Indeed, when they receive the proper supports and resources, children are remarkably resilient. However, the juvenile justice field typically focuses on compliance and control rather than promoting positive growth and helping youth reach their potential. To advance the health, prosperity, and welfare of justice-involved youth and move the field into the future, juvenile justice system policymakers, practitioners, and researchers need a guiding framework that illuminates how interdisciplinary approaches can be integrated to promote youth thriving and a structured set of tools and approaches that can test the framework. We need a model framework for organizing and guiding the field, new tools for measuring youths? success rather than just their deficits and recidivism, and a model program that can be replicated easily in other jurisdictions to promote youth success. <br/><br/>This project consists of an integrated research, education, and implementation plan devoted to developing and testing the Integrated Youth Development Model (IYDM), a novel theoretical framework that demonstrates how interdisciplinary approaches can be integrated and distilled into a workable set of core tenets that promotes thriving among justice-involved youth. Specifically, the CAREER project has four objectives: (1) Develop the IYDM, which leverages social ecology, positive youth development, youth empowerment, and learning science, to promote positive youth outcomes; (2) Construct and test a ?Positive Change Center Tool? for jurisdictions to assess current practices and perspectives on IYDM-informed principles; (3) Systematically test elements of the IYDM and positively impact JJS-involved youth; and (4) Engage university students, youth, and their parents in learning and participatory action research. In doing so, the investigator will create tools that assess how much jurisdictions engage in positive youth change, as well as enable jurisdictions to shift from assessing recidivism as the sole outcome to using new tools that assess their impacts on positive outcomes. Both quantitative/experimental and participatory action research methodologies will be used, and the studies will take place within one of the nation?s largest juvenile justice systems. Altogether, the project will yield a new, empirically supported, sustainable, and replicable path forward for juvenile justice scholarship, education, and practice focused on promoting learning and growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate students with disabilities enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) degree programs at rates similar to students without disabilities; yet many students with disabilities leave before earning a degree. One possible reason for the low graduation rates of students with disabilities may be that classroom instruction, which is designed to promote student learning, is not automatically inclusive and does not inherently support the needs of these students. In addition, STEM instructors often lack knowledge and expertise to support students with disabilities. This project will support chemistry graduate teaching assistants in conceptualizing inclusive practices in their teaching by creating and testing video-based lessons designed to be incorporated into professional development for graduate teaching assistants. Findings from this project will support increased participation of people with disabilities and others who are underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>This collaboration between researchers at the University of Central Florida and the University of Connecticut Avery Point will employ the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework to articulate, model, and assess research-based instructional principles to support the preparation of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) for chemistry courses. Materials will be created to support GTAs to enhance accessibility in the courses they teach and to promote meaningful learning for students with a wide range of abilities in undergraduate chemistry courses. Three specific objectives guide the execution of the project. First is to examine chemistry GTAs? current awareness, conceptualizations, values, and reported use of the UDL-aligned instructional strategies. Second is to develop a suite of video-based lessons and facilitator materials to illustrate best practices for implementing UDL instructional strategies in chemistry courses. The final objective is to investigate how the materials are incorporated into professional development programs at a variety of institutions to shift GTAs? views about accessibility, inclusivity, and UDL. This investigation includes examining how those who prepare and support GTAs integrate the materials developed into their department?s professional development programs and how they prefer to access the materials. To accomplish these three objectives, the project team will curate video of GTAs integrating inclusive practices that research has shown to be difficult for chemistry instructors to conceptualize or implement. To explore the efficacy of the video-based professional development, the project team  will compare outcomes for both GTAs and students across three different UDL professional development conditions (none, standard UDL, and the video-based UDL developed by the project). The research team will collect and analyze responses to several key measures including pre- and post- Modified Inclusive Teaching Strategies Inventory, scenario assessments, and interviews to assess the impact that the video-based training lessons have on GTAs? understanding, recognition, and application of inclusive practices in chemistry teaching and learning environments. Materials generated from this project will be shared with GTA training programs nationwide as well as with other stakeholders who are committed to facilitating inclusive STEM teaching and learning. Ultimately, this project will contribute to our understanding of how to connect theory and practice to better understand UDL strategies and facilitate wider implementation in undergraduate chemistry courses. Further, the findings are likely to have implications for UDL-aligned instructor professional development in other STEM disciplines. Finally, since graduate teaching assistants are the future workforce of academia, the focus on GTA professional development enhances the potential for long-term impacts of the project.

In some cases, earthquakes and ground swelling have been used to predict imminent volcanic eruptions. In other instances, changes in volcanic gas emissions have been used to infer changes in volcanic activity because gas emissions are thought to be linked to the ascent of magmas beneath volcanoes preceding eruptions. This project explores the possibility that volcanic gas chemistry might hold vital clues about magma recharge that could help forecast the onset and course of volcanic eruptions. Magmas from the deep Earth are rich in 3He (an isotope of helium that is very rare compared to 4He). Thus, magma recharge events may cause increases in 3He relative to 4He (i.e., higher 3He/4He). This hypothesis will be tested by measuring 3He/4He values in lavas from recent eruptions in Hawai?i, Iceland, and the Canary Islands. By comparing 3He/4He to other volcanic indicators, including lava discharge rate, lava composition, earthquake frequency and magnitude, and other chemical features of volcanic gases detected by satellites, the team will attempt to link changes in 3He/4He to volcanic activity. If helium systematics change in response to potentially hazardous volcanic processes, real-time helium monitoring of volcanoes may be justified. Not only does this project aim to broaden our understanding of volcanic systems, it also emphasizes high school, undergraduate, and graduate education. In partnership with the New Heights Charter School, in Brockton Massachusetts, the science team will develop lectures and activities relating to volcanology. Two undergraduate summer student fellows at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will be recruited from City University of New York (CUNY), which has a diverse student population. Two additional CUNY undergraduate students will participate by conducting independent study projects. One graduate student enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program will contribute to all stages of the research.

Seismic activity and ground deformation monitoring are often difficult to link with magmatic processes. Integrative monitoring approaches show the most promise, especially those that supplement established techniques with geochemical monitoring. Helium isotopes show great potential in this regard because they (i) are sensitive to recharge events and (ii) can be monitored?in fumaroles, soils, geothermal waters, and lavas?during eruptions and during periods of repose. Furthermore, previous work indicates that helium isotopes (3He/4He) are sensitive to magma recharge events from the mantle. The goal of this project is to assess the causes of 3He/4He variability on timescales of weeks to months in order to determine whether costly real-time helium isotope monitoring efforts would improve volcanic hazard forecasting. This study will produce magmatic 3He/4He time series records for three recent eruptions: the Lower Eastern Rift Zone of K?lauea in Hawaii (2018), Fagradalsfjall in Iceland (2021), and Cumbre Vieja in the Canary Islands (2021). Magmatic helium will be extracted from clinopyroxene and olivine mineral separates from lava samples spanning each eruption. Comparison of lava 3He/4He, major and trace element abundances, radiogenic isotopes, and remote sensing data?including ground deformation, seismicity, satellite-based SO2 emissions, and lava discharge rates?will establish whether magma recharge is principally responsible for 3He/4He variability. Alternatively, source heterogeneity or lithospheric helium assimilation might be dominant. By investigating multiple well-monitored eruptions, this project will potentially identify common causes of helium isotopic variability during volcanic eruptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy consumers may respond to the conflicting price and emission signals quite differently. Understanding the behavioral heterogeneity in energy use and its impact on sustainability of the electrical infrastructure is of critical importance to accelerating global energy system decarbonization. This project will establish an altruistic game theoretic framework to understand the interplay of an individual?s financial and environmental goals in shaping their energy use behaviors and to evaluate the impact of behavioral heterogeneity on system-level performances of the electric grid. The altruistic game framework models each energy consumer as a partially altruistic entity whose perceived cost is a weighted sum of his/her direct electricity cost and the social cost of energy-related carbon emission. The weighting factor characterizes an individual?s valuation of energy-related carbon emission, which in turn influences their energy use behaviors. Customer behavioral models will be developed from data collected through (1) online human subject tests with a custom designed demand response game and (2) sociotechnical experiments in a multi-family apartment complex within a historic African American community in downtown Oklahoma City.<br/><br/>Project goals include: (1) generation of new knowledge on residential customers? valuation of energy-related carbon emission and its impact on energy use behaviors; (2) development of a statistical behavioral model that characterizes how climate altruism correlates with socio-demographic variables; (3) synthesis of learning-based model predictive control strategies to enable automated demand response; (4) establishment of an altruistic game theoretic framework to facilitate impact analysis of behavioral heterogeneity on financial and environmental performances of the electric grid; and (5) design of distributed and privacy-preserving Nash equilibrium solution algorithms to accommodate distributed decision making for flexible load control in electricity markets. The project aims to increase public awareness of load flexibility and the associated environmental impact through a series of interrelated research, educational and outreach activities. The data-driven predictive control strategies are designed to unlock the residential flexibility potential through technological development, while the game theoretic framework supports design and assessment of demand-side carbon reduction technologies, programs and policies with socio-economic insights. The field experiment will directly engage 50 and indirectly affect more than 300 households in Oklahoma City providing technology solutions to and educating a population that does not usually engage in the early stages of technology adoption. Through collaboration with the community, developers and other partners, the project will demonstrate social drivers that affect large infrastructure systems, with the results potentially scalable and applicable on a national level in the residential sector. Through the education program development, this project will provide opportunities for K-12, underrepresented, undergraduate, and graduate students to acquire cross-disciplinary skills that are critical to addressing future engineering challenges.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CNSTAT's mission is to advance the quality of statistical information, contribute to the statistical policies and coordinating activities of the federal government, and help provide a forward-looking vision for the federal statistical system and national statistics more broadly in service of the public good. Established in 1972, CNSTAT harnesses knowledge and expertise across disciplines to provide trusted, independent advice to the nation on complex and challenging data and statistical issues in the 21st century. CNSTAT conducts much of its work through consensus studies carried out by panels of volunteer experts, and their reports often are used to inform policy and practice, establish a research agenda, or review specific statistical programs, measures, and infrastructure. CNSTAT also advances the conversation around important statistical and data issues by convening experts at public workshops and seminars to engage in focused discussion and explore new ideas and solutions for the benefit of the statistical and research community. CNSTAT?s flagship publication, Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency, is in its 7th edition and is updated every 4 years. The guidance in this publication helps protect the objectivity and credibility of federal statistics, educates the executive and legislative branches of government on the important public good provided by strong federal statistical agencies, and provides a code of ethics for the agencies.<br/><br/>CNSTAT's activities will contribute to improving the data and data infrastructure that are available for economic and social science research applied to important national needs, such as understanding the economy, technology and innovation, public health, education, welfare, and other areas. Relevant, objective, high-quality, timely, and accessible information produced by federal statistical agencies and offices is critical for informing decisions by policy makers in federal, state, and local governments as well as by private businesses, communities, and households. Interacting with NSF, federal statistical agencies, relevant programmatic and research agencies, and the social and economic sciences research community, CNSTAT will identify priority issues for study involving federal and national statistics, data, and statistical methods. Specific studies will continue to build a vision for a 21st century data infrastructure for federal statistics and social and economic research by exploring the implications of blending multiple data sources for major survey programs, data equity, and approaches for data governance and protecting privacy. Examples of work underway include integrating federal statistics on household income, wealth, and consumption and examining disclosure methods for protecting privacy in census and survey programs. CNSTAT also will update Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency for its 8th edition to be issued by early 2025.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recommendation algorithms employed by these platforms are designed to maximize views and clicks by finding engaging content, which in turn often ends up amplifying stories from dubious news sources, conspiracy theories, and unverified rumors. Older adults are a demographic increasingly turning to social media as a way to stay informed and are especially vulnerable to online misinformation.<br/><br/>This situation is especially concerning for partisan news consumers, who have a tendency to engage with information that conforms to their beliefs, regardless of its accuracy. The objective of this research is to build a simulated social media platform that will allow researchers to test more robust news recommendation algorithms designed to improve the news consumption of social media users while recommending content that is still relevant to them. The project will include studies of how older adults engage with the news on major social media platforms and whether alternative algorithms would improve the quality of their news consumption.<br/> <br/>This project is based on the observation that ranking the news by (either predicted or achieved) popularity creates a self-sustaining cycle that prioritizes pro-attitudinal information regardless of its quality. To break this loop, the project tests the hypothesis that prioritizing content that generates engagement in diverse audiences will improve the trustworthiness of recommendations. The project will explore the relevant dimensions under which the heterogeneity of an audience provides a good signal for news quality. The technical contributions will include a set of new regularization techniques to incorporate audience diversity of news sources into content recommendation methods, a quantitative evaluation of the effect of different re-ranking methods on the quality of the information diet of news consumers, especially older consumers, and a new experimental methodology on counterfactual ranking with high ecological validity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists still debate how tectonic plates recycling into Earth?s interior evolve over time as they descend. Advances in generating 'seismic tomographic images' of the Earth (analogous to medical CT scans) provide increasingly detailed images of these foundered plates (or 'slabs'), many of which are trapped about 300 to 600 miles below the Earth's surface. These images represent a present-day snapshot of the convecting mantle, and its evolution over time may be investigated through numerical modeling of the subduction process. This collaborative proposal combines recent developments in data-driven modeling and seismic tomography. Liu, Tromp, and their graduate students will explore different ways that subducted slabs get trapped in the mid mantle, with a focus on two competing hypotheses: that the slab is being pulled by one end which is stuck to a plate at the surface, or (2) that it is dragged along with horizontal flow of the surrounding mantle. This research will improve our understanding of how the Earth's mantle flows, and how it has flowed (and how the Earth's plates have moved) over tens of millions of years. Sophisticated software for modeling the slabs and imaging the mantle will be significantly improved and freely shared with other scientists via public websites.<br/><br/>Extensive fast seismic anomalies within the 500-1000 km mantle depth range are called stagnant slabs, and their origin has implications for continental tectonics and mantle dynamics. A commonly invoked mechanism is trench retreat, but the observed amount of retreat does not always match simulations. Another frequently made assumption is that slabs sink vertically, even though this can violate geological observations. A potential solution to these problems is to consider lateral mantle flow at mid-mantle depths, whose effect on slab stagnation remains poorly explored. Another complication is the inconsistency of tomographic images of the present-day configuration of stagnant slabs. The PI teams will collaboratively evaluate dynamic effects of trench retreat and lateral mantle flow on slab stagnation by designing 3D spherical Earth models through sequential data assimilation (SDA) and comparing the results with improved tomographic images using full-waveform inversion (FWI) with source encoding. The SDA modeling approach is appropriate for testing key controlling parameters for slab stagnation while simultaneously considering many other natural complexities. The improved FWI method increases seismic resolution significantly at upper-to-mid mantle depths, where stagnant slabs reside. Through a set of SDA models that test the available range of trench motion histories at different geographic locations implemented in both regional- and global-scale simulations, the teams will quantify the respective contributions of trench retreat and lateral mantle flow on the formation of observed stagnant slabs. Ultimately, this exercise will generate new insight into subduction dynamics and the associated tectonic records.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these RNA molecules then act as messengers that shuttle instructional blueprints to enable proper cellular function. The informational content encoded by RNA is amplified by the process of splicing, which enables the creation of dozens of different RNA molecules from a single gene sequence. The process of splicing is very complex, with one of the largest molecular complexes and many auxiliary factors working together to coordinate the precise levels and compositions of messenger RNAs. This intricacy opens the door for noise and errors in splicing that may comprise a substantial fraction of RNA output in a cell. While quality control mechanisms to check for and correct such errors have been identified over the last decade, less is known about how often these errors occur and why certain erroneous RNAs escape detection and removal. This project will use novel genomics and computational tools to identify directly and quantify erroneously spliced RNAs, gaining a better understanding of the regulation of proper RNA synthesis for cellular function. More broadly, the project aims to teach the cross-cutting skills of biological data analysis to up and coming researchers and educators by (1) hosting Worcester area undergraduates for a combined summer research and outreach experience in computational biology and (2) facilitating an enrichment program at UMass Chan Medical School for Worcester Public School science teachers.<br/><br/>For decades, the process of mRNA splicing was thought to be highly efficient, with little opportunity for deviation outside of regulated alternative splicing decisions. This idea led to a widespread perspective that all alternative mRNA isoforms must be regulated and, potentially, have biological function. Recently, however, researchers have identified pervasive, non-canonical splice site choice, including those at low-fidelity spliceosome binding sequences. These discoveries suggest that there is widespread error and cryptic splice site usage by mRNA splicing mechanisms, with unexplored roles for stochastic, biological noise in shaping metazoan transcriptome diversity. This project will use high-throughput sequencing of nascent RNA to track splicing intermediates through cellular compartments, creating a catalog of cryptic splice sites and examining genetic and biochemical features associated with these events. These studies will provide insight into how and when undesirable splicing products escape or are pruned by mRNA quality control mechanisms. Leveraging this catalog, a statistical model will be built to enable a predictive understanding of cryptic splice site usage and employ gene editing tools to test predictions from this model. The long-term research goal of this project is to define what constitutes noise in mRNA splicing and use these studies to redefine the mRNA splicing code.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This branch of behavioral economics, behavioral game theory, focuses on how people form expectations in strategic environments about the anticipated behavior of other individuals. This project will experimentally investigate the ?dirty faces game?, a workhorse example of a strategic environment where individuals can observe some actions by other players in the game that enable them to make inferences leading to more informed decisions. This is a simple but illustrative game that models situations where people update their beliefs and make decisions based on others? past behavior, such as choosing a restaurant or purchasing a new product by reading reviews by other people. Classical theory about behavior in games, based on assumptions of perfect rationality, makes behaviorally implausible predictions in this game. Relaxing the assumption of perfect rationality leads to drastically different predictions about behavior in the dirty faces game, which makes it an ideal test bed for a new ?dynamic cognitive hierarchy theory? (DCH) that predicts that, in dirty faces games, players will generally behave differently under two different conventional experimental protocols (direct response vs. strategy method), while the standard theory does not predict any behavioral difference. This project designs two experiments to detect the behavioral differences predicted by DCH in these games. A long-run goal of this project is not only to test the theory, but also to provide insights to policy designs that take account of cognitive limitations. Armed with improved theoretical models, policy makers can design more cognitively robust auctions, tax schemes, regulations, and other mechanisms to improve economic performance. <br/><br/>The dirty faces game is a strategic environment where each individual within a group of individuals has either a dirty or a clean face and can see all other players? faces but not their own faces. Over a sequence of decision periods, each individual can take an action that provides some information about the faces they see, and the ultimate goal of each individual is to learn their own face type from observing the others? actions. At the beginning of the game, an honest announcement is made by an observer about whether or not there is at least one dirty face. From the standard game-theoretic perspective, players will eventually learn whether their face is dirty or clean. Moreover, the extensive and strategic form representations of this game are strategically equivalent and make the same classical predictions. However, from the psychological perspective, the mental processes are completely different---in the strategic form representation, players make inferences based on hypothetical events while in the extensive form representation, players can make statistical inferences based on observed behavior. In a two-person dirty faces game, equilibrium theory predicts players will know their face type within two periods---regardless of the payoffs and the representations (extensive form vs. strategic form). Specifically, DCH predicts both the payoff structure and game-form representation will jointly affect behavior: (1) players will behave closer to the equilibrium in the extensive form representation if they are sufficiently impatient and payoffs are sufficiently low; and (2) the representation effect exists depends on the number of decision periods (horizon). Experiment 1 uses a 2x2 design where the representations (extensive vs. strategic form) and the payoffs (high vs. low) are systematically varied. Experiment 2 manipulates the horizon of the game. DCH predicts when the horizon of the game is shorter, the representation effect detected in Experiment 1 will vanish.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a demand for high-throughput quality control systems in manufacturing plants to further increase production efficiencies and reduce production costs. In addition, valuable feedback provided by in-line quality control systems may enable optimization of the manufacturing processes to minimize defects and provide high-quality products. Terahertz imaging offers unique functionalities for non-destructive evaluation of various industrial products. Teraherz frequencies also offer higher resolution imaging than radio frequencies and they can penetrate through many opaque materials at visible and infrared frequencies. Compared to ultrasound imaging, terahertz imaging does not require any coupler and can enable a non-contact evaluation. Terahertz waves also do not pose health hazards, unlike X-rays. Although these unique capabilities have been known for a long time, terahertz quality control systems are not yet widely utilized in manufacturing plants due to the absence of high-performance terahertz cameras capable of producing large-pixel-count three-dimensional (3D) images with a high frame rate.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to address the technological limitations of using terehertz cameras in high throughput manufacturing through a cross-disciplinary research, education, development, and commercialization partnership between the university, industry, and federal laboratories. This university-industry partnership seeks to develop and assess a terahertz camera for high-speed and high-sensitivity quality control in industrial production settings. The proposed camera utilizes plasmonic nanoantenna arrays to address the main challenges of conventional terahertz detectors for use in a multi-pixel terahertz imaging systems: low signal-to-noise ratio operation and small device active area, which requires complex optics to be scaled to large arrays. The proposed work may extend the scope and potential uses of terahertz technology for non-destructive quality control of various products in industrial manufacturing settings, which were not possible before due to the low throughput, low sensitivity, and the bulky nature of conventional terahertz scanner systems. While the developed hardware and data analysis software provide a high-performance, compact scanner for non-invasive material characterization and inspection, field tests and partnerships provide a deep understanding of the critical customer needs in real-world field settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biofilms can cause severe problems, including medical infections, fouling, and clogging in industrial applications. In contrast, biofilms play beneficial roles in wastewater treatment and microbial fuel cells. Scientists have been able to characterize the chemical components of biofilms but don?t know yet how an active, self-renewable, and self-healing material emerges from these components and their interactions. How can scientists use their vast knowledge of man-made polymers to understand these natural polymers? Are there new physical mechanisms to be discovered in the way bacteria build their biofilm communities? To answer these questions, this project aims to reveal the secrets of how biofilms derive mechanical properties from their individual components by integrating state-of-the-art mechanical measurement, single-cell imaging, and computer simulations. Through these fundamental studies, scientists can design better strategies that either eliminate harmful biofilms or use beneficial biofilms to create useful structures. By integrating multiple disciplines, this project will train a diverse group of students in the areas of biology, physics, materials science, and engineering, and prepare them for the next-generation workforce. The educational objectives of the project will be realized through curriculum development, undergraduate research opportunities, and K-12 outreach programs, with special efforts to involve underrepresented students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Biofilms are surface-attached communities of bacteria embedded in a matrix made of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The overarching goal of this project is to integrate state-of-the-art mechanical measurement, single-cell imaging, mutagenesis, computer simulations, and soft matter theory to address how, at different time and length scales, bacterial cells build communities with emerging mechanical properties. Specifically, the three research objectives are to (i) establish EPS as associative polymers crosslinked by matrix proteins, (ii) reveal the contribution of bacterial cells to biofilm mechanics, and (iii) measure the development of biofilm mechanics and heterogeneity at the single-cell level. These objectives are accomplished via experiments involving rheological testing, high-resolution imaging, protein biochemistry, bacterial genetics, and multiscale modeling. The broader impacts of this work are to help produce a diverse STEM-capable workforce by incorporating central concepts addressed in this project into education and outreach activities that expose and engage students in biology, materials science, physics, and engineering. The education and outreach activities center on the following three objectives: (i) expanding the Pathways to Science program for local high school students, (ii) incorporating research findings into the curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate courses, and (iii) providing research experiences to underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Basic motions in the living word are also chiral: bacteria swing their flagella like a boat propeller, and the microtubules in cells are rotating while sliding apart. A fundamental question to ask is how chiral activity in a chiral world produces a large range of interesting structures, dynamics, and mechanics of the biological world. To answer this question, the research team will develop and systematically investigate a new model system called chiral living liquid crystals. The system is composed of biocompatible liquid crystals and bacteria swimmers that self-propel through helical motion, allowing a wide range of experiments to be done in a controlled way. The project aims to reveal the underlying mechanisms of a hierarchy of dynamics, ranging from how individual bacteria motion is affected by chiral environments, to how chiral systems respond to chiral stresses. The research aspects of the project are accompanied by an extensive scope of educational and outreach activities, including educating schoolteachers with optics experiments, helping them setting up new STEM demos for K-12 students, improving undergraduate students? problem-solving skills with course-based research experiences, preparing advanced undergraduates for summer research with mini-courses, and mentoring graduate students from a diverse background and underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>Technical abstract: <br/>This study aims to understand the multi-level dynamics in active matter with chiral nematic order. Active matter is far from thermodynamic equilibrium by constant energy consumption at the level of individual constituent particles that drives their locomotion.

In this proposal, the team will investigate a new symmetry, the chiral active nematic, using the chiral living liquid crystal as a model system. The system is a mixture of chiral liquid crystals with swimming bacteria. By independently controlling the key physical parameters such as chirality of the host, the activity of the bacteria, and boundary condition of the confinement using standard liquid crystals and biological techniques, the team will investigate and understand dynamics at multiple levels, from individual motion of a chiral swimmer navigating through chiral environments, to global patterns and macroscopic properties generated by collective injection of chiral and achiral stress. The team will also further study the effect of confinement and understand how geometric and topological constraints further shape the dynamics of the chiral active nematics.<br/>Completion of the project will not only answer a cascade of questions in biology across scales, but also enable new design mechanisms of autonomous materials, such as new bio-mechanical hybrids that harness active particles for useful functions.

Though it is only 3% of the total ocean it takes up 10% of the carbon dioxide we add to the atmosphere every year. Though the Arctic has always had a permanent ice cap, it is shrinking in size and by the year 2040 the permanent summer ice cap will be gone. This implies that there will be an increased intensity in the amount of ice that melts each year and there is little known about how the melting ice will alter Arctic surface water chemistry. This study will sample Arctic Sea ice, snow, and brine to map its chemistry profiles in the eastern Arctic with the goal of making better predictions in the future Arctic environment as the Arctic climate changes. The main focus is on the ice profiles of boron and salinity which have a constant ratio in the open ocean, but this ratio may shift in the marginal ice zone at salinities that are less than 30 g/kg and are freshened by melt. This project will also create lessons that show how we use chemistry to do this work and understand climate.<br/><br/>This project joins the Atmospheric rivers and the onset of sea ice melt (ARTofMELT) Expedition on the I/B Oden in May June 2023 to conduct sampling in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), including ice cores and brine. The goal is to discern the boron to salinity ratios of these unique systems and their impact on total alkalinity and uptake of atmospheric CO2. The objectives include; 1) to determine the boron to salinity (B/S) ratios in Arctic sea-ice and brine, 2) to determine the carbonate system parameters in Arctic sea-ice and brine, 3) to compare the profiles of all above parameters in annual vs multi-year ice and brine, 4) to evaluate changes in these parameters over the ice-melt process at a given ice station, and 5) to assess the impact on B/S ratios and total alkalinity in adjacent meltwaters of the MIZ. Intellectual Merit: This study contributes to biogeochemical, physical oceanographic, meteorological and climate change research. The results of the B/S ratios will provide important corrections to total alkalinity analyses in polar regions and improve parameterizations in future Arctic CO2 uptake estimates and modeling efforts. Most notably, this study will provide the first ever boron to salinity profiles in annual ice in this region and the first multiyear ice profiles in any region. In addition, ice and brine profiles of other biogeochemically relevant parameters will be generated. It is expected that the results of this study will provide new insights on the future biogeochemistry of the warming Arctic and Arctic CO2 uptake. Broader Impacts: Ten paired videos (from the cruise) and lesson plans will be generated that target high school and undergraduate chemistry students based on chemical concepts used in this research (equilibrium constants, acidity constants, etc.). Following the cruise these will be posted on the project webpage and shared with PBS Learning Media and other educational resource platforms. All lessons will introduce the theme of Arctic ice loss. Researchers will also continue to work with senior illustration students to create Arctic sea ice retreat themed projects (books, posters, short animations) for the broader public. This project will create opportunities for two female graduate students, one of which will have the opportunity for international collaboration in Boron analysis in Korea, and at least four undergraduate students from minority groups through an REU program and the FirstGen program at University of Connecticut.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This implies the need for efficient and dense data storage. A multi-level cell (MLC) is a memory cell capable of storing more than a single bit of information in a single device, and thus can be used for dense efficient storage.  However in conventional computing systems, data stored in memory needs to get transferred to computing units for processing, resulting in excessive power dissipation and delay.  Therefore, there exists a need for a computing paradigm that limits data movement, does efficient data transfer and handles the challenges associated with MLC memories. This project investigates the incorporation of emerging technology designs into existing Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) based computing systems to satisfy the above-mentioned requirements. Learnings and insights developed from this project will be incorporated into computer-engineering undergraduate and graduate courses. Investigator will also involve students from underrepresented groups and undergraduate students in this project. <br/><br/>Investigator chooses an emerging device technology called ferroelectric field-effect transistor  (FeFET), and the project will focus on two specific research tasks. The first task will develop circuit components amenable to traditional single-level cell and dense multi-level cell (MLC) memory architectures.  MLC cells store multiple bits by exploiting a particular device property and MLC data to binary conversion requires complex peripheral circuits.  This project aims to design compact flexible peripheral circuits by leveraging the threshold voltage programmability of FeFETs. In the second task, investigator will utilize the structural features of FeFET to design flexible multi-directional data access memories and caches. Applications exhibiting row-column directional preferences such as matrix operations and database operations will especially benefit from a flexible directional access system as it limits the unnecessary data transfer from memory to processing units. Investigator will also explore the reuse of flexible peripherals for in-situ computing to further limit the data transfer and to increase the computing efficiency.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Foundations of Emerging Technology (FET) program of CISE/CCF Division, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research on the role of chemicals in the behavior of animals in the ocean has focused mostly on a small number of organisms, primarily larger, ?charismatic? organisms, leaving most species completely ignored. Small organisms are by far the most abundant and diverse and have major ecological importance. The so-called ?smaller majority? even includes larval or juvenile forms of some larger species. Yet, their small size has left them particularly neglected. Despite decades of research on the importance of chemicals in the behavior of marine organisms, the sophistication of testing apparatus for small marine organisms in particular has changed little and lags far behind systems used for similar studies on insects. The traditional ?set up? for marine studies involves using a two-choice channel flume, which provides a variety of limitations and areas of potential bias. In insect studies, the use of airflow ?olfactometers? has eliminated many of these limitations. However, adapting these devices for use on marine organisms is complicated because of the unique properties of water compared to air. We have assembled a team of experts in the fields of hydraulic engineering, sensory biology, and marine biology to develop a device like those used for insect studies that can be used on marine organisms. The goal of this project is to test this new device, which stands to fundamentally change the way we study the behavioral response of marine organisms to chemicals.<br/><br/>This project aims to validate a newly adapted olfactometer for use in research on behavioral responses to chemicals in small, aquatic organisms. Testing of the olfactometer will be conducted at the University of Texas?s Marine Science Institute, and the Keys Marine Laboratory, both of which provide modern marine research facilities and easy access to test organisms. Three organisms will be used to validate the olfactometer. These include Daphina spp., fish-parasitic gnathiid isopods, and juvenile stages of scleractinlan (stony) corals. All of these can be easily obtained and data on important chemical cues is already available for them. All organisms will be exposed to a test chemical within the olfactometer, and their behavior observed. The movement of the organism within the olfactometer will be recorded and analyzed using Ethovision XT software, allowing for a high volume of data to be collected, including data indicating attraction or avoidance of chemical stimuli. This research will help place marine researchers on a level playing field with terrestrial researchers by upgrading the toolkit for studies on the response to chemicals by small organisms in an ever-changing ocean<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists are debating how accurately such hotspot tracks record plate motion. During the formation of the Emperor chain paleomagnetic data show that the hotspot moved southward by ~10-15to its current location. This shift might be caused by movement of the hotspot. An alternate cause could be the shift of the Earth?s spin axis, or true polar wander (TPW). If TPW occurred, it should cause a consistent global shift: southward hotspot motion in the Pacific would be paired with northward hotspot motion in the Atlantic. This project will study volcanic rocks and sediments cored from Walvis Ridge during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 391 (December 2021-February 2022) to produce a record of paleolatitudes for comparison with Hawaii-Emperor paleolatitudes. The project supports several early career researchers.<br/><br/><br/>This project will analyze and publish studies of sediment and basalt core paleomagnetic data from IODP Expedition 391, with the object of developing a paleolatitude record for Walvis Ridge hotspot volcanoes for Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic. IODP Expedition 391 drilled four sites, three on the Cretaceous Valdivia Bank plateau and one on a Paleocene guyot. Previous studies from Emperor and Louisville seamounts in the Pacific Ocean have been influential in studies of hotspot geodynamics. Prior to Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean Drilling Program (DSDP/ODP) drilling of Emperor seamounts, hotspots were considered fixed mantle markers, defining plate motions by seamount age progressions. DSDP/ODP cores showed that northern Emperor guyots were formed ~15 farther north than the current Hawaiian hotspot. IODP Expedition 330 cored coeval Louisville guyots, finding insignificant latitudinal motion, concluding that hotspot motion is the preferred explanation for inter-hotspot motion. Consequently, other explanations for hotspot latitude changes are not currently favored. One such phenomenon is true polar wander (TPW), the coherent shift of the entire mantle relative to the spin axis. TPW has been deemed insignificant for the past ~100 Ma, even though it is occurring at present and it has occurred deeper in the past. Hawaii and Louisville paleolatitude data show a small amount of mutual southward motion. If this results from TPW, the Walvis Ridge, almost antipodal to Hawaii and Louisville, should show the opposite paleolatitude change. This project will produce paleolatitude data for the Walvis Ridge using Expedition 391 cores (with data from DSDP Legs 72 and 74). A major objective is to test the hypothesis of Late Cretaceous-early Cenozoic TPW. This project hypothesizes that observed paleolatitude shifts are a combination of TPW and mantle flow. The project addresses important geodynamical problems that ultimately reflect mantle structure and convection. This project supports three early career investigators. In addition, the two faculty on this project will recruit undergraduate student workers from under-represented groups for internships that will help them advance in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is growing evidence that Manganese also plays a critical role in maintaining algal growth and if found in low concentrations can play a role in limiting primary productivity. As algal growth is a major player in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, understanding what controls productivity increases our understanding of what role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle. This study proposes to study the algal processes that take up Manganese in Antarctic diatoms, one of the main primary producers in the region. Another aspect will be to understand how Zinc, a micronutrient with similar dynamics than Manganese, can inhibit its uptake. The PIs propose lab experiments with cultured diatoms isolated from the Southern Ocean to obtain answers to their questions on micronutrient dynamics and will compare results from those obtained with a diatom species isolated from temperate waters. The proposed research will benefit NSF?s goals of understanding life in cold environments and how they differ from other parts of the ocean. This project will support two first-time early career scientists and a female researcher in Earth Sciences. Two graduate students will also be supported, and scientific techniques used in this research will be shared at open houses sponsored by the academic institutions and with local summer schools. <br/>                                                                                                                          <br/>This proposal represents collaborative research to explore manganese (Mn) limitation in Antarctic diatoms by two early career investigators. Diatoms are central players in the Southern Ocean carbon cycle, where the micronutrient chemistry is fundamentally different from other oceans. The Southern Ocean is characterized by widespread low Mn, coupled with high zinc (Zn). High Zn levels are potentially toxic to diatoms as Zn can competitively inhibit Mn uptake and metabolism, compromising the ability of building critical cellular components, thus impacting the biological pump. Using culture experiments with a matrix of micronutrient treatments (Mn, Zn, Fe) and irradiances, and using physiological and transcriptomic approaches, along with biochemical principles, the Principal Investigators will address the central hypothesis (diatoms from the Southern Ocean possess physiological mechanisms to low Mn/high Zn) to quantify rates of uptake and transporter binding constants.  The transcriptomics approach will help to identify candidate genes that may provide Antarctic diatoms physiological mechanisms in low Mn/high Zn environment. The project does not require fieldwork but instead would make use of culture experiments with 4 diatom species (3 Antarctic, and 1 temperate). The proposed approach will also enable the goal of developing biomarker(s) for assessing Mn stress or Zn toxicity and results from the physiological experiments will help parameterize models of micronutrient limitation in the Southern Ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Economic theories link the departure of behavior from the rational model of choice under uncertainty to the lack of decision confidence. The lack of decision confidence may arise, for instance, from individuals? uncertainty over their willingness to take risks. This research project will use economic theory and laboratory experiments to study how people make decisions between risky alternatives and how confident they are when they make their decisions. The results of this research project will help understand how people behave as a function of their level of decision confidence. A particular emphasis will be given to decisions between safe and risky alternatives, for which it will be possible to examine whether people tend to be more risk-averse or risk-seeking when unconfident. The researchers will also conduct laboratory experiments to study the importance of experience in decision-making. In particular, the researchers will study whether people who can familiarize themselves with the decision environment before making a decision tend to become more confident about their decisions and behave more rationally. This analysis will provide new insights into the design of policies aimed at promoting socially desirable behaviors by increasing the familiarity of the targeted population with the decision environment. Moreover, the researchers will also develop and implement a novel methodology to estimate individuals? willingness to take risks from incentivized experiments and relate this new measure to decision confidence. This novel approach may be used, for instance, by financial advisors to determine appropriate portfolio recommendations for their clients.<br/><br/>The researchers will conduct laboratory experiments to study failures of the independence axiom, to understand their relationship with decision confidence and experience, and to elicit risk aversion for individuals who may violate the independence axiom. To this end, subjects will make choices over monetary lotteries and declare on a scale from zero to 100 how confident they are about their choices. Moreover, to study whether experience can affect decision-making, a group of subjects will be asked to observe random draws of monetary prizes from some pairs of lotteries before answering these questions. The researchers will analyze the experimental data using the notion of expected utility core, which represents the greatest part of a preference relation that satisfies the independence axiom. Studying the expected utility core amounts to testing the implications of the independence axiom locally for every single choice. This local analysis will allow reevaluating the relevance of features of the choice environment traditionally associated with higher violations of the independence axiom, most notably the presence of a certain (i.e., probability 1) alternative. Moreover, it will shed new light on the role of decision confidence and experience in decision-making under risk. In particular, the project seeks to explore the correlation between decision confidence and violations of the independence axiom and under what circumstances experience can increase confidence and reduces independence violations. The lack of confidence can arise, for instance, from indecisiveness on the level of risk aversion. This project will formalize this intuition by developing a new methodology that exploits the expected utility core to estimate a set of possible levels of risk aversion, each captured by a different utility function. This novel approach allows for a general analysis of attitudes toward risk that is robust to model misspecification because it relies neither on expected utility nor on a specific alternative model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This two-day workshop is designed to attract STEM faculty, both K-12 and post-secondary, and research scholars in STEM teaching and student learning to present and learn about evidence-based practices and methodology design to implement and effectively evaluate research driven STEM education practices. Following the workshop, further evaluation of what will be learned and subsequently implemented, including identifying organizational barriers to change, will be obtained through surveys of conference participants. Materials shared during the workshop will be made publicly available for use. <br/><br/>The workshop, Pipelines to Pathways: Humanizing Diversity in STEM, will have an Implementation, Research, and Evaluation focus designed specifically at improving the educational pathway of students currently underserved and underrepresented in STEM. Implementation sessions will focus on theoretically driven, classroom-based practices geared toward humanization of broadening participation in STEM, and mentorship practices designed to address socio-emotional development as a means towards broadening participation. Research sessions will include emerging theoretical and philosophical work that has potential to yield the formation of evidenced-based/research-based practices for broadening participation in STEM. Evaluation sessions will involve the examination of the current state of evaluation and what needs to be directly addressed to move forward with sustainable changes.  Pipeline to Pathways will have subtopics in the following major areas: (1) Theory Driven Mentoring Practices, (2) Identifying and Mitigating Bias, (3) Evidenced-Based Models for Broadening Participation in STEM education, (4) Humanizing Research Methods (qualitative, intersectionality approaches, etc.), and (5) Assessment/Evaluation innovation for broadening participation in STEM. Through these efforts, the project hopes to shift the thinking associated within the use of commoditized language specific to STEM broadening participation efforts, and in doing so, shift how individual scholars and their institutions approach this topic. The commoditization of students limits the STEM field?s ability to humanize the student experience which inadvertently creates barriers to effective mentorship adoption, treating students as metrics/numbers, potentially impeding authentic meaningful inclusivity into STEM disciplines. A new language can contribute to students being able to actualize and enhance their professional future ?sense of self.? This conference has the potential to contribute to new knowledge in stimulating conversations from an interdisciplinary approach to STEM education issues related to broadening participation by actively training individuals in humanization techniques?cultural competence, cultural awareness, mentorship effectiveness, and methodology that better aligns with such practices.<br/><br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

Around Antarctica, these seafloor sediments are influenced by an ice sheet that grinds and transports sediments from the continent?s interior into the surrounding ocean. Since the Last Glacial Maximum (about 20,000 years ago) when the ice sheet extended hundreds to thousands of kilometers seaward, ice has retreated inland to the configuration we observe today and left behind signatures of its growth and decline, as well as indicators of ocean change, in the seafloor sediments. Ongoing glacial and ocean processes are reflected in the characteristics of contemporary sediments, whereas older sediments beneath the seafloor offer a longer temporal perspective of changes to the ice sheet and surrounding ocean. Using data generated from archived sediment cores that are predominantly housed in the Antarctic Core Collection at Oregon State University, we aim to confirm if recent sediments clearly reflect the specific instrumental and historical field-based observations of ocean and glacial change seen in different regions of Antarctica. These modern changes will be placed into context with those recorded by sediments deposited on the seafloor hundreds to thousands of years ago.<br/><br/>This project will explore interlinked physical, biological, and geochemical properties of seafloor sediments to address the influence of glacial and oceanographic processes on ice-proximal marine sedimentation during the 20th and 21st centuries and since the Last Glacial Maximum, with a focus on sediment fluxes, meltwater drainage, ice-rafted debris deposition, and radiocarbon chronologies. We will integrate multi-proxy analyses to interrogate the seafloor sediment record around Antarctica, targeting regions offshore of relatively fast-flowing and fast-changing glacial systems today and regions offshore of slower flowing, more stable (i.e., unchanging or relatively minimally changing) parts of the ice sheet.

It will identify limitations of the current state-of-the-art in AI for existing scientific grand challenge problems, and lay out the strategies for designing building blocks for translational use-inspired research that will have transformative and long-lasting scientific and societal impact. In particular, there is a tremendous opportunity for (1) advancing frontiers of AI that are driven by the unique needs of scientific problems, and (2) taking advances made in the context of specific scientific domains to many other domains.  In addition, challenges unique to scientific problems also offer an opportunity to advance AI, leading to a virtuous cycle of fundamental AI research driving scientific discovery, and use-inspired challenges in scientific problems advancing the frontiers of AI.

While academic researchers have traditionally been the center of innovation and research, industry is pouring significant resources into developing solutions to many of these same problems. The Data Institute Conference will draw leaders from industry and academia to explore the latest theoretical advances and technological applications in data science. The conference aims to promote the next generation of cross-disciplinary research and offers educational and professional development opportunities to early-career data scientists from diverse backgrounds. The conference is designed to launch new research collaborations among academics and to build bridges between academia and advanced research groups from Bay Area industry and beyond. This conference will make an equally important impact to the greater scientific community with a focus on recruiting and increasing diversity in data science, with attendees who are not traditionally represented in STEM fields. <br/> <br/>Data science is a rapidly developing field with fluid boundaries but largely contains research areas from the statistical, mathematical, and computational sciences. This conference will bring together both junior and senior researchers from industry and academia to exchange ideas from recent advances to data science. There will be several invited and contributed talk tracks, including one in network analysis at which speakers will address many important questions on the estimation of graphical models, inference related to graphs, and applications of networks to neuroscience. Other tracks include practical issues and advances in experimentation and A/B testing; applications of machine learning to sports analytics; and precision healthcare. There will also be tracks devoted to the discussion of the societal impact of data science, including tracks on data privacy and artificial intelligence, the application of data science to public policy, and a panel discussion on data and algorithmic ethics. Most conferences in this space have attendees numbering in the thousands and are either very broad with dozens of parallel sessions or focused on a single topic in data science.

Planetary albedo is a composite quantity determined by the reflection of sunlight from the relatively dark and thus low albedo ocean surface, lighter and thus higher albedo land surfaces, and the even higher albedos of snow and ice covered surfaces.  Clouds add another layer of complexity as bright reflective clouds form intermittently over darker land and ocean.  The complexity of planetary albedo is a challenge for efforts to determine the warming effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) increases since warming can cause a decrease in albedo, say due to the replacement of high-albedo sea ice with lower albedo ocean surface, which in turn can substantially enhance the GHG warming.<br/><br/>Recent work shows that the albedos of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are uncannily close: the sunlight received in each hemisphere is the same averaged over the year, and the amount reflected back to space is 99.7 watts per square meter in the Southern Hemisphere and 99.6 in the Northern Hemisphere (the resulting planetary albedo is about 29%).  The sameness occurs despite the higher albedo of the Northern Hemisphere due to its larger land area, which yields a difference in hemispheric reflected sunlight of about 6 watts per square meter under clear skies. This difference must be compensated by clouds, and the work of Datseris and Stevens (2021) shows that the compensation is largely occurring over the middle- and high-latitude oceans, as the Southern Ocean is cloudier than the northern Pacific and Atlantic by about 11%.  Datseris and Stevens also show that while planetary albedo has decreased appreciably over the past two decades the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have seen equivalent reductions, thereby retaining their ""albedo symmetry"".  There is no theory for why clouds should compensate for surface albedo differences, and it is of course possible that the albedo symmetry of the recent record is a coincidence and not the result of a global-scale adjustment mechanism.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to determine if an adjustment mechanism exists and if so to develop a theory for it.  In addition to observational data from satellite missions and reanalysis products the work takes advantage of large ensembles of model simulations including simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and a recent perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) created using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM, the atmospheric component model of CESM, the Community Earth System Model).  Results from analysis of these models are used to design additional simulations created with CAM, CESM, and a simplified version of CESM in which the ocean component model is replaced by a thermodynamic ""slab"" which simulates ocean heat storage but not ocean circulation. The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the potentially large role that albedo changes could play in determining how much warming is caused by a given increase in GHG concentrations. A theory of albedo adjustment operating through cloud processes and on a global basis could provide valuable guidance in anticipating the magnitude of future climate change.  The project also provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future scientific work force in this research area.

Methane is an important greenhouse gas. Oceans are often viewed as having the potential to release large amounts of methane to the atmosphere with warming. However, current emissions of methane from the sea surface to the atmosphere are relatively low.  Local studies have shown that aerobic oxidation of methane in these natural waters helps to remove methane prior to emission.  However, estimating this removal has been challenging for two reasons.  First, methane oxidation measurements from different laboratories do not always agree.  Second, different national conditions change the rates of aerobic methane oxidation.  This project will solve these problems.  This work will help determine the global importance of this methane sink, predict how methane oxidation rates will change in the future, and establish measurement protocols for greater comparability of results.  Additionally, this project will engage a cohort of undergraduate students.  These students will be taught oceanographic research methods centered around this project. Also, they will be coached on how to develop their own scientific interests, hypotheses, and experimental plans.  Then, these students will be given the opportunity to join the research cruise associated with this work where they will enact their own experimental plans.  Past participants of this program have contributed to 5 scientific publications, and 12 students have gone on to highly competitive graduate programs.  <br/><br/>This project will be accomplished through a combination of systematic laboratory experiments and environmental measurements.  Investigations on the US Great Lakes and at sea along the US Atlantic Margin will be conducted to evaluate the steady-state and non-steady-state chemical kinetics of aerobic methane oxidation.  This project will test the hypothesis that water temperature and methane concentration are the dominant variables governing aerobic methane oxidation with other variables of dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations contributing secondary influences.

Both nucleic acids and proteins have the ability to encode information and perform specific functions, yet they each benefit from unique advantages with regard to designability and breadth of function. To date, all polymers seeking to mimic these natural biopolymers only take advantage of a single code ? either nucleic acid or protein. The proposed work explores novel polymers that are able to simultaneously encode both nucleic acid and protein information, in turn providing greater control over structure and function. Specifically, the research will explore the uptake of these polymer assemblies into cells and their ability to bind and release small molecules such as therapeutics. Additionally, the proposal will explore new modes for controlling structure that mimic those found in nature. This research project will span the fields of materials science, chemistry, and molecular biology, providing undergraduate and graduate students with a highly interdisciplinary training experience involving the use of cutting-edge techniques. This project will also contribute to public scientific literacy through a science communication project implemented in a course taught by the PI, as well as through the PI?s participation as a judge and student mentor for the high school International Science Fair.<br/><br/>Technical: <br/><br/>The overarching research goal of this NSF proposal is to explore ?bilingual biopolymers? as a new class of programmable materials capable of interpreting both peptide and nucleic acid information codes to direct assembly, disassembly, and guest release. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) serves as an ideal scaffold for these polymers, as it has a peptide-like backbone that can be functionalized with amino acid side chains, and is able to bind sequence-specifically to DNA and RNA. Using prior NSF support, this team generated and characterized ?bilingual? PNA sequences having an amphiphilic amino acid code to drive assembly into micelles. They demonstrated stimuli-responsive disassembly in the presence of a complementary DNA or RNA sequence, as well as cell permeability and the ability to sequester hydrophobic guest molecules. Building upon these exciting results, the proposed experiments aim to: (1) Evaluate the effect of side chain structure and pattern on assembly and small-molecule binding capabilities; (2) Investigate the effect of micelle size and surface properties on cellular uptake and small-molecule release; (3) Expand the scope of stimuli-responsive control of assembly via chemically addressable cross-links. The broader impacts of the proposed research include activities aimed at improving undergraduate education and public scientific literacy, and the potential to benefit public health through the development of improved diagnostics and drug delivery platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenges posed by the increasing complexity of forward models and dynamical systems in inverse problems and data assimilation can be mitigated by the development of computational methods that are derivative-free and require few model evaluations. This project is concerned with two important families of cost-efficient, derivative-free algorithms: ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization. Rigorous mathematical analyses will established which will contribute to the understanding of these algorithms, determining their potential and limitations in high-dimensional inverse problems and data assimilation. Methodological contributions will focus on the design of novel algorithms and computational frameworks to merge derivative-free optimization with machine learning. Numerical implementations of these new algorithms will be made publicly available. Beyond inverse problems and data assimilation, the principal investigator will also investigate the potential of ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization in large-scale scientific computing problems where gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute, and in data science applications where privacy is a concern. A central component of the project is the integration of education and research. The principal investigator will engage in the new Preceptor Program, a collaborative initiative to build data science curricula at minority-serving community colleges in Chicago. This program will create pathways for community college students from underrepresented groups to transfer to the University of Chicago. In addition, the investigator will complete two books aimed at graduate and upper-level undergraduate students that will incorporate topics drawn from this project.  Mentorship of graduate students and development of graduate-level courses is a core part of the project.<br/><br/>The project will consist of two interrelated research thrusts on ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization. Ensemble Kalman methods are popular algorithms in the geophysical  sciences, where they are often used with a small ensemble size to keep the number of model evaluations low. The first research thrust of the project will develop a new comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of ensemble Kalman methods that rigorously explains when and why a small ensemble size may suffice. Previous analyses have focused instead on large ensemble asymptotics that cannot explain the practical success of these algorithms with a small ensemble size. Methodological contributions of this research thrust will be focused on deriving principled frameworks to blend ensemble Kalman methods and machine learning, as well as novel regularization techniques based on hierarchical formulations of inverse problems and data assimilation.  The proposed non-asymptotic theory will establish ensemble size requirements for these new methods. The second research thrust of the project will advance Bayesian optimization in graphical and manifold settings by developing new geometry-aware kernels, acquisition functions, and convergence guarantees. The PI will use tools from computational harmonic analysis to obtain approximation guarantees for stochastic processes on manifolds and tools from information theory to obtain regret bounds under mis-specified models. Finally, the investigator will explore synergistic ways to combine ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization, leveraging the strengths of both families of algorithms to mitigate their weaknesses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Around Antarctica, these seafloor sediments are influenced by an ice sheet that grinds and transports sediments from the continent?s interior into the surrounding ocean. Since the Last Glacial Maximum (about 20,000 years ago) when the ice sheet extended hundreds to thousands of kilometers seaward, ice has retreated inland to the configuration we observe today and left behind signatures of its growth and decline, as well as indicators of ocean change, in the seafloor sediments. Ongoing glacial and ocean processes are reflected in the characteristics of contemporary sediments, whereas older sediments beneath the seafloor offer a longer temporal perspective of changes to the ice sheet and surrounding ocean. Using data generated from archived sediment cores that are predominantly housed in the Antarctic Core Collection at Oregon State University, we aim to confirm if recent sediments clearly reflect the specific instrumental and historical field-based observations of ocean and glacial change seen in different regions of Antarctica. These modern changes will be placed into context with those recorded by sediments deposited on the seafloor hundreds to thousands of years ago.<br/><br/>This project will explore interlinked physical, biological, and geochemical properties of seafloor sediments to address the influence of glacial and oceanographic processes on ice-proximal marine sedimentation during the 20th and 21st centuries and since the Last Glacial Maximum, with a focus on sediment fluxes, meltwater drainage, ice-rafted debris deposition, and radiocarbon chronologies. We will integrate multi-proxy analyses to interrogate the seafloor sediment record around Antarctica, targeting regions offshore of relatively fast-flowing and fast-changing glacial systems today and regions offshore of slower flowing, more stable (i.e., unchanging or relatively minimally changing) parts of the ice sheet. This work will leverage the application of new techniques and knowledge to legacy sediment cores that NSF has invested greatly in collecting and archiving.

In this Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering (BRITE) Pivot  project, volatile organic compounds produced by the microbes in aged concrete, both undamaged and undergoing deterioration, will be analyzed. Cementitious materials are the most used building materials in the entire world; twice as much as all other materials combined. These materials can undergo premature deterioration and reacting to that as quickly as possible can mean a successful remediation plan that ensures the intended lifespan. This is a key part of meeting increasingly demanding sustainability goals. Identifying volatile organic compound biomarkers of this material?s health will lay the groundwork for the development of sensors that can provide early warnings of deterioration, enabling more effective remediation/repair strategies. Microbes may also be sensitive to environmental stress (e.g., climate change), and a sensor based on microbial volatile organic compounds could be used not only monitor infrastructure health, but to also provide data to detect environmental stressors relevant to other fields.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is for the PI to pivot to the field of volatilomics for disease detection and bring back new quantitative tools for diagnosing deterioration in the abiotic environment of concrete. Volatile organic compounds metabolites, an oft unused resource of chemical information that are produced by concrete-associated microbial communities, will be used to detect and characterize concrete deterioration. Scanning electron microscopy with energy disperse x-ray analysis, expansion measurements, and visual observations will be used to confirm deterioration mechanisms identified using volatilomics. Volatiles will be analyzed using two-dimensional gas chromatography?time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To determine if the volatile organic compound metabolites can distinguish between different deterioration mechanisms, the data gathered will be analyzed using machine learning (Random Forest).

Despite this immense potential, there are significant gaps in the theoretical understanding of some of the most foundational aspects which are crucial for these modern applications. These applications pose complex requirements, such as memory or space constraints on the learning algorithm and robustness of the learned model to changes in the data distribution.  Classical learning theory, however, mainly focuses on more traditionally examined metrics, such as the running time of the learning algorithm and the average error that the model obtains on a test set. Therefore, the goal of this project is to re-examine some of the foundations of learning theory and develop a theory that takes into account modern requirements such as memory efficiency and robustness. In doing this, the project will not only help build a rich algorithmic suite to meet these requirements in practice and hence significantly increase the scope of current applications; it will also develop insights that can guide the understanding of new theoretical angles on learning and computation.<br/><br/>In more detail, the project?s objective is to understand the fundamental limits and trade-offs of what is achievable under these contemporary requirements and use this understanding to develop new algorithmic frameworks to meet the requirements. To achieve this, the project will examine if there are inherent trade-offs between the available memory and the best achievable convergence rate for a number of fundamental learning and optimization problems. The project aims to leverage these trade-offs to identify suitable classes of problems where it is possible to achieve the convergence rate of memory-intensive algorithms but with much less memory usage. Finally, the project aims to establish a principled framework that goes beyond the classical training/test paradigm to understand the generalization abilities of learned models, and to develop a toolbox that effectively addresses modern robustness demands. To aid in the translation of theoretical results to practical settings, open-source software will be developed, and algorithms will be evaluated on benchmark datasets.

A key factor affecting biodiversity is the number of species that can live in the same place at the same time. However, not all species can co-exist, and the rules regulating co-existence are not completely understood. This project investigates the factors governing the co-occurrence of closely related wildflower species in habitats throughout eastern North America. Closely related species are likely to have similar traits and similar ecological needs. On one hand, similarities may result in close relatives being more likely to live in the same environments. On the other hand, similarities may cause close relatives to compete or interfere with one another during growth and reproduction, making it difficult for close relatives to co-occur in the long term. The long-term view is important. Relatively recently, glaciers in eastern North America forced species to migrate southward. This migration changed species? geographic distributions after glaciation and likely increased co-occurrence. This research will improve our understanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes affect co-existence and biodiversity. The project will provide broad training for students. Public outreach will include creation of a museum display on biodiversity and species co-existence.  <br/><br/>The research team will locate and sample from multiple populations and herbaria records of 24 native Lobelia species across their ranges in eastern North America to document where they live and how often they co-occur.

Investigations will include determination of species relationships via phylogenomics, key components of each species? niche via microsite and trait characterization, and the degree to which species interfere with one another?s growth or reproduction. Whether interference affects their likelihood of co-existing will be determined using field measurements of reproductive traits, experimental crosses, and transplant experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to improve the battery life and privacy of wearable devices, enabling long-term monitoring for both personal health and medical conditions. The system applies to a variety of bio-parametric signals which could be used for general consumer health monitoring that informs users of their own health, motivating lifestyle changes, and detecting emergency conditions. The system also has applications in intensive care to improve the comfort of patients that are being monitored in the long-term by removing wires while maintaining a long lifetime. Monitoring of specific signals such as stress, emotion, sound, and motion can provide utility for military applications including soldier monitoring in the battlefield, soldier training, and post-traumatic diseases. The system could also be customized for specialized athletic sport monitoring or even for specialized medical conditions. For example, patients with chronic conditions like stroke recurrence could benefit from heart monitoring, temperature monitoring can predict immune response to viruses so patients can get treatment, and respiration tracking can predict the risk of an asthma attack. Overall, the system has the potential to improve health monitoring for the general public, and the ability for patients with chronic conditions to get treatment in advance of critical events.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an intelligent wireless sensor network platform for extended human health monitoring through in-sensor machine learning. The technology uses emerging brain-inspired Hyperdimensional Computing, which is characterized by very low computational complexity, to minimize net power consumption improving network lifetime, security, and privacy. The technology enables integration of a large number of low-power distributed sensors that wirelessly communicate intelligently detected events/classes. Current systems either transmit data to another device for processing, which is very costly in terms of power, or attempt to process locally with algorithms that are more expensive than the amount saved by reducing transmission. To solve these problems, this project utilizes the emerging brain-inspired Hyperdimensional Computing paradigm to minimize net power consumption of in-sensor computation. This paradigm represents information with fully binary vectors and thus the encoding of data patterns involves only simple binary operators such as right shifts, making it extremely computationally simple. The representation can be used for classification tasks through encoding training data into a prototype vector per class and then, during inference, comparing similarly encoded input data against the trained prototypes to find the closest class. Using this technology, this project can significantly improve sensor lifetime and also provide security and privacy due to the local computation. This project aims to develop a platform that takes advantage of these various elements for long-term monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists are debating how accurately such hotspot tracks record plate motion. During the formation of the Emperor chain paleomagnetic data show that the hotspot moved southward by ~10-15to its current location. This shift might be caused by movement of the hotspot. An alternate cause could be the shift of the Earth?s spin axis, or true polar wander (TPW). If TPW occurred, it should cause a consistent global shift: southward hotspot motion in the Pacific would be paired with northward hotspot motion in the Atlantic. This project will study volcanic rocks and sediments cored from Walvis Ridge during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 391 (December 2021-February 2022) to produce a record of paleolatitudes for comparison with Hawaii-Emperor paleolatitudes. The project supports several early career researchers.<br/><br/><br/>This project will analyze and publish studies of sediment and basalt core paleomagnetic data from IODP Expedition 391, with the object of developing a paleolatitude record for Walvis Ridge hotspot volcanoes for Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic. IODP Expedition 391 drilled four sites, three on the Cretaceous Valdivia Bank plateau and one on a Paleocene guyot. Previous studies from Emperor and Louisville seamounts in the Pacific Ocean have been influential in studies of hotspot geodynamics. Prior to Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean Drilling Program (DSDP/ODP) drilling of Emperor seamounts, hotspots were considered fixed mantle markers, defining plate motions by seamount age progressions. DSDP/ODP cores showed that northern Emperor guyots were formed ~15 farther north than the current Hawaiian hotspot. IODP Expedition 330 cored coeval Louisville guyots, finding insignificant latitudinal motion, concluding that hotspot motion is the preferred explanation for inter-hotspot motion. Consequently, other explanations for hotspot latitude changes are not currently favored. One such phenomenon is true polar wander (TPW), the coherent shift of the entire mantle relative to the spin axis. TPW has been deemed insignificant for the past ~100 Ma, even though it is occurring at present and it has occurred deeper in the past. Hawaii and Louisville paleolatitude data show a small amount of mutual southward motion. If this results from TPW, the Walvis Ridge, almost antipodal to Hawaii and Louisville, should show the opposite paleolatitude change. This project will produce paleolatitude data for the Walvis Ridge using Expedition 391 cores (with data from DSDP Legs 72 and 74). A major objective is to test the hypothesis of Late Cretaceous-early Cenozoic TPW. This project hypothesizes that observed paleolatitude shifts are a combination of TPW and mantle flow. The project addresses important geodynamical problems that ultimately reflect mantle structure and convection. This project supports three early career investigators. In addition, the two faculty on this project will recruit undergraduate student workers from under-represented groups for internships that will help them advance in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will help volcanologists understand how magmas move from the Earth's mantle to volcanoes, and why this movement can cause earthquakes. Dr. Ross and his team will use new artificial intelligence techniques to identify microearthquakes in seismometer data from the past 14 years, which will make the list (or 'catalogue') of documented Hawaii earthquakes at least ten times as long as it was before. Locations of these quakes will outline features such as magma chambers and conduits connecting these chambers to each other and to volcanoes. Measurements of shaking caused by some of these earthquakes will also be used to generate a separate, complementary image of the subsurface (like a medical CT scan). Dr. Ross will participate in the newly created ?Earthquake Fellows? program at Caltech for high school students from the Los Angeles area. <br/><br/>The magmatic architecture of the Hawaiian volcanic system is central to understanding the transport of magma from the upper mantle to the individual volcanoes. This process in turn is at least partly responsible for the abundance of seismicity in Hawaii. This project will leverage recent advances in earthquake monitoring with deep learning algorithms to produce a substantially enhanced seismicity catalog for Hawaii by reprocessing the entire continuous waveform archive. A key goal of the project is to better understand these transport structures and associated driving processes. As part of this project, Dr. Ross and his team will develop a 14-year seismicity catalog to shed more light on the magmatic conduits in this system and their role in generating seismicity. This will be accomplished using three interrelated components: (i) a seismic tomography of the magmatic architecture with a state-of-the-art machine learning inversion technique, (ii) systematic analysis of the spatio-temporal seismicity patterns and the associated magma transport structures across the island, and (iii) derived earthquake source properties to study the physical processes driving these events and their relation to the causative transport structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is growing evidence that Manganese also plays a critical role in maintaining algal growth and if found in low concentrations can play a role in limiting primary productivity. As algal growth is a major player in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, understanding what controls productivity increases our understanding of what role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle. This study proposes to study the algal processes that take up Manganese in Antarctic diatoms, one of the main primary producers in the region. Another aspect will be to understand how Zinc, a micronutrient with similar dynamics than Manganese, can inhibit its uptake. The PIs propose lab experiments with cultured diatoms isolated from the Southern Ocean to obtain answers to their questions on micronutrient dynamics and will compare results from those obtained with a diatom species isolated from temperate waters. The proposed research will benefit NSF?s goals of understanding life in cold environments and how they differ from other parts of the ocean. This project will support two first-time early career scientists and a female researcher in Earth Sciences. Two graduate students will also be supported, and scientific techniques used in this research will be shared at open houses sponsored by the academic institutions and with local summer schools. <br/>                                                                                                                          <br/>This proposal represents collaborative research to explore manganese (Mn) limitation in Antarctic diatoms by two early career investigators. Diatoms are central players in the Southern Ocean carbon cycle, where the micronutrient chemistry is fundamentally different from other oceans. The Southern Ocean is characterized by widespread low Mn, coupled with high zinc (Zn). High Zn levels are potentially toxic to diatoms as Zn can competitively inhibit Mn uptake and metabolism, compromising the ability of building critical cellular components, thus impacting the biological pump. Using culture experiments with a matrix of micronutrient treatments (Mn, Zn, Fe) and irradiances, and using physiological and transcriptomic approaches, along with biochemical principles, the Principal Investigators will address the central hypothesis (diatoms from the Southern Ocean possess physiological mechanisms to low Mn/high Zn) to quantify rates of uptake and transporter binding constants.  The transcriptomics approach will help to identify candidate genes that may provide Antarctic diatoms physiological mechanisms in low Mn/high Zn environment. The project does not require fieldwork but instead would make use of culture experiments with 4 diatom species (3 Antarctic, and 1 temperate). The proposed approach will also enable the goal of developing biomarker(s) for assessing Mn stress or Zn toxicity and results from the physiological experiments will help parameterize models of micronutrient limitation in the Southern Ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This band, known as the inter-tropical convergence zone, or ITCZ, is generally found north of the equator with a mean latitude of about 6N.  Many aspects of the ITCZ including its existence, its role in global atmospheric circulation, and its preference for the Northern Hemisphere can be understood by thinking of the ITCZ as a uniform strip of convection with the same width, central latitude, and rainfall intensity at all longitudes.  But this longitudinally averaged view of the ITCZ overlooks substantial variations in ITCZ latitude around the tropics.  In particular the ITCZ is found south of the equator in the Indian Ocean and it has a southwest to northeast slope across both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  The latitude of the ITCZ can thus be anywhere from from 4S to 10N depending on the ocean basin, the longitude within that basin, and the time of year.<br/><br/>This project uses combination of observational analysis and carefully designed model simulations to study regional variations in ITCZ latitude and other properties.  For instance the northward displacement of the ITCZ in the eastern Pacific has been attributed to the geography of the North and South American coastlines, an idea which can be tested through simulations in which the west coasts of the Americas are mirror images of each other.  The importance of oceanic processes is tested using simplified ocean configurations which allow some mechanisms but disable others.  Ocean model configurations include a simple motionless ""slab"" ocean, a modified slab ocean which captures near-surface heat transport driven by surface winds, and a ""shallow water"" ocean model which allows surface cooling due to the upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean.  In addition, the project develops a version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in which flux corrections are applied to improve the representation of the ITCZ.<br/><br/>The work is of practical interest given the importance of the ITCZ for tropical rainfall as well as its outsized effects on the climate and atmospheric circulation of the earth.  Despite its importance the ITCZ is not well simulated in models used for weather prediction and climate change projections, thus a better understanding of ITCZ dynamics could be quite useful for model improvement.  The work also has value for the broader research enterprise, as model configurations developed for the project will be openly available for adoption by the worldwide research community.  In addition, the award provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby contributing to scientific workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite extraordinary successes in practice and the potential for tremendous further impact, theoretical understanding of the basic algorithmic building blocks for high-dimensional statistics remains limited. Unlike in traditional (low-dimensional) statistics, the key bottleneck is not how much data is available but how much computational power is available to process it. The central aim of this proposal is to advance a theory of algorithmic statistics which can address the core questions: which problems in high-dimensional statistics have computationally efficient algorithms? And, what are the best -- most accurate, most robust, fastest, etc. -- algorithms for such problems? Pursuing answers to these questions is likely to lead both to foundational algorithmic innovations as well as to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limitations of efficient computation in statistical settings, which is a prerequisite for understanding when a given algorithm is the best possible at the task it performs. Furthermore, the curriculum development and mentoring components of this project will disseminate state-of-the-art algorithm design techniques to the broader scientific community via courses, lectures, and videos and train the next generation of algorithm designers for science and industry.<br/><br/>This project will develop the Sum of Squares method (SoS) as a powerful tool for algorithm design in statistical settings and as a lens on fundamental limitations. SoS is a problem-independent approach to designing algorithms with strong provable guarantees, generalizing tools such as linear programming, and eigenvalue/eigenvector methods. SoS has already broadly impacted algorithms in numerous areas: combinatorial optimization, quantum information, cryptography, control theory, high-dimensional statistics, and more. Even within high-dimensional statistics, SoS already has many applications in clustering, robust estimation, and tensor decomposition (the inverse problem underlying the method of moments), to name only a few. However, knowledge of SoS remains incomplete: there is tremendous potential to push the frontier of efficient algorithms by studying SoS, including in high-dimensional statistics. The core technical thrust of this project will be developing novel algorithms based on SoS as well as the mathematical tools to understand the guarantees and fundamental limitations of those algorithms. The project will focus on algorithm design in two specific domains, privacy-preserving data analysis and Bayesian inference, where the investigator believes that there are opportunities for new algorithms with strong provable guarantees to offer new insights on algorithm design broadly, as well as to have a near-term impact on practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To motivate participation in this ?motor therapy,? virtual reality (VR) technologies are increasingly used. VR can be programmed to be highly realistic or look like a game to encourage participants. Still, persons who use VR motor therapy do not always achieve better outcomes than traditional methods, partially because they are not personalized to each user. Improving VR therapy requires a greater understanding of how persons respond to programmable features. Two features that can improve VR motor therapy are the difficulty of the training task and the guidance (feedback) provided during training. VR interfaces that stimulate senses for greater immersion can readily provide training guidance using augmented sensory feedback (ASF). The method of ASF involves providing sensory (e.g., visual, haptic) cues about the direction and magnitude in which a person should move during training. This project will examine how impairment in function affects personal performance, physiologic responses, and perceptions during VR training that adapts the task difficulty and ASF. This project will advance education through supervised training of high-school students to custom-develop VR rehabilitation applications. These students will further engage the community by presenting their work at laboratory demonstrations to K-12 students from under-resourced districts. In addition, they will receive constructive feedback about their applications from caregivers, clinicians, and, most importantly, persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI) serving as end-user mentors.   <br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that motor performance improves when adapting VR training features (i.e., task complexity, ASF for guidance) based on measures indicating well-being and physical readiness for training. This project?s technical objectives are: (1) creating regression-type models relating performance to perceptional and physiologic measures during VR motor training and as a function of varying disability, and (2) leveraging these models in an adaptive control system using positive reinforcement to personalize VR training features. Experiments will include persons with SCI performing VR motor rehabilitation tasks with a robot-arm avatar. This project focuses on the SCI population, under-served by VR motor rehabilitation yet ideal for fundamental scientific study since SCI can present as a physical disability with or without cognitive impairment. Participants will generate muscle-activation signals, measured at the skin surface, serving as inputs to a machine-learning algorithm that detects command intention in controlling the avatar. Data from the VR environment, body-mounted sensors, and surveys will be used to assess changes in performance, physiologic responses, and perceptions during training. As such, this project promotes human-centered training that considers both body and mind in providing clinicians with new and diverse dimensions of patient-specific data to personalize healthcare for better function. This project has the potential to generate critical insights into how user-device interfaces are best adapted for function, including how to deliver sensory-driven training for more intuitive control of devices (e.g., smartphones, vehicles, remote-controlled robots).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, ML-based approaches for decision-making largely lack appropriate methods for certification. In the meantime, rigorous model-based approaches based on Formal Methods, control, and programming languages have made fundamental contributions to developing many reliable hardware and software systems and can provide rigorous guarantees.  Unfortunately, these rigorous approaches cannot scale to today's complex critical systems. The projects? novelties are to combine the effectiveness of data-driven methods and the rigor of formal approaches. The project is developing a novel set of certifiable data-driven technologies for the control, design, and risk analysis of highly challenging autonomous systems. The project is investigating theoretical and algorithmic foundations of the methods, integrating them into a unified design automation framework, and evaluating their capability thoroughly in advanced simulation environments and on practical hardware platforms. The project?s impacts are 1) addressing the insufficiency and poor scalability of existing methods and enabling the design and analysis of new systems that existing methods cannot support; and 2) allowing the deployment of NNs in various real-world systems in a safe, reliable, and resilient way. <br/><br/>This project's intellectual merit is redefining how to provide rigorous certificates at different levels of computation for highly complex autonomous and cyber-physical systems. Specifically, the project is focusing on 1) Developing novel data-driven control methods that can handle highly complex systems beyond the capability of traditional model-based approaches. The methods will provide the resulting closed-loop systems with mathematical certificates for safety, robustness, and resiliency, which are often missing in pure data-driven approaches. 2) Developing novel data-driven design methods that enable end-to-end optimization of the full autonomy stack and provide certificates of robustness by performing program-level symbolic sensitivity analysis. 3) Exploring stochastic verification methods based on Hamiltonian mechanics to develop novel strategic sampling methods to increase rare case appearances in training samples. The methods can reduce unforeseen behaviors in executions and improve the sampling efficiency of the data-driven methods.

Around Antarctica, these seafloor sediments are influenced by an ice sheet that grinds and transports sediments from the continent?s interior into the surrounding ocean. Since the Last Glacial Maximum (about 20,000 years ago) when the ice sheet extended hundreds to thousands of kilometers seaward, ice has retreated inland to the configuration we observe today and left behind signatures of its growth and decline, as well as indicators of ocean change, in the seafloor sediments. Ongoing glacial and ocean processes are reflected in the characteristics of contemporary sediments, whereas older sediments beneath the seafloor offer a longer temporal perspective of changes to the ice sheet and surrounding ocean. Using data generated from archived sediment cores that are predominantly housed in the Antarctic Core Collection at Oregon State University, we aim to confirm if recent sediments clearly reflect the specific instrumental and historical field-based observations of ocean and glacial change seen in different regions of Antarctica. These modern changes will be placed into context with those recorded by sediments deposited on the seafloor hundreds to thousands of years ago.<br/><br/>This project will explore interlinked physical, biological, and geochemical properties of seafloor sediments to address the influence of glacial and oceanographic processes on ice-proximal marine sedimentation during the 20th and 21st centuries and since the Last Glacial Maximum, with a focus on sediment fluxes, meltwater drainage, ice-rafted debris deposition, and radiocarbon chronologies.

The difficulty of brine management hinders the growth of such applications, which ultimately affects the water and energy security of our Nation. Electrodialysis, a membrane-based technology that uses charged polymer membranes and electricity to separate ions, removing them from water, has been proposed for treating highly impaired waters. However, this technology is energy intensive and inefficient because the membrane performance significantly deteriorates when contacted by highly impaired waters. In this study, the connection between the chemical identity of the charged groups on the polymer backbone and the membrane performance will be systematically investigated. The development of such structure/property relationships will guide the design of membranes with improved transport properties when contacted by highly impaired waters. To enhance the involvement of low socioeconomic status students in STEM, a comprehensive summer research program for high school students will be developed. The program will involve hands-on laboratory work, a short course on membrane science, and dissemination of the results to a broad and diverse audience via outreach programs developed via a collaboration with the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>Ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) that are used for treating highly impaired waters via electrodialysis contain low amounts of water. There is evidence of ion pairing in such materials, which ultimately decreases the charge density of the membrane and worsens both the ionic conductivity and selectivity. Increasing the charge delocalization of the fixed charge groups is hypothesized to enhance both the ionic conductivity and selectivity of low water content IEMs by weakening electrostatic interactions between the fixed charges and mobile ions. This hypothesis will be systematically tested via a combined experimental and modeling study on the influence of charge delocalization on transport properties of IEMs. The majority of IEMs for aqueous ion separations utilize sulfonate anions or trimethylammonium cations as the charged groups attached to the polymer backbone, so the proposed project will open up a new direction of study on IEMs for aqueous ion separations. Due to the fundamental nature of the proposed study, the knowledge generated will have broad implications for other technologies that use IEMs in low dielectric environments (e.g., energy conversion and storage devices).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second thrust is developing a novel generative modeling approach to probe chatbots for hidden toxicity vulnerabilities, and to detoxify models and create safety benchmarks. The third thrust builds on the earlier findings to develop a novel attack-agnostic training pipeline that is resilient to toxicity injection attacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The homotopy groups of spheres are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to certain deformations.  These groups hold fundamental information about maps between topological spaces and have deep connections to number theory, differential topology, and geometric topology.  However, despite their simple definition, the homotopy groups of spheres are extremely difficult to compute.  To better understand these groups, chromatic homotopy theory is a powerful tool that organizes theory and computations by analyzing the algebraic geometry of smooth one-parameter formal groups.  The moduli stack of formal groups has a stratification by height, which corresponds in the stable homotopy category to localizations with respect to the Lubin-Tate theories. The Lubin-Tate theories give rise to higher periodicity in the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and studying them is one of the most important areas of research in chromatic homotopy theory.  Starting from Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel's resolution of the Kervaire invariant problem, the newly developed equivariant machinery offers new methods to attack problems in chromatic homotopy theory that were notoriously difficult to approach via classical methods.  The planned research explores the connections between equivariant homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory, and uses cutting-edge equivariant technology to produce state-of-the-art computations in chromatic homotopy theory.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study periodicity phenomena in the stable homotopy groups of spheres through the lens of equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory. In current and ongoing projects, the PI establishes the first known connection between the obstruction-theoretic actions in chromatic homotopy theory and the geometry of complex conjugations. Using this newly discovered connection, the PI will study Lubin-Tate theories as equivariant spectra and use equivariant machinery developed by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel to produce higher chromatic height computations at the prime 2.  This project aims to deepen the connection between equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory by proving Periodicity, Gap, and Detection theorems for norms of Real bordism theories and fixed points of Lubin-Tate theories. The PI will carry out more chromatic computations to study the last open case of the Kervaire invariant problem. The PI will also investigate Hurewicz images, prove general differential patterns, and exhibit transchromatic phenomena in the slice spectral sequences of Real bordism theories and Lubin-Tate theories across different groups and heights.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Online Optimization of these systems entails taking actions that consider the tightly integrated spatial, temporal, and human dimensions while accounting for uncertainty caused due to changes in the system and the environment. For example, emergency response management systems (ERM) operators must optimally dispatch ambulances and help trucks to respond to incidents while accounting for traffic pattern changes and road closures. Similarly, public transportation agencies operating electric vehicles must manage and schedule the vehicles considering the expected travel demand while deciding on charging schedules considering the overall grid load. The project's proposed approach focuses on designing a modular and reusable online decision-making pipeline that combines the advantages of online planning methods, such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search, with offline policy learning methods, such as reinforcement learning, promising to provide faster convergence and robustness to changes in the environment. The research activities of the proposed project are complemented by educational activities focusing on designing cloud-based teaching environments that can help students and operators with prerequisite domain and statistical knowledge to design, manage, and experiment with decision procedures.<br/><br/>The societal-scale CPS that we study have spatial-temporal properties. The spatial aspect refers to the location-specific state variables such as traffic congestion, transportation demand, and the frequency with which incidents occur at a location. The temporal aspect refers to the dynamic nature of these systems---traffic congestion evolves over time. Non-myopic decisions entail selecting actions over time under uncertainty while accounting for future impact and demand for resources. The combined research and education efforts proposed in the project focus on answering the following critical questions for these systems - first, how do we solve the challenge of sampling future state/ environmental actions across a high-dimensional space while also tackling the challenge of non-stationarity? Second, how do we address the need for robust, fast non-myopic planning that also tackles potential non-stationarity? And third, how do we make it possible to engage non-computer science students and community partners with the solutions built using approaches pioneered in the project? The proposed approach involves investigating novel machine learning methods, such as normalizing flows for designing generative models and an innovative approach to design planning algorithms using a policy-augmented hybrid Monte-Carlo Tree Search approach. A significant effort of the project will focus on complementing fundamental research with the design of a cloud-based visual domain-specific modeling environment that can help explain the design, operation, and introspection of methods by using a block-based compositional approach. The work will be augmented with course modules and online tutorials accompanying the cloud-based environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sensor chips will be applied to spider-like microelectromechanical (MEMS) interposers that grip onto mesh fibers. The benefit of mesh packaging is it allows sensors to be placed into new, technologically important environments with flowing fluids, including cell growth scaffolds, membrane reactors used in chemical manufacturing, and coolant-flushed electronics. The supporting materials are softer than conventional electronic circuit boards, and the researchers will investigate how to join deformable materials making electronic connections across seams without precise alignment. Cut-and-seam manufacturing benefits filtration systems such as air handlers and respiratory masks that must fit one-of-a-kind three-dimensional (3D) surfaces without gaps. This project can lead to a new electronics manufacturing method designed for porous and fibrous materials. It presents a strategy for 3D assembly of working sensor meshes and evaluates its success as well as limitations for seam crossing and signal identification. This project also provides research and training opportunities for undergraduates in textile engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering, and outreach materials for participants to learn about MEMS and Sensors.<br/><br/>The goal of this EAGER research is to make progress on three challenges: 1) scalable transfer processes for low-resistance contacts between MEMS and fibers, 2) sufficient mechanical strength for operating in perfused environments, and 3) addressability across seams made with the loose alignment tolerances of textile manufacturing. The project investigates a new thermal method for device release from a donor surface. The devices? pull-off force is characterized under flow, and electrical contact is measured using a probe station. The approach is to use chip-scale diodes in a rectifying seam tape that prevents shorting at seams. Finally, using temperature chips with unique ID numbers, the sensor meshes will be scanned with a heat source and the sensor signals are used to identify the heated location across a seam. This interdisciplinary project transforms microtransfer printing to porous and fibrous substrates by improving understanding of device-to-fiber junctions? electrical and mechanical properties and their dependence on layout. Microtransfer chip printing techniques are now seeing commercial success, but these methods are designed for continuous, non-porous, surfaces with predictable adhesion contact area.

Planetary albedo is a composite quantity determined by the reflection of sunlight from the relatively dark and thus low albedo ocean surface, lighter and thus higher albedo land surfaces, and the even higher albedos of snow and ice covered surfaces.  Clouds add another layer of complexity as bright reflective clouds form intermittently over darker land and ocean.  The complexity of planetary albedo is a challenge for efforts to determine the warming effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) increases since warming can cause a decrease in albedo, say due to the replacement of high-albedo sea ice with lower albedo ocean surface, which in turn can substantially enhance the GHG warming.<br/><br/>Recent work shows that the albedos of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are uncannily close: the sunlight received in each hemisphere is the same averaged over the year, and the amount reflected back to space is 99.7 watts per square meter in the Southern Hemisphere and 99.6 in the Northern Hemisphere (the resulting planetary albedo is about 29%).  The sameness occurs despite the higher albedo of the Northern Hemisphere due to its larger land area, which yields a difference in hemispheric reflected sunlight of about 6 watts per square meter under clear skies. This difference must be compensated by clouds, and the work of Datseris and Stevens (2021) shows that the compensation is largely occurring over the middle- and high-latitude oceans, as the Southern Ocean is cloudier than the northern Pacific and Atlantic by about 11%.  Datseris and Stevens also show that while planetary albedo has decreased appreciably over the past two decades the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have seen equivalent reductions, thereby retaining their ""albedo symmetry"".  There is no theory for why clouds should compensate for surface albedo differences, and it is of course possible that the albedo symmetry of the recent record is a coincidence and not the result of a global-scale adjustment mechanism.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to determine if an adjustment mechanism exists and if so to develop a theory for it.  In addition to observational data from satellite missions and reanalysis products the work takes advantage of large ensembles of model simulations including simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and a recent perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) created using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM, the atmospheric component model of CESM, the Community Earth System Model).  Results from analysis of these models are used to design additional simulations created with CAM, CESM, and a simplified version of CESM in which the ocean component model is replaced by a thermodynamic ""slab"" which simulates ocean heat storage but not ocean circulation. The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the potentially large role that albedo changes could play in determining how much warming is caused by a given increase in GHG concentrations. A theory of albedo adjustment operating through cloud processes and on a global basis could provide valuable guidance in anticipating the magnitude of future climate change.  The project also provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future scientific work force in this research area.  Undergraduate students are also involved in the project as summer interns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists still debate how tectonic plates recycling into Earth?s interior evolve over time as they descend. Advances in generating 'seismic tomographic images' of the Earth (analogous to medical CT scans) provide increasingly detailed images of these foundered plates (or 'slabs'), many of which are trapped about 300 to 600 miles below the Earth's surface. These images represent a present-day snapshot of the convecting mantle, and its evolution over time may be investigated through numerical modeling of the subduction process. This collaborative proposal combines recent developments in data-driven modeling and seismic tomography. Liu, Tromp, and their graduate students will explore different ways that subducted slabs get trapped in the mid mantle, with a focus on two competing hypotheses: that the slab is being pulled by one end which is stuck to a plate at the surface, or (2) that it is dragged along with horizontal flow of the surrounding mantle. This research will improve our understanding of how the Earth's mantle flows, and how it has flowed (and how the Earth's plates have moved) over tens of millions of years. Sophisticated software for modeling the slabs and imaging the mantle will be significantly improved and freely shared with other scientists via public websites.<br/><br/>Extensive fast seismic anomalies within the 500-1000 km mantle depth range are called stagnant slabs, and their origin has implications for continental tectonics and mantle dynamics. A commonly invoked mechanism is trench retreat, but the observed amount of retreat does not always match simulations. Another frequently made assumption is that slabs sink vertically, even though this can violate geological observations. A potential solution to these problems is to consider lateral mantle flow at mid-mantle depths, whose effect on slab stagnation remains poorly explored. Another complication is the inconsistency of tomographic images of the present-day configuration of stagnant slabs. The PI teams will collaboratively evaluate dynamic effects of trench retreat and lateral mantle flow on slab stagnation by designing 3D spherical Earth models through sequential data assimilation (SDA) and comparing the results with improved tomographic images using full-waveform inversion (FWI) with source encoding. The SDA modeling approach is appropriate for testing key controlling parameters for slab stagnation while simultaneously considering many other natural complexities. The improved FWI method increases seismic resolution significantly at upper-to-mid mantle depths, where stagnant slabs reside. Through a set of SDA models that test the available range of trench motion histories at different geographic locations implemented in both regional- and global-scale simulations, the team will quantify the respective contributions of trench retreat and lateral mantle flow on the formation of observed stagnant slabs. Ultimately, this exercise will generate new insight into subduction dynamics and the associated tectonic records.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER proposal aims to advance the study of chaotic grid disturbances and their mitigation through a deeper understanding of their underlying physics and characteristics considering high volumes of renewable energy. A major technical barrier to achieving truly sustainable and reliable power grids of the 21st century are the unknown electromagnetic incompatibilities from combining renewable energy technologies with fundamentally archaic, yet vital infrastructural components such as transformers and rotating machinery. Solid-state power converters are an enabler for many green technologies such as wind and solar power. However, when their volatile operation becomes entangled with certain types of grid disturbances, complex and chaotic fault signatures are likely to undermine grid operations. The project will 1) pioneer new analytical tools to reveal overlooked disturbance signatures influenced by renewable energy activity, 2) develop advanced protection and grid stabilization techniques to mitigate the impacts of chaotic disturbances and 3) reinvigorate much needed STEM-oriented educational resources to stimulate participation of K-12 students into electrical energy related fields. <br/><br/>This CAREER proposal will focus on two types of destructive and chaotic disturbance phenomena that have periodically occurred but have not been studied in a renewable energy rich environment: ferroresonance and geomagnetically induced currents. The project will answer fundamental questions of (i) how chaotic electromagnetic disturbances change their signatures and damping mechanisms in a high converter-based renewable energy environment, (ii) how to determine new safe operating limits of critical network components such as electrical machines and transformers, (iii) what system protection improvements can be made to correctly detect and suppress disturbances, and (iv) what grid design modifications should be done to reduce disturbance severity and outage risks. The study will first develop novel numerical models and analytical tools to explore, characterize and predict these disturbances under the largely ignored influence of solid-state converter dynamics. Secondly, numerical results will be validated through a small-scale experimental hardware model of a representative power grid with solid-state converters. Thirdly, new system protection technologies will be prototyped for enhanced disturbance detection and suppression.

Part of regulating gene expression is accomplished by the packaging of the genome into chromatin. The nucleosome forms the repeating chromatin unit, a complex of DNA and two copies each of histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. Histone variants and histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are key regulators of nucleosome accessibility and chromatin remodeling, supporting changes to gene expression. This gene regulation is fundamentally important to how organisms function and respond to environmental cues and is highlighted by the prevalence of histone mutations associated with human disease. This project will leverage computational and wet-lab research with yeast and human model systems to examine mechanisms by which naturally occurring histone mutations dysregulate gene expression. This work will advance our understanding of the role of histone variants in nucleosome integrity, chromatin modification, and gene expression. The project itself provides opportunities to engage scientific trainees as part of ?Team Histone,? assembled of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees to build scientific agency and provide research and educational experiences to a broad set of participants within STEM fields. <br/><br/>Genetic studies demonstrate the importance of conserved and essential histone amino acids for maintaining nucleosome structure and function as well as proper regulation of gene expression. However, how most missense histone mutations impact histone structure and function is currently unknown. This project identified a series of recurrent histone missense mutations in human disease. In silico modeling suggests that some of these histone mutations impart local structural changes that alter transcription, and studies in yeast have defined diverse growth and cellular phenotypes. The major aims of this project are to use mammalian and yeast models, along with molecular, cellular, and computational biology to define the mechanism(s) by which the changes alter histone/nucleosome function and delineate the biological outcome of mutant histone expression in model organisms and cells. By exploiting histone mutations to explore histone protein function, nucleosome remodeling, and regulation of gene expression, this project will broadly advance the understanding of how histone proteins contribute to the maintenance of appropriate nucleosome structure and function, to contribute to cell and organismal fitness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When faced with a high-risk weather event, individuals are likely to be motivated to seek information in order to alleviate anxiety and gather information about how to protect themselves. While these tendencies are well documented, less is known about the extent to which media dependency translates into desired behavior, and whether specific source dependencies are contingent on information sufficiency. Recent studies in other emergency contexts have suggested that these dependencies may cluster around information depth, but this has not yet been linked empirically to sufficiency thresholds. The extent to which engagement with risk news content motivates mitigation and evacuation efforts surrounding a natural disaster has also not been directly examined. The findings contribute to our knowledge base by filling a significant gap in the social science literature on emergency response by evaluating the links between self-perception, processing styles, source preferences, and protective actions.<br/><br/>The study consists of an online survey distributed to 1,000 residents of southwest Florida impacted by Hurricane Ian. Participants are identified by zip code and drawn from counties in Florida that were directly impacted by the storm. Participants are asked about the relative importance of varying news outlets, sources of first alerts, time spent seeking information, risk perception (including magnitude and probability), mitigation and evacuation behaviors, and information sufficiency thresholds. The aim is to extend previous research by investigating the extent to which risk perception and information sufficiency are tied to specific source preferences, and the degree to which these dependencies are subsequently associated with mitigation and evacuation. By examining preferences for specific news outlets, along with the role of information sufficiency thresholds in information consumption and response, these organizations may be able to develop best practices for message placement and content. The data may also provide valuable guidance to emergency managers and crisis responders in terms of identifying audiences that are less inclined to internalize risk and/or take protective actions, and appeal to those audiences directly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Where is the eruptive vent? 2. What areas will the lava flows affect? and 3. How fast will lava reach certain areas? Forecasting methods for lava flow paths and velocities require a detailed understanding of the lava?s flow properties (i.e. how viscous it is), the slope of the ground that the lava is flowing on and how much lava is erupted over a certain time interval. As lava flows down a volcano, it cools, crystallizes, and forms and/or loses bubbles, all of which affect how fast and how far lava may flow. An incomplete understanding of how the lava?s flow properties change makes accurate lava flow forecasting, and with that, hazard mitigation ahead of effusive eruptions, civil protection, and management of ongoing eruptive events, difficult. This project is motivated by 1) an incomplete understanding of lava flow properties, 2) a lack of integration of accurate flow properties in lava flow models and 3) the need for shorter response times between eruption onset and availability of lava flow-path forecasts. The project will tackle these challenges using the two most hazardous effusive volcanoes in the world, Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira as type localities. As an example, the 2021 eruption of Nyiragongo claimed over 30 lives, left > 20,000 homeless, destroyed > 3,500 houses, 12 schools, and 3 hospitals ? a powerful expression of the impact lava flows can have on human lives. The core objectives are to 1) reconstruct the lava?s flow properties from natural samples 2) measure the lava?s viscosity at conditions relevant to its emplacement, and 3) integrate these data into a framework of satellite informed lava forecasting models. This may enable the development of a satellite-data-driven near-real time protocol for rapid and accurate forecasting of lava flow paths, which can then be applied during effusive eruptions to help guide decision making in civil protection efforts. Project results will also be incorporated into the SUNY Buffalo EarthEd program, providing content for K12 educators serving underrepresented communities, promoting science literacy. The project will support a graduate student at SUNY Buffalo and involves international collaborations (USA, Italy, France, DR Congo) in academia, development aid, and at volcano observatories.<br/><br/>Lava rheology varies as a function of temperature, melt composition, crystal, and bubble content as well as strain rate. From eruption to flow cessation, basaltic lavas traverse a range of up to 10 orders of magnitude in their effective viscosity. The resulting non-linear changes in the lava?s transport behaviour determine how it accommodates deformation during emplacement and how fast and how far a lava can flow. The core objectives are to 1) reconstruct the lava?s rheology from natural samples 2) map the lava?s rheology over conditions relevant to their emplacement, and 3) integrate these data into a framework of satellite informed lava emplacement models. Using careful experimental characterization of the lava enables adaptation of a satellite-data-driven near-real time protocol to develop a tool for rapid and accurate forecasting of lava flow emplacement paths. The project will integrate field measurements, textural analysis, and targeted high temperature rheology experiments to generate the first complete rheological flow law for a basaltic lava that is derived from measurements at conditions relevant to lava emplacement and validated with field constraints. Using this flow law, the project will optimize a lava flow emplacement model, and integrate it into an existing near real time satellite monitoring system. This will create a highly adaptable tool for predicting lava flow paths and advance rates that is rooted in and optimized for the core physical property ? lava rheology. The project sets out to: 1) Perform detailed petrographic analyses of natural samples and collect and evaluate field data of lava flow geometries 2) Use these in concert with viscosity measurements in controlled atmospheres to reconstruct the lava?s rheology during emplacement. This includes generating critical new data at reduced conditions, which are extremely scarce. 3) Employ the derived data to initialize and calibrate a deterministic lava flow model. This tool may enable near real time lava emplacement forecasting during future eruptions as well as forensic investigations of previous eruptions. The selected type localities enable testing both cooling- and volume-limited lava emplacement scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate the fundamental limits of the trade-offs between privacy and performance to build AI systems that are as performant as possible without compromising privacy. The project's results will not only improve the security of people who already benefit from products that learn from their data but will also reduce bias in AI by enabling more sensitive or vulnerable individuals to participate safely.<br/><br/>On a technical level, this project will develop new differentially private stochastic optimization algorithms. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in private optimization, but the theory for private non-convex optimization (which is required for training neural networks) is surprisingly underdeveloped. For this setting, the typical approach is to treat a standard non-private algorithm as a black box, providing it with inputs that have already been processed by adding noise to obscure individual contributions so that the output must also necessarily preserve privacy. This project will open up this black box to produce new algorithms that improve privacy guarantees while maintaining good convergence results both in theory and in practice. One of the initial technical approaches will be to develop a connection between momentum, a ubiquitous technique in modern optimization algorithms, with privacy. This approach does not require structural assumptions on<br/>the loss surface (e.g., convexity, smoothness) to ensure privacy but has the potential to significantly decrease the amount of noise injected into the algorithm, resulting in improved performance with the same level of privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climbing vines are a critical part of forest ecosystems, where they frequently outcompete and kill forest trees. Moreover, these plants are increasing in size and abundance in response to forest fragmentation and climate change. However, we still lack a basic understanding of precisely how these plants perform their dramatic snake-like twining motions. In this CAREER award, the developmental basis of twining will be investigated. How cells, tissues, hormones, and molecular biology interact to build a twining vine will be investigated, with the aim of revealing the fundamental reasons that vines are distinct from erect plants. To enhance public and professional literacy of how plants are constructed ? the field of plant anatomy ? the PI will launch an educational video series teaching plant anatomy with live dissections and animations. This video series will be made freely available to engage novice, and as a primer and teaching tool for professional scientists and educators.<br/><br/>In this CAREER award, the investigator seeks to address the following question ? ?how do vines climb?? ? by leveraging a multiscale integrative approach linking gene expression, cell wall construction, and hormone regulation to organismal form to explain the developmental processes that generate twining vines. Using common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabaceae), as the model species, the research aims of this proposal are to: (1) Characterize the developmental basis underpinning the continuum of habits, from twiners, to prostrate vine, to erect shrub; (2) Elucidate how phytohormones determine plant habit; and (3) Test the functional role of gelatinous fibers in twiners. At present, there is a significant imbalance in training and pedagogy between molecular biology and plant anatomy in the United States, therefore hindering advancements in the plant sciences. The broader impacts aim of this work is to generate an animated educational Plant Anatomy video series. This resource will serve as a freely available resource to advance public literacy of botany while providing critically absent expertise for the scientific community.

In materials, we are used to measuring such rates in the context of their response to small electric and magnetic fields. For instance, the rate that current decays in a metal after an electric field impulse can be related to the width of its low-frequency ?Drude? response in its optical conductivity. The rate that polarization decays after polling a liquid with an electric field corresponds to the width of the broad peak in the Debye relaxational functional form. In contrast, the energy relaxation rate is a fundamental rate that governs many processes, but which is unfortunately not measured straightforwardly via conventional electrodynamic measurements using small fields.   This proposal concerns the development of measurement tools to probe materials with large THz range fields that can push materials far from equilibrium allowing new parameters to be measured.  The systems of interest in this proposal possess unconventional features with regards to their interactions or band structures that will affect energy relaxation in interesting ways.   The team will investigate the rates of energy relaxation in a variety of materials with interesting quantum mechanical correlations.  This project also includes a broad initiative in education and outreach. The work is of particular educational value in training students with unique skills to prepare them as the work force in high-tech industries. The research team will play active roles in the Johns Hopkins Physics Fair- an outreach activity which brings hundreds of people each year through Hopkins' labs during a Saturday event and exposes them to various physics demonstrations and activities. The team will also give demonstration shows at the Physics Fair and work with under-resourced local schools.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This is a project to investigate fundamental aspects of energy relaxation, time-evolution, and thermalization in strongly correlated, topological, and disordered systems by new nonlinear ?pump-probe? THz spectroscopies. The research team will exploit recent developments in the form of THz range 2D coherent spectroscopy (and its relatives) to get new information about energy relaxation in correlated and topological metals, as well as disordered electron glasses. Measurements will emphasize the extended THz range (here 0.1 - 40 THz [0.4 - 165 meV]) where generally responses target the low energy emergent degrees of freedom, but experiments will use a full complement of photon energies up through the near infrared. This topic of THz range dynamics and nonlinear response of quantum materials is an effectively wide-open area, in which there has been much interest and some theory, but very few experiments.  Among other aspects, the team will investigate the rates of energy relaxation in the regime of ?Plankian dissipation? in the cuprate superconductors.  It has been conjectured that their anomalous properties reflect an intrinsic quantum mechanical bound on the rate of relaxation that arises from maximally allowed inelastic scattering. This has been inferred from the resistivity experiments, among others. The team will shed light on the origin of this remarkable property by probing the interplay of energy relaxation with this bounding scale.  Another project that will confront a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics is the understanding of materials with both strong interactions and strong disorder. The team will investigate the issue of thermalization and time-evolution in the ?electron- glass? state of doped semiconductors on the insulating side of the 3D metal-insulator transition. The team will use both the novel technique of THz 2D coherent and THz pump-probe spectroscopy. The mechanism of energy relaxation, both internal to the electron sub-system and coupling to the lattice are expected to be very different in such glasses and the results of this study may have relevance to the lack of thermalization in many-body localized systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fungi are known to have a role in making ice in the atmosphere; however, little is known about how these fungal compounds function in ice nucleation or the role they have in influencing the earth?s climate. This project seeks to unravel the working mechanism of fungi?s ability to optimize ice formation and to improve our understanding of how these fungi influence the amount and intensity of precipitation and impact the earth?s climate. Because these fungi are also plant pathogens, this research will also help with understanding the impact of fungal ice nucleation on crops and the rhizosphere and enable new strategies for the design and preparation of powerful new freezing technologies. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will provide novel learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Underrepresented students from the University of Alaska Southeast, a rural native-serving Primarily Undergraduate Institution, will have unique opportunities to learn advanced bioanalytical techniques, crystal growth, and advanced spectroscopy and will be encouraged to attend graduate school through peer-to-peer mentoring and interactions with graduate students from Baylor University. Graduate students from Baylor University will have unique research experiences studying ice-binding biomolecules of organisms inhabiting Alaska and a unique mentoring experience through working with rural, Alaska Native undergraduates.<br/><br/>Pure water does not freeze at 0 C owing to the energy barrier associated with creating the initial crystallization nucleus. In nature, water typically freezes in a heterogeneous process, facilitated by the presence of particles that serve as ice nucleators. Ice-nucleating biomolecules (INBs) from fungi are among the best ice nucleators known, enabling the formation of ice at temperatures close to 0 C. The control fungal INBs exert over the phase transition of water has direct relevance for disciplines as diverse as cryobiology, plant pathology, biomedical engineering, and climate science. Despite their importance, the structural basis and molecular mechanisms behind INB-mediated freezing have remained largely elusive. Progress towards answering the question of what makes INBs so much better at nucleating ice than any other material requires a microscopic picture of the structure and interactions that enable superior ice nucleation in their natural environment. The main objectives of this project are: 1) Identify and characterize the compounds and structural moieties responsible for ice nucleation in fungi, 2) Determine conformational changes of the compounds when they make ice, and 3) Determine changes in the hydration shell of the compounds in the process of ice making. These objectives will be accomplished using novel ice-binding assays and advanced spectroscopic methods. This research will allow the derivation of general structure-function relationships and optimal functionalities of INBs, enabling unprecedented insights into the molecular basis of biological ice nucleation.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes they are technical obstacles to overcome, while in other cases they encode essential features of the problem being considered. In this research  the focus is on singularities of minimal submanifolds and of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. Minimal submanifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of minimal surfaces, which model soap films. Their study is very classical, but some basic questions remain unanswered about their behavior near singularities. Special Lagrangian submanifolds are a particular kind of minimal submanifolds, which have received a great deal of attention recently due to their appearance in string theory. The Lagrangian mean curvature flow is a natural evolution process by which we can attempt to find special Lagrangian submanifolds, however once again the appearance of singularities is the basic difficulty. This research project aims to understand some common features of singularities which appear in families, in contrast with most previous research that focused on isolated singularities. Progress on this problem will have applications to many other related questions in geometry and analysis. The project also includes several educational activities aimed at increasing interest and success in STEM fields at all levels. Specifically, the educational activities include: a week long summer math circle aimed at students in grades three to five; support for undergraduate research; the continuation of a summer undergraduate workshop in geometry and topology; and the continuation of a bridge program for beginning graduate students to ease transitioning to graduate school.<br/><br/><br/>The most basic information that can be obtained from a singularity in many geometric problems is its tangent cone or tangent flow. The question of the uniqueness of such ""tangent objects"" is one of the most basic problems in geometric analysis and it is only well understood when singularities are isolated. The PI will study non-isolated singularities in two related settings: minimal hypersurfaces and the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. The tools developed for understanding the uniqueness of tangent cones and flows in these settings will also have applications to important geometric problems: the classification of minimal hypersurfaces with prescribed behavior at infinity; the generic smoothness of minimal hypersurfaces; and the possibility of surgeries at singularities along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow in connection with the Thomas-Yau conjecture. In addition to these specific applications, the PI expects that the new methods introduced in connection with the above problems will have applications in other areas of geometric analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been used to identify regions of the genome associated with common diseases and disorders.  However, genetic variants identified through these approaches usually explain only a small fraction of their known heritability and have yielded a poor record of finding disease-causing variants. This project will develop tools to combine GWAS with other sources of data, such as family-based genetic studies that identify important rare variants and transcriptomic or proteomic studies that capture gene expression signatures in disease, to find genetic modifiers that would be entirely missed using GWAS alone.<br/><br/>This project will identify genes involved in disease progression by combining information across different experimental types. The fundamental building block of the family of statistical models that will be employed is a hierarchical three-group mixture of distributions. Each gene is modeled probabilistically as belonging to either a null group that is unassociated with disease progression, a deleterious group that is associated with negative disease outcomes, or a beneficial group that is associated with positive disease outcomes. This three-group formalism has two key features. First, by apportioning prior probability of group assignments with a Dirichlet distribution, the resultant posterior group probabilities automatically account for the multiplicity inherent in analyzing many genes simultaneously. Second, by building models for experimental outcomes conditionally on the group labels, any number of data modalities may be combined in a single coherent probability model, allowing information sharing across experiment types. These two features result in parsimonious inference with few false positives, while simultaneously enhancing power to detect signals.  The model disease for applying the combined analysis approach will be Parkinson?s Disease (PD). Genomic sequences from PD and control patients will be jointly analyzed along with transcriptomic data from public sources and targeted single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data.  In addition, a powerful imaging approach called robotic microscopy (RM) will be used to functionally evaluate the predictions of the statistical model thereby providing experimental feedback to the model. Using human neurons derived from PD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (i-neurons) and RM, levels of genes predicted to be beneficial or deleterious will be modulated in the PD i-neurons, and mitigation or exacerbation of disease phenotypes will be quantified to validate or invalidate predictions of the statistical model.  The strategy of combining genomic, transcriptomic, phenotypic, and potentially other sources of information using the three-groups framework can be applied to any heritable disease with multiple data types available.  The analytical approach in this project will help identify which genes are likely to play a role in pathogenesis, resulting in therapeutic targets and potentially individualized ""precision medicine"".  This could lead directly to treatments for PD, and in addition could provide a useful set of tools for other researchers to pursue therapies for other heritable diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geodesy characterizes the Earth's time varying shape, orientation in space, mass distribution, and gravity field. It has revolutionized the geosciences, by measuring Earth changes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The GAGE facility employs expert professional staff, with guidance provided by the scientific community, to manage and operate a set of foundational geodetic capabilities that are essential for current research support, as well as frontier geodetic activities that will enable future research. The facility will promote advances in our understanding of continental deformation; tectonic plate boundary processes; the processes that drive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and landslide hazards; continental water storage, atmospheric, ice sheet and glacier dynamics; and interactions among these components of the Earth system. The geodetic capabilities provided through the GAGE facility contribute to issues of national/global strategic importance, including geohazard assessment and disaster resilience; environmental management and economic development; and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and workforce development. Data products from GAGE will be used by federal agencies including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for missions including spacecraft positioning, satellite orbit, and timing corrections; earthquake, tsunami, and volcano early warning; weather forecasting; water resources; and environmental management.

Despite being identified nearly a century ago, much is not understood regarding the relationship between the resources in a quantum system and the level of entanglement that can be achieved. This project seeks to answer some fundamental questions in the resource theory of entanglement for quantum channels. How much entanglement is required to prepare a quantum state or to simulate a quantum channel? How much entanglement can one distill from these same resources? How many ""magic quantum states"" are required to perform a given quantum computation? How much ""non-Gaussianity"" is required to achieve a quantum advantage in communication over quantum channels? How distinguishable are two quantum states or channels? The questions that this project addresses are of particular interest for the many applications of quantum information processing, such as solving computationally hard problems and enabling secure and covert communications. The project will also train an inter-disciplinary cadre of students in this domain through extensive education and curriculum development activities. <br/><br/>This project will address foundational questions concerning resource theories of quantum channels. The traditional perspective in quantum resource theories concerns how to use free operations to convert one resourceful quantum state to another one. For example, a fundamental and well known question in entanglement theory is to determine the distillable entanglement of a bipartite state, which is equal to the maximum rate at which fresh Bell states can be distilled from many copies of a given bipartite state by employing local operations and classical communication for free. It is the aim of this research project to take this kind of question to the next level, with the main question being: What is the best way of using free channels to convert one resourceful quantum channel to another? The project seeks to identify measures of entanglement for quantum channels that allow for addressing the above questions while being efficiently computable, and also to understand dynamical processes in other resource theories, such as magic states and channels, distinguishability, purity, thermodynamics, non-Gaussianity, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Docker and Singularity are two popular software technologies for containerizing scientific applications and are widely supported on different hardware platforms. However, their adoption involves a steep learning curve, especially when it comes to developing secure and optimized images of the applications of interest. A large number of domain-scientists and scholars are usually not formally trained at containerizing their applications with Docker and Singularity, and spend a significant amount of their time in porting their applications to different cloud computing and supercomputing platforms. The process of porting applications having multiple software dependencies and sensitivities to specific software versions can be especially arduous for such users. To assist them, this project is developing BASIL - a tool for semi-automatically containerizing the scientific applications, frameworks, and workflows. This project will deliver BASIL through a web portal, as a command-line tool, and through APIs. BASIL has a broad applicability across multiple domains of deep societal impact such as artificial intelligence, drug discovery, and earthquake engineering. By enabling the preservation of valuable legacy software and making them usable for several years in future, BASIL will save cost and time in software rewriting and software installations, and thus contribute towards advancing the prosperity of the society. The project will result in educational content on ?Introduction to Containerization? and students engaged in the project will develop valuable skills in the areas of national interest such as supercomputing/High Performance Computing (HPC) and cloud computing. <br/><br/>BASIL will be the first tool of its kind that can semi-automatically generate secure, optimized, and trustworthy container images with clear information on how to use the images under appropriate licenses. The rules for optimizing the images will be derived from expert knowledge and best practices, such as multi-stage builds and reordering the sequencing of commands to take advantage of caching so that the overall time involved in building the images is reduced. Users of the BASIL tool will provide the recipes for building their applications/workflows in one of the following forms (1) Makefiles/CMakefiles, (2) scripts, (3) commands, or (4) a text-file with predefined keywords and notations using templates provided by the project team. These recipes will be parsed, and Dockerfiles or Singularity definition files will be generated. The parser developed in this project will be another novel contribution of the project. Using a generated Dockerfile or Singularity definition file, a Docker or Singularity image will be built. Next, the image will be scanned for any vulnerabilities, signed, and if the user desires, released in public registries with appropriate licenses. These container images can be tested using the BASIL web portal, and can be pulled to run or deploy on diverse hardware platforms. <br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Physics at the Information Frontier in the Division of Physics within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is one of the active lines of bioinformatics research currently. Pan-genome collections may be represented as high-scoring Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) data, indexed text data, or the more popular graph-based representations (pan-genome graphs). One of the fundamental objectives of these models is to support read mapping queries efficiently. To that end, this research will lead to a new class of string/graph algorithms for the analysis of pan-genomic data that are closely tied to critical applications that have the potential to make a lasting impact on the theory and practice of data-driven bioinformatics. The key findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed conferences, journals, and workshop tutorials. Several Ph.D. and Master's theses will also evolve from this research. The investigator is committed to ensuring the participation of women, students from underrepresented minority groups, and undergraduates in this research. <br/><br/>The novel aspects of this project include new graph algorithms parameterized by different graph parameters and techniques for indexing (highly similar, possibly dynamic) texts and graphs. The parameterization of the string-to-graph matching and related problems might lead to several efficient, practical solutions for restricted graph classes. Such problems are well motivated by pressing applications, including read-mapping and (reference-based) genome assembly. Additionally, some fundamental computational biology problems, like the Multiple Sequence Alignment, will be revisited in the context of pan-genomics for faster approximations and better heuristics. A deeper investigation on popular heuristics like co-linear chaining is another direction. The goal here is to provide solid mathematical reasoning on why such methods work well in practice. These research objectives align with the investigator's background in string algorithms and his long-term career goals of transforming foundational research into practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This analysis environment is more resilient against evasive malware than standard Android emulators. Furthermore, the environment is stealthier and provides better flexibility and productivity for analysis than bare-metal machines. The novel Android container architecture has cross-disciplinary contributions: it improves resource utilization, reduces hardware costs, thus advancing automated malware analysis and streamlining the tasks of malware analysts.

The rate of this flow depends on the properties of the rock, such as its temperature, and on the nature of the contacts between the tiny mineral crystals that comprise the rock. The mantle can be pushed to flow by numerous different phenomena, such as: passing seismic waves after an earthquake; melting of continental ice sheets and glaciers; the annual cycle of groundwater recharge and extraction; and the draining of large lakes. This study uses observations of these phenomena to measure the rock properties and the interactions between mineral crystals in the mantle beneath three locations: the western United States, Alaska, and Iceland. Meanwhile, laboratory experiments are probing how samples of rock deform under controlled conditions. Finally, new computer models are synthesizing the lab and field observations to understand the underlying physical laws that explain the full suite of data. The results of this study have a bearing on topics that range from predicting how sea level will rise due to melting ice sheets to understanding tidal deformation on Jupiter?s moons. Outreach and training are key elements of the project. Four graduate students and six undergraduate students are being educated over the duration of the project. Workshops will bring together researchers from diverse scientific disciplines to learn and debate about the scientific outcomes and the computer tools developed as part of this study.<br/><br/>There is emerging recognition that the variables describing Earth?s mechanical response to stress, elastic moduli, attenuation, and viscosity, are all frequency dependent. While the end-member elastic and steady-state behaviors are relatively well understood, there remain many fundamental questions regarding the intermediate transient regime. This study is an integrative research and outreach program that combines observational, laboratory, and modeling efforts to measure Earth?s full-spectrum rheological response and illuminate the underlying microphysical processes. Observational work is characterizing frequency dependent upper-mantle dissipation in three locations (western U.S., Iceland, and Alaska) using seismic and geodetic observations of different frequencies but complementary spatial sampling. Experimental work is investigating how dislocations affect transient creep under different temperature and stress conditions and with variable quantities of melt and secondary solid phases. Modeling work is developing new constitutive laws for transient creep and incorporating more sophisticated rheologies in the viscoelastic deformation code. This study is addressing questions about: (1) the broadband mechanical response of the solid Earth; (2) the microphysical processes that control viscoelasticity; and (3) the implications for inferences of steady-state viscosity from geodetic observations and of thermodynamic state from seismic tomography. Broader impacts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, a synthesis workshop that convenes 120 researchers to outline recent advances in understanding transient rheology and to shape the topics and collaborations that will dictate the next decade of inquiry, and development of interactive Jupyter notebooks that introduce open-source data-science tools in the context of seismic attenuation and transient rheology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will also catalyze the transformation of the engineering culture to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion.<br/><br/>This mixed-methods multi-case study seeks to understand engineering faculty beliefs about DEI and develop a gaming intervention to catalyze their engagement with DEI efforts. The study is framed by basic values theory to answer the following research questions:<br/><br/>RQ1. What beliefs and values do engineering faculty hold about diversity, equity, and inclusion? <br/>RQ2. How do faculty values and beliefs about DEI impact their approach to integrate DEI into their professional activities?<br/>RQ3. How does the gaming intervention impact engineering faculty values and beliefs about DEI?<br/><br/>This proposal will initiate a national conversation about the role of engineering faculty in promoting diversity and inclusion. Specifically, the project will develop an online gaming tool that can provide asynchronous access to a DEI training instrument tailored for engineering faculty. The synergistic activities of research and teaching will provide a medium to introduce the DEI concepts into the engineering culture, curriculum, and classroom. The results of the study will increase the engineering faculty engagement with DEI efforts. Through their gaming and communities of practice (COP) interactions participants will develop a tailored individualized understanding of what it takes to implement DEI concepts into their faculty activities. Finally, the results of the study will update our understanding of strategic approaches for broadening participation and how faculty can effectively teach diverse students in STEM. The study will provide an exemplar for improving diversity and inclusion initiatives that various institution types can model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These gas streams are hot, high-pressure, and can contain noxious chemicals. Before the gas can be safely released to the atmosphere, small, chemically similar molecules must be selectively removed from the stream to meet government regulatory standards. Conventional gas separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and absorption are energy-intensive and, thus, add to operational cost and further burden the environment. Membrane-based separations are a competitive alternative gas separation technology, but those used in industrial gas service stand to benefit from performance improvements that enable use at higher temperatures. This project will establish a controlled membrane fabrication process that overcomes the primary limitations facing industrial use of membranes in gas separations, including the ability to control the internal network of pores and how the material ages. The fabrication process incorporates polymer precursors and porous liquids to form a ""mixed matrix"" membrane with high selectivity (preference) for a target molecule and good mechanical properties. The incorporated materials significantly increase the ability of the membranes to operate at higher temperatures making them more competitive with the energy-intensive separation methods. The results of this project are expected to be broadly applicable to many types of gas separation processes and may spur the development of new technologies for air pollution control. Educational opportunities will be provided to undergraduate students and graduate students through research projects. The principal investigator will also leverage existing programs at Missouri University of Science and Technology to engage with K-12 educators and high school students in activities that enhance public science literacy.  <br/><br/>This project will systematically investigate structure/property relationships in a recently developed platform of fluorinated copolyimides (FCPs), which exhibit outstanding gas separation performance. The objective of this study is to develop a better understanding of the fundamental relationships between the microstructure of the polymer precursor and physical aging and gas separation performance of the resultant carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membrane. Such FCP materials and related blends have high thermal and chemical stability, making them suitable candidates for separations at high temperatures or in harsh chemical environments, such as natural gas processing or olefin/paraffin separation. In this project, the investigator will synthesize a family of FCPs and related materials integrating the polymer precursor?s backbone structure with porous organic cage (POC) nanoparticles via covalent bonding. The effects of backbone structure modification and polymer precursor doping with POCs on morphology, free volume, transition layer, physical aging, and gas separation properties will be explored; the objective of which is to develop fundamental structure/property/performance relationships for these novel membranes. Gas solubility, diffusivity, and permeability as a function of temperature and pressure for pure gases will be characterized. Similarly, mixed gas permeation properties over the resulting FCP and derived POC-based CMS membranes will be assessed for application in natural gas or olefin/paraffin separations. The project will offer undergraduate and graduate education opportunities, and in conjunction with existing programs at Missouri University of Science and Technology, the investigator will create classroom modules for K-12 educators and high-school outreach events.

They have shown great potentials for sustainable technologies in diverse engineering applications, including artificial muscles and skins, flexible electronics, soft robotics and many others. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art design of self-healing polymers remains at the trial-and-error stage with insufficient theoretical guidance. This award supports fundamental research to elucidate the self-healing mechanics of nanocomposite hydrogels that consist of water-mediated polymer networks crosslinked by nanoparticles. The knowledge obtained from this project will provide mechanistic insights into self-healing polymers that are able to restore their functionality after damage. The research will not only promote the fundamental science of self-healing mechanics, but also advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare through further development and enhancement of soft-materials based sustainable technologies. This project will also train a diverse group of students in the areas of solid mechanics, polymer science, mechanical engineering, and high-performance computing for next-generation workforce development. The educational objectives of the project will be realized through curriculum development, undergraduate research opportunities, summer research program for high school students, research experience for K-12 teachers program, and K-12 outreach program. Special efforts will be made to involve underrepresented students in this project. <br/><br/>Despite extensive studies in the syntheses and applications of self-healing polymers, constructing the mechanistic relationship between self-healing properties and material/healing settings remains challenging. The key technical barrier is how to physically model the microstructure evolution of the polymer networks during the self-healing process. The central hypothesis of this project is that the self-healing strength of nanocomposite hydrogel is governed by the diffusion of polymer chains across the fractured interface and subsequent crosslinks formed with nanoparticles. To test this hypothesis, the project integrates molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theories to study microscopic diffusion-reaction behaviors of polymer chains during self-healing process and macroscopic interfacial strengths after self-healing. The computational and theoretical predictions will be systematically validated with experimental studies of nanocomposite hydrogels composed of several material compositions, such as particle concentration, particle size, and water fraction, and under various external healing controls, such as temperature and delaying time. The interdisciplinary effort will open promising avenues for quantitatively understanding the multiscale mechanics of self-healing polymers and providing fundamental design principles of high-performance self-healing polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will advance the science of automated computational design by creating new algorithms capable of generating and optimizing multi-body systems.  Starting with only a mathematical description of design materials and physical environment, the algorithms will automatically generate assemblies for compound machines that combine multiple basic components such as levers, hinges, wheels, and axles, which together form the foundation of all mechanical design. This work will enable a new level of automated computational design not previously possible under existing design frameworks.  The knowledge obtained from this research will benefit a wide range of applications including nanoscale mechanisms for delivery of medications and self-reproducing robotic systems. The project also involves an integrated education program featuring a STEM Pipeline program for undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups. The program includes bi-weekly labs and seminars, team design projects, and K-12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>The algorithms created in this project will rely upon several novel design formulations devised specifically for the design task.  Chief among these will be an original topology optimization-type framework in which the internal topologies of multiple planar design domains are optimized simultaneously, while also optimizing the connectivity between adjacent domains to form compound mechanisms whose components can slide and rotate freely with respect to one another.  The mechanical behavior of the designs will be modeled using a combination of finite element analysis and flexible multibody dynamics to capture the rigid body motion and the elastic deflection of the system components.  Additionally, adjoint sensitivity analysis will be used to derive and compute the design sensitivities that will power the gradient-based optimization algorithms.

When people receive information about risks, they often feel anxious and do not seek or retain information like other people, making it hard to make good decisions. It is critical to understand how anxiety affects both people?s information processing and management to design better risk communication messages. This project applies the risk perception attitude framework to two experiments to examine how anxious people process and manage risk information regarding two issues: Type 2 diabetes and climate change. This project combines self-report measures of processing and response with eye-tracking (to measure attention to information) and physiological measures of anxiety. The findings of this project are important because they will contribute to our understanding of how to design risk communication messages by identifying the ways in which people use risk information in decisions when they feel anxious. <br/><br/>The Risk Perception Attitude framework is a risk communication model that predicts how audiences, segmented by perceived risk and efficacy beliefs, will seek out risk information and the emotions they will experience. The framework predicts that those with high risk perception but weak efficacy beliefs are likely to avoid information and will experience high anxiety (termed the anxious segment). Gaps in knowledge exist about how people who fall into the anxious segment respond to risk information, seek, and process information about risks. This research examines: (1) how risk perception and efficacy beliefs affect information processing and management behaviors processing via anxiety, (2) the type of efficacy information best processed by people in the anxious segment, and (3) how anxious people process information when their efficacy beliefs are enhanced. This research involve two studies: an online experiment testing the Risk Perception Attitude framework with a nationally representative sample, and a laboratory experiment with only anxious people to further investigate how they process information. The study combines eye-tracking data and self-report to examine risk message attention and processing. This project informs risk communication efforts for health and environmental risks by focusing on the role of anxiety, an emotion people often experience when they are exposed to risk information. Understanding how anxious individuals process information can contribute to improving risk communications for a significant population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria and fungi evolve to stop responding to antibiotics and to continue to grow. Each year in the US alone, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or fungi cause infection in more than 2.8 million people and more than 35,000 deaths. Developing alternatives to traditional antibiotics is critical for addressing this global challenge. This collaborative project supports fundamental research to develop a new type of antimicrobial nanoparticle to combat  antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These nanoparticles are unique in that they display a non-uniform coating of hydrophobic and positively charged molecules. Such nanoparticles are expected to act through novel antibiotic mechanisms that are less likely to cause acquired drug resistance in bacteria. The research team will combine experiments with computational modeling to elucidate how interactions of these nanoparticles with bacteria depend on the non-uniform surface chemistry of nanoparticles and the cell wall chemistry of bacteria. The mechanistic understanding from this study will guide the rational design of antimicrobial nanoparticles against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. By integrating nanoscience research with educational and outreach activities this collaborative project outlines interdisciplinary approaches to promote critical thinking and increase diversity in STEM. These approaches include the development of introductory undergraduate courses that integrate science teaching with art, a collaborative outreach project to K-12 students in rural areas, and training of the next generation of researchers, especially underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>Developing broad-spectrum antimicrobial nanoparticles is challenging because a single nanoparticle design cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution effective against all bacteria.

Specifically, experiments will be combined with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interactions of amphiphilic nanoparticles with model bacterial membranes and a diverse selection of Gram-negative bacterial strains, many of which are resistant to most available antibiotics. The expected results will establish the structure-activity relationship governing the antimicrobial mechanisms of the amphiphilic nanoparticles. Such new understanding will enable the development and optimization of antimicrobial nanoparticles that are potentially more potent than existing ones and whose effects are tunable.

Further, the current lack of a well-established tunneling junction capable of processing phononic quantum information limits progress in phononic quantum computing. Bistable structures are a promising approach for the realization of a mechanical tunneling junction because, at the nanoscale, their energy barrier approaches the energy of a single phonon.

However, traditional encryption systems used in mobile devices cannot defend against an active attacker who can force the mobile device owner to disclose the key used for decrypting the sensitive information.

An example of this would be a human rights worker collecting evidence of untoward activities in a region of oppression or conflict and storing the same in an encrypted form on the mobile device, and then being coerced to disclose the decryption key by an official. Plausibly Deniable Encryption (PDE) has been proposed to defend against such adversaries who can coerce users into revealing the encrypted sensitive content. However, existing techniques suffer from several problems when used in flash-memory-based mobile devices, such as weak deniability because of the way read/write/erase operations are handled at the operating systems level and at the flash translation layer, various types of side channel attacks, and computation and power limitations of mobile devices.

The project includes significant curriculum development activities and outreach activities to K-12 students.   <br/><br/>This project fundamentally advances the mobile PDE systems by leveraging existing hardware features such as flash translation layer (FTL) firmware and TrustZone to achieve a high deniability with a low overhead.

In addition to its economic and cultural value, biodiversity plays an important role in keeping an environment?s ecosystem in balance. Disrupting such processes can reduce the provision of natural resources such as food and water, which in turn yields a direct threat to human health. Protecting natural areas is fundamental to preserving biodiversity and to mitigate the effects of ongoing environmental change.

These models will feature realistic objectives faced by practitioners, such as maximization of the protected area or the number of species covered and minimization of the conservation cost. The design models will embed stochastic processes to capture the species? spatiotemporal movement across the landscape and to assess the effectiveness of conservation plans, including extinction risks, mortality, and ecosystem disturbances.

The project would rely on a novel eddy-identifying analysis technique (developed in prior work by the PIs) applied to in-situ measurements from global surface drifter dataset and the historical set of acoustically-tracked subsurface floats. This is a departure from the usual approach of eddy detection in gridded satellite products, relying instead on the adaptation of signal processing techniques to float trajectory data. Prior studies based on such gridded products significantly underestimate numbers of eddies, and overestimate eddy sizes and transport of water trapped within them. Data analysis will be supplemented by theoretical idealized and realistic numerical modeling. This work will address what observed ubiquitous coherent eddies actually accomplish in terms of their effect on the large-scale flow. This is a question of societal importance because of its relevance for the development of accurate subgrid-scale parameterizations for general circulation models. The project will advance the boundaries of the viable use of Lagrangian data, and thus provide new tools for eddy examination to the community. The project will support and inform free online courses in fundamental and advanced oceanographic data analysis, so that that these state-of-the-art methodologies will be broadly accessible to the next generation of researchers. The project supports an early career latino scientist, who will develop an undergraduate-level teaching module related to this project.<br/><br/>This project will produce a definitive study on the role of coherent eddies in driving fluid transport, taking significant eddy detections from in situ Lagrangian observations as the starting point. The detection method, called vortex signal extraction, recovers time-varying oscillatory signal components from Lagrangian trajectories, without a requirement for the oscillations to be strictly periodic. Available data include approximately 24,000 global surface drifter trajectories plus another 3,000 subsurface trajectories from an historical set of eddy-resolving floats, both NOAA datasets. Data analysis will be complemented by idealized and ultra-high-resolution realistic modeling. These components will be used to explore the subtleties of observing the eddy field from the Lagrangian perspective, to examine the theoretical properties of the eddy detection methods, and to investigate the dynamics of the transport processes of interest. The project will proceed in three branches: (i) dynamics of direct and indirect eddy-driven transport, (ii) the vortex observability problem, and (iii) global estimates. Anticipated products will be new global estimates of coherent eddy properties, populations, and boundaries through statistical modeling informed by an improved understanding of the physics of long-term and transitory trapping. The project will further provide a calibration process by which remotely-sensed features can be more accurately mapped onto fluid structures, and a hydrographic analysis will convert areal transport estimates into mass transports.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In observing that a passenger car takes much space on a roadway due to the relatively long gap following a preceding vehicle, this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project explores emerging modular autonomous vehicle (MAV) technology that can dynamically adjust gaps between vehicles. With the MAV technology, vehicles composed of multiple modular pods can be dynamically docked and separated during operations. For example, during peak hours, modular pods will be docked into longer MAVs, resulting in zero gaps between the modular pods docked together, which obviously improves highway throughput and reduces congestion. Whereas during off-peak hours, a long MAV may separate into shorter MAVs to ensure flexible system accessibility and reduce vehicle operation costs. This way, the MAV service equivalently creates ?elastic? capacity for fixed transportation infrastructure to adapt spatiotemporally-varying travel demand. This project is for a new transmodal MAV system paradigm to realize such elastic capacity of a road transportation system. <br/><br/>To realize this vision, we will adapt multidisciplinary theoretical methods (e.g., time-geography, queuing theory, traffic flow theory, and homogeneous analysis) to understand and formulate operations of an MAV system. Then we will build mathematical models for the optimal design and operations of an MAV system at various scales by synchronizing demands and modular pods over time and space. The major challenge is to deal with continuous time and space as opposed to traditional fleet management problems with discrete time-space states. This challenge will be overcome by integrating microscopic trajectory control into macroscopic fleet management. If successful, this project will provide transmodal concepts to improve transportation and other related systems that are currently segregated into different modes. It will help boost the MAV service from a startup stage to a sustainable industry. The results will help transportation stakeholders understand feasibility and benefits of the MAV service and devise measures to incorporate it in their future planning, which may result in profound positive impacts on surface transportation including transit and freight operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by supporting planning activities with clear potential to develop novel, leading edge research ideas and approaches to address NNA goals. It integrates aspects of the?natural environment and social systems, and?addresses important societal challenges,?builds significant educational opportunities, and?engages internationally and with local and Indigenous communities. <br/><br/>Rapidly changing Arctic conditions necessitate multi-perspective approaches to creating new knowledge and engaging communities that are most affected by these changes. Thus, planning and co-producing effective Arctic research is needed, results of which will inform social and ecological security on a national, and global scale. The Kluane Lake Region in the Yukon Territory has recently experienced many abrupt environmental shifts. In 2016, the retreating Kaskawulsh Glacier cut off flow from Lh?n Mn (Kluane Lake), effectively removing one of the largest water inputs to the lake. Additionally, recent insect outbreaks have harmed nearby forests, and warming climate regimes have shifted winter ice formation and snowpack development. While these compounding environmental changes will have drastic impacts to the ecosystem for decades to come, their impacts on the local communities will be more rapid. While these ecological impacts have been observed by formal research communities, it is also critical to work closely with local communities to understand their perspectives on critical research questions and natural resource concerns. Thus, the research team works with local communities like the Kluane First Nations and Champagne and Aishihik First Nation, as co-producers of research questions and design. <br/><br/>This convergence research team is co-creating research questions, seeking questions that are relevant and generalizable to the Kluane Lake region specifically, the Yukon generally, and broadly at a pan-Arctic scale. Research questions are being identified by incorporating the experiences and local knowledge of communities.  Specifically, planning activities center around a community liaison employed by the project with credibility in the communities around the lake, with two kick-off scoping trips (research team), and then a community-driven workshop to identify gaps in current understanding and existing methodologies to develop: 1) a citizen-science monitoring program to generate reliable and consistent data for climate and lake conditions; 2) compilations of datasets, databases, and tools for accessibility and integration into educational offerings; and 3) knowledge of community acceptance and perspectives on new technologies and data tools. Researchers are employing a mixed methods triangulation approach during the co-production process, via assembly of existing quantitative data, key informant interviews, and structured and unstructured qualitative data collection during the workshop. Researchers will then expand the team to include gaps in expertise, based on final co-produced research questions. Finally, the research team is involving underrepresented students from multiple institutions in the planning process, so they may see how a hybrid model of knowledge co-production (traditional and westernized view of knowledge) takes place.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
