However, three sets of factors make this goal difficult to achieve. First is the lack of resources, knowledge, and awareness of relevant data sets. Second are shortfalls in quantitative research capacity. Third is a dearth of examples of the ways data can be used to document and tell stories about student success.  To address these constraints, this study draws upon an on-going collaboration among community college faculty and administrators, university education researchers, and industry.  In Phase 1, the research team will collect and analyze technician education pathways in Washington State that have received funding from the NSF's Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. In Phase 2, the study will examine cross-sector statewide longitudinal data to identify and investigate key momentum points and employment outcomes that indicate critical milestones along technician education pathways. The study will establish and investigate the collaborative processes that lead to the development, implementation, and use of tools, guides, and interactive data dashboards that visualize descriptive and predictive analytics.  The study will illuminate the extent to which the availability of data analytic tools and findings influences the effective use of statewide longitudinal data and, in turn, shape the organizational cultures of three community colleges toward heightened awareness and use of data analytic processes and results for the improvement of STEM-oriented technician education pathways.  Phase 3 will synthesize findings from Phase 2, in a manner that produces replicable processes and a set of promising practices for developing and investigating cross sector longitudinal data systems (LDS) for improving and documenting milestones and outcomes of technician education pathways at other institutions within Washington state and across the nation. <br/><br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate (1) critical milestones and students outcomes along technician education pathways;  (2) critical cross sector statewide longitudinal data that can be incorporated into interactive data dashboards to enhance decisions on improving technical education pathways; and (3) the extent to which the availability of interactive data analytic tools and findings affect organizational culture around improving technical education pathways. The qualitative case study research project offers the research team the ability to systematically collect, examine, code, triangulate, test, and develop a deep understanding of organizational learning involved in culture change directed toward heightened awareness and use of data analytics to improve education pathways.  Systematic data collection, analysis, and interpretation will be guided by deductive and inductive approaches.  The project's conceptual foundation (Guided Pathways, Equity Scorecard, and Pathways to Results) will provide the deductive framework for the project.  The team will inductively uncover, investigate, and coalesce emerging themes as team members participate in and observe the complex relationships among faculty experience, learning, the project's conceptual framework, and the changing organizational culture. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as ocean acidification impacts the water chemistry of the surface and deep ocean, the future of deep-sea reefs is highly uncertain because ocean acidification makes it more difficult for corals to build the three-dimensional structure that these ecosystems depend on. The naturally harsh water chemistry conditions of the North Pacific are being exacerbated by ocean acidification therefore it was previously thought that deep-sea coral reef development could not occur in the region.  Despite these expectations, reefs were recently discovered in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) and the Emperor Seamount Chain (ESC), with 4 of 7 sites in waters that are corrosive to, or likely to dissolve, the coral skeletons that make up deep-sea reefs.  With the discovery of these reefs, we have an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the potential impact of ocean acidification on these important ecosystems because, in contrast to previous studies, there is a gradient of water chemistry across our study sites, all at the same depth. This study will address basic questions regarding reef development in the deep sea, including: Can deep-sea coral reefs develop in water that is corrosive to coral skeletons? What is the fate of reefs that developed under supportive water chemistry conditions once they experience corrosive water? How long can reefs persist in corrosive water?  Through addressing these questions, this study will provide critical insights into deep-sea reef formation, persistence, distribution, and the effects of ocean acidification on deep-sea coral communities.

The discovery of these reefs, with more than half the sites in undersaturated water, provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the potential impact of ocean acidification on these important ecosystems. It is becoming critical to gain a better understanding of the role of aragonite saturation in the distribution of deep-sea scleractinian reefs because it has been documented that the aragonite saturation horizon (ASH) is shoaling throughout the world oceans due to ocean acidification. More deep-sea reefs will experience undersaturation in the near future as aragonite saturation declines and the ASH shoals, making the future of deep-sea reefs and the ecologically and economically valuable ecosystems they support highly uncertain. Building on the discovery of deep-sea coral reefs in the NWHI and ESC, the overarching question of this project is: How is it that deep-sea scleractinian coral reefs can occur in undersaturated water, well below the hypothesized reef development limit Although individual corals may be capable of calcifying in undersaturated water, it is unlikely that a three-dimensional reef structure could develop since deep-sea calcification rates are slow and most of the reef matrix is dead skeleton susceptible to dissolution. Therefore the hypotheses to be tested are: 1) These deep-sea reefs developed in saturated water and are now in undersaturated water because the ASH has shoaled; 2) The reefs in undersaturated water are now net dissolving; and 3) Environmental parameters other than aragonite saturation are driving reef distribution. To test these three hypotheses, we plan two research cruises to characterize the reefs and environmental parameters of nine seamounts across an aragonite saturation gradient where reefs exist above and below the ASH.  Coral and water samples will be collected, an ROV will conduct video transect surveys, and experimental dissolution blocks and in situ instrumentation will be deployed at the reef sites to investigate: carbonate chemistry variability on diel (in situ instruments) to centennial (skeletal boron isotopes as a pH proxy) scales, calcification and dissolution rates, and reef ecology.

A fundamental question to be answered is, under what conditions do elaborate communication signals develop?  To address this, a series of experiments will be conducted on two inhabitants of the Central American rainforest, the tungara frog, and its predator, the frog-eating bat.  Male tungara frogs vocalize in the noisy backdrop of the rainforest as they attempt to attract a mate. While vocalizing, the frogs also inflate a large sac in their throat which generates a cascade of water ripples surrounding them.  The experiments will address how and when each of these different signal components is used by a female frog searching for a mate or a bat searching for a meal. A common assumption in studies of animal behavior is that, additional information in an animal's signal always improves the ability of signal recipients to locate that signaler.  In studies on humans, however, it is understood that more information can lead to cognitive overload and degrade decision performance.  This study will address the conditions under which added information improves or degrades the efficiency of animal communication signals.  The project will also incorporate training of future scientists, ranging from undergraduate students to post-doctoral researchers.  Further, the knowledge gained from the project will be disseminated through student training at universities and primary schools as well as public outreach through museum displays.<br/>     <br/>A fundamental question in animal behavior is, how do animals utilize available information to inform adaptive behaviors? In behavioral ecology there is often the implicit assumption that more information is better. In human psychophysics, however, there is substantial evidence to show that more information can lead to cognitive overload and disrupt signal detection and decision-making. Previous results from the investigators have made it clear that information in the male tungara frog's mating display is not linearly related to the response of two receivers, the female frog or its predator, the frog-eating bat. To address the question, ""is more information always better,"" a series of playback experiments will be conducted under conditions of increasingly complex multimodal background noise.  These experimental noise levels will mimic the variable noise levels that occur naturally in the environment. The performance (decision accuracy and latency) of the two receivers (female frog and bat predator) to playback calls will be assessed, making a critical contribution to an understanding of how animal decision-making occurs in a complex world. This will be the first study to explicitly contrast hypotheses that added information in the environment leads to either enhanced performance or cognitive overload on the part of the receiver. An added value of this study is that it will yield information on two very different species, with fundamentally different sensory systems and cognitive abilities.  This will enhance the generality of the interpretations, providing insights into how different cognitive systems deal with environmental noise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To promote the progress of science, the focus of this project is to study polymer nanocomposite coatings that have the potential to improve the ability of solar cell devices to utilize a broader section of the solar spectrum allowing for more efficient energy production. The fundamental issue that the project seeks to address is how to combine dissimilar materials in such a way that the properties can be varied by controlling how well the particles are distributed  In addition to experiments,  computer simulations will be used to guide the selection of polymer and particles and to help interpret experimental results.  Block copolymers, which are two different polymer molecules tied to each other, will be manipulated to create horizontal and vertical alternating domains (like a stack of cards) that contain nanoparticles of complementary functionality. To determine the location of particles and size of aggregates, state-of-the-art characterization tools will be used.  This research will produce phase diagrams that allow for the determination of environmental conditions that promote good mixing between the polymer and particles.  Besides producing a well-educated, scientifically skilled workforce, the integration of research and education benefits society at several levels. For example, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in annual public events including Nanotechnology Day at Penn,  Philly Materials Day, and the Philadelphia Science Festival.  An additional exciting outreach program is Girls in Engineering Mathematics and Science Camp (GEMS), a weeklong day-camp that introduces middle-school girls from the Delaware Valley to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental principles that control the spatial distribution and assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) in block copolymers (BCPs) and to understand the thermodynamics and phase separation pathways of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). The overarching goal is to perform systematic studies that build on expertise in polymer and NP diffusion as well as NP assembly in PNCs. <br/>(1) The first aim is to tune the nanoscale separation between plasmonic NPs and upconverting nanoplates/nanospheres in horizontally and vertically aligned lamellar BCPs. By functionalizing the NP with polymer brushes, the two NP species will be located in alternating BCP domains. The effect of domain spacing and particle loading will be investigated. PNC field-theoretic simulations (PNC-FT) will be used to determine the free energies of these PNCs and predict the cylinder-to-lamellar phase transition. <br/>(2) The second aim is to study the thermodynamic behavior of binary (A/NP) and ternary (A/B/NP) PNCs. The phase diagrams will be mapped out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on isothermal samples as well as the new in situ X-ray scattering capabilities. As in the first aim, PNC-FT will provide guidance for selecting materials parameters and help interpret results. <br/>(3) The third aim is to investigate phase separation dynamics of binary (A/NP) PNCs to elucidate the fundamental parameters that determine aggregate size and percolating morphologies in kinetically trapped systems.

Particle diffusion will be measured using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry.  Polymer brush relaxation and ion diffusion through percolated morphologies will also be measured. In summary, although fundamental in nature, the proposed work has the potential to create PNCs with enhanced upconversion luminescence and fast ion mobility, which is of importance for solar energy and energy storage devices, respectively.  <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These particles, also known as aerosols, make the air hazy (reduce visibility) causing potential problems navigating on the roads, at sea or in the sky. There is also significant evidence that breathing such particles is harmful to human health. Generally, about half of the mass of these particles is composed of molecules comprised of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen (oxygenated hydrocarbons). There is recent evidence that some of these oxygenated hydrocarbons form in the air via the combination of two smaller molecules, a process known as accretion. To learn what promotes this type of chemical combination reaction, laboratory and computer calculations are used to examine the efficiency for different chemicals found in the atmosphere.  This research is important for developing an underlying understanding of air quality but also for biology, human toxicology, soil chemistry and the preservation of artwork.  Students and staff from the Wennberg and Stoltz groups are heavily engaged in bringing science to the public. Atmospheric chemistry provides an opening for conversation and interaction as citizens of Los Angeles have direct experience with poor air quality. These outreach activities are performed both on campus and in the local schools. On campus,<br/>for example, the science program is conducted with local elementary schools and pre-K children in an outdoor lab. The research team works closely with the Benjamin Franklin Elementary School in Glendale, CA to collaborate with the teachers in designing experiments that enhance the science- and math-based learning curriculum in which the students are engaged.<br/><br/>Reactions of organic peroxy radicals with other peroxy radicals are thought to produce much larger molecules via accretion. These larger molecules have a much lower vapor pressure and can condense to form aerosol. Little is known about what controls the rates at which these accretion products form. This study examines the hypothesis that weak bonding interactions in the initially produced complex of the two peroxy radicals determine the efficiency of this chemistry. The rates of this oxidative reaction are studied for a diverse set of organic substrates. The team synthesizes compounds that are thought to characterize these accretion products to confirm their identity. The comprehensive laboratory studies are complemented with computational chemistry through a collaboration with Professor Kjaergaard at the University of Copenhagen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates the water cycle during climates that are characterized by atmospheres with high concentrations of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases like carbon dioxide. As long as atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to increase, we may observe more evaporation and more seasonally intense precipitation (rain/snow) in future climates. One way to understand such changes in the intensity of the hydrologic cycle is to explore the record of evaporation and precipitation during ancient high carbon dioxide climates, such as those of the early Cenozoic time period (65-30 million years ago). This project will develop a new tool to estimate the intensity of evaporation using ancient soil carbonates and mollusk shells. The chemical composition of these ancient carbonate materials contains information about the temperature of formation and the extent to which the rain/ground water from which they grew was affected by evaporation. Thus, this tool will allow for a simultaneous estimate of earth surface temperature and of aridity. The investigator will convey the importance of understanding ancient environmental change through outreach programs affiliated with the University of Michigan. One program is Earth Camp, which brings underrepresented high school students at no-cost to the university and to the field. Another program is Females Excelling More in Math and Engineering Sciences (FEMMES), which encourages girls to explore their potential in science. <br/><br/>This project is leveraging two novel stable carbonate isotope measurements to improve our ability to reconstruct aridity and precipitation of ancient climates. This research consists of two components: 1) a modern calibration study, where the isotopic composition of modern soil carbonates and mollusk shells are measured, along with the isotopes of modern meteoric waters, to add to the growing understanding of how the isotopic composition of carbonates reflect their environment, and 2) an application to an ancient greenhouse climate, where these new proxies are applied to a Paleocene section in California that has both paleosol carbonates and mollusks in order to reconstruct past aridity and moisture sources. By targeting environments where marine and terrestrial carbonates are collocated, the investigator can understand the potential seasonal biases that the carbonate materials may impart as well as different aspects of the hydrologic cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stieber of the Department of Chemistry at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) is studying small molecule reactions at metal centers. Reactions utilizing small, nitrogen containing molecules found in the atmosphere are of considerable interest as mimics for existing biological processes involved in agricultural nitrogen fixation (such as in legumes) or for reducing the health effects of automobile pollutants. Advancing the knowledge of metal-nitrogen oxide interactions may also offer insights towards the development of catalytic systems for converting nitrogen oxide pollutants into useful chemicals. This research is especially challenging as the nitrogen oxide species are often unstable and short-lived, and thus require the development of new characterizational tools at a national synchrotron facility.  These new tools are coupled with computational efforts and the synthesis of air-and moisture-sensitive inorganic complexes. The project is designed to enable undergraduate researchers to conduct impactful research and gain experience with a range of techniques. The research is integrated with education through student-led research modules in computational chemistry and crystallography.  The efforts broaden research opportunities for all students and enable the recruitment of a diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Current methods to characterize metal interactions with nitrogen oxide-containing species are insufficient to provide complete chemical characterization of bonding, oxidation states, and functionalization, all of which are necessary for developing synthetic systems for nitrogen functionalization. A key challenge of studying nitrogen oxide-containing species is isolating the unstable species and characterizing them.  To overcome these stability issues, Professor Stieber uses spectroscopic techniques that stablish spectral fingerprints for metals bound to different coordination numbers, modes, and oxidation states of nitrogen oxide species. This project examines X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) as an analytical technique for characterizing coordination modes and redox activities in coordination complexes. The current project utilizes synthetic, synchrotron and computational methods to study more complex and challenging systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The textbook description of electrons in solids assumes essentially free electrons, moving throughout the solid independently of what all other electrons are doing. Research in the recent past has shown that this description fails in a wide variety of materials, in which electrons in the solid are strongly correlated with each other. In these quantum materials, strong correlations can produce unusual states of matter, and lead to phase transitions between them.

Strong correlations can yield novel phases and unusual excitations. In metallic systems, an outstanding challenge is to understand how the correlations generate physics beyond the Fermi-liquid theory. The proposed research will address this open problem, primarily by using systems with both itinerant electrons and localized moments as a prototype setting. The research will develop and apply controlled theoretical methods to study well-defined microscopic and field-theory models. <br/><br/>The research aims to gain new insights that are broadly relevant to the physics of strongly correlated electrons. The PI will pursue four specific research directions: First, the PI will analyze heavy-fermion quantum criticality, with a focus on Kondo lattice systems that contain entwined degrees of freedom. Second, the PI plans to initiate theoretical studies on the novel phases that emerge near quantum critical points, including pairing state of multiorbital superconductivity that is driven by quantum criticality. Third, the PI will explore non-Fermi-liquid physics in heavy-fermion systems potentially hosting Kondo-driven Weyl nodes, thereby elucidating quantum criticality in a new setting. Fourth, the PI will investigate real-time dynamics under driven conditions as a means of probing quantum criticality. Through concrete model studies, this research direction aims to shed light on the coherence and dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems out of equilibrium.<br/><br/>Through the project, the PI will bring about understanding about quantum materials in general, which is a central element of quantum science and technology that has recently emerged as a top national priority. The PI intends to collaborate with leading experimental groups worldwide in this area, thereby creating educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students involved in the PI's research program. The advanced theoretical training will help students prepare for future careers in academia or industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These polymers bear a charged group that can associate with oppositely charged macromolecules to form a larger superstructure called a polyelectrolyte complex. The nature of how these polyelectrolytes associate is represented by the number of associations or electrostatic crosslinks, which in turn influences the physical properties of the complex. One important challenge is that these complexes should bear desired properties at real-world conditions, such as certain relative humidity values and temperatures. However, there remains a lack of understanding regarding how and why water and temperature dictate the thermal and mechanical properties of a given complex. One significant challenge is that it is not clear how these physical properties connect to the original structure of the electrostatically crosslinked polyelectrolyte complex. This project addresses this challenge by examining the dynamics and mobility of the polyelectrolyte and of water within the structure at varying environmental conditions. These findings will be compared to the structure of the complex and physical properties such as stiffness. The knowledge developed in this project could lead to a predictive relationship that may broadly describe the physical properties of any complex in response to environmental conditions. The proposed work offers several opportunities for educational enrichment of a broad spectrum of members of the general public. The educational objectives and broader impact for this work include: hands-on research opportunities for undergraduates, K-12 outreach through TAMU's Chemistry Open House through demonstrations to the public, Science Night demonstrations at local elementary schools, and online outreach through the EngineerGirl website.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Cultivating a deeper understanding of the physical properties of polyelectrolyte complexes as they connect to the complex's structure is an important challenge for advancing their wider application. However, this understanding is complicated by complex factors such as the electrostatic crosslinking density, water content, and temperature. For example, it is known that the glass transition temperature (Tg) is intimately tied to the water content and ion pairing within the complex, which is in turn influenced by salt and/or pH. However, the current understanding is somewhat empirical or qualitative, and a quantitative connection to a physical dynamic process is needed. The central goal of this project is to elucidate the physical origin of the glass transition-ion pairing-water relationship via characterization of the glass transition dynamics and the molecular structure of the complex. This will be accomplished by spectroscopic characterization, dynamic mechanical analysis, and thermal analysis. These complexes will be further explored for their stiffness at different time scales, temperatures, and humidity values. The central hypothesis is that the dynamics of the polymer chain are influenced by water mobility at the electrostatic crosslink and by the association/dissociation of the crosslink itself. Water may lubricate the electrostatic crosslink and promote temporary dissociation of the electrostatic crosslink. One significant outcome of this work is possibly a new physics-based understanding that quantitatively connects the structure of a complex and the surrounding environmental conditions to the resultant physical properties of that complex.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will use geologic records of past wildfires to investigate factors that might impact future fire prevalence in the Arctic tundra. Wildfires play an important role in forest ecology, contribute to the global carbon cycle, and can interfere with human activities. In the Arctic, wildfires are historically rare, but their frequency is increasing as climate warms. This recent trend is surprising given that existing paleofire records demonstrate that a cold and dry climate is more conducive to burning then a warm and wet climate. Ancient lake sediments from the Siberian Arctic will be analyzed for evidence of past wildfires during time periods that span a wide range of climatic conditions to better understand climate-wildfire linkages. The study will test the ideas that permafrost, aridity, and vegetation can influence the relationship between temperature and tundra wildfires. The research will be coupled with community education activities, including teaching environmental science camps for local youth in Massachusetts and Arctic Alaska.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use organic geochemical proxies in a Lake El'gygytgyn sediment core covering 3.6 million years to reconstruct variations in Arctic biomass burning over the Plio-Pleistocene.

Many plants and animals evolve traits that allow them to produce offspring through self-fertilization. However, this transition is thought to be a one-way street because self-fertilization limits genetic variation which prevents further evolution. This project will determine whether plants that primarily self-fertilize can re-evolve to be outcrossing. Highly outcrossing and primarily selfing species of monkeyflower will be compared for their genetic variation and artificially selected for flower traits that determine the rate of selfing. The project will involve undergraduates in the conduct of independent experiments and the analysis of genetic data, and new laboratory materials will be developed on artificial selection and genetic evolution for an undergraduate course at Washington State University.<br/><br/>Limited heritable variation in predominantly selfing populations is thought to be a primary constraint on the evolution of outcrossing traits. While declines in effective population size and the efficacy of recombination are expected with close inbreeding, there is scant information on their consequences for adaptive trait evolution. Constraints on the re-evolution of outcrossing traits in primarily selfing lineages suggest either that genetic variation is limiting or that such responses are possible but unlikely to occur. Outcrossing populations of Mimulus guttatus and selfing populations of M. laciniatus and M. micranthus will be subject to five generations of artificial selection for increasing the anther-stigma distance, a key outcrossing trait, and the realized heritability will be determined. Pooled whole-genome population sequencing of the control and selection lines before and after the experiments will reveal the comparative effects of selection on their genomes. This whole-genome information has the potential to critically link constraints on adaptation to the genetic consequences of self-fertilization (i.e., low nucleotide diversity and strong linkage disequilibrium).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drought, overuse, degradation, and population growth are causing significant stress upon urban areas. With 55% of the world's population residing in urban areas and urban populations expanding, it is key to train a future generation of scientists to tackle urban hydrologic problems. Another challenge is that underserved groups are inadequately represented in the hydrologic workforce and are, thus, often not involved in policy decisions that directly impact their communities. To address these concerns, this project presents a vertically integrated set of mentor-focused education and research experiences to provide career pathways for undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds in the field of urban hydrology. Our proposal aims to attract motivated students from underrepresented backgrounds to investigate urban hydrological problems through a nested series of events during a 10-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer training program.  Program activities include independent research, professional training, mentoring, social activities, a research and training field activity, and post-summer activities. The REU research activities include investigations in five topical areas: (1) surface hydrology of urban areas; (2) climate-driven changes in urban groundwater; (3) meteorology and precipitation along coastal urban corridors; (4) hydrochemistry of urban streams/hydrochemical methods development, and; (5) river sedimentation and restoration in urban coastal watersheds. The intellectual merit of this proposal is established through undergraduate engagement in high-level urban hydrologic research. Student research on urban hydrologic systems will provide an understanding of important hydrologic processes in urban watersheds. The research will contribute to the understanding of climate and anthropogenic-forced change in urban hydrologic systems that require additional study and long-term monitoring. The broader impacts of the proposal are focused on recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented backgrounds in the hydrological sciences.  As a result, this effort aims to expand representation in water resources decision making.<br/><br/>This REU program provides multidisciplinary training and education focused on urban hydrology affected by climate change, and challenges of integrating diversity and demographic equity in policy and technical decisions.  Objectives of the program are to: 1) provide students an enriching and cultural experience under the guidance and mentorship of a core group of faculty with research interests in fields of urban hydrology; 2) increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in water-related fields, such as hydrogeology, watershed analysis, and hydrologic modeling, and; 3) increase the number of underrepresented students and especially those that do not have access to research opportunities and/or professional development, providing exposure/training in research and opportunities for these students to pursue graduate degrees or employment. To accomplish these objectives, the REU program includes engagement in supervised research, training activities, mentoring activities, social activities, a research and training field activity, and post-REU activities. Research activities include investigations in five topical areas: (1) surface hydrology of urban areas; (2) climate-driven changes in urban groundwater; (3) meteorology and precipitation along coastal urban corridors; (4) hydrochemistry of urban streams/hydrochemical methods development, and; (5) river sedimentation and restoration in California coastal watersheds. Training activities include half-day workshops for undergraduate mentees covering several professional topics including developing computing skills in the Spatial and Temporal Data Analysis short course, technical writing/abstract preparation, and poster/oral presentation. Mentoring activities include Friday afternoon meetings between REU students plus faculty and graduate students where they have informal discussions related to career and professional development and challenges.  Social activities include three weekend social events to create bonds between REU students and faculty peers. A combination research and training activity includes a four-day field trip through the lower part of the Colorado River Basin scheduled for the end of the third week. After the summer REU activity is complete, faculty mentors will continue to work with student mentees to finalize the dissemination of the REU research results through conference publications and presentations by the student participants and to provide career guidance as practicable.  We expect the REU effort to help lead students into productive research enterprises after their term in the program is complete.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental question to be answered is, under what conditions do elaborate communication signals develop?  To address this, a series of experiments will be conducted on two inhabitants of the Central American rainforest, the tungara frog, and its predator, the frog-eating bat.  Male tungara frogs vocalize in the noisy backdrop of the rainforest as they attempt to attract a mate. While vocalizing, the frogs also inflate a large sac in their throat which generates a cascade of water ripples surrounding them.  The experiments will address how and when each of these different signal components is used by a female frog searching for a mate or a bat searching for a meal. A common assumption in studies of animal behavior is that, additional information in an animal's signal always improves the ability of signal recipients to locate that signaler.  In studies on humans, however, it is understood that more information can lead to cognitive overload and degrade decision performance.  This study will address the conditions under which added information improves or degrades the efficiency of animal communication signals.  The project will also incorporate training of future scientists, ranging from undergraduate students to post-doctoral researchers.  Further, the knowledge gained from the project will be disseminated through student training at universities and primary schools as well as public outreach through museum displays.<br/>     <br/>A fundamental question in animal behavior is, how do animals utilize available information to inform adaptive behaviors? In behavioral ecology there is often the implicit assumption that more information is better. In human psychophysics, however, there is substantial evidence to show that more information can lead to cognitive overload and disrupt signal detection and decision-making. Previous results from the investigators have made it clear that information in the male tungara frog's mating display is not linearly related to the response of two receivers, the female frog or its predator, the frog-eating bat. To address the question, ""is more information always better,"" a series of playback experiments will be conducted under conditions of increasingly complex multimodal background noise.  These experimental noise levels will mimic the variable noise levels that occur naturally in the environment. The performance (decision accuracy and latency) of the two receivers (female frog and bat predator) to playback calls will be assessed, making a critical contribution to an understanding of how animal decision-making occurs in a complex world. This will be the first study to explicitly contrast hypotheses that added information in the environment leads to either enhanced performance or cognitive overload on the part of the receiver. An added value of this study is that it will yield information on two very different species, with fundamentally different sensory systems and cognitive abilities.  This will enhance the generality of the interpretations, providing insights into how different cognitive systems deal with environmental noise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surfactants in solution self-assemble into spherical or cylindrical aggregates called ""micelles"", whose shape and size control the properties of the surfactant solutions. The micelle sizes and shapes are in turn controlled by the molecular structure of the surfactant and by the concentrations added salts and other ingredients. An ability to predict and control these dependencies is the key to the rapid design of surfactant products. The project will therefore develop molecular simulation tools at multiple levels of scale that, together, will produce a deep understanding of the energies and forces that control surfactant self-assembly allow for predictive design of surfactant products. Software tools developed under this project will be made public and we expect it to be used by companies such as Procter and Gamble, as has been the case with software developed under the previous NSF funded grant.

These predictive tools will be tested by measuring rheological data for well-defined micellar solutions of CTAC (cetyl trimethylammonium chloride) mixed with either NaCl or with sodium salicilate (NaSal), and other surfactant solutions. We will also develop a simulation method and constitutive theory for the nonlinear rheological properties of thread-like micelles that accounts for breakage/fusion, nonlinear deformation, and entanglements.

Through this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, the research team at the University of Southern California develops a deeper understanding of why these materials perform so exceptionally well and investigates strategies to push the performance of these hybrid materials even higher in the future. The work is highly interdisciplinary, combining efforts in organic synthesis, computational chemistry, and physical property measurements to examine how light interacts with these complex materials.

In previous studies the organic component has been predominantly structural in nature, not actively participating in the valence or conduction bands. In this project the research team at the University of Southern California focuses on materials where the organic component is an active optical or electronic element, by making it a major contributor to the valance and/or conduction bands of the hybrid solid. The principle investigators develop new material design principles to promote enhanced charge transport of photoexcited carriers through the solid state. In the process, new understanding is achieved about how to align the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of organic dyes with the conduction or valence bands of the extended framework. The materials that are developed during this study act as model systems to investigate how localized excitons on the organic molecules can be transferred into the far more delocalized bands of the metal halide region of the crystal. The systematic investigation involves a combination of materials design, synthesis, Density Functional Theory calculations, and physical property measurement to answer fundamental questions about how the organic and inorganic components interact within the crystal structure. Additionally, the project engages undergraduates from the nearby Cerritos Community College (which is 54% Latino, 8% African American) and Native American High School students in the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current state-of-knowledge regarding the modeling of soft contact dynamics is still based on a 300-year-old concept of a coefficient of friction, which was developed to represent global frictional behavior of hard rough surfaces. This concept ignores local stick-slip instabilities that represent an important source of excitation for any dynamic system involving friction. The effort will contribute to the understanding of dynamics of rolling friction in soft-rigid interfaces by abandoning the principles formulated by Amontons and Coulomb for rigid body mechanics, and by introducing the modern perception of soft adhesive contact behavior into dynamics analysis. Soft rolling motion is ubiquitous in countless engineering applications ranging from vehicle tires to power transmission in belt drives, to soft robotic grasping. If successful, the effort will significantly increase the current understanding of these systems, leading to analysis and design that will reduce energy losses, noise pollution, loss of accuracy, wear, etc. associated with dynamic effects. Successful completion of the research will also introduce an alternative way of addressing contact problems in flexible dynamics simulation, which will significantly expand the capabilities of the computational dynamics research community. The project includes outreach activities to increase participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through K-12 internship and training opportunities in the investigators' labs.<br/><br/>This research will explore newly-uncovered nonlinear dynamics and instabilities associated with soft rolling contact, with the objective of posing new/incorporating appropriate first-principle models based on intermolecular (adhesive) and interatomic (viscous) interactions. Without employing the concept of a friction coefficient nor the assumption of local sliding, which are both long-held and in direct conflict with experimental observations, the approach will focus on introducing a coupling of the deterministic dynamic response of the rolling system to relative contact displacements associated with a local stochastic normal (adhesive) separation and out-of-contact tangential motion. From this conceptual context will emerge the observed nonlinear dynamics and global instabilities. Results from the predictive approach will be compared to elaborated experiments involving dynamic measurements of rolling friction, observation of contact area evolutions, and examination of deformations in the near-contact zone, while using materials having different adhesive and viscous properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to address an acute shortage of well-prepared grade 7-12 science teachers in Long Island and Queens, New York.  Building on lessons learned from the prior Adelphi Noyce project, this project shifts the focus to STEAM (STEM + Art and Design), which is intended to foster creativity through engagement with the arts and project-based learning.  This approach is expected to promote deeper understanding and facilitate the transfer of knowledge across STEM subjects.  The project will make use of the University's Makerspace, engage STEM majors working towards teaching certification in clinical practice at partner schools where STEAM is embedded through an interdisciplinary approach, and partner with two community-based organizations that offer STEAM programming.  At each clinical practice site, scholars will be paired with accomplished mentor teachers.  By preparing science teachers to use creative endeavors and Maker challenges to frame STEM learning, STEM may become more accessible to youth who are typically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The project aims to recruit, support, and prepare 24 science teachers, including those from typically underrepresented groups, to take STEM teaching positions in high-needs school districts.  Undergraduates working to obtain baccalaureate degrees in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, or environmental studies will be recruited through Adelphi's Scholar Teacher Education Program, a five-year, combined baccalaureate and master's program for students preparing to teach at the adolescent level.  They will receive Noyce support for the junior, senior, and master's years.  In addition, one year of support will be provided to STEM Professionals (i.e. graduates from STEM programs and/or career changers from STEM fields) as they earn Master of Arts in Education degrees with teacher certification.  This project is a partnership of Adelphi University, the Mineola Public Schools, New York City Department of Education/Queens High School for Teaching, Global Kids, Operation SPLASH, and Nassau Community College.  This project is designed to equip future science teachers with the knowledge and pedagogical skills needed to implement the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in their instruction.  Distinguishing elements of the preparation and induction program include the following four activities:  1) The STEAM Laboratory I, STEM into STEAM, is a course in which Noyce Scholars will explore and tinker with materials linked to the NGSS, including basic electronics, 3D printing, Arduino, LilyPad, Makey-Makeys, small motors, and green screens as they develop knowledge, skills and interest in integrating the arts into science instruction; 2) The STEAM Laboratory II, Computer Programming for Hackers and Makers, is an introductory computer programming course that takes advantage of the creative environment of the University's Makerspace to introduce students to big ideas in computer science and computational thinking;  3) The STEAM Summer Internship supports Scholars as they serve as informal education teachers for STEAM programming in the Long Island Flood Resiliency Solutions, Flood Mitigation Designs, Resilient Housing Solutions, and Water Quality Studies projects; and  4) The Scholar Learning Communities support continued professional development during Scholars' first two years of teaching, focusing on evidence-based instructional practices, developing and implementing new instructional ideas in their classrooms, and continued use of the Makerspace.  Knowledge generated by the project's research agenda focuses on the effectiveness of the STEAM-based model for science teacher preparation and may benefit other teacher preparation programs.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a field that deals with the study of algebraic varieties, that is, the solution set of a system of polynomial equations in several variables. For example, the parabola defined by the equation y=x^2 in the plane is smooth, meaning that  locally, at any point, it looks like a line, while the curve defined by the equation y^2=x^3 is not smooth at the origin (it looks like a cusp near the origin). The singular or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have very rich algebraic and geometric structures, and investigating their properties has many applications in other sciences and engineering. The projects that will be explored are the study of singular points of algebraic varieties (i.e., singularities), with a focus on measuring the singularities (e.g., assigning some invariant to compare them with each other) using the theory multiplier/test ideals and multiplicities. <br/><br/>The PI plans to develop a mixed characteristic singularity theory that is parallel to singularities in the minimal model program and tight closure theory from equal characteristic. This is motivated by the recent breakthrough of Yves Andre that solved Hochster's long-standing direct summand conjecture and the existence of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras. Together with Karl Schwede, the PI utilizes Andre`'s techniques from perfectoid algebras and spaces to start building such a theory, introducing a perfectoid version of multiplier/test ideals. There will be applications on the study of symbolic powers in mixed characteristic, as well as the study of family of singularities when the characteristic varies. Another research direction is the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities attached to singularities, with a focus on Lech's conjecture, Lech's inequality, and the Stuckrad--Vogel invariant. The PI has settled the dimension three equal characteristic case of the longstanding Lech's conjecture, and has recently settled the Stuckrad--Vogel conjecture (together with Klein, Pham, Smirnov and Yao). The proposed projects include attacking the higher dimensional case of Lech's conjecture by studying and improving the classical Lech's inequality. A related project is to investigate the relationship between multiplicity and colength for sufficiently deep ideals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary goal of the project is to increase the number of highly qualified middle and high school STEM teachers who are ready to teach in high-need urban and rural Pennsylvania schools.  Over a five-year period, this project plans to award 17 two-year scholarships to upper-division undergraduate STEM majors, who will be supported to complete their STEM degree and teaching certification.  In addition, the project plans to award 12 one-year stipends to post-baccalaureate STEM scholars, to support their attainment of teaching certification.  The Noyce Scholars will participate in rural and urban capstone field experiences at educational facilities specializing in Trauma Informed Care Models.  These experiences are expected to help the Scholars develop versatile skills that will be applicable in any school district.  While at the university and for the first three years after their employment at teachers, the Scholars will have STEM and teacher mentors and access to professional development opportunities.  These supports are expected to contribute to the Scholar's success as teachers and their retention in the teaching profession.  The training that the Scholars receive is designed to ensure that they can use effective teaching practices in their classrooms, thus improving their students' learning in STEM. <br/><br/>The project plans to recruit Scholars from three populations:  1) current STEM undergraduates at the University, who will be supported to earn both their STEM degree and a teaching certification; 2) community college students who will transfer to the University and will be supported to complete their STEM degree and teaching certification; and 3) post-baccalaureate scholars who will be supported to earn their teaching credential.  To accomplish recruitment goals, the University has developed collaborative relationships with Butler Community College, Jamestown Community College, and Allegheny Community College.  To broaden the teaching experience of the Noyce Scholars, it has also developed collaborations with rural school districts (Corry Area School District, Union City Area School District, and Penncrest School District) and diverse urban school districts (City of Erie School District and Pittsburgh School District).  As a result, Scholars will have both rural and urban classroom experiences prior to their employment as teachers. The project leadership team anticipates that studying the effects of recruiting and retaining students from urban upbringing and providing them with rural experiences (and vice versa) will provide unique pedagogical training for future STEM teachers.  Consequently, this project has the potential to be a model for other teacher-preparation universities who aim to provide training for multiple school environments.

The third meeting is tentatively planned for April 2020, with the location to be determined during the meeting on April 2019.  The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty. Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks. <br/><br/>A primary purpose of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to regularly convene Southeastern number theorists at all career stages and from all types of institutions at low cost to the participants. Participants and speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty. Efforts will be made to increase participation of undergraduates. Many participants come from institutions that do not award Ph.D. degrees. Such participants often have limited access to travel funds or to research seminars. The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings serve the purpose of integrating them into the larger research community. The organizers will also continue to try to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and racial and ethnic minorities. As a means of engaging undergraduates at host institutions, we will include an accessible Friday colloquium lecture by one of the plenary speakers. The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings are designed to both strengthen and invigorate the number theory community in the Southeast. By working together, its members can achieve more than by working alone.

Studies have shown that whether and how children defend their victimized peers has a significant impact on the adjustment of victims. Although much research has focused on individual factors and on class-level dynamics of victimization, less is known about the role of teachers. This project will examine the complex ways in which teachers' characteristics, practices, and actions affect (1) students' beliefs and attitudes; (2) the classroom ecology; and (3) victimization and defending behaviors. Future researchers will be able to use these findings to develop teacher training programs. Findings may also facilitate the development of anti-bullying policies and classroom management strategies.<br/><br/>The study will address the following research questions: What is the association between teaching practices and peer victimization? What is the association between teaching practices and students' desires to defend their victimized peers? How do teaching practices contribute to students' attitudes toward victimization, and are these associations a function of the quality of teacher-student relationships?  Social motivation theoretical models provide an important interpersonal context for socialization by teachers whereas social cognitive theory describes how socialization might contribute to student social cognition and the classroom climate. The researchers will examine reciprocal interactions between teachers and students in fourth and fifth grade classrooms. The project will use a short-term longitudinal design.  Multimethod (e.g., surveys, in-class observations) and multi-informant (teachers, students, trained observers) approaches will be used to gather unique data for multilevel analyses.

Recently, unexpected and exciting discoveries have been made in various condensed matter systems, such as devices made from two graphene sheets that can exhibit superconductivity when the two sheets are precisely stacked at a specific orientation with respect to one another. These systems offer unprecedented tunability and may represent the beginning of a new era of study in quantum many-body physics.

Wallace has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to work at the University of Cincinnati to examine how agricultural practices and changes in precipitation patterns affect nitrous oxide production along rivers. Some evidence suggests that fertilizers from agricultural activities near streams could contribute to the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, a process that has accelerated as human food and energy demands have increased. Surface water and groundwater mixing along rivers delivers this nitrogen to river beds and banks, where it stimulates the formation of nitrogen gases. The release may be influenced by the amount of rainfall, the characteristics of the soil, and type of land use. Through experimental, field work, and modeling activities, this work will study how streams contribute to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and how such emissions might change in the future. Results from this work will advance knowledge on how greenhouse gases are released to the atmosphere and will contribute to the development of management strategies to reduce these emissions. The postdoctoral fellow will also enhance graduate and undergraduate education by hosting a field and classroom-based course on the environmental effects of climate change and agriculture.<br/><br/><br/>As a redox process, the extent and magnitude of subsurface nitrogen cycling changes with nutrient availability and groundwater flow patterns. Subsequent nitrous oxide production is thus highly variable across spatial and temporal scales. The working hypotheses of this study include: (a) sediment heterogeneity increases subsurface nitrous oxide flux relative to a homogenous lithology in an otherwise analogous geochemical environment, and (b) climate change related shifts in precipitation patterns increase nitrous oxide flux along river corridors, creating a positive feedback loop that further stimulates climate change. The postdoctoral fellow will utilize the CV Theis Groundwater Observatory at the University of Cincinnati to evaluate the riparian aquifer adjacent to the Great Miami River at high spatial and temporal resolution and elucidate the hydrologic and geochemical controls on nitrous oxide yield from subsurface nitrogen cycling. These field measurements will inform numerical model development, which in turn will provide information on the influence of sediment heterogeneity and other factors on nitrous oxide production. Watershed-scale effects will be assessed by concomitantly using simulated future climate data and projected land use change to estimate nitrous oxide flux along river corridors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations can be thought of as dependence relations between physical quantities in some model, while the solution set of these equations describes the geometric shape of the model. Natural phenomena often come equipped with a rich symmetry, which is important to identify and incorporate into the modeling process. To imagine how equations, geometry and symmetry naturally fit together, one should think about lines and planes that are defined using linear equations and exhibit translational symmetries, or about circles and spheres that are described by quadratic equations and display rotational symmetries. For more complex systems, the degrees of the equations alone are not able to capture the geometry or the symmetries. The goal of this project is to systematically analyze (higher) relations between the equations defining elaborate systems, that are robust enough to accurately predict shapes and portray symmetries. The techniques developed by the PI will be used to study curves and configurations of linear spaces, polynomials and their factorization pattern, or spaces of matrices and higher dimensional tensors. Such spaces are not only important for the fundamental research in mathematics, but they also play a central role in applications throughout the sciences. The research is suitable for engaging students in research, as well as for computer experimentation and software development.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate a number of fundamental invariants in homological commutative algebra and classical algebraic geometry. An important emphasis will be on the study of problems that are concrete, exhibit a rich symmetry, and that touch upon a number of related fields within mathematics. The PI will continue to advance the theory and applications of Koszul modules, exploring their uses to group theory and to syzygies of curves, to hyperplane arrangements or to the homological theory of algebraic varieties. The PI will study homological invariants such as syzygies and Ext modules, regularity and projective dimension, local cohomology and Lyubeznik numbers, in the context of examining central objects such as determinantal and monomial ideals, Segre and Veronese varieties, binary forms, or representations with finitely many orbits.

The conference will be beneficial to the U.S. economy as well as to the regional and global economies, addressing the biological and environmental implications of nanoscale materials. Addressing the complex and critical issues surrounding the responsible development of nano-micromaterials is important for both society and the environment. Technological advancement has often resulted in the simultaneous emergence of adverse effects for either human health, the ecosystem or both. It is envisioned that this conference will provide an opportunity to discuss important research activities relating to the circular economy and sustainability in nanoscience and technology. Specifically, the conference will be a unique forum for leaders in government policy and scientific researchers to interface and dialogue with respect to the practical merits of this emerging field. It is expected that several hundred materials scientists and engineers, industrial partners, students, government officials, social and physical scientists, and toxicologists would attend this conference. This composition of participants will enable the promotion of dynamic discussion and facilitate the exchange of new ideas. The conference would support a minimum of twenty to thirty research students including females and those underrepresented within STEM fields.

Therefore, a new platform is to be established in the emerging areas of artificial intelligence- and data science- driving education and research, as well as repositioning the manufacturing sector to utilize the opportunities made available in cyber physical space (called the fourth industrial revolution). Hence, combining the tools and methodologies of nano-micromaterials with Circular Economy would provide a platform for furthering the capacities for recycle, redesign, remanufacture, reduce, and recover, as well as enable improved lifecycle engineering and assessment of sustainable nano materials. The current emphasis and focus within the U.S. on circular economy will enable this scientific meeting to propel the development of nano-micromaterials for circular economy towards achieving sustainable systems. The main topics which will be discussed are namely: regeneration of resources in sustainable nano-biotechnology, sustainable waste management, biological interactions of regenerated nanoscale materials, resource lifetime extension through nanotechnology, innovation and green economy, and nano-waste impact, will be focus areas. A specialized conference on circular economy and sustainable nano-micro materials, involving the best intellectuals in this area, will enable a more responsible approach to the development of this technology to be outlined for U.S. researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These services rely on the transfer of water between a river channel and floodplain surface during flooding events, also known as hydrologic exchange flows. Floodplain vegetation plays a particularly important role in controlling river-floodplain hydraulics and hydrologic exchange flows, and therefore can influence many floodplain services and channel stability. However, most river restoration efforts rarely consider the influences of floodplain vegetation because we do not adequately understand the hydraulic controls of vegetation on stable restoration designs nor the degree to which vegetation influences exchange flows and floodplain services. Therefore, the goal for this research is to improve our understanding of the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation on hydrodynamics in restored meandering channels and on hydrologic exchange flows that are important for floodplain services. <br/><br/>To meet the above stated goal, this research targets accomplishing the following core objectives: (1) advance conceptual knowledge of the vegetation-flow hydrodynamics related to momentum exchange in meandering channels with natural bed topography; (2) investigate the influence of floodplain vegetation on hydrologic exchange flows on floodplain surfaces; and (3) evaluate relationships between channel hydrodynamics and hydrologic exchange flows on floodplain surfaces pertaining to river-floodplain restoration design. This research will address these objectives using a combination of flume experiments and numerical modeling that are linked to characteristics of local river restoration projects. Flume experiments will be conducted to explore the hydrodynamics of overbank flows in meandering channels while systematically varying floodplain vegetation characteristics. Hydraulic measurements collected during the flume experiments will be used to better understand the influence of floodplain vegetation and channel bedform on in-channel and floodplain hydraulic conditions during overbank flows, including distributions of secondary currents, turbulence characteristics, and hydrologic exchange flows. Results from the flume experiments will be used to inform numerical modeling. The numerical and physical experiments will be complemented by the collection and analysis of field data from local restoration sites on the Cache la Poudre River, Colorado. Work conducted in this research will closely involve the City of Fort Collins, which has already spent nearly $10 million on restoration investments on the local Poudre River and has large goals for transforming the Poudre to provide a greater connection between natural and human systems along the river. This research will engage with stakeholders by participating in numerous local outreach events, including the Poudre River Fest and the City's ""The Science Behind the Scenery"" program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the many problems that arises is how neurons are ""barcoded""; that is, how they distinguish self from non-self. This ability is essential since, without it, there would be nothing to prevent neurons from forming connections (synapses) with themselves, essentially creating a short circuit within the brain. The fundamental goal of this project is to understand how neurons are barcoded. Neuron-neuron recognition is mediated by protein-protein interactions. This project focuses on members of the Clustered Protocadherins (Pcdh) protein family that establish a unique identity for individual vertebrate neurons allowing them to distinguish ""self"" from ""non-self"".  The research will involve computer simulations, biophysical measurements, and high-resolution microscopy experiments to experimentally validate and describe the barcoding mechanism in cells.   A particularly important element of the research is the development of scientists with expertise in both computational and experimental work. The training of women and minority scientists is an integral component of the proposed research program. Both undergraduate and graduate minority students trained to be on a trajectory to become highly successful research scientists. <br/> <br/>The main objective of the project is to advance understanding of the molecular basis of neuron-neuron recognition. Cell-cell interactions are mediated by protein-protein interactions and the long-range goal of the research is to understand the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, how do protein-protein interactions involving cell surface proteins mediate highly specific cell-cell interactions. Given the complexity of the nervous system, neuron-neuron interactions offer a unique challenge in this regard. The research focuses on the clustered Protocadherins (Pcdhs) that establish a unique identity for individual vertebrate neurons allowing them to distinguish ""self"" from ""non-self"". These are neuronal barcoding proteins. The research involves computational studies to determine how homophilic specificity is coded on Pcdh-Pcdh interfaces, the design of mutants to test the hypotheses that are generated, and their testing experimentally. A second focus of the research is to elucidate the molecular basis of neuronal barcoding. A novel chain termination mechanism based on the assembly of crystalline-like ""molecular zippers"" in cell-cell interfaces has been proposed and is consistent with all available experimental data. The model will now be explored with multi-scale simulations, and in vitro and in vivo experimental studies. Notably, the model introduces new concepts in the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition.

In this regard, all-carbon materials such as plastics are attractive, but they lack the electrical transport ability of traditional metals.  Unlike metals, carbon-based plastics are rarely perfectly structured (crystalline). Their disorder makes it difficult to determine how electricity flows through them, a necessary first step in improving their electrical performance. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Aaron Massari of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is using sophisticated laser techniques to study the movement of electrical charges through complex molecular materials that could act as future electrical conductors.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project supports a training environment for undergraduate and graduate students that produces next-generation scientists who are skilled in benchtop chemistry, but also electrical, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques. Ultimately, the research may not only lead to new perspectives on existing problems, but also inform the rational design of electrical materials  leading to devices that are less toxic and require less energy to produce. Professor Massari serves as the Director of the Energy and U Show, which brings science to over 10,000 3rd-6th graders each year. The show is filled with vibrant scientific demonstrations and the First Law of Thermodynamics.  For many, the event introduces the idea of attending college for the first time as more than half of the attendees are members of underrepresented groups.  Professor Massari also directs the chemistry portion of the University on the Prairie program, where he and his research group travel to work with 60 students in grades 7-12 and their teachers from rural, geographically isolated portions of the state.  These outreach and educational activities encourage STEM careers. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the roles of structural parameters, such as polymorphism, donor-acceptor spacing, partial charge transfer, and covalent attachment of molecular dopants, in the transport of charge through ground-state doped molecular thin films.  The measurements leverage the ability of two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy to isolate the rates of charge transfer within specific molecular geometries from highly heterogeneous chemical environments. Short pulses of infrared light excite molecular vibrations on neutral and charge (doped) molecules in a film and then a second pair of pulses probe the evolution of that excitation as a marker for the location of the charge as a function of time.  Resolving the vibrational spectrum into a second dimension allows one to monitor the kinetics of charge transfer for specific molecular configurations independent of the others so that the transport kinetics can themselves be resolved.  The work systematically tests the impact of microscopic molecular spacing and order on macroscopic electrical transport by using molecules with particular structural modifications that affect their packing in known ways. Electrical transport is also driven in-situ in samples while they are characterized by 2D-IR spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fortunately, HIV can be effectively managed if people of HIV can be identified and their virus is controlled to undetectable levels by antiretroviral therapy. Increasing access to routine viral load testing can help reduce the treatment failure rate by early detection of viral rebound caused by either drug resistance or poor therapy adherence. To this end, HIV self-testing, a process in which individual who wants to know HIV status collects a specimen, performs a test and interprets the result in private, has become an empowering and innovative approach. Existing HIV self-testing methods rely almost exclusively on lateral flow based test to detect host antibody response to HIV infection. They could miss a significant portion of asymptomatic individuals during the 6-12 weeks of early infection window; they also lack the ability for detection of viral rebound. Nucleic acid testing is currently the only method for viral load quantification. Nevertheless, its use by laypersons is limited due to the sample handling and assay complexity. The proposed research has the potential to significantly enhance the treatment outcomes for individuals of HIV under antiretroviral therapy. In addition, with educational and outreach activities, the proposed research is well positioned to enhance the integrative learning experience and to engage multidisciplinary students at many levels.<br/><br/>The primary research objective of this proposal is to explore an ultra-compact quantitative nucleic acid testing (NAT) on a disposable microfluidic chip with a USB analyzer to detect HIV-1 viral rebound that is simple enough for laypersons to test themselves to monitor treatment adherence. The goal is to develop and validate a whole blood-based test that can semi-quantitatively assess the presence of HIV-1 RNA at cell concentrations as low as 1000 copies/ml. The test can be performed similarly to a home blood glucose test with a single step of finger-prick blood loading. To this end, four research tasks regarding the microfluidic sample preparation, amplification assay, USB analyzer integration, and analytical validation will be pursued. Task 1. Automated microfluidic sample preparation. A streamlined microfluidic chip for automated plasma separation and RNA extraction from whole blood will be developed. Task 2. An HIV-1 Real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay will be optimized and the lowest possible limit of detection will be explored. Task 3. Analyzer integration and small-scale prototyping. The analyzer hardware and software will be developed and integrated for easy and robust operation. Task 4. Laboratory validation with control samples. The prototyped device will be validated in lab settings using HIV-1 plasma samples spiked into whole blood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease. It is a consequence of a repeated concussions and traumatic brain injuries, such as those experienced by athletes in high-contact sports. A brain with CTE gradually deteriorates and loses mass. The disease not only deteriorates skills necessary for daily life (e.g. memory, self-control, time-management, focus); but it also causes much bigger mental problems (e.g. strong suicidal thoughts, depression, cognitive and thinking problems, anxiety, violent/abusive behavior, dementia) which become worse over time. The main issue with CTE is that it can only be diagnosed after death. Therefore, early detection is impossible, and prevention relies on monitoring individual impacts.  While there have been significant efforts in the development of helmets with capabilities of measuring head injuries in athletes, current technologies come with limitations and inaccuracies that are inherent to the approaches and transduction mechanisms used. For example, current approaches consists on using an array of accelerometers that are physically connected to the helmet, and trigger data collection whenever any of the accelerometers measures an acceleration beyond certain threshold. The main limitation of this approach is that it relies on accelerator-based sensors attached to the helmet's not the athlete's head. Thus, the sliding that can occur between the helmet and the head makes it difficult to predict how the brain moves inside the skull. The resonance of the micro-mechanical structures inside the MEMS-based accelerometers are within the range of head motion frequencies; which has been found to cause large errors when measuring the peak angular accelerations. The proposed work is aimed at developing a reliable, robust, flexible patch that overcomes the sliding problems and frequency issues present in the current technologies by developing a reliable patch monitor that is in direct contact with the athlete's head and does not rely on suspended micrometer structures to measure acceleration.  A 2-week summer activity for high-school students will be developed as part of this project.  Undergraduate students and high-school teachers from the summer research opportunities program and research experience for teachers site at MSU will participate. This program will also help to motivate talented underrepresented student from The University of Puerto Rico to continue graduate studies.<br/><br/>Three Major Research Tasks have been designed to start at the device level, continue with system integration, and finalize with a validation process. In the first task, we will perform fundamental studies on the integration of PPFE films with carbon nanotube-based thin films as electrodes of a flexible patch; where a mechanical impact will produce an electrical signal from which the force and acceleration of the mechanical impact will be extracted. The use of CNT films (instead of metal electrodes) is aimed at eliminating issues due to metal electrode cracking and enabling a reliable patch. The second task we will look for integration of the patch into a reliable, self-powered wireless transmitter, from which the information of the mechanical impact can be extracted. The third task looks for the validation of the developed patch, where the device will characterized and compared to a benchmark to confirm its performance. The idea is that the final patch can produce and transmit signals that provide a comprehensive representation of the impact; and from which the severity of an impact on the human body (particularly the head) can be assessed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example of a compact group would be the surface of a sphere. The PI will conduct reading courses on the subjects related to this project. One of the important features of this project is its connections with many areas of  mathematics. And this can help students to see what kind of mathematics makes them more excited.

This specific interaction between molecules often arises from a blend of both strong and weak forces that control the orientation of the component building blocks.  While strong interactions have achieved considerable attention, chemical features that produce less manageable motifs via less well defined or weak contacts are also important to the overall molecular recognition process.  Molecular shape is one such feature.  This program, directed by Professor Kraig Wheeler and anchored by a research team of undergraduate students at Whitworth University, creates target molecules that align to form crystals by using the structural feature of molecular shape.  A central aim of the research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, is to develop diverse families of materials that exploit the shape space of components that form predetermined assemblies.  This basic research may open the door for the future design of functional solids via exploiting molecular properties of the building blocks.

The manner in which molecules organize into energetically favorable solids often relates to complementary electrostatic non-bonded contacts and best-fit scenarios.  This research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, focuses on understanding structural boundaries of molecular shape to the molecular recognition process by using the quasiracemate approach for constructing bimolecular solid compounds.  Chiral building blocks formulated from known organic precursors will be synthesized via amino acid, carboxylamide, and naphthyl derivatives.  While the study of quasiracemic materials has now progressed to an established science, the intimate details of assembling pairs of quasienantiomers remains relatively unknown.  This proposal explores how increasing crystal lattice stabilization via charge-assisted non-bonded contacts and an increased size of molecular framework effectively allows for greater structural variation of the quasienantiomeric components.  Lattice energy calculations combined with crystallographic, video-assisted thermomicroscopy, and calorimetric studies will be used to assess the ability of these materials to form quasiracemic assemblies.  The research group seeks a systematic understanding of the definition of ""isostructural"" in the context of quasiracemate formation that may prove useful for probing the topological features responsible for molecular recognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In such systems, implants can measure critical physical and physiological parameters, such as mobility, heart rate, neural activity, and chemistry. Based on this data, the system can act to prevent the onset of critical health events or treat diseases in many applications, such as drug delivery, closed-loop neural prostheses, etc. For this vision to be successful, a paradigm shift from conventional standalone highly invasive implants to wirelessly connected networks of miniaturized implants (i.e., Internet of Implantable Things) is of paramount importance. Multiple unresolved challenges exist within current state-of-the-art techniques for intra-body communication that includes radio frequency, inductive, ultrasound, and human body communication. These challenges are: high power consumption, short communication range, low data rate, and large implantable transmitter/receiver transducers. Novel micro-scale implantable methods that enable low-power intra-body communication across long distances (meter) at Mega bits-per-second (Mbps) rates are needed. The proposed research will demonstrate a unique building block for a comprehensive set of wirelessly connected minimally invasive implants that will enable real-time healthcare monitoring and therapies. It will open opportunity for conducting unprecedented neuroscience and electrophysiology experiments that address the most basic questions about the complex nervous system. This program also includes a significant educational and outreach component by taking advantage of the multidisciplinary nature of the research to impact K12 teachers and students, minorities, and undergraduate and graduate students. K-12 teachers and students will be hosted in summers and supported with multidisciplinary classroom research projects, engineering modules, and hands-on opportunities closely coupled to the proposed research.  <br/><br/>The proposed Internet of Implantable Things are envisioned to be minimally invasive, fully wireless, and highly connected to address existing challenges within current state-of-the-art techniques for intra-body communication, such as high-power consumption, short communication range, low data rate, and bulky transmitters/receivers. The main objective of this program is to enable wideband, long-range, and low power wireless communication among a network of miniaturized biomedical implants through the use of MHz-range magnetic fields coupled with implantable micro-scale magnetoelectric transducers. The overarching target is to simultaneously provide several Mbps data rate and whole-body communication range with pico-joule-per-bit (pJ/bit) level of energy consumption while dramatically reducing the implant's size. Low-frequency magnetic fields are attractive because of their very low absorption in human tissue and safety. Systematic investigations will be conducted to understand the fundamental behavior of implantable micro-scale magnetoelectric transducers operating at tens of MHz and interfaced with custom-designed pulse-based transceiver circuits for energy-efficient and robust intra-body communication. Effects related to implants' crosstalk, alignment, orientation, and tissue interaction uncertainties in ambulatory subjects will be overcome through innovative magnetoelectric transducer and circuit design. Extensive characterization will be conducted to elucidate the influence of material microstructure and anisotropy, transducer operating mode, alignment, orientation, and tissue interactions on the performance. High accuracy computational and circuit models for magnetoelectric transducers at different tissue medium will be developed and experimentally validated, which will serve as a basis for broad range of system design. The program will provide foundational basis for a novel modulation technique, termed Ultrasound Harmonic Modulation, along with a transceiver chip for micro-scale magnetoelectric transducers. This will lead to a first-in-class micro-scale implantable platform for channelized energy-efficient meter-range communication at safe MHz-range frequencies. System-level demonstrations with different magnetoelectric transducers (dimensional range of 0.1-1 millimeter) and frequencies (10-100 MHz) enabling communication up to meter range at Mbps with pJ/bit power consumption will establish the fundamental basis for the Internet of Implantable Things.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inland waters are a crucial component of the global carbon cycle because they transport organic carbon from soils to oceans; bury it in sediments; and release it as carbon dioxide, yet the natural processes that oxidize organic carbon to carbon dioxide in inland waters are not well understood. This project will characterize one of the most important yet poorly constrained of these processes, the oxidation of dissolved organic carbon in sunlight when iron is present. This research, which links these mechanisms at the molecular level to broad climatic changes, will be used to inform undergraduate lesson plans that link chemical principles to earth sciences processes. Undergraduates will be engaged in summer research internships and expose them to innovative techniques in the earth sciences. The postdoctoral fellow will benefit from broadening her research perspective and methods as well as the mentoring experience gained for her future career.<br/> <br/>Complexation with iron can enhance the reactivity of organic carbon with light, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide.

People on the autism spectrum are very capable of leading productive lives and have interests and abilities that can enable them to make valuable contributions to their communities. For example, research shows that young people with autism who go to college choose science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors at higher rates than college students in the general population. With one out of every 59 people in the United States on the autism spectrum, it is essential to create programs that prepare this segment of the population for full participation in the workforce so our society can benefit from the unique perspectives they have to offer. This project scales up an Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) project called IDEAS: Inventing, Designing, and Engineering on the Autism Spectrum, in which a multidisciplinary team adapted a museum-based maker program and tested it in three autism inclusion middle schools in New York City. The project will build on the lessons learned from that project to bring maker programming to a wider range of students, teachers, and schools, and to increase the education community's understanding about how maker programming can help young people on the autism spectrum gain the social, functional, and communication skills necessary for careers in design and engineering. <br/><br/>The goals of the project are (1) to expand the program to more autism inclusion middle schools, (2) to expand the program to autism inclusion elementary and high schools, (3) to make the program sustainable by facilitating local adaptation in autism inclusion schools, (4) to shift the ownership of the program to autism inclusion schools and the city's professional development providers and special education office, and (5) to explore more broadly how making can support autism inclusion efforts in general. To achieve these goals, we will establish a collaborative co-design process that will include current partners (Education Development Center, New York University's Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Nest Support Project, New York Hall of Science), as well as autism inclusion schools (teachers and principals) and an advisor from the New York City Department of Education's Special Education Office. By the end of this three-year project, there will be 12 Maker Programs run by 24 teachers, reaching approximately 150,180 students on and off the spectrum each year. The team also will explore what it will take to sustain such a program and to build the capacity of the ASD Nest Support Project to have engineering design maker programming available beyond the life of this grant to the other districts to which their autism inclusion model is expanding. These activities will build knowledge in the larger special education and informal education communities about how making can enhance autism inclusion efforts and eventually increase the participation of young people on the autism spectrum in STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Up to now, however, most of the research has focused on collinear antiferromagnetic systems.  Spin current phenomena in non-collinear antiferromagnetic systems remain largely unexplored.  Very recent theoretical work has uncovered new phenomena in non-collinear antiferromagnets Mn3X, where X is Sn, Ga, or Ge.  These include an unusual spin Hall effect, a strong spin Nernst effect, and electric manipulation of antiferromagnetic ordering.  The heart of this program is the timely experimental elucidation of these phenomena and their use in prototype devices.  The studies will largely promote the understanding of spin-related phenomena in non-colinear antiferromagnets and will thereby significantly advance the research field of antiferromagnetic spintronics. From a technological perspective, the proposed research will have significant implications for the future development of magnetic memory, spin-torque nano-oscillators, and spin-wave logic and will therefore have a major impact on future advanced electronic systems.  Two undergraduate students and two graduate students per year will participate in film growth, nanofabrication, electrical transport and high-frequency measurements, and data analysis. Outreach to high schools will be accomplished through the Colorado State University 'Little Shop of Physics' and the 'summer Research and Engineering Apprenticeship"" Programs.<br/><br/>The program consists of three main research thrusts.  Thrust I will focus on a rather unusual spin Hall effect in Mn3Sn.  A normal spin Hall effect can convert a longitudinal charge current to a transverse spin current whose polarization is orthogonal to the spin flow direction.  In stark contrast, the transverse spin current produced by the unusual spin Hall effect has a polarization that is along the spin flow direction.  This unusual phenomenon will be demonstrated through two distinct approaches.  Further, the effect will be used to induce magnetization switching, drive magnetization precession, and excite spin waves in ferromagnetic thin films with perpendicular anisotropy.  None of these effects can be achieved, in principle, with spin currents produced by the normal spin Hall effect, the Rashba effect, or topological surface states.  Thrust II will focus on the spin Nernst effect, a process in which one uses a thermal gradient to produce pure spin currents.  Recent experiments have revealed this effect in Pt.  Very recent theoretical work indicates that the effect can also occur in Mn3X and can be significantly stronger than in Pt.  Thrust II will elucidate these predicted strong spin Nernst effect for Mn3X films.  It is also planned to use this effect for spin-orbit torque-induced magnetization switching in ferromagnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy.  Thrust III will focus on the control of antiferromagnetic ordering in Mn3X.  Work is planned to manipulate antiferromagnetic states using damping-like and field-like spin-orbit torques and move domain walls through spin transfer torque. While theory suggests that such ordering control is feasible, this has not yet been demonstrated experimentally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for workers with the skills to design and create products using additive manufacturing technologies is also increasing. To help meet this need, Chippewa Valley Technical College will work with industry partners and secondary schools to develop new courses related to additive manufacturing, which is also called 3D printing. A Fabrication Laboratory (Fab Lab) facility will be created to provide students with hands-on learning opportunities. Students will have the opportunity to learn about the processes, materials, and design approaches used in additive manufacturing and to develop the skills needed to create items using those approaches. The knowledge and skills they develop, in turn, will prepare students for high-demand technician careers in manufacturing industries. The Fab Lab will also be available as a space for local entrepreneurs and makers to explore the use of modern equipment and technology. It is expected that the project will contribute to increasing the number of skilled technicians for the regional and national manufacturing workforce.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to: 1) prepare manufacturing technicians with skills in additive manufacturing processes and concepts; and 2) increase the capability of secondary school teachers to teach additive manufacturing topics. Course content for five modules on additive manufacturing will be developed to augment the Manufacturing Engineering Technologist and Mechanical Design associate degree programs at the college. These modules will cover topics such as material properties, metal additive manufacturing, design principles, and quality assurance for digital manufacturing. The new Fab Lab high-quality makerspace will be equipped with multiple types of 3D printers (including thermoplastic, stereolithography, composite material, and metal 3D printers) and a 3D laser scanner. Students will participate in a capstone experience that incorporates project-based learning on real-world projects that allow students to work collaboratively with industry partners. Course modules with appropriate content for middle and high school students will also be developed. All students will have the opportunity to earn industry-recognized credentials after completing the modules. Secondary school teachers will have access to faculty mentors and professional development workshops, to help them work with the Fab Lab equipment and integrate the modules and course activities into their curriculum. The project includes evaluation by an external expert.  Results of this evaluation could inform other institutions about effective approaches to recruiting and educating technicians for additive manufacturing jobs.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Products based on deep learning have already made real-life impact in face recognition, machine translation, and shown promise for more applications such as self-driving cars. However, despite the practical success of deep learning, theoretical understanding for why these algorithms work has been scarce. One of the main difficulties in understanding deep learning algorithms is that these algorithms need to solve very complicated optimization problems that try to find out what are the best ways for the neurons to be connected. In the most general form, these optimization problems are known to be intractable. This research project will identify properties of the real-world problems that make these problems special and tractable, and provide new optimization algorithms with theoretical guarantees that are applicable to deep learning. The materials developed in the project will be disseminated through conferences and workshops that try to connect different research communities, and used to create new machine learning courses. The algorithms designed in the project will also be implemented in standard deep learning frameworks and made publicly available.<br/><br/>The specific approach of this project revolves around the new concept of optimization landscape. For an optimization problem, its optimization landscape includes clear understanding of the location and values of its local and global optimal solutions. The research goals are divided into three categories. First, the research project will focus on a class of locally optimizable functions for which local minima are all globally optimal. The research project will develop simple and efficient algorithms for optimizing such functions, as well as a new framework to prove several problems of practical interest are locally optimizable. Second, the project will develop stronger optimization algorithms that can work even when the optimization landscape is not as ideal. Finally, the research will focus on optimization problems that arise in deep learning and show how the techniques developed in the previous two parts can be applied. These projects will bring more theoretical insights into the heuristics for training neural networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classically symmetries of a physical system are described by algebraic objects known as groups, which act on the observables of the system. In quantum systems, however, the observables are described by noncommutative operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras). In this setting a new kind of symmetry emerges. The algebraic objects that naturally arise are called tensor categories, and have proved to be very successful at describing symmetries of low dimensional quantum field theories, topological phases of matter, and quantum statistical mechanics. The goal of this project is to apply the theory of tensor categories to understand the relationship between noncommutative operator algebras, as well as exploring the role of tensor categories in low dimensional quantum systems.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three main problems. The first is to use tensor categories to classify and construct discrete inclusions of von Neumann algebras building on recent progress in this area, furthering the work of the PI with David Penneys and with Shamindra K. Ghosh. The second is the study of Alain Connes' chi invariant for finite von Neumann algebras from the point of view of braided tensor categories. We propose a generalization of this invariant using non-invertible bimodules, along with new methods of computation of this invariant that will allow us to distinguish previously indistinguishable classes of von Neumann algebras. Finally, we investigate the algebraic process of gauging braided tensor categories, which described the interaction between quantum and classical symmetry in topological phases of condensed matter systems. This is an important construction from the physical point of view, but mathematically difficult to understand. The primary problem for this project is to establish the  existence of gauged categories in physically relevant situations such as permutation symmetry, generalizing the results of the PI with Terry Gannon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ranging from image, audio and video to social-network, medical and biological datasets, modern applications require us to model and reason about complex data over extremely large domains. It is well-known, however, that this cannot be done in a rigorous manner unless simplifying assumptions can be made about how the data of interest are generated. Accordingly, a long line of investigation in Probability Theory, Statistical Physics, Information Theory and Machine Learning has been preoccupied with developing mathematical and algorithmic frameworks that allow for succinct representation and inference of high-dimensional distributions with simplifying structure. This project will go beyond the standard frameworks in these fields to advance the theoretical foundations of a research frontier that has recently emerged as a promising approach towards a more accurate modeling of high-dimensional data. In particular, this project will study the theoretical foundations of learning, testing and statistical inference of high-dimensional data that are generated by deep neural network-based generative models, developing mathematically rigorous quality guarantees, which is a big desideratum in the field of deep learning. On the practical front, this work has the potential to significantly improve the performance of image-reconstruction algorithms compared to state-of-the-art, and therefore to have significant impact on various applications of image reconstruction such as rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br/><br/>Since the introduction of deep neural network-based generative models, there have been numerous approaches for how to architect them, how to train them using samples from a distribution of interest, and how to use them for downstream inference tasks; these have delivered impressive practical results. On the other hand, there has also been a lot of debate around the quality of deep generative models that are trained via current techniques, and it has been recognized that there are significant challenges in optimizing, evaluating and scaling the dimensionality of deep generative models, as well as in using them for data recovery. This project develops three research thrusts targeting these challenges, namely: (i) developing better algorithms for training deep generative models, and for using these models as ""regularizers"" in signal-processing applications; (ii) developing statistical techniques for evaluating the quality of a deep generative model against the distribution whose samples it was trained on; (iii) proposing architectures and algorithms for scaling up the dimensionality of deep generating models while providing statistical accuracy guarantees. This work will rely on techniques from non-convex and combinatorial optimization, signal processing, game theory, high-dimensional statistics, and statistical physics, and build connections between these fields and deep learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The P.I. will primarily study functions which are natural relatives to modular forms called mock modular and quantum modular forms, and harmonic Maass forms.  Modular forms are among the most fundamental objects in the area of number theory in mathematics. For example, they are central to the Riemann Hypothesis (1859), so significant a conjecture  that the Clay Mathematics Institute is offering one million dollars to anyone who can solve it.  Major developments in the theory of modular forms were also crucial to the 1995 proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (1637), a conjecture which defeated mathematicians for 358 years. Beyond number theory, modular forms also yield applications to the diverse areas of combinatorics, mathematical physics, cryptography,  and more.  The newer related theories of harmonic Maass forms and mock modular forms have evolved substantially over the last 10-15 years, and have opened the door to many new applications and significant results;  a comprehensive theory is still lacking, however.  Moreover, within the last few years, the relatively new subject of quantum modular forms has shown intriguing connections to other areas including topology, mathematical physics, representation theory, combinatorics, and more.  <br/><br/>The P.I. will study the theory and applications of harmonic Maass forms, mock modular forms, quantum modular forms and related functions.  An overarching question is to understand the various roles played by the holomorphic parts of harmonic Maass forms and related automorphic objects in mathematics and number theory.  Methods include tools from the theory of harmonic Maass forms, aspects of the developing theory of quantum modular forms, transformation and other properties of mock modular and mock Jacobi forms,  zeta functions, analytic properties of Mordell and Eichler integrals, theta functions, and combinatorial q-hypergeometric series.  The relatively new subject of quantum  modular forms in particular has shown rich connections to other areas including harmonic Maass forms, Eichler integrals, radial limits and mock modular forms, combinatorics, partial theta functions, Jacobi forms, topology, and vertex algebras, many of which are included within the scope of this proposal.

The conferences bring together people from diverse areas including graphical and web user interfaces, tangible and ubiquitous computing, virtual and augmented reality, multimedia, new input and output devices, and CSCW. Researchers and developers, from both academia and industry, meet to exchange ideas and present reports on new hardware and/or software advances related to these areas.  UIST 2019 will be held in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 20 -23.  More information about this year's conference is available online at http://uist.acm.org/uist2019/.  The Student Innovation Contest is intended to serve as a catalyst to increase participation of students and junior researchers from diverse backgrounds, due to its accessibility and strong visibility at the conference. This funding will supplement the existing program of the Student Innovation Contest, which is a collaboration between industry (supplying hardware and software) and academia (supplying the general framing and mentoring). The organizers want to increase the attractiveness of the conference for students and researchers from currently underrepresented socio-economic groups. To this end, these funds will be used to support travel and conference expenses of U.S.-based students from groups that would otherwise lack sufficient means to attend.  The organizers will aim to include teams from diverse cultural and institutional backgrounds, with equal representation of genders.  To further increase participant socio-economic diversity, the requested funds will allow the financial support of only one team per educational institution.<br/><br/>The Student Innovation Contest will help shape future research projects aimed at technological<br/>advancement in HCI. The event will promote scholarship and networking among new researchers in this interdisciplinary area. The contest will give students and new researchers constructive feedback on their work, and will expose these promising young researchers to a larger international community. A key component of building this community is through its youth. The Student Innovation Contest brings students together from various backgrounds (e.g., engineering, computing, design, architecture) so that they can see the broader spectrum of research and development approaches.  For the contest, students will receive specific hardware to develop innovative systems and showcase their work at UIST 2019 as demonstrations.  The contest's objectives are to allow promising students and young researchers to showcase their work and technical skills at an internationally renowned conference through an evening-long event and gather feedback from experts in the field, to get access to a large network of researchers and practitioners in the field of HCI and build and expand their own network, to enable these junior researchers to attend the entirety of the UIST 2019 conference, and to support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on academic, research, industrial, and nontraditional career paths.  The Student Innovation Contest will provide an opportunity for student participants to demonstrate their technical and creative skills to a large number of internationally renowned HCI experts, and to create a network of peers that includes both researchers and practitioners. The event will also offer participating teams the opportunity to attend the full conference and allow them to explore the diversity of the research that composes the UIST community. Evaluation of the Student Innovation Contest, and its organization, will be conducted, and the results of the evaluation will be made available to the organizers of future conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The arrangement of plastic molecules at interfaces between layers can determine whether the device performs well. However, there is currently limited knowledge of how such arrangements govern device performance. In this project, solar cells and light emitters printed from plastic inks are studied. These devices have important interfaces where power is generated and light is emitted. This project involves varying the arrangement of the molecules at these interfaces, monitored by powerful X-ray techniques. Correspondingly, power- and light-generating processes are measured and related to the arrangement of the molecules. The result will be a new capability to tailor molecule arrangements at interfaces to maximize device performance. Such a capability will enable flexible and printable technologies to dramatically reduce the cost of energy. Students involved in this project will take part in the Science Ambassadors Program by developing a plastic solar cell lab for high school students. This activity will demonstrate both the fundamental science and the potential of these technologies. The interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the project will provide the students with expertise to communicate diverse viewpoints that will be required of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Optoelectronic properties in printable organic devices could be tailored for revolutionary applications through simple processing techniques that engineer interfacial structures, but there is a gap in knowledge to realize this goal. This gap is due to the difficulty in quantitatively resolving buried organic interfacial nanostructure and directly correlating this to fundamental device processes. In the proposed work, a suite of recently developed resonant X-ray nanoprobes will be used to quantify molecular orientation, aggregation, and mixing local to buried organic interfaces. These measurements will be combined with advanced studies of excited state structure and dynamics on the exact same device - eliminating uncertainties related to sample variability. The objective is to define quantitative relationships on how molecular ordering at buried organic junctions controls excited state dynamics connected to performance.

However, arbitrarily high data rates, low delays and high reliabilities cannot be achieved simultaneously over noisy and time-varying wireless channels. This research will seek to characterize, in a technology-agnostic manner, the fundamental (Delay, Reliability, Rate) tradeoffs in communications over the last-hop of wireless networks, where one base-station wishes to communicate independent messages to many users. The results will provide fundamental performance benchmarks and algorithmic prototypes for industries working towards these ambitious goals. The project also seeks to broaden participation through activities designed to increase enrollment and engagement of students from under-represented groups in computing.<br/><br/>The (Delay, Reliability, Rate) tradeoffs will be characterized from information and communication theoretic perspectives. From an information theoretic perspective, the capacity region has long been the central focus, characterizing the number of messages that can be reliably (with vanishingly small probability of error) be communicated to the users simultaneously as the number of channel uses (and hence delay) tends to infinity. Such metrics ignore latency constraints present in practical systems. This research aims to characterize the set of messages that can be communicated to each user in a broadcast setting when the delay is finite and one tolerates some error. Transmission schemes must be carefully re-thought to incorporate these latency and reliability constraints, in particular when the channels to the users change over time as in a wireless channel. The information theoretic study will be complemented by more practically motivated communication theoretic (Delay Reliability, Rate) tradeoffs for the tractable multi-layer erasure channel (that extends simple erasure channels studied in the communications and networking communities) and then the practically relevant Gaussian fading broadcast channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The knowledge obtained is  applicable to other important chemical reactions relevant to alternative energy production and storage technologies.  The project seeks to develop a unique microscopy technique that allows for the high-resolution imaging of the reactive site.  This imaging is conducted using two techniques: transmission electron microscopy (for atomic-scale structural information) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (for electrochemical information).  Correlating the data of the two complementary techniques provides information on the nature of the catalytic nanosheet edges, defects and atomic steps.  The information is needed to understand the catalytic activity of these materials.  The project provides training for a diverse group of students in renewable energy related science and technology, including mathematical modeling and data processing and mining.  Area middle school students are exposed to science research through hand-on experience in the investigators' laboratories. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this collaborative research is to visualize and quantify active sites on two-dimensional (2D) catalyst surfaces via high-resolution (i.e., equal or less than 10 nm) reactivity mapping by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in combination with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques.  By using very small nanoelectrode probes and significantly increasing the SECM resolution the researchers map and quantitatively measure activities of the nanosheet edges, defects and atomic steps on 2D electrocatalysts and assess the effects of phase transformations and surface functionalization.  The methodology is developed for multi-technique imaging of the same nanoscale portion of the catalytic surface to obtain spatially resolved mechanistic information about heterogeneous processes on 2D electrocatalysts.  The nature of the active sites is elucidated by correlating the SECM activity maps with atomic scale structural and bonding information obtained by STEM and spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) with one-to-one correspondence.  These approaches investigate two important classes of 2D materials - transition metal dichalcogenides and MXenes.

The Langlands functoriality conjecture is a profound unifying force in modern mathematics.  Though largely open, even what is currently known has consequences that ripple throughout number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and even mathematical physics. The basic objects of study are automorphic representations.  Automorphic representations are defined using locally symmetric spaces, which are highly symmetric spaces that can be thought of as arbitrary dimensional drums.  Every sound on a drum is a superposition of pure tones and automorphic representations are analogous to these pure tones.  These are very complicated objects. Every locally symmetric space has a comparatively simple invariant called an L-group, and the functoriality conjecture predicts that when one can relate L-groups one can relate (the far more complicated) automorphic representations. The PI will also train graduate students in this area of research and is involved in mentoring activities at all levels from high school through to post-doctoral.<br/><br/><br/>Using  relations between L-groups one defines functions called L-functions, and proving L-functions are ""nice"" is enough to prove Langlands functoriality.  This proejct will develop new techniques to prove that L-functions are nice.  The oldest tool available for proving L-functions are nice is the Poisson summation formula familiar from Fourier analysis, signal processing, etc.  The PI and B. Liu have recently discovered generalizations of the Poisson summation formula that are the first of their kind. The more particular goal of the research is to extend and exploit these generalizations with the aim of studying triple product L-functions in higher rank.  Using converse theory as developed by Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro many cases of Langlands functoriality can be reduced to the study of triple product L-functions so this is of fundamental importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the gatekeeper of carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange between plants and their surrounding environment, stomata are not only crucial to the health of the individual plants, but also have a direct and global impact on the evolution of our entire ecosystem. However, currently our understanding of stomatal movement and function is limited by the conventional strategies that only captured static, averaged, and long-term macro scale behaviors of stomata. Little is known about the qualitative characteristics of stomata behavior and functions at the micro-scale, and their correlation with the underlying physiological processes of the host plant. This award supports fundamental research to create a multiscale dynamics modeling framework centered on instantaneous stomatal movement. Success of this research will create a unique, powerful tool for stomata studies and a game-changing sensing device for monitoring and controlling plants' physiological activities, opening up and enabling a wide-range of fundamental biological research (e.g., defending mechanism of plants against insect attack, plant-environment interaction) and frontier agricultural applications (e.g., optimal crop growth control, rapid genotype to phenotype transition). Thus, results from this research will benefit both the U.S. society and the economy.

The research team will create a biophysics-based multiscale stomatal dynamics model that links and correlates subcellular mechanical evolutions to microscale cellular activities during stomatal movement. The modeling approach will be built upon a novel atomic force microscope technique to quantitatively map nanomechanical evolutions during single stoma movement, and one-of-a-kind miniaturized sensors to measure the water vapor and electrical potential variations caused by the stomata movements. They will also identify, evaluate, and optimize the stomatal dynamics model through experiments, by using maize and Arabidopsis thaliana as example systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The chemical processes that connect nitrogen species in the ocean are sensitive to the amount of oxygen dissolved in seawater. These reactions become more intense within oxygen minimum zones ?areas of the ocean with little or no dissolved oxygen. Oxygen minimum zones are affected by currents that range in scale from hundreds to less than few kilometers. These currents create microhabitats where nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide emissions are higher. This project investigates the interaction between small-scale ocean circulation, oxygen availability, and the nitrogen cycle. It uses a series of increasingly finer-scale numerical simulations of the Pacific Ocean, where two of the largest oxygen minimum zones are found. These simulations provide information about nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide emissions on timescales from less than one year to several decades, and spatial scales from a few kilometers to the basin scale. This research will increase our ability to simulate and predict ocean responses to natural and human disturbances, with implications for society. The educational component of the project establishes a series of ocean-going chemical oceanography activities for approximately 100 undergraduate students at the University of California at Los Angeles each year. The field trips involve half-day cruises in the Santa Monica Bay, where students sample a variety of biogeochemical properties. Observations collected during the field trips will be used as a resource in classroom activities and student research projects. The field trips and educational materials offer opportunities to explore cutting-edge questions in ocean biogeochemistry, increase student interest in ocean sciences and access to research, and enhance student learning and self-efficacy, ultimately promoting retention in oceanography and STEM.<br/><br/>Oxygen minimum zones host major nitrogen transformations, including denitrification, anammox, and nitrous oxide production, which are essential for biogeochemistry and climate. These reactions are strongly partitioned along oxygen gradients in the suboxic range, making them sensitive to ventilation and chemical heterogeneity driven by variable ocean currents. However, the nature of this sensitivity is poorly understood. The objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that physical circulation at scales from tens of kilometers (mesoscale) to less than one kilometer (submesoscale) is critical in shaping these nitrogen cycle transformations. To test the hypothesis and investigate its implications, we will optimize a new model of the nitrogen cycle against a range of recent observations, and implement it in a realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. We will adopt a nesting strategy to downscale a Pacific-wide historical simulation to a series of regional domains at resolutions down to few kilometers or less, resolving the oxygen minimum zone boundaries and their fine-scale variability. By analyzing these model solutions, we will: (1) constrain the sensitivity of the microbial nitrogen cycle to oxygen, ventilation, and chemical heterogeneity; (2) in light of this sensitivity, quantify the role of mesoscale and submesoscale processes in shaping nitrogen transformations and transport across oxygen minimum zone boundaries; and (3) investigate the response of the nitrogen cycle to climate variability, in particular fixed-nitrogen losses and nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These modifications change the RNA structure and function.  These changes help us understand the role of RNA in numerous biological processes. The research focuses on the determining the three-dimensional structure of RNAs containing the modified nucleotides, understanding how these changes affect the reactivity of the RNA and then studying the study of the nucleotides' role in gene expression.  The Dr. Sheng makes the new natural nucleotides and their 3D structures available to a wide range of researchers. The strategies developed under this project may be applicable to other enzymes targeting different RNA modifications, leading to a new general approach for RNA editing and thus, this research is considered to be within the Understanding the Rules of Life initiative. The research methodologies and outcomes of the study are integrated into a new course ""Nucleic Acid Chemistry"".  Dr. Sheng is a leader in the ""World of Chemistry"" program which helps freshmen chemistry majors transition to college successfully.

Synthetic 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized variants (5xrC) are systematically incorporated into RNAs to determine their impact on the stability and local and global conformations of the RNAs. In addition, studies with 5xrC-modified RNAs reveal their effects on enzyme recognition and the mechanism of enzymatic oxidation of 5mC by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of oxygenases. Finally, the sequence targeting the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) enzyme is fused with a TET oxygenase to create a tool that site-selectively oxidizes 5mC in natural RNAs. This tool is used to determine how 5xrC nucleotides affect the efficiency of translating cellular mRNAs into proteins. The knowledge gained and new general approaches developed by Dr. Sheng may benefit other scientists who study epitranscriptomic modifications of messenger RNA and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research concerns an extraordinary web of conjectures, including the Langlands conjectures, connecting algebra (i.e. the theory of polynomial equations) with analysis and geometry (particularly the study of geometric symmetries). Whenever these conjectures can be established, they provide a powerful tool which can reduce very hard problems in one domain to much easier problems in the other. The most celebrated example was Andrew Wiles' proof, after over 300 years of effort, of Fermat's last theorem. Wiles, partly in conjunction with the PI, reduced this algebraic problem to a much easier problem concerning symmetries of the hyperbolic plane (a sort of geometry popularized in Escher's ""Circle Limit"" woodcuts). The field of arithmetic geometry has seen extraordinary progress in recent decades.

Further progress seems possible. One of the PI's students is also working on related issues and the PI will continue himself to think about these questions.

It is a basic combinatorial optimization problem:  color the edges of a graph with as few colors as possible such that each edge receives a color and adjacent edges, that is, different edges incident to a common vertex, receive different colors. It has a rich theory, abundant applications, and many beautiful conjectures.  It is studied not only by mathematicians but also by computer scientists.

One of these compounds, lignin, gives physical strength and supports water transport in plants.  It is beneficial to generate bioenergy plants with less lignin because lignin impedes the production of bioethanol. However, lowering lignin production may negatively impact plant growth. This research will address this fundamental issue by studying how essential compounds such as lignin are synthesized and how the underlying processes evolved in different plants.  Specifically, this project seeks to understand the genes and pathways responsible for making lignin in grasses, which are major sources of food and bioenergy production. Because grasses have a unique pathway for making lignin that is not found in other plants, understanding the evolution of this grass-specific lignin pathway will provide better strategies to improve grasses for efficient production of food and energy.  To increase the awareness of the importance of plant-derived compounds and to train next generations of scientists, this project will conduct K-12 outreach activities called ""Pigment Art+.""  This will be specifically focused on schools from communities that are underrepresented in science. The scientific and educational outcomes of this project will have broad impacts for both research and society through improved understanding of how essential compounds, such as lignin, are made in plants. <br/><br/>Primary metabolites, such as proteins and cell walls, directly impact yield, quality, and performance of crops. This research will explore primary metabolic diversity to uncover major evolutionary innovations of plant metabolism and to provide novel tools and strategies to rationally optimize these core metabolic processes in plants. A primary cell wall component, lignin, and other phenolic compounds are produced through a complex network of the aromatic amino acid and phenylpropanoid pathways and usually synthesized from L-phenylalanine. Uniquely, grasses synthesize lignin additionally from L-tyrosine. This research aims to elucidate biochemical and genetic basis of this unique diversification of primary metabolism, the tyrosine-derived lignin biosynthetic pathway. Utilizing the wealth of genome/transcriptome data from grass and non-grass monocots, this project will employ ""phylogeny-guided"" biochemical and genomic analyses to dissect the tyrosine-derived lignin biosynthetic pathways and their evolutionary history. Aim 1) will determine the evolutionary timing of the emergence of the tyrosine-lignin pathway through activity screening of key enzymes across monocots. Aim 2) will define molecular basis of the evolution of the tyrosine-derived lignin pathway through phylogeny-guided structure-function analyses of these enzymes. Aim 3) will further identify genes and enzymes that co-evolved and reshaped the overall tyrosine-lignin biosynthetic network. Aim 4) will elucidate potential functionalization of key enzymes involved in the tyrosine-lignin biosynthetic network. This study will establish a multidisciplinary approach of phylogeny-guided biochemical genomics, which allows us to investigate evolutionary history of complex traits, such as primary metabolic diversity, that occurred in multiple loci over a long evolutionary time scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the age of large data, classical probability theory does not offer sufficient tools for current applications in large data. One of the most basic objects in data analysis is large random matrices representing data and noise. The statistics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices essentially determine the real information contained in the data matrices. In this work, we aim to develop tools in understanding the eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics of the large class of random matrices. Besides data matrices, the research also investigates the spectral properties of the associated matrices of large random graphs. In order to enhance the exchange of ideas among different groups of researchers, we have been running seminars jointly with the Statistics and Computer Science departments at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications at Harvard University. We also co-organize the Charles River Lectures in Probability (jointly with MIT and Microsoft Research), the Current Development in Mathematics conference (jointly with MIT), and the CMSA's annual conference on Big Data. These programs will bring researchers from probability theory, statistics, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and computer science to work together. We are actively formulating mathematical questions that are interesting to statisticians and computer scientists. It is clear that the analysis of large random matrices is of great interest to these scientists and we expect fruitful results from these collaborations. <br/><br/>This research aims to extend random matrix statistics to large classes of matrix models, including band matrices, adjacency matrices of sparse random graphs, and heavy-tailed random matrices. Our goal is to understand to what extent random matrix statistics, in particular the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, can be shown to hold independent of the matrix law. Our work is driven by the grand vision of E. Wigner, asserting that random matrix statistics are universal laws for systems of high complexity. More precisely, we choose the following five projects: 1. Delocalization and universality of band matrices. 2. Quantum unique ergodicity and data analysis. 3. Edge statistics of sparse random graphs. 4. Levy matrices and heavy-tailed random matrices. 5. Spin glass dynamics on hypercubes. The first project aims to extend the current random matrix theory to non mean-field models since most basic physics laws are short-ranged and thus far from the mean field type. Project 1 concerning non mean-field band matrices is in our view one of the most important questions regarding <br/>Wigner's original vision. Projects 2 and 3 concern edge statistics of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of random sparse graphs. Due to a Gaussian to Tracy-Widom transition in the edge statistics for the Erdos-Renyi graphs, we expect this project to clarify the role of sparsity in random graphs. In addition, our understanding of eigenvector statistics will have applications in restricted minimum singular value problems and signal recovery algorithms. Project 4 aims to classify the phase diagrams of heavy-tailed random matrices according to their spectral statistics. The last project aims to develop methods to prove spectral gaps and logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the Glauber dynamics of spin glasses on hypercubes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout its five years, the project will fund 125 fellowships in five groups of 25 students to support attainment of bachelor's degrees in Biological Sciences, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Computer Science, Geological Sciences, Mathematics & Statistics, or Physics & Astronomy. The curricula of these STEM majors are designed to provide a strong background in the principles of discovery and analytical thinking, as well as extensive knowledge of a STEM field.  Although this knowledge and skills are essential to success in the STEM workforce, they are not enough.  To address this issue, the project plans to develop strong STEM leaders by weaving professional skills development, with workplace psychology and equity training, into the STEM curriculum.  The region is experiencing rapid high-tech industrial growth. In addition, individuals from groups that have been historically under-represented in the STEM fields will soon represent most of the population.  Consequently, this project has the potential to serve as a pipeline of workforce-ready graduates into the region's STEM workforce, including biotechnology, computer science, and engineering industries.<br/><br/>This project has three objectives: (1) promote the engagement and retention of low socio-economic scholars in the sciences through the award of scholarships; (2) integrate sector-specific career skills into the training of scholars with an eye toward exceeding workplace expectations in industry and academia on completion of their BS degrees; and (3) minimize attrition of students within the STEM workforce by incorporating workplace psychology workshops that teach individuals how to navigate less hospitable work environments and establish an equitable workplace. Qualified students of all backgrounds will be eligible for scholarship support, with expanded efforts to recruit and support under-represented minorities, women in science, and first-generation scholars. The activities and resources created by the training program will be available to all STEM undergraduate and graduate students across the university. This Design and Development project is funded by the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future scientists, engineers, and technicians, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This capability has had profound impact on science, technology, and on the world economy. The community is in agreement that future advances in many areas of science and technology depend on understanding the structure-function relationships at the nano-scale, where new properties emerge. Controlling the fabrication of complex materials at that scale will allow for novel physical, chemical, and biological functionality. Output flux and brilliance of Compton sources rivals, and by some measures exceeds, modern synchrotron sources, bringing the most advanced scientific and medical X-ray probe into the university, industrial, and medical laboratory. In this context, this project will improve the  calculation of radiation spectra in Compton sources. If successful, the new approach is expected to play a pivotal role in ushering a new era in hard X-ray source technology. Combined with powerful optimization tools, this will lead to substantial improvements in performance for all existing and future Compton sources.<br/><br/>When a relativistic electron beam interacts with a laser beam, intense and highly collimated electromagnetic radiation is generated through Compton scattering. Increasing the laser intensity changes the longitudinal velocity of the electrons during their collision, which leads to considerable broadening in the scattered radiation spectra. The effects of such ponderomotive broadening are so deleterious that most Compton sources either remain at low laser intensities or pay a steep price to operate at a small <br/>fraction of the physically possible peak spectral output. In this project, the PI and his collaborators will build on previous work that showed that the ponderomotive broadening for individual electrons can be eliminated by suitable frequency modulation (chirping) of the incident laser wave. The PI will generalize this chirping prescription to realistic electron beams and laser pulses, in order to quantify its advantages. High-fidelity simulations of Compton sources with chirping are expected to lead to substantial savings in the operational costs of the existing as well as the design and construction cost of new Compton sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using mathematical and biological approaches, the team will uncover interactions that control different stages of developmental self-organization: (1) pre-aggregation cell alignment and formation of cellular streams; (2) formation and growth of initial aggregates; and (3) aggregate coarsening, dispersal, and pulsing. This project is expected to elucidate some of the general mechanisms behind the collective behavior of motile cells in other organisms and to develop widely applicable mathematical approaches. Transition from single cells to multicellularity is fundamentally important to increase understanding of many pathogenic bacteria and to elucidate self-organization in more complex systems. Even though individual bacterial cells are considered to function independently and to be autonomous, many bacterial populations will act collectively, communicating, moving and self-organizing into multicellular structures.  M. xanthus is a great model system for studying biological self-organization: its cells function fine alone, but cooperate to form variety of distinct, dynamic patterns depending on environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms of these behaviors are currently not fully understood. Broader impacts of the project will be further enhanced by training opportunities for participating students. Solving complex biological problems requires a new generation of life scientists with cross-disciplinary training in both experimental and computational methods. This research will provide those training opportunities for all participants, facilitated by close interactions such as joint meetings and trainee collaborations.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on solving one of the fundamental problems of modern developmental biology: how individual cells self-organize into multicellular structures. In particular, the goal of the research is to uncover mechanisms controlling the developmental program of a biofilm formed by M. xanthus. This soil bacterium is tractable and has a relatively simple genome and as such is an excellent model system to develop novel mathematical models and experimentally test their predictions. Under starvation, M. xanthus cells coordinate their movement in space and time, bringing tens of thousands of cells together into multicellular aggregates to differentiate into spores. This model of prokaryotic development is experimentally tractable and shares many of the complexities that are ubiquitous in developmental systems. With a combination of mathematical modeling approaches and quantitative experiments, this project will uncover the interactions and signaling mechanisms that control three distinct stages of developmental self-organization. To this end, the research builds on the previously fruitful methodology to connect these interactions with the observed population phenotypes. The emphasis of the mathematical component of this research is on the advancement of agent-based and kinetic models that go beyond the existing, oversimplified models of the phenomena that postulate and analyze a single mechanism for self-organization. The resulting predictions will be tested experimentally using genetic or environmental perturbations. Broader impacts include developing novel and widely applicable methodology to understand multicellular patterns, cross-disciplinary training for participating students, and educational and outreach activities based on the research results and methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were created in the Big Bang together with antiprotons and antineutrons. It is unknown why more particles than antiparticles have been created in the early Universe, and it is the particles that have survived to become all of the presently existing nuclear matter. Such an imbalance may occur only if physical laws are not exactly symmetric when time is reversed. If this is the case, nuclear experiments must observe precession (rotation) of neutrons in an electric field. In the next decade the precision of such experiments will be improved 100-fold. This project is aimed at providing the theoretical foundations to examine whether experiments agree with known interactions of elementary particles or not, and measure how much the space reflection and time reversal symmetries of physical laws are broken. These questions are at the heart of modern nuclear physics and they have to be answered to understand the origin of all known matter.<br/><br/>Electric dipole moments (EDMs) of nucleons (protons and neutrons), nuclei, and atoms can be induced by time reversal (T) symmetry-violating interactions of elementary particles that comprise them. While the standard model contains T violation, the violation is not sufficiently large to produce the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. This alone points to new, yet unknown types of particle interactions, such as color-electric dipole moments of quarks, three-gluon, and four-quark effective interactions. EDMs of nucleons and nuclei may also be produced by nontrivial topology of gauge fields (the so-called theta-term) that has not been observed so far. While the theory governing quarks and gluons is known, it is intractable analytically, and requires numerical calculations (lattice QCD) to compute nucleon structure and EDMs, which is the aim of this project. Current and future experiments measuring EDMs are thus at the frontier of fundamental physics. Their interpretation, however, depends critically on precise theoretical calculations of nucleon structure that will be performed in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the solutions of systems of polynomial equations is a key to advances in many areas, including computer aided geometric design, robotics and physics. In most cases a small change of the coefficients results in a  small change of the geometric objects. For example, increasing the radius of a  sphere a little results in a slightly larger sphere. The aim of this project is to give a general theoretical framework for analyzing those cases when a small change of the coefficients results in a dramatic change of the geometric objects.  These are the cases when a small error in measurement or manufacturing may have large consequences.<br/><br/><br/>The main aim of the project is to understand what a good family of algebraic varieties is. The moduli of curves and its compactification constructed by Deligne and Mumford are among the most important objects in mathematics and in string theory. The goal of higher dimensional moduli theory is to construct more general versions and to use this in understanding the geometry of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. An approach to compactifying the moduli space of varieties of general type was proposed by Kollar and Shepherd-Barron in 1988. The limiting objects are called stable varieties. These satisfy a local condition  (having only log-canonical singularities) and a global condition (having ample canonical class). More generally, following Alexeev,  one should consider moduli spaces of pairs of a projective, reduced scheme and a non-negative linear combination (with rational or real coefficients) of divisors. In order to get a reasonable moduli space, these pairs should satisfy a local condition  (the pair has only semi-log-canonical singularities) and a global condition (having ample log canonical class). The aim of the project is to apply the study of semi-log-canonical singularities to complete the moduli theory of stable pairs. The theory is complete as far as the underlying varieties are concerned, but the divisor parts of the pairs exhibit non-flat behavior that is harder to approach with the usual techniques. For stable varieties without divisors, the existence of the moduli space are known, but it needs to be written down in a systematic way. When a divisor is added, we run into the problem  (first observed by Hassett) that a deformation  of the pair need not induce a flat deformation of the divisor part. For seminormal base spaces the theory of Chow varieties is ideal to understand non-flat deformations over. The first main aim is to generalize this to reduced base spaces. In general we may expect a better theory when the coefficients in the divisorial part are bigger than a half.  The second main aim is to work out the moduli theory by treating the variety and the divisor  as essentially independent objects varying flatly. A third aim is to understand what happens when the coefficients in the divisorial part are allowed to be a half, since this  case  comes up frequently in applications. Besides being important in its own right,  this is a test case for the various techniques that one can use in general. The fourth, most speculative part is to develop a general moduli theory that works optimally in all cases. A key problem is that there are several competing definitions that give slightly different answers for some non-reduced schemes. We need to understand the precise relationships and to find the optimal theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Approximate Number System (ANS), a cognitive system which is operational from early infancy onward, allows humans to approximately quantify sets of items without language or symbols. Research suggests that the ANS could potentially support arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, and that the ANS could therefore serve as a bridge to learning formal mathematics. However, the arithmetic capacity of the ANS, and how this capacity develops, is not well understood. This project fills that knowledge gap by systematically examining the computational capacity of the ANS using a series of experiments designed to assess young children before they learn the formal rules of arithmetic in school. The project addresses theoretical debates about the early cognitive architecture of the ANS and its role in arithmetic computation. The project will identify potential ways that educators could leverage children's pre-symbolic mathematical intuitions in order to help them learn formal mathematics. This has implications for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. <br/><br/>This project will examine the degree to which computations performed over ANS representations parallel true arithmetic computations.  The development of the computational capacity of the ANS will be examined.  Symbolic arithmetic computation obeys a set of functional rules. For example, the result of an arithmetic computation like 5+6 is a new, independent quantity that is just as precise as the quantities it was derived from, and which can be manipulated and used in further computations. These functional rules make symbolic arithmetic computation both powerful and flexible. This project aims to identify the functional rules of non-symbolic arithmetic with the ANS. In a series of experiments, four to six year-old children will be asked to solve non-symbolic problems with unknown addends (e.g., 5+__=11). This task requires children to perform arithmetic-like computation, holding two separate ANS representations in mind (e.g. approximately five and approximately 11) and performing a computation over them (e.g. subtracting approximately five from approximately 11) to derive a solution. Each experiment is aimed at examining different components of the functional rules of non-symbolic arithmetic, including the representational structure and precision of the solutions to ANS computations and the extent to which these solutions can be used in further computations. Additional measures of working memory capacity, symbolic math performance, and ANS representational precision are used to elucidate contributions of these cognitive systems to the computational capacity and development of the ANS. Data will be analyzed using a combination of traditional null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factor analysis, and logistic regression. The project will therefore compliment what is known about the representational structure of the ANS by shedding light on its computational architecture and the development of this architecture in early childhood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project lays the theoretical foundations for a new real-time implementation strategy that will significantly reduce the runtime of model predictive control, increase its overall reliability, and extend its applicability to the automotive and aerospace domains.<br/> <br/>Traditional model predictive control is implemented by fully solving an optimal control problem at every time step. This research project focuses on an alternative scheme where the solution to the optimal control problem is tracked with a bounded error over multiple time steps. By treating the numerical solver as a dynamic system that evolves in parallel to the controlled plant, the project will identify sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability and constraint satisfaction using Input-to-State Stability arguments. Recursive stability and constraint satisfaction will then be ensured by introducing the Real-Time Iteration Governor, which is an add-on supervision layer that suitably manipulates the reference of the model predictive controller so that the solution to the optimal control problem can be tracked with an acceptably small error. These theoretical contributions will be supplemented by dedicated numerical algorithms and analog circuits that take full advantage of running at a faster timescale with respect to the rate of change of the optimal control problem. The proposed framework will also address nonconvex constraints by using the Real-Time Iteration Governor to progressively steer the numerical solver away from undesirable local minima. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Real-Time Iteration Governor and its supporting theory, the proposed framework will be applied to practical engineering challenges, which include the autonomous navigation of small spacecraft in close proximity to asteroids, the development of efficient control algorithms for self-driving cars, and the implementation of constrained coordination strategies for unmanned aerial vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the gatekeeper of carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange between plants and their surrounding environment, stomata are not only crucial to the health of the individual plants, but also have a direct and global impact on the evolution of our entire ecosystem. However, currently our understanding of stomatal movement and function is limited by the conventional strategies that only captured static, averaged, and long-term macro scale behaviors of stomata. Little is known about the qualitative characteristics of stomata behavior and functions at the micro-scale, and their correlation with the underlying physiological processes of the host plant. This award supports fundamental research to create a multiscale dynamics modeling framework centered on instantaneous stomatal movement. Success of this research will create a unique, powerful tool for stomata studies and a game-changing sensing device for monitoring and controlling plants' physiological activities, opening up and enabling a wide-range of fundamental biological research (e.g., defending mechanism of plants against insect attack, plant-environment interaction) and frontier agricultural applications (e.g., optimal crop growth control, rapid genotype to phenotype transition). Thus, results from this research will benefit both the U.S. society and the economy.

However, scientific challenges are yet to be addressed to establish such a modeling framework. The research team will create a biophysics-based multiscale stomatal dynamics model that links and correlates subcellular mechanical evolutions to microscale cellular activities during stomatal movement. The modeling approach will be built upon a novel atomic force microscope technique to quantitatively map nanomechanical evolutions during single stoma movement, and one-of-a-kind miniaturized sensors to measure the water vapor and electrical potential variations caused by the stomata movements. They will also identify, evaluate, and optimize the stomatal dynamics model through experiments, by using maize and Arabidopsis thaliana as example systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A system of polynomial equations has a geometric avatar, called an algebraic variety.  The mantra of arithmetic geometry is that geometric properties of an algebraic variety, like curvature, bear strongly on the types and the structure of solutions to the underlying system of polynomial equations.  The PI studies systems of polynomial equations whose algebraic varieties are surfaces, i.e., they are two-dimensional.  Algebraic surfaces are classified into four rough phyla. Within this classification, the PI studies the class of K3 surfaces, within a phylum of ""intermediate complexity.""  Our knowledge of the geometry of K3 surfaces is ripe enough now for a meaningful study of the rational points they harbor.  The projects supported by this award aim to answer questions like: given a set of polynomial equation that define a K3 surface, is there an algorithm that will determine whether the system of equations has solutions?  If so, can this algorithm be implemented?<br/><br/>K3 surfaces have a rich and structured geometry; their arithmetic is subtle, yet conceivably tractable. A host of conjectures in the last 10 years point to a surprising expectation: given equations for a K3 surface over a number field, there should be an algorithm that detects whether the surface caries rational points. Many of the projects are designed to either provide evidence towards this expectation, or to give practical methods for detecting the existence of rational points on K3 surfaces.  Proposed projects include a detailed study of moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with Brauer group level structures, as well as a type of inverse Galois problem to study the possible algebraic Brauer groups of K3 surfaces.  The PI also proposes to study a class of orbifold points on algebraic varieties that interpolate between rational points and integral points, and to do so in a uniform way, so as to develop a better understanding of when treatments of these two types of points must be separated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mammalian carnivores are critical to the stability and integrity of ecosystems around the world, largely because they play key roles in regulating such important ecosystem processes as interspecific competition and predator-prey dynamics, yet many carnivores are currently threatened or endangered. The economic well-being of many developing nations in Africa is intimately linked with conservation of mammalian carnivores, but our ability to conserve these animals is often limited by how little we know about their basic biology. This IRES training program is designed to fill these gaps in our knowledge about African carnivores while also enhancing the professional development of young biologists at a critical early stage of their careers. Top undergraduates and junior graduate students are selected each year from large pools of applicants interested in conducting field research in Kenya on spotted hyenas and other African carnivores. Mammalian carnivores represent one of Kenya?s most important natural resources, yet many of them remain poorly understood. IRES students have a rich selection of carnivore species from which to draw their research subjects. IRES students work on a wide array of topics ranging from comparative study of carnivore cognition to modeling the ecological and anthropogenic forces affecting carnivore population sizes. Some students exploit naturally-occurring variation to test hypotheses, whereas others conduct experiments using equipment borrowed from our research camps. Each team of undergraduate and graduate students works closely with a specific Kenyan trainer. This arrangement allows students to get deeply involved in their work even before they arrive in Kenya, and they also benefit immensely from the careful guidance of individual grad students. Graduate student participants, in turn, acquire invaluable mentorship experience as well as close American and Kenyan colleagues working on problems of mutual interest. This IRES program will contribute significantly to the development of a new generation of global scientists who are united in their desire to understand and protect the natural world.<br/><br/>This IRES project will engage five advanced undergraduates and five junior graduate students each year to spend several months in Kenya with experienced trainers, conducting research on African carnivores. Students will utilize comparative methods, and undertake projects designed to acquire new and useful information about the carnivores inhabiting the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. IRES pursues continuation of a training partnership with three Kenyan scientists and one young American PhD-level biologist; this team of trainers will help IRES students address a broad array of research questions about the behavior, conservation, and physiology of African carnivores, ranging from the evolution of their cognitive abilities to anthropogenic effects on their stress physiology.  Teams of undergraduate and graduate students will be linked by topical research focus, and they will work closely with specific Kenyan trainers. All Kenyan trainers are closely affiliated with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). Students will spend several weeks developing and executing their field research projects, working closely with Kenyan trainers and Kenyan students. While in Kenya, IRES students will also receive explicit training in science writing, and present their work orally at the Carnivore Researchers Conference held each year at KWS. The research opportunities offered to students are unparalleled, not only to investigate the biology of several carnivore species that remain very poorly understood, but also to make important contributions to behavioral ecology, stress physiology and conservation biology. In addition to providing support for one graduate student program assistant, the IRES project is intended to influence the professional development of ten top American student participants each year, and offer them extraordinary opportunities to learn a wide array of field research skills in a spectacular natural setting. IRES students will receive training in, and conduct research projects investigating, both the basic and applied biology of African carnivores. The economic well-being of Kenya is intimately linked with conservation of African carnivores, but our ability to conserve these animals is often limited by how little we know about their basic biology. Guided by Kenyan trainers whose professional lives are dedicated to the conservation of African wildlife, IRES students will gather data to allow important improvements in the management policies used in Kenya's national parks and reserves. IRES participants will learn a great deal about African life and culture, and about the complexities associated with carnivore conservation in a developing nation. This IRES experience will thus contribute significantly to the development of a new generation of global scientists who are united in their desire to understand and protect the natural world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using mathematical and biological approaches, the team will uncover interactions that control different stages of developmental self-organization: (1) pre-aggregation cell alignment and formation of cellular streams; (2) formation and growth of initial aggregates; and (3) aggregate coarsening, dispersal, and pulsing. This project is expected to elucidate some of the general mechanisms behind the collective behavior of motile cells in other organisms and to develop widely applicable mathematical approaches. Transition from single cells to multicellularity is fundamentally important to increase understanding of many pathogenic bacteria and to elucidate self-organization in more complex systems. Even though individual bacterial cells are considered to function independently and to be autonomous, many bacterial populations will act collectively, communicating, moving and self-organizing into multicellular structures.  M. xanthus is a great model system for studying biological self-organization: its cells function fine alone, but cooperate to form variety of distinct, dynamic patterns depending on environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms of these behaviors are currently not fully understood. Broader impacts of the project will be further enhanced by training opportunities for participating students. Solving complex biological problems requires a new generation of life scientists with cross-disciplinary training in both experimental and computational methods. This research will provide those training opportunities for all participants, facilitated by close interactions such as joint meetings and trainee collaborations.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on solving one of the fundamental problems of modern developmental biology: how individual cells self-organize into multicellular structures. In particular, the goal of the research is to uncover mechanisms controlling the developmental program of a biofilm formed by M. xanthus. This soil bacterium is tractable and has a relatively simple genome and as such is an excellent model system to develop novel mathematical models and experimentally test their predictions. Under starvation, M. xanthus cells coordinate their movement in space and time, bringing tens of thousands of cells together into multicellular aggregates to differentiate into spores. This model of prokaryotic development is experimentally tractable and shares many of the complexities that are ubiquitous in developmental systems. With a combination of mathematical modeling approaches and quantitative experiments, this project will uncover the interactions and signaling mechanisms that control three distinct stages of developmental self-organization. To this end, the research builds on the previously fruitful methodology to connect these interactions with the observed population phenotypes. The emphasis of the mathematical component of this research is on the advancement of agent-based and kinetic models that go beyond the existing, oversimplified models of the phenomena that postulate and analyze a single mechanism for self-organization. The resulting predictions will be tested experimentally using genetic or environmental perturbations. Broader impacts include developing novel and widely applicable methodology to understand multicellular patterns, cross-disciplinary training for participating students, and educational and outreach activities based on the research results and methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electronic and optical properties of materials form the basis of much of modern information technology. Newly discovered materials that go under the classification ""topological materials"" respond in unique ways to applied electric and magnetic fields, and their properties in some cases can be unusually robust to impurities. The first area of the research portion of this project involves developing theoretical methods to predict and understand properties of topological materials, extending previous work in this area. A particular focus is on improving our understanding of the optical properties that appear when materials are studied with intense laser light. The electrons in these materials appear effectively massless, which creates exciting opportunities for basic science and technology.<br/><br/>The other main area of research involves understanding how interactions between electrons in a very clean material lead to fluid-like collective motion of electrons, but with interesting differences compared to the flow of a normal fluid, like water. Understanding these hydrodynamical flows of electrons, or of atoms in an atomic gas, could help in the design of future generations of electronic devices.<br/><br/>Educational work in this project includes several activities beyond standard professorial classroom teaching and mentoring of graduate students. The PI is working on a textbook that will be a broad introduction to topological materials, building on his previously published lecture notes. He will pursue outreach activities with local science teachers and with the general public, to give them a sense of recent developments in quantum materials. Undergraduates will be involved in introductory research problems to give them a sense of modern research in the above areas.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project combines research in two areas of quantum condensed matter physics with related education and outreach activities.  One area of research is concerned with gapless topological states of electrons, building on discoveries of new classes of materials and new phenomena that they enable. The other area involves transport in interacting electron metals including hydrodynamic effects that arise in very clean materials. The main broader impacts of the work to be conducted are on education, primarily of the PI's graduate students but also of scientists and non-scientists more generally, and on understanding the physical underpinnings of future quantum technologies.<br/><br/>The PI seeks to understand new kinds of electronic behavior in two areas of quantum condensed matter physics. One area involves topological behavior in metallic or gapless materials. Two recently discovered examples with a long history as theoretical possibilities are the topological bulk semimetals of Weyl or Dirac type. These, and more complicated states such as gapless spin liquids, are subjects of active experimental and theoretical study, but what unique properties they might have is not well understood, compared to the insulating case. This research direction builds on promising recent results on how nonlinear optics and other properties not usually thought of as having a topological origin can become unexpectedly strong and even quantized in topological phases. The supported work will advance the understanding of these kinds of materials more systematically, including interaction effects, and find new examples of topological behavior beyond linear response.<br/><br/>Hydrodynamics of simple fluids was arguably the first simplified or ""effective"" theory of an interacting condensed matter system. The second area of research involves how the modified forms of hydrodynamics arising in the long-time, long-distance dynamics of electrons differ from conventional classical hydrodynamics, which describes a simple fluid like ordinary water. Theoretical work in recent years has given several examples of how electron hydrodynamics in materials can differ from ordinary classical single-component hydrodynamics, whether from extra conserved quantities, the long-ranged nature of Coulomb repulsion, or broken symmetries such as time-reversal or inversion. The behavior of quantum fluids is both experimentally important, for actual transport in practical devices made from very clean materials at small length scales, and is connected to deep questions about thermalization and relaxation rates.<br/><br/>Educational activities include undergraduate and graduate student supervision and classroom teaching, lecturing at advanced schools and co-authorship of an introductory textbook on topological matter, and outreach to schools and teachers. One goal of the educational work is to bring some of the magic of recent discoveries in quantum condensed matter physics to a broader audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, limnologists have dedicated their efforts to studying lakes in the summer, while overlooking winter. Winter field work is challenging. Most lakes in the United States, however, freeze over for at least part of the winter. A bias for summer research has left gaps in knowledge on lake chemistry and biology under ice. More pressingly, with anticipated changes in environmental conditions, there is a need for information on how lakes and reservoirs function in the winter for a more complete understanding of lakes. This knowledge is also critical to future management of freshwater resources in a future with shorter winters and less lake ice. The project advances the growing field of winter limnology by using long-term data collected on northern lakes in Wisconsin in conjunction with a snow-removal experiment to look at under-ice algae and the implications for ice-loss on spring algae blooms. This research will also provide hands-on research experience for students, including K-12, undergraduates, and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project will advance the understanding of under-ice ecology by leveraging the rich winter limnology datasets of the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) site, high-frequency sensors, and the resources of a year-round limnological field station. To address the overarching question of how lake ice loss will impact lake productivity, this project focuses on three questions: is there a seasonal succession of planktonic events under lake ice; what are the major drivers of winter productivity; and how do seasons with less ice, or early-ice off, alter spring phytoplankton blooms? These three questions will be addressed through a combination of long-term data analysis, comparative and experimental studies, and modeling. The seven study lakes are in Northern Wisconsin and have been routinely monitored since 1981. Additionally, a bog lake will be the site of a snow manipulation experiment. This project will produce multiple outcomes, including insight into under-ice community dynamics and productivity, the dynamic nature of chlorophyll and oxygen production under ice, and the role of light availability in under-ice productivity. All of these analyses will further our ability to predict how a future with less lake ice will alter lake ecosystem dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Competition is common within these communities as diverse microbes compete for a limited supply of nutrients, but there are also opportunities for collaboration. In the context of the ""arms race"" that defines host-pathogen interactions, pathogen-pathogen collaboration represents a potentially powerful mechanism for disease organisms to overcome host resistance strategies, with severe implications for agriculture. As an example, in 2001, cotton bacterial blight (CBB), a disease for which there are resistant cotton varieties, re-emerged across the southern USA. Surprisingly, the disease was observed on CBB-resistant cotton plants. Closer examination revealed the CBB pathogen as well as a second bacterial pathogen on these diseased cotton plants. The co-occurrence led to the hypothesis that the two bacterial pathogens are collaborating to suppress host resistance responses and cause disease. This project tests that hypothesis using genomics and molecular biology approaches. If confirmed, this research will have revealed a new frontier of pathogen strategies to overcome host resistance that will need to be considered in the future.<br/><br/>CBB is caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm). Xcm and a second pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae (Ps), were co-isolated from cotton plants that are resistant to Xcm. Xcm and Ps may, therefore, be forming a disease complex that suppresses the resistance triggered by Xcm. This research aims to reveal the putative mechanism(s) of collaboration between Xcm and Ps. The first aim will establish experimental systems and assays, adapted from classic plant pathology techniques, to carefully define points of potential interaction between Xcm and Ps. The second aim will seek potential molecular mechanisms of collaboration between Xcm and Ps. For example, Ps may use its repertoire of type III effectors to repress the resistance response normally triggered by Xcm. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing plant defense gene expression after inoculation with Xcm, Ps and co-inoculation with Xcm and Ps. RNA sequencing and differential gene expression analyses will reveal the relevant virulence mechanisms employed by both pathogens and the response triggered within cotton. The final aim will directly test the roles of specific bacterial genes in any interaction by constructing genetic knockouts in Xcm and/or Ps and conducting pathogenicity assays. This project breaks important new ground by considering the effect of multiple bacterial plant pathogens attacking the same host simultaneously. Understanding the rules that define these complex interactions is required to meet the agricultural needs of an increasing population and changing environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators have developed ideas, based on probability theory and geometric measure theory, for the analysis of non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields. They have also introduced renewal-theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of nonlinear SPDEs. They plan to continue their investigation of precise quantitative connections between SPDEs, random fields, potential theory, and the geometry of random fractals. They believe that further pursuit of these connections will ultimately yield novel insights into the structure of SPDEs,large-scale physical multifractals, and related random fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using mathematical and biological approaches, the team will uncover interactions that control different stages of developmental self-organization: (1) pre-aggregation cell alignment and formation of cellular streams; (2) formation and growth of initial aggregates; and (3) aggregate coarsening, dispersal, and pulsing. This project is expected to elucidate some of the general mechanisms behind the collective behavior of motile cells in other organisms and to develop widely applicable mathematical approaches. Transition from single cells to multicellularity is fundamentally important to increase understanding of many pathogenic bacteria and to elucidate self-organization in more complex systems. Even though individual bacterial cells are considered to function independently and to be autonomous, many bacterial populations will act collectively, communicating, moving and self-organizing into multicellular structures.  M. xanthus is a great model system for studying biological self-organization: its cells function fine alone, but cooperate to form variety of distinct, dynamic patterns depending on environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms of these behaviors are currently not fully understood. Broader impacts of the project will be further enhanced by training opportunities for participating students. Solving complex biological problems requires a new generation of life scientists with cross-disciplinary training in both experimental and computational methods. This research will provide those training opportunities for all participants, facilitated by close interactions such as joint meetings and trainee collaborations.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on solving one of the fundamental problems of modern developmental biology: how individual cells self-organize into multicellular structures. In particular, the goal of the research is to uncover mechanisms controlling the developmental program of a biofilm formed by M. xanthus. This soil bacterium is tractable and has a relatively simple genome and as such is an excellent model system to develop novel mathematical models and experimentally test their predictions. Under starvation, M. xanthus cells coordinate their movement in space and time, bringing tens of thousands of cells together into multicellular aggregates to differentiate into spores. This model of prokaryotic development is experimentally tractable and shares many of the complexities that are ubiquitous in developmental systems. With a combination of mathematical modeling approaches and quantitative experiments, this project will uncover the interactions and signaling mechanisms that control three distinct stages of developmental self-organization. To this end, the research builds on the previously fruitful methodology to connect these interactions with the observed population phenotypes. The emphasis of the mathematical component of this research is on the advancement of agent-based and kinetic models that go beyond the existing, oversimplified models of the phenomena that postulate and analyze a single mechanism for self-organization. The resulting predictions will be tested experimentally using genetic or environmental perturbations. Broader impacts include developing novel and widely applicable methodology to understand multicellular patterns, cross-disciplinary training for participating students, and educational and outreach activities based on the research results and methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The coevolutionary dynamics that push arms races such as this one onward are determined by many factors. The coevolutionary dynamics may involve the geographic distributions of the species, the physiological effects of toxins, or the structure of proteins that are used in attack or defense. Synthesizing how these different levels of biological organization interact and dictate arms races will help us better predict outcomes of coevolutionary battles. Understanding what drives one enemy to outpace the other, or eventually win the race, can inform strategies for managing interactions between humans and disease, hosts and parasites, and plants and their herbivore pests. <br/><br/>This synthesis of several integrative studies will explore the connections between landscape ecology, microevolution processes, and underlying genetic and protein variation.

These data will be used in spatially explicit analyses to test predictions about the historical, ecological, and environmental factors that structure geographic mosaics of coevolution. The intersection of organismal mechanisms and evolutionary process will be explored in a single-authored popular science book that follows the pathways to discoveries within the newt-snake system.

Porous materials are critical in many large-scale industrial applications, ranging from water purification to the separation of the components of air, and from the capture of toxic chemicals to the production of fuels. However, to make existing processes more efficient and environmentally-friendly, it is essential to improve the properties of materials that perform these functions. The Humphrey group at the University of Texas Austin is working to design and synthesize new porous materials that can incorporate a wide range of well-defined metal species inside their pores. At present, chemically reactive metals cannot be easily or systematically incorporated into most porous materials. Providing a general solution to this problem leads to materials that can capture certain valuable chemical species with greater selectivity and higher capacity. The research team comprised of the PI, graduate students and undergraduate researchers works together to prepare model materials, which are studied using state-of-the-art characterization tools to obtain fundamental information about their properties. Throughout this process, the research team collaborates with theoretical chemists and scientists at beamline facilities to gain a deeper understanding of how structure can affect function. This project integrates an innovative undergraduate educational program, called the Austin-International Framework (AIF). The AIF provides a fully immersive, scholarship-supported international exchange experience to UT Austin undergraduate scientists; students are given the opportunity to broaden their horizons by witnessing first-hand the global nature of science via a semester of study and research in porous materials development at one of several overseas universities of international acclaim. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>The scientific objective of this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, is to prepare new metal-organic framework (MOF) materials based on unexplored classes of ligands, and to gain an in-depth understanding of their solid-state properties. The field of MOF research continues to expand at an increasing rate, as new potential applications of this novel class of porous materials are discovered. The potential boundaries of MOF chemical complexity remain unknown. However, advances in this regard are slow, restricted by the reliance of MOF discovery using chemically similar organic components. The Humphrey group significantly expands the MOF 'toolkit' by showing that phosphine, arsine and chalcogenide ligands can impart genuinely new solid-state functionalities. The resulting MOF micropores are decorated with structurally well-defined Lewis bases, which can be exploited as post-synthetic attachment points for low-valent, low-coordinate metal species that impart advanced solid-state functionalities (i.e., small molecule chemisorption, chemical bond activation).  In essence, the target MOFs are crystalline, atomically-precise solid-state ligands. This is a challenging project, but the resulting materials provide new avenues to systematically incorporate a broad range of metal species of industrial relevance into uniquely confined micro-pore environments. From a fundamental perspective, these materials advance the frontiers of chemical reactivity in MOFs and provide ideal models on which to perform detailed characterization studies pertaining to stronger gas adsorption processes. From a technological perspective, new materials that enable selective adsorption and activation of gases are important for future applications in atmospheric remediation and the production of renewable fuels. In addition to providing research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at UT Austin, this project also integrates an innovative undergraduate educational program, called the Austin-International Framework (AIF).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fully-implantable Bidirectional Brain Computer Interfaces (BBCI) are the focus of this project. These are electronic systems capable of recording, processing and stimulating neural activity, and they play a foundational role in enabling better understanding of the brain. Implantable BBCIs will enable neuro-scientists to explore brain function in unprecedented detail, and help realize neuro-prosthetic devices capable of restoring mobility, vision and brain function among the disabled. However, critical technological barriers facing BBCIs are hindering progress in neuroscience. Existing BBCI architectures do not scale well, in terms of power or area, to support ever-increasing numbers of recording and stimulation channels needed for finer examination and control of brain function. Furthermore, neural stimulation produces artifacts - electrical disturbances in the brain - that hamper the ability to perform neural recording. Finally, the desired level of computational performance required to perform neural signal processing and data-communication to external devices consumes power in excess of thermal limits of implantable devices. The technologies resulting from this project will be translated into a fully implantable, bio-compatible and versatile closed-loop neuroscience platform that overcomes these existing challenges. Collaborations with neuroscientists, the medical-device industry, and fabrication partners, to be pursued during this project, are critical to the realization of this goal. The resulting platform will be made available to the broader neuroscience community to enable experiments at unprecedented levels of scale and scope, accelerating progress toward understanding the brain.

The effort is organized into three threads: 1) Development of novel, computationally-enhanced neural interfaces to achieve desired levels of efficiency and scalability; 2) Exploration of domain-correspondence to Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication systems through low-energy computing, which will allow systems capable of rejecting artifacts and allowing recording to be focused to a targeted set of neurons; and 3) Leveraging an understanding of neural signal processing algorithms and preliminary results in ultra-low power computing to devise domain specific architectures that meet BBCI processing requirements under severe power limitations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its remarkable success in the chemical process control industry, the successful transition of model predictive control into time-and-safety-critical applications is limited by the computational challenges faced in its real-time implementation. This research project lays the theoretical foundations for a new real-time implementation strategy that will significantly reduce the runtime of model predictive control, increase its overall reliability, and extend its applicability to the automotive and aerospace domains.<br/> <br/>Traditional model predictive control is implemented by fully solving an optimal control problem at every time step. This research project focuses on an alternative scheme where the solution to the optimal control problem is tracked with a bounded error over multiple time steps. By treating the numerical solver as a dynamic system that evolves in parallel to the controlled plant, the project will identify sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability and constraint satisfaction using Input-to-State Stability arguments. Recursive stability and constraint satisfaction will then be ensured by introducing the Real-Time Iteration Governor, which is an add-on supervision layer that suitably manipulates the reference of the model predictive controller so that the solution to the optimal control problem can be tracked with an acceptably small error. These theoretical contributions will be supplemented by dedicated numerical algorithms and analog circuits that take full advantage of running at a faster timescale with respect to the rate of change of the optimal control problem. The proposed framework will also address nonconvex constraints by using the Real-Time Iteration Governor to progressively steer the numerical solver away from undesirable local minima. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Real-Time Iteration Governor and its supporting theory, the proposed framework will be applied to practical engineering challenges, which include the autonomous navigation of small spacecraft in close proximity to asteroids, the development of efficient control algorithms for self-driving cars, and the implementation of constrained coordination strategies for unmanned aerial vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike the visible spectral range where materials such as glass provide exceptionally high performance at extremely low cost, the infrared optical components are typically sensitive to water, opaque in the visible, expensive and/or brittle. Thus, identifying alternative materials or material platforms that can provide the basis of next generation infrared optics and light sources is highly desired. Within the infrared, many polar materials, such as silicon carbide, exhibit crystal vibrations that can be excited using light. This provides opportunities to compress long-wavelength infrared light to nanometer scale lengths, offering the potential to significantly reduce the size of infrared optics. However, these crystal vibrations are material specific and thus, finding the right material in the desired infrared frequency range is challenging. This project investigates novel hybrid materials composed of altering stacking thin layers with potential to modify their crystal vibrations in an effort to change its corresponding infrared properties. The collaborative research seeks to understand how these vibrations are influenced when the layer thickness is reduced to atom-scale thicknesses, and involves a multidisciplinary team of a material scientist, physicist and mechanical engineer to aid in realizing designer infrared materials deemed 'crystalline hybrids'. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor growth, infrared spectroscopy and characterization and theoretical descriptions of complex solids.<br/><br/>Technical Description: This project seeks to develop a new class of materials called Crystalline Hybrids (XHs) that offers the promise for realizing user-defined infrared (IR) optical materials. These novel materials can serve as the basis of next generation IR optical components, sources and detector elements. A primary research goal of this collaborative program is to discover theory-guided principles for the rational design of XHs to meet a given application space. The XH approach seeks to modify polar optic phonons within atomically thin layers comprising a multilayered superlattice. Within these structures, the layer thicknesses will be less than the phonon mean-free-path, resulting in quantum confinement and frequency tuning of the vibrational state. Furthermore, the modified bonding at the multiple interfaces within the superlattice structures introduce new interfacial phonons. These modified phonon properties directly influence the infrared response of the material, as it is optic phonons that dominate the IR behavior of polar crystals. The research is focused on superlattices comprised of the near-lattice matched III-V semiconductors InAs, GaSb and AlSb, which eliminate external effects like strain and allow well-controlled experiments to be performed. The project involves a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students who are trained in the basics of semiconductor growth, IR spectroscopy, theory and first-principles calculations of nanomaterials, enabling them to work at the frontiers of nanophotonics research.

Today's microprocessors can dissipate more than ten times the power density of an electric stove-top element.  The underlying cause of this dissipation is the wasteful way in which information is handled in modern microprocessors.  This project will investigate structures to improve two crucial parts of a computational system.  In the first, devices will be developed for adiabatic reversible logic, using an approach that eliminates leakage power dissipation in digital logic.  In this type of logic the energy used in the computation can be recovered and reused, instead of being lost to heat as in today's computers.  However, in practice this recovery of energy is difficult to do in real systems.  To address this, in the second thrust, power resonators will be developed that can efficiently recover and recycle the energy that is used to process information within the logic. Resonators coupled with reversible adiabatic capacitive logic can greatly reduce the power consumption of computing systems and increase the amount of computation that can be accomplished in an energy constrained application such as the internet of things (IoT). The outreach program proposed will target middle school and high school students through classroom activities involving faculty and graduate students, and field trips to bring students to the Notre Dame labs.<br/><br/>Power dissipation continues to be an immense challenge facing the integrated circuit industry, as today's microprocessors can dissipate more than 100 W/cm2, stretching the limits of single-chip cooling.  The underlying cause of this dissipation is the wasteful way in which information is processed in modern processors.  In conventional logic the energy used to encode a bit of information is dissipated to heat in each clock cycle.  Adiabatic reversible logic can be used to lower dissipation by recovering and reusing the bit energies, but this approach is limited by the energy lost to leakage in the devices.  In addition, energy recovery is complicated and often inefficient.  The goal of this project is to develop micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) structures for both crucial parts of a reversible computational system: logic and energy recovery.  Reversible logic based on transistors is limited by the leakage through the transistors, but the MEMS-based adiabatic capacitive logic developed in this project eliminates leakage. The project will leverage work on devices such as nanorelays to produce voltage-controlled capacitors used in logic structures, and since current-carrying electrical contacts are not required, a key limitation of nanorelays is eliminated.  Relatively little research has been done on power supplies that can drive the logic circuit then recover and reuse the energy used in the computation.  Resonant circuits can meet these requirements, and this project will investigate MEMS resonators that operate with better efficiencies than are possible with on-chip inductor-based resonators.  As a critical component for energy recovery, these resonators must have characteristics different that those of typical MEMS resonators, which are used mostly as time-bases for clocking, and for frequency filtering.  The piezoelectric contour mode resonators developed here will deliver, and recover, significant energy into a capacitive load (the logic elements) with low internal dissipation.  Resonators coupled with reversible adiabatic capacitive logic implement an overall system that can greatly improve the amount of computation that can be done in an energy constrained application such as IoT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using the Hohokam Ballcourt World in the southern U.S. Southwest as a case study, this research informs upon the dynamic ways that groups form social boundaries regardless of spatial proximity. In a broader sense, the project addresses questions regarding the organization of human communities at varying scales, how people form identities, and the long-term effects of these processes. <br/><br/>As part of her Ph.D. dissertation research, Ms. Aragon will use archaeological data from across southern Arizona to examine how people in the prehispanic Southwest formed both relational and categorical identities among social groups and how those identities changed or persisted with the rise and decline of the Hohokam Ballcourt World during the eighth through twelfth centuries (A.D. 700-1100). The researchers will use a multiscalar network approach to reconstruct group identities in the Hohokam Ballcourt World based on material culture at 100-year intervals to create ""snapshots"" through time. In this way, the project addresses issues of group adaptation during times of cultural and ideological change and reorganization. The investigators will use understudied curated material and published reports to integrate and synthesize more than 50 years of fieldwork across the study region. Research with existing collections will add to the stock of information available to managing agencies and will contribute new information that can be used in the interpretation of sites for the public. Finally, this research will contribute new methods for studying identity across time and space, which will be useful to researchers investigating similar processes, both in the past and present.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of these devices rely on so-called p-type GaN, a material with added impurities, which greatly improve its properties. In addition, exciting opportunities in optoelectronics currently emerge in development of a related material, p-type AlGaN.  This is potentially groundbreaking since it will pave the way toward bright ultraviolet (UV) LEDs that can be used in numerous energy efficient applications, including air and water purification, phototherapy, gas sensing, plant growth lighting, and UV curing. The integrated experiment/theory research project is aimed at realizing new efficient conductive p-type GaN and AlGaN semiconductor materials. Adding beryllium (Be) impurity to GaN and AlGaN is expected to result in significantly improved p-type conductivity of these materials, leading to dramatic improvement of UV LED efficiency. Students, including those from underrepresented groups, have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art material deposition, optical spectroscopy experiments, and theoretical calculations. The project also builds a strong foundation for research and education in a relatively small Physics Department at Virginia Commonwealth University. <br/><br/>Technical Description: The project focuses on growth of Be-doped GaN and AlGaN and fundamental studies of point defects in these materials. Analysis of photoluminescence from Be-doped GaN indicates that Be is the shallowest acceptor in GaN, yet achievement of p-type conductivity is still a challenging task, because a variety of point defects are formed during material growth. This collaborative research involves first-principles calculations of microscopic properties of Be and related defects in GaN and AlGaN, growth of Be-doped GaN and AlGaN by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition method, use of ion implantation, thermal annealing, and detailed experimental studies, primarily with photoluminescence and Kelvin probe methods. The roles of growth conditions (temperature, pressure, gas ambient), co-doping with Si and Mg, delta doping techniques, use of surfactants, various thermal annealing approaches are investigated to achieve conductive p-type materials. An in-depth and comprehensive study of the properties and behavior of Be and other defects in GaN and AlGaN by using advanced experimental and theoretical approaches is essential to gain a basic understanding of point defects in semiconductors, the mechanisms of radiative and nonradiative recombination, and possible growth pathways for realizing the efficient p-type materials. Furthermore, the accuracy of current approaches in solid-state theory is critically examined through direct experimental verification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, research has almost exclusively focused on nanowires of traditional semiconductor materials, such as silicon or germanium, in which the atoms are tightly bonded to their neighbors in a three-dimensional crystal. This project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, explores opportunities in tuning structure and properties that arise in nanowires of layered semiconductors, in which atoms are tightly bonded in atomically thin sheets that are in turn held together by much weaker forces. Coordinated efforts in studying the synthesis of such layered nanowires and in exploring their distinct electronic and optoelectronic properties aim to uncover relationships between crystal structure, electronic structure and the flow of electrical current, as well as light absorption and emission, which are import for technological applications. In addition to the targeted technical advances, the project provides far-reaching educational and training opportunities for the involved graduate and undergraduate students. It includes dedicated outreach to high-school students from rural areas that gives student-teacher teams the opportunity to participate in hands-on activities related to the research. Under the guidance of the researchers the students prepare new science learning materials, which they bring back to their school to share their experience with their peers and to help build excitement for careers in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Part 2: Technical Summary<br/><br/>Extensive research on planar 2D and layered chalcogenide semiconductors has been driven by outstanding electronic, optoelectronic, mechanical and chemical properties of these materials. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the possibility of combining the concepts of vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) nanowire growth and van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy to realize layered chalcogenide nanowires. The few existing studies have treated those systems on an equal footing with conventional 3D-crystalline nanowires without addressing the opportunities for materials design that arise in vdW crystals. This project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, explores the unique crystallographic degrees of freedom of vdW nanowires and their control via tailored VLS growth processes. Examples of distinct properties include layering along different directions, facile materials integration due to lifted lattice matching requirements, and a tendency toward spontaneous interlayer twist that adds up to an overall chirality and whose magnitude is controlled by the wire diameter. Coordinated growth and characterization of selected materials with focus on anisotropic metal monochalcogenide semiconductors provide insight into the atomistic growth mechanisms of vdW nanowires and heterostructures. Structure and morphology are correlated to single-nanowire charge transport, and to optoelectronic properties probed by cathodoluminescence spectroscopy at resolution below the exciton radius to address the role of layer stacking and twist, confinement, excitonic effects, as well as interfacial carrier transfers in heterostructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Children's early experiences lay the groundwork for long-term brain development. This is particularly clear in the context of early life stress (ELS), which alters neural circuits involved in learning and self-regulation during adolescence. Identifying biological sequelae that follow ELS exposure and contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes is a pressing scientific priority given that ELS exposure poses significant risks to cognitive and emotional development. The immune system presents itself as a promising biological mechanism by which ELS impacts long-term neurodevelopment because it is highly sensitive to early experiences and has strong bidirectional connections with the brain. <br/><br/>The Psychoneuroimmunological Effects of Early Life Stress Study will test for links between ELS exposure, inflammatory processes, and neurodevelopment across a 2-year period in adolescence.

Longitudinal data will be collected from a group of adopted adolescents who experienced institutional orphanage care as infants--a severe form of ELS--as well as a group of never-institutionalized adolescents. The researcher will test the hypothesis that inflammatory processes promote brain development relevant for learning about threats and disrupt brain development relevant for regulating emotional responses to threats in ELS-exposed adolescents. Pro-inflammatory gene expression will be tested as a mediator between ELS and (a) increased prefrontal-subcortical connectivity during threat learning, and (b) diminished prefrontal-subcortical connectivity during self-regulation.

The knowledge obtained is  applicable to other important chemical reactions relevant to alternative energy production and storage technologies.  The project seeks to develop a unique microscopy technique that allows for the high-resolution imaging of the reactive site.  This imaging is conducted using two techniques: transmission electron microscopy (for atomic-scale structural information) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (for electrochemical information).  Correlating the data of the two complementary techniques provides information on the nature of the catalytic nanosheet edges, defects and atomic steps.  The information is needed to understand the catalytic activity of these materials.

By using very small nanoelectrode probes and significantly increasing the SECM resolution the researchers map and quantitatively measure activities of the nanosheet edges, defects and atomic steps on 2D electrocatalysts and assess the effects of phase transformations and surface functionalization.  The methodology is developed for multi-technique imaging of the same nanoscale portion of the catalytic surface to obtain spatially resolved mechanistic information about heterogeneous processes on 2D electrocatalysts.  The nature of the active sites is elucidated by correlating the SECM activity maps with atomic scale structural and bonding information obtained by STEM and spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) with one-to-one correspondence.  These approaches investigate two important classes of 2D materials - transition metal dichalcogenides and MXenes.

This award will develop accurate and efficient numerical methods with which to study at the whole-cell scale how cells respond and process external signals. This will be done by developing new particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion methods that allow the numerical simulation of the motion of, and reactions between, proteins on the surface of cells and within cells. High-resolution soft X-ray tomographic images of cells will be reconstructed to provide an accurate picture of the interfaces between immune cells. Geometries reconstructed from these images will then be used in computational modeling studies to investigate how the activation of immune cells depends on the structure of contact geometries between cells, and on physical properties of proteins involved in the signaling process. As immune cells play a key role in the body's response to pathogens and cancer, such studies have the potential to ultimately further our understanding and treatment of disease.<br/><br/>This project investigates how both the shape of cell membranes, and cellular substructures within the cytosol, can modify the predicted dynamics of cell signaling pathways. This will be achieved by developing new particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion (PBSRD) models in realistic cellular geometries of T cells, reconstructed from X-ray tomographic images. The studies will focus on T cell signaling pathways, where membrane-based signaling is critical for T cell activation in response to antigens, and highly regulated by the dynamics of cytosolic enzymes. In such pathways, membrane geometry is thought to play a major role through interactions of microvilli and filopodia with antigen presenting cells (APCs). The combination of modeling and imaging studies will give quantitative answers to the question of what the magnitude of these geometric effects are on T-cell signaling. Four-dimensional spatial stochastic models will be developed as they are necessary to accurately capture the dynamics of successfully functioning cellular signaling processes, in situations where cell shape, and internal substructure, can significantly influence the behavior of signaling pathways. The primary research objectives of this project are to: 1) Develop new PBSRD that incorporate the surface diffusion and reaction of molecules. 2) Develop efficient, exact numerical methods for sampling spatial jump processes associated with PBSRD models. 3) Conduct 3D X-ray tomographic imaging studies of T cells and T cells engaged with APCs to understand the variation in the shape of cells, organelles, and density of material within T cells. 4) Apply the new PBSRD methods in 3D geometries reconstructed from the imaging studies to investigate how cell shape and organelle barriers can influence the dynamics of T cell signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include paints, food products and cosmetics. An important feature of these products is that the particles remain in particular arrangements, rather than aggregating or separating from the suspending liquid. Maintaining the proper arrangement of the particles can be challenging, especially for products with long shelf lives.  The key aspect of maintaining the desired arrangement of particles is to control what happens in the small gaps where the particles almost touch each other.  This project takes advantage of a recent development in our ability to make well-defined examples of these small gaps.  The project examines how molecules adsorb into the gaps, and how the adsorption is affected by the gap size.  This molecular adsorption is critical to controlling whether the gaps close or widen with time, and thus whether consumer products maintain the most useful arrangement.  The research in this project will be integrated into programs that teach undergraduate and graduate students, and will provide educational tools to inspire high school students, especially those underrepresented in STEM fields, to continue in science and engineering studies.<br/><br/>Adsorption of ions, surfactants, polymers, and particles is a key factor in determining the stability of colloidal dispersions in thin wetting films, and thus is central to many engineering processes.  Adsorption at single interfaces has been well studied, but the directly relevant quantity for colloid stabilization is adsorption in a thin film between two interfaces. This has only rarely been measured in prior work. A new technique has been developed to measure the amount of a species in nanometer-scale films between two solids.  This technique will be used to measure adsorption in critical regimes where simple modeling based on Poisson-Boltzmann theory is expected to fail, such as in concentrated solutions, multivalent ions, surfactants, and particles. The technique has three elements: (1) fabrication of a robust thin film between two solids with a continuous gradient of thicknesses in the range of 1?200 nm; (2) measurement of film thickness by interferometry; and (3) measurement of the amount of adsorbed molecules from the intensity of fluorescence emission. The expected outcomes are: (1) accurate measurements of amounts of species in thin films; (2) assessment of the validity of common models; (3) insight into the stabilization of films in various applications; and (4) some development of the method to measure the profile of fluorophore concentration in the direction normal to a planar film. We will integrate this work into the ""Computers and Technology at Virginia Tech"" (C-Tech2), which is an annual two-week summer program for 120 female high school to participate in hands-on activities to help develop and sustain interest in science and engineering.

These applications have increased the need for privacy and authentication in future data networks. Traditional encryption tools rely for their security on computational intractability of mathematical procedures such as factoring large numbers, and are therefore, in principle vulnerable. This vulnerability is absent in quantum optics technologies that have been explored during the past few decades. However, in current approaches, quantum networks exploit the most obvious independent quantum point-to-point transmission links between different nodes, making scaling up quantum networks increasingly complicated. Moreover, the technology for quantum networks uses realizations based on free space optics and/or hybrid systems combining free space with fiber optics.  These approaches, however, do not scale; they are bulky, and cannot handle the high level of complexity in a network with a large number of nodes.  The vision of this project is to develop quantum communication circuits on a silicon photonic chip to meet the societal needs of future quantum networks, exploiting multiple entangled and single-photons carrying qubits. Specifically, this proposal is focused on the experimental realization and theoretical analysis of quantum material sources, devices and circuits manufactured with CMOS technology for scalable quantum secret sharing network. The proposed research on exploiting multiple energy-entangled and single qubit carrying photons will enable the construction of next generation quantum networks with unprecedented impact on cybersecurity.

To construct such a network we will develop novel quantum optical devices and components on a chip exploiting CMOS processes with use of fabrication foundries.

Despite the tremendous potential of the ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductors for device applications, with orders of magnitude improvement over devices made from more conventional semiconductors, the fundamental underlying mechanisms of their electrical properties are poorly understood. This project is focused particularly on gallium oxide, a semiconducting oxide with a bandgap of 4.9 eV, that is an attractive candidate for high-power devices. In spite of its promising applications, gallium oxide remains underexplored, and the defects and impurities that affect its electrical properties remain controversial, opening exciting opportunities for fundamental research that impacts technology. Hydrogen impurities and their chemical reactions strongly affect the electronic properties of gallium oxide and are of particular interest in this project. Experimental studies of defects and impurities in gallium oxide provide an excellent opportunity for students to solve important problems in materials physics, igniting excitement that leads to a successful career in science and engineering. The recruiting of students from groups that are under-represented in physics is expanded in the present project.<br/><br/>Technical description: This project is focused on experimental investigation of the hydrogen impurity in gallium oxide, a semiconducting oxide with an ultra-wide bandgap of 4.9 eV. Hydrogen is an important impurity in oxide semiconductors where it can give rise to n-type conductivity and can also compensate deep acceptors. While there are a few theoretical predictions for the properties of hydrogen in gallium oxide, the research in this area is in its infancy. Gallium oxide promises to show new behaviors and to reveal new defect physics. The research involves a complementary set of experimental methods, aiming to determine how hydrogen impurities affect the electronic properties of gallium oxide and to test the theoretical predictions. For example, the combination of vibrational spectroscopy with free-carrier absorption provides a powerful strategy for studying hydrogen centers that relates specific defects with the conductivity they cause. Furthermore, the interactions of hydrogen with other defects such as gallium vacancy are investigated to probe the passivation of these deep acceptors by hydrogen. The addition of Raman scattering and photo-thermal ionization spectroscopies provide access to additional types of hydrogen species that do not have infrared absorption lines (such as molecular hydrogen) but that, nonetheless, play an important role in defect reactions that affect the conductivity of gallium oxide and its thermal stability. The expected outcome of this research is fundamental understanding of which hydrogen centers are n-type dopants in gallium oxide and investigates how hydrogen interacts with other defects that also affect electronic properties. The fundamental science of these defects and their reactions needs to be understood so that the conductivity of gallium oxide can be reliably controlled and engineered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is increasingly a public and policy concern. This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience. This project will establish new multidisciplinary approaches to tackle such complex problems as climate change adaptation, and train graduate students from the partner institutions and countries in international collaborations. <br/> <br/>Dr. Vining and his team will examine how prehispanic agriculturalists developed and switched between various productive strategies as the el Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) changed in frequency and severity.  The study region, north coastal Peru, hosted a series of civilizations between approximately 2000 BC - 1450 AD, including the Moche, Lambayeque, and Chimu societies.  However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.  The researchers come from the fields of archaeology, paleolimnology and palaeoclimate, and ecological modeling. A principal objective will be to combine high-precision dating of agricultural systems with paleoclimate conditions reconstructed from lake cores.

Anderson at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to develop new ways to construct molecules to help meet society's demands for new drugs and new materials. Professor Anderson works with graduate and undergraduate students designing ways to use a reactive molecule called a nitrone as the lynchpin between cheap, readily-accessible reagents and complicated value-added compounds. These nitrone lynchpins are tuned towards new chemical bond construction. Robust routes are being determined to easily generate key intermediates. This approach provides access to new examples of desirable compounds for pharmaceutical and agricultural applications. The broader impact of this work results from both the compounds generated from the new reactions, as well as the new strategies and fundamental reactivity patterns that are identified.

The overarching goal of this program is to couple two simple starting materials to access novel reactive intermediates and then to tune the reactivity of these intermediates to prepare an array of value-added products in a small number of steps. Reactivity goals for the conjugated nitrone intermediates include determining how to control the stereoselectivity of an electrocyclization reaction for the asymmetric synthesis of azetidines and designing ways to direct a cascade process towards the synthesis of spirocyclic pyrrolines. The aim of improving access to conjugated nitrone intermediates involves identifying and fixing road blocks in the Chan-Lam reactions of oximes. These activities provide impact on a broader scale due to the fundamental reactivity patterns and synthetic strategies that are identified, as well as the expansion of chemical space that is achieved through access to new heterocyclic compounds.

Unlike the visible spectral range where materials such as glass provide exceptionally high performance at extremely low cost, the infrared optical components are typically sensitive to water, opaque in the visible, expensive and/or brittle. Thus, identifying alternative materials or material platforms that can provide the basis of next generation infrared optics and light sources is highly desired. Within the infrared, many polar materials, such as silicon carbide, exhibit crystal vibrations that can be excited using light. This provides opportunities to compress long-wavelength infrared light to nanometer scale lengths, offering the potential to significantly reduce the size of infrared optics. However, these crystal vibrations are material specific and thus, finding the right material in the desired infrared frequency range is challenging. This project investigates novel hybrid materials composed of altering stacking thin layers with potential to modify their crystal vibrations in an effort to change its corresponding infrared properties. The collaborative research seeks to understand how these vibrations are influenced when the layer thickness is reduced to atom-scale thicknesses, and involves a multidisciplinary team of a material scientist, physicist and mechanical engineer to aid in realizing designer infrared materials deemed 'crystalline hybrids'. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor growth, infrared spectroscopy and characterization and theoretical descriptions of complex solids.<br/><br/>Technical Description: This project seeks to develop a new class of materials called Crystalline Hybrids (XHs) that offers the promise for realizing user-defined infrared (IR) optical materials. These novel materials can serve as the basis of next generation IR optical components, sources and detector elements. A primary research goal of this collaborative program is to discover theory-guided principles for the rational design of XHs to meet a given application space. The XH approach seeks to modify polar optic phonons within atomically thin layers comprising a multilayered superlattice. Within these structures, the layer thicknesses will be less than the phonon mean-free-path, resulting in quantum confinement and frequency tuning of the vibrational state. Furthermore, the modified bonding at the multiple interfaces within the superlattice structures introduce new interfacial phonons. These modified phonon properties directly influence the infrared response of the material, as it is optic phonons that dominate the IR behavior of polar crystals. The research is focused on superlattices comprised of the near-lattice matched III-V semiconductors InAs, GaSb and AlSb, which eliminate external effects like strain and allow well-controlled experiments to be performed. The project involves a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students who are trained in the basics of semiconductor growth, IR spectroscopy, theory and first-principles calculations of nanomaterials, enabling them to work at the frontiers of nanophotonics research.

Ranging from image, audio and video to social-network, medical and biological datasets, modern applications require us to model and reason about complex data over extremely large domains. It is well-known, however, that this cannot be done in a rigorous manner unless simplifying assumptions can be made about how the data of interest are generated. Accordingly, a long line of investigation in Probability Theory, Statistical Physics, Information Theory and Machine Learning has been preoccupied with developing mathematical and algorithmic frameworks that allow for succinct representation and inference of high-dimensional distributions with simplifying structure. This project will go beyond the standard frameworks in these fields to advance the theoretical foundations of a research frontier that has recently emerged as a promising approach towards a more accurate modeling of high-dimensional data. In particular, this project will study the theoretical foundations of learning, testing and statistical inference of high-dimensional data that are generated by deep neural network-based generative models, developing mathematically rigorous quality guarantees, which is a big desideratum in the field of deep learning. On the practical front, this work has the potential to significantly improve the performance of image-reconstruction algorithms compared to state-of-the-art, and therefore to have significant impact on various applications of image reconstruction such as rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br/><br/>Since the introduction of deep neural network-based generative models, there have been numerous approaches for how to architect them, how to train them using samples from a distribution of interest, and how to use them for downstream inference tasks; these have delivered impressive practical results. On the other hand, there has also been a lot of debate around the quality of deep generative models that are trained via current techniques, and it has been recognized that there are significant challenges in optimizing, evaluating and scaling the dimensionality of deep generative models, as well as in using them for data recovery. This project develops three research thrusts targeting these challenges, namely: (i) developing better algorithms for training deep generative models, and for using these models as ""regularizers"" in signal-processing applications; (ii) developing statistical techniques for evaluating the quality of a deep generative model against the distribution whose samples it was trained on; (iii) proposing architectures and algorithms for scaling up the dimensionality of deep generating models while providing statistical accuracy guarantees. This work will rely on techniques from non-convex and combinatorial optimization, signal processing, game theory, high-dimensional statistics, and statistical physics, and build connections between these fields and deep learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wetlands are effective at storing C due to their high rates of vegetation growth and generally low rates of soil C losses from decomposition by microbes. Like many ecosystems, wetlands are subjected to nutrient enrichment via fertilization from agricultural runoff. Often, fertilization effects can increase microbial activity, leading to higher rates of C loss through microbial decomposition. Thus, wetland C storage is vulnerable to changes in the environment, which, in turn, can result in a reduced capacity for wetlands to compensate for change. Wetland C storage potential could be overestimated when impacts of nutrient enrichment and microbial physiology are not incorporated into the earth-system context. This research will provide insights into microbial controls on soil C processes, which have implications for broad national interests in energy, natural resources management and conservation. This research will advance the fields of ecosystem science, ecology, and microbiology by examining the relationships among microbial diversity, microbial metabolisms, and C-cycling functions. It will also benefit society through classroom educational content focused on microbial diversity and processes at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels that will reach under-served populations, enhancing diversity of the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>This study will test the hypothesis that inorganic nutrient enrichment causes shifts in microbial communities from slow growing oligotroph- to fast growing copiotroph-dominated assemblages, resulting in changes in microbial processing of C and nutrients in soils. An altered ecosystem may lead to soil organic matter (SOM) destabilization, due to decreased mineral-protected SOM and increased respiration rates, thereby reducing soil C storage in wetlands. The specific objectives of this project include: (1) determine how variation in above- and below-ground plant biomass relates to SOM buildup in a historically nutrient-poor wetland now experiencing nutrient enrichment; (2) relate microbial resource-use strategies to atmospheric gas exchange (methane, carbon dioxide), and soil organic matter pools under ambient and nutrient-enriched conditions; and (3) examine how shifts in microbial biomass, community structure, and metabolic diversity affect SOM stabilization and C storage potential due to long-term fertilization. Since 2003, replicated fertilization and disturbance (by mowing) treatments have been applied to a nutrient-poor wetland ecosystem in the North Carolina coastal plain. This new project will leverage the field experiment to determine whether ongoing fertilization influences plant-microbe relationships and soil C storage potential. If nutrient enrichment disrupts wetland C storage, then predictions for wetland C pools may be overestimated since wetlands experience both human and temperature-induced nutrient enrichment. This study will also determine whether physiological assessments of microbial communities (used to characterize oligotrophic and copiotrophic taxa) provide a better predictor of ecosystem responses than taxonomy or biomass-based metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using DMFBs, bioassay protocols are scaled down to droplet size and executed through software-based control of nanoliter droplets on a patterned electrode array. However, technology transition to industry has been challenging as today's DMFBs suffer from several key limitations: (1) constraints on droplet size; (2) difficulty of sensor integration for real-time detection and monitoring; and (3) reliability/yield concerns. To overcome these limitations, micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) biochips have been recently developed, incorporating real-time capacitive sensing on every microelectrode to detect the property and location of a droplet. Such 'sensing maps' open up the exciting opportunity of cyber-physical MEDA biochips that can dynamically respond to bioassay outcomes, perform real-time error recovery, and execute ""if-then-else"" protocols from biochemistry necessary to support the next generation of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with tightly integrated lab-on-chip sensing technology. Despite such tremendous promise, a significant barrier in the exploitation of MEDA for realistic biochemistry arises from the need to manually control biochemical protocols on the biochip. This research is thus motivated by the need to enable the execution of biomolecular assays on programmable and cyber-physical MEDA biochips. To take full advantage of the dynamic adaptation capabilities of MEDA, there is a need for a synthesis and run-time optimization framework that can be agile in its ability to respond to real-time sensor feedback. The proposed research therefore constitutes a comprehensive effort towards the realization of MEDA-based CPS, resulting in new applications that would, for instance, enable breakthroughs in cancer treatment or atmospheric aerosol measurements for pollution monitoring in smart cities.<br/><br/>This is aimed at developing an integrated system solution for MEDA that includes advances in both hardware and software. Specific research products include the following innovations: (1) Modeling and robust controller design, which will involve offline model-based protocol synthesis and online learning-based protocol/model adaptation; (2) Adaptive and elastic synthesis techniques that comprehensively incorporate all the MEDA-specific droplet operations; (3) Optimization methods for multiple-reactant synthesis, which will involve on-chip sample preparation and optimization of the fluidic steps associated with dilution, mixing, and the generation of concentration gradients; (4) Fault tolerance through error recovery based on real-time sensing, droplet tracking, and adaptive MEDA-specific fluidic operations; and (5) MEDA biochip design, fabrication, and testbed setup, and the demonstration of real-time adaptation under software control for cell analysis in personalized cancer treatment. These breakthroughs will advance MEDA from an exploratory platform used to demonstrate droplet manipulation, to a mature platform that microbiologists and biochemists can use for implementing realistic protocols. The project also has an extensive education and outreach component, including curriculum development, expansion of hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and international collaboration. For instance, MEDA-CPS will be used as an important example to showcase real-time adaptation in new undergraduate and graduate courses on modeling, design, and analysis of embedded control and cyber-physical systems.

Most of these devices rely on so-called p-type GaN, a material with added impurities, which greatly improve its properties. In addition, exciting opportunities in optoelectronics currently emerge in development of a related material, p-type AlGaN.  This is potentially groundbreaking since it will pave the way toward bright ultraviolet (UV) LEDs that can be used in numerous energy efficient applications, including air and water purification, phototherapy, gas sensing, plant growth lighting, and UV curing. The integrated experiment/theory research project is aimed at realizing new efficient conductive p-type GaN and AlGaN semiconductor materials. Adding beryllium (Be) impurity to GaN and AlGaN is expected to result in significantly improved p-type conductivity of these materials, leading to dramatic improvement of UV LED efficiency. Students, including those from underrepresented groups, have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art material deposition, optical spectroscopy experiments, and theoretical calculations. The project also builds a strong foundation for research and education in a relatively small Physics Department at Virginia Commonwealth University. <br/><br/>Technical Description: The project focuses on growth of Be-doped GaN and AlGaN and fundamental studies of point defects in these materials. Analysis of photoluminescence from Be-doped GaN indicates that Be is the shallowest acceptor in GaN, yet achievement of p-type conductivity is still a challenging task, because a variety of point defects are formed during material growth. This collaborative research involves first-principles calculations of microscopic properties of Be and related defects in GaN and AlGaN, growth of Be-doped GaN and AlGaN by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition method, use of ion implantation, thermal annealing, and detailed experimental studies, primarily with photoluminescence and Kelvin probe methods. The roles of growth conditions (temperature, pressure, gas ambient), co-doping with Si and Mg, delta doping techniques, use of surfactants, various thermal annealing approaches are investigated to achieve conductive p-type materials. An in-depth and comprehensive study of the properties and behavior of Be and other defects in GaN and AlGaN by using advanced experimental and theoretical approaches is essential to gain a basic understanding of point defects in semiconductors, the mechanisms of radiative and nonradiative recombination, and possible growth pathways for realizing the efficient p-type materials. Furthermore, the accuracy of current approaches in solid-state theory is critically examined through direct experimental verification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmonic analysis plays an important role not only in pure mathematics but also in applied math, engineering, physics, and other sciences. The key idea of harmonic analysis is to represent complicated functions as sums of simple functions. Recently, a few new methods in harmonic analysis were developed and as a result, some long-standing open problems in mathematics were solved. It is desirable to get a deeper understanding of these tools and apply them in other settings.<br/><br/>By combining the polynomial partitioning method of Guth and decoupling theory of Bourgain-Demeter, the principal investigator (together with Guth and Li) proved a sharp Schrodinger maximal estimate, which is a special case of weighted Fourier extension estimates. As an application, this solved the almost everywhere convergence problem of Schrodinger solutions in dimension two, which was raised by Carleson about 40 years ago. The main novelty in this work is the derivation of linear and bilinear refined Strichartz estimates using decoupling and induction on scales. In other recent work together with Zhang, the principal investigator obtained fractal L^2 estimates, which resolved Carleson's problem in higher dimensions and provided new results on Falconer's distance set problem, spherical average Fourier decay rates of fractal measures, bounding the size of divergence set of Schrodinger solutions, etc. The goal of this project is to make progress towards fully understanding fractal L^p estimates by exploiting ideas from the work mentioned above as well as developing new tools in a more general setting. There will be applications to other problems in analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike the visible spectral range where materials such as glass provide exceptionally high performance at extremely low cost, the infrared optical components are typically sensitive to water, opaque in the visible, expensive and/or brittle. Thus, identifying alternative materials or material platforms that can provide the basis of next generation infrared optics and light sources is highly desired. Within the infrared, many polar materials, such as silicon carbide, exhibit crystal vibrations that can be excited using light. This provides opportunities to compress long-wavelength infrared light to nanometer scale lengths, offering the potential to significantly reduce the size of infrared optics. However, these crystal vibrations are material specific and thus, finding the right material in the desired infrared frequency range is challenging. This project investigates novel hybrid materials composed of altering stacking thin layers with potential to modify their crystal vibrations in an effort to change its corresponding infrared properties. The collaborative research seeks to understand how these vibrations are influenced when the layer thickness is reduced to atom-scale thicknesses, and involves a multidisciplinary team of a material scientist, physicist and mechanical engineer to aid in realizing designer infrared materials deemed 'crystalline hybrids'. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor growth, infrared spectroscopy and characterization and theoretical descriptions of complex solids.<br/><br/>Technical Description: This project seeks to develop a new class of materials called Crystalline Hybrids (XHs) that offers the promise for realizing user-defined infrared (IR) optical materials. These novel materials can serve as the basis of next generation IR optical components, sources and detector elements. A primary research goal of this collaborative program is to discover theory-guided principles for the rational design of XHs to meet a given application space. The XH approach seeks to modify polar optic phonons within atomically thin layers comprising a multilayered superlattice. Within these structures, the layer thicknesses will be less than the phonon mean-free-path, resulting in quantum confinement and frequency tuning of the vibrational state. Furthermore, the modified bonding at the multiple interfaces within the superlattice structures introduce new interfacial phonons. These modified phonon properties directly influence the infrared response of the material, as it is optic phonons that dominate the IR behavior of polar crystals. The research is focused on superlattices comprised of the near-lattice matched III-V semiconductors InAs, GaSb and AlSb, which eliminate external effects like strain and allow well-controlled experiments to be performed. The project involves a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students who are trained in the basics of semiconductor growth, IR spectroscopy, theory and first-principles calculations of nanomaterials, enabling them to work at the frontiers of nanophotonics research.

Questions of this type are often motivated by applications in other areas including theoretical computer science, geometry and information theory. This is one of the most active areas in modern Combinatorics and has developed spectacularly over the last decades. In this project the PI intends to investigate several fundamental problems in the area, including ones that are motivated by algorithmic applications. A representative example is the problem of finding the smallest possible size of a graph that contains every member of a given family as an induced subgraph. This is closely related to the ability to store members of the family in an economical way in distributed systems. It is expected that work on the problems addressed in the proposal will lead to new methods and new applications. It is also expected that the project will contribute to advancing mathematics through education by mentoring graduate students working on these topics and by giving lectures on these and related subjects to experts and to graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to study several important problems in Extremal Combinatorics, including ones motivated by algorithmic applications. The first topic addressed deals with universal graphs which are graphs that contain every member of a given family as an induced subgraph. The investigation of the smallest possible number of vertices of universal graphs for prescribed interesting families is motivated by the study of adjacency labeling schemes and received a considerable amount of attention. Within this area, the main goals are to obtain tight estimates for the smallest possible sizes of universal graphs or hypergraphs for the family of all graphs or hypergraphs with a given number of vertices, the family of all Cayley graphs of a given group, and several families of intersection graphs of simple geometric objects. The second topic proposed concerns traces of hypergraphs and the related notions of their VC-dimension and Littlestone dimension. The PI hopes to prove new bounds for the general extremal problem of estimating the maximum number of projections on a set of vertices of a given size that can be guaranteed in any hpergraph with a given number of vertices and edges. In the study of these problems and related ones the PI plans to apply and develop a range of methods combining combinatorial, probabilistic, algebraic and geometric tools with ideas from Coding Theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the western region of Pennsylvania, there are growing needs for skilled technicians in advanced manufacturing and energy companies. To help address this situation, the Community College of Allegheny County will work with industry partners and community organizations to develop courses in new technology areas and expand the college's associate degree program in mechatronics (a blend of mechanical, electrical, and computerized technologies). These new courses will address areas such as robotics, plastics technology, and process technology. Faculty will also be able to obtain certifications in these new areas. This expansion of the program into areas of industrial growth will serve as a model for the benefits of integrating industry certification with academic coursework. The mechatronics program will be designed to offer a variety of options that allow more students to participate and obtain degrees. The project team will also work with secondary school teachers to increase the interest of high school students in career pathways in advanced manufacturing fields. The project will help increase the number of technicians with skills needed for the workforce in the western Pennsylvania region and the nation. <br/><br/>Three goals will guide the project. First, to expand the existing mechatronics degree program to include specialization courses in Robotics, Plastics and Process Technology, and Green Manufacturing. Second, to provide professional development and certifications for faculty in these new technology areas. Three, to develop strategies to increase the exposure and retention along career pathways for secondary school and community college students. The new courses will cover concepts and skills based on industry-relevant topics such as programming portable and customizable robots, injection molding, plastic material selection, instrumentation and operations, quality control, and equipment troubleshooting. These courses will have an overarching theme of green manufacturing. The new curriculum will incorporate capstone projects that include project-based learning activities and student internships. The mechatronics program will also be enhanced to provide flexible evening and weekend scheduling as well as self-paced, online courses to facilitate more participation from a diverse population of students and students in rural areas. Mechatronics faculty at the college will use transportable trainers to provide hands-on guest lectures for secondary school students to showcase career pathways or instruct course modules at high schools. The college will also host Mechatronics Problem Solving Competitions for secondary school students to encourage their engagement in, and awareness of, technician pathways for advanced manufacturing fields.

This award will develop accurate and efficient numerical methods with which to study at the whole-cell scale how cells respond and process external signals. This will be done by developing new particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion methods that allow the numerical simulation of the motion of, and reactions between, proteins on the surface of cells and within cells. High-resolution soft X-ray tomographic images of cells will be reconstructed to provide an accurate picture of the interfaces between immune cells. Geometries reconstructed from these images will then be used in computational modeling studies to investigate how the activation of immune cells depends on the structure of contact geometries between cells, and on physical properties of proteins involved in the signaling process. As immune cells play a key role in the body's response to pathogens and cancer, such studies have the potential to ultimately further our understanding and treatment of disease.<br/><br/>This project investigates how both the shape of cell membranes, and cellular substructures within the cytosol, can modify the predicted dynamics of cell signaling pathways. This will be achieved by developing new particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion (PBSRD) models in realistic cellular geometries of T cells, reconstructed from X-ray tomographic images. The studies will focus on T cell signaling pathways, where membrane-based signaling is critical for T cell activation in response to antigens, and highly regulated by the dynamics of cytosolic enzymes. In such pathways, membrane geometry is thought to play a major role through interactions of microvilli and filopodia with antigen presenting cells (APCs). The combination of modeling and imaging studies will give quantitative answers to the question of what the magnitude of these geometric effects are on T-cell signaling. Four-dimensional spatial stochastic models will be developed as they are necessary to accurately capture the dynamics of successfully functioning cellular signaling processes, in situations where cell shape, and internal substructure, can significantly influence the behavior of signaling pathways. The primary research objectives of this project are to: 1) Develop new PBSRD that incorporate the surface diffusion and reaction of molecules. 2) Develop efficient, exact numerical methods for sampling spatial jump processes associated with PBSRD models. 3) Conduct 3D X-ray tomographic imaging studies of T cells and T cells engaged with APCs to understand the variation in the shape of cells, organelles, and density of material within T cells. 4) Apply the new PBSRD methods in 3D geometries reconstructed from the imaging studies to investigate how cell shape and organelle barriers can influence the dynamics of T cell signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, these gendered career patterns increase attrition risk for female engineers. This project aims to serve the national interest of broadening participation by improving the representation of women in technically-oriented roles and career paths within engineering. This Institutional and Community Transformation, Exploration and Design project focuses on female engineering students' elective track choices as a predictor of gendered career patterns.  Project personnel will investigate the driving forces behind elective track choices for female engineering students.  Then, they will use the findings to inform faculty development and other administrative efforts to improve gender balance within technical elective tracks and technically-oriented careers.  <br/> <br/>The goal of the project is to identify individual and institutional factors that contribute to female students' elective track choices within engineering majors. This study builds on previous work that demonstrates gendered role and career patterns, and will contribute to filling gaps in understanding how and why these patterns develop.  The investigators will collect data over multiple years through surveys and interviews of female undergraduates in engineering.  The study will also include faculty and staff members who advise those students regarding elective track selection. The surveys will be developed by the PIs and will incorporate previously validated measures of math attitudes, role confidence, engineering identity, and related constructs.  Using a longitudinal, multi-method and multi-level case study approach, the investigators will identify key relationships between female students' elective track choices and institutional demographics, culture, curriculum, and instructional approaches in both gender-balanced and imbalanced majors. The study, which includes oversight from an external evaluator, will produce recommendations for engineering faculty, advisors, and administrators who can directly affect the climate of engineering programs and career path decisions of engineering students. Moreover, the findings may inform similar investigations of gendered educational tracking in non-engineering majors (e.g., mathematics; physics), and may generalize to other educational settings beyond the study site. Thus, the study could help address gendered practices and identify strategies to minimize them throughout undergraduate STEM education.

The objective of this research is to generate new, tailorable, metamaterials in ways that can be easily scaled up and do not rely on complex and expensive approaches. Specifically, this work will produce porous polysilicone materials and generate fundamental understanding of how the structure of polymers used to prepare the porous materials can control their performance as soft metamaterials. In addition to the expected positive impact on metamaterials research, the findings from this work will also benefit scientists studying porous materials used for biomedical and regenerative medicine applications and new silicone materials. <br/><br/>There is also a great need for a diverse, globally engaged U.S. workforce possessing world-class skills. This workforce is expected to enhance U.S. leadership in research and education and strengthen national economic competitiveness. The activities in this proposal will include international collaborative research opportunities between the University of Cincinnati and the University of Bordeaux. This will include a trip to France for two undergraduate students from the University of Cincinnati to participate in hands-on research experiences with experts on metamaterials. The effectiveness of the international experiences will be evaluated each year and the results disseminated though conference presentations and scientific papers.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The fabrication of metamaterials is largely achieved by top-down lithography approaches, which are difficult to scale-up. Alternatively, a bottom-up strategy to make optical and acoustic metamaterials is possible using silicone polymerized high-internal-phase emulsions (polyHIPEs). The objective of this research is to generate new, tailorable, metamaterials. The central hypothesis tested in this project is that the structure and functionality of block copolymer surfactants control the stability and properties of water-in-silicone emulsions and thus the resulting polyHIPEs, and hence the final metamaterials properties. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine how the porosity, storage moduli, and damping of silicone polyHIPEs control the speed of sound within the material as a result of the structure of water-in-silicone emulsions.  Aim 2: Prepare polymer cross-linkers as surfactants for water-in-silicone emulsions to maintain porosity and compressibility of silicone polyHIPEs and stabilize gold nanoparticles within the polyHIPE.  Accomplishment of these Aims is expected to establish how amphiphilic block polymer surfactant chemistry can be used to prepare new porous silicone polyHIPE materials.  This is timely and important, as it could afford tunable, simple, and relatively cheap acoustic metamaterials for applications in imaging, cloaking, and long-wavelength noise reduction. The graduate and undergraduate students engaged in this research will be trained in polymer chemistry, materials synthesis and characterization, and will participate in international collaborative research.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike PET, crystalline PLA are brittle at room temperature, making the material hardly usable.  Amorphous PLA is also brittle because of rapid physical aging that can take place in PLA.  To make the replacement competitive, which is of considerable economic benefit to the national prosperity and welfare, several scientific advances must be made.  First, a better understanding of mechanics of semicrystalline polymers must be achieved from a molecular viewpoint.  Second, a clearer relationship must be established between processing conditions and resulting mechanical properties of semicrystalline polymers.  The proposed research will investigate why crystallization does not enhance ductility for polymers with Tg above room temperature.  In particular, research will be conducted to evaluate the conjectures that (a) crystalline regions of such semicrystalline polymers are mechanically weaker than the non-crystalline regions and (b) fast crystallization is necessary is entrap chain entanglement and preserve (instead of deplete) chain networking.  Moreover, efforts will be made to establish the processing, structure and property relationships that will make PLA superbly tough and heat resistant.  Specifically, scientific principles will be identified to achieve crystallization while preserving chain uncrossability.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Past studies of mechanics of semicrystalline polymers and ""flow-induced"" crystallization mainly focused on polymers whose glass transition temperature are below room temperature and crystallization kinetics are relatively fast, e.g., isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene.  The existing knowledge is thus not transferrable for class B semicrystalline polymers (with Tg above room temperature) such as PLA because mechanics of PLA at room temperature involves deformation of glassy amorphous regions that separate the crystalline regions.  For example, the well-known respective models of Peterlin and Flory-Yoon do not directly apply.  The much higher stress due to glassy polymer deformation raises the question of whether crystalline regions are structurally as strong as the amorphous regions.  Since chains do not topologically cross in the crystalline regions, the cohesion of crystalline regions cannot take advantage of strong covalent bonds and is thus limited.  The planned research will apply new knowledge in melt rheology and molecular mechanics of polymeric glasses, in combination with the mature characterization tools such as WAXS, SAXS and DSC to establish an insightful perspective that recognizes the need to explicitly describe and control the state of the amorphous phase in terms of the population of tie chains relative to dangling and free chains.  Moreover, in situ polarized optically microscopy will be employed to identify the locations (either inside spherulites, or within amorphous regions or at inter-spherulitic boundaries) where mechanical weakness resides, providing the needed information for a molecular model of mechanics of glassy semicrystalline polymers.  The proposed work will explore the unique effect of elastic pre-melt-deformation on polymer crystallization and resulting mechanical properties of PLA.  Here each stretched entanglement strand is expected to nucleate a nano-crystal that is free of chain folding and acts like rigid nano-fillers in close packing, linked by non-crystalline stretched chain networking.  Specifically, cold-crystallization of pre-melt-stretched PLA could result in crystalline yet optically clear samples that are not only superbly ductile but also have outstanding dimensional stability (e.g., zero shrinkage at 100 degrees Celsius).<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The full-day event will take place on October 14, in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2019 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held October 15?18, in Memphis, TN, and which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.  This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, the mission of VL/HCC is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  More information about the Symposium may be found online at https://human-se.github.io/vlhcc2019/.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants to the Graduate Consortium, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women.  To further increase diversity, no more than two student participants will be accepted from any given institution (and if two are accepted, then at least one of them must be from an under-represented group in STEM fields).<br/><br/>Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in an ""ocean"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Graduate Consortium, the 17th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.   The Graduate Consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  The student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty participants as well as from the other students.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  This event will therefore promote discovery and learning, while also building community among young researchers working from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  To get feedback from a broader slice of the VL/HCC community, every student participant will present a poster or demo at the Showpieces event during the main conference. A 2-page extended abstract of each student participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Besides, it is one of the most common ways of propagating mobile malware. Existing countermeasures mostly detect repackaging based on app similarity measurement, which tends to be imprecise when obfuscations are applied to repackaged apps. Moreover, they rely on a centralized party, typically the hosting app store, to perform the detection, but many alternative app stores fail to commit proper effort to piracy detection. This research aims at an effective defense against app repackaging, and will result in substantial progress in tackling malware propagated via repackaged apps. It will help mitigate attacks such as ransomware or DDoS launched from repackaged apps. It will also help reduce the massive monetary loss of legitimate app developers. Industrial collaborations ensure rapidly translate scientific discovery and technical knowledge into beneficial commercial products. Educational resources from this project, including course modules on mobile security and malware detection, will be disseminated through a dedicated web site. This research will foster new research and education opportunities at University of South Carolina. Students from underrepresented groups will participate in the project.<br/><br/>This research is to explore a decentralized scheme that adds repackaging detection capability into the app to be protected, such that the host devices are made use of to conduct detection when the app is running. The main challenge is how to protect the repackaging detection code from attacks. The team of research proposes a novel malware-inspired approach to handling the important mobile app repackaging problem. The team will explore a creative use of logic bombs, which are regularly used in malware: the trigger conditions are constructed to exploit the differences between the attacker and users (in terms of hardware, sensor values, and inputs), such that a bomb that lies dormant on the attacker side will be activated on the user side. The repackaging detection code, which is packed as the bomb payload, is executed only if the bomb is activated. (2) Unlike many conventional software tampering detection techniques that try to conceal the detection code, by leveraging various methods used in malware this design is non-stealthy, which means that the detection code is not hidden, yet still resilient to attacks. (3) The proposed system also aims to detect code tampering, which occurs when malicious code is inserted and hence implies extraordinary dangers. (4) The decentralized repackaging/tampering detection is proposed to be used for crowdsourced malware information collection to fight against malware propagation. (5) Finally, the team is to address how to prevent the proposed techniques from being abused by malware authors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To help fill this need, Front Range Community College will design and implement a new associate degree program that will prepare students to be industrial maintenance technicians. The project team will work in partnership with local manufacturing companies in northern Colorado to develop courses for the program. These courses will include active learning and skills-building instruction on new training equipment to provide industry-relevant learning experiences for students. This innovative degree program will provide students with options of certificates that can be stacked toward the associate degree as part of an approach for career advancement. The program will also provide the opportunity for students to obtain industry-recognized certifications. The certifications will help demonstrate students' readiness for employment. As a result, the project has the potential to increase the number of skilled industrial maintenance technicians available to meet workforce needs.<br/><br/>This project will seek to: 1) provide enhanced learning experiences for engineering technology students that respond to critical needs of the Northern Colorado advanced manufacturing industry; and 2) grow and diversify the regional industrial maintenance technician workforce. The project team will design a new Associate of Applied Science degree in automation and engineering technology, in close collaboration with subject matter experts in local manufacturing industries. The new curriculum will use state-of-the-art industrial training equipment to incorporate hands-on experiences that help students develop needed skills, including skills in electrical circuits and instrumentation, industrial motors and controls, basic machining, fluid power, and mechanical systems. The two-year course of study will include two stackable certificates. At the end of the first year in the program, students will earn a certificate in Industrial Maintenance. During the second year, students will be able to earn an Industrial Automation and Robotics certificate, as well as complete the National Institute of Metalworking Skills (NIMS) Certification tests for Process Control Systems (Duty Area 7). Student performance on the NIMS testing will be used to study the effects of the new curriculum on student learning outcomes. The innovative structuring of the course sequences will enable students to gain marketable skills after only one year and will help provide a shortened path to an entry-level job for students who may have financial obstacles. This flexible structuring will also be used to attract, recruit, and retain more students from underserved and underrepresented populations within the region. The content in the new degree program, the project results, and best practices will be disseminated in the local community, regionally, and nationally.

In the US, eastern forests have been less affected by droughts and fires than western forests. However, several eastern tree species -- notably eastern hemlock and American beech -- have experienced big population collapses over the last several thousand years.  Hence, eastern forests may be at greater risk of collapse than commonly thought.  This project will collect new data and apply powerful mathematical tools to test hypotheses about why hemlock and beech forests have suffered big declines. Researchers will focus on the roles of severe droughts, bigger and more frequent fires, and greater competition among tree species.  Ultimately, this project seeks to 1) better understand the fundamental processes that trigger abrupt collapse of tree populations and 2) thereby inform and reduce current risks to forest health.<br/><br/>The project will analyze long-term records (>6,000 years, at decadal resolution) of forest composition, fire regime, and drought, based on lake sediment cores to be collected at four sites -- two at places where beech and hemlock are abundant today and two where only beech is abundant.  At each site, the timing of past tree population declines will be established by records of fossil pollen and radiocarbon dates, while past fire events will be identified through analysis of the abundance of charcoal fragments in sediments.  Because plant water stress affects the kinds of carbon isotopes in plant tissue, this project will identify past drought episodes through an innovative approach that requires precise measurements of the carbon isotopic content of individual pollen grains.  Because all records will be co-located from the same sediment cores, the relative sequence of events will be precisely known.  At two sites, reconstructions of changes in lake water balance, based on characteristics of the lake sediments, will provide an independent check on the drought and water-stress signals inferred from carbon isotopes.  A new community-level statistical model will integrate data and be used to test hypotheses about the relative importance of drought, fire events, and competition on past declines of tree populations.  All data collected will be archived in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, an open public repository of long ecological records, curated by experts.  All source code for statistical software developed here will be made publicly available, and a workshop will be held to train students and early career scientists in the new methods that will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is unique in that physics will be used to focus algebraic reasoning in a mathematics content course based on elementary and middle school curriculum, an area that has received little attention in previous research. Because elementary preservice teachers typically do not receive any instruction in physics, they often struggle with algebraic concepts and the applications of those concepts in meaningful real-world contexts. This project has the potential to address these weaknesses by providing integrated physics/mathematics training for mathematics education instructors who prepare elementary preservice teachers to teach in grades K-8. In addition, the project will prepare over 200 teachers per year using physics laboratory activities and technological tools in their undergraduate coursework. As a result, the project's impact could extend to thousands of elementary school students in classes taught by these teachers who learned how physics can be used to contextualize mathematics. <br/><br/>The project has three primary goals: (i) develop and test curricular materials and instructional methods that connect experimental physics activities to elementary and middle school algebraic reasoning content; (ii) confer with, train, and support mathematics education instructors over a three-year period to develop their knowledge and expertise in the classroom use of the developed instructional materials and methods; and (iii) improve elementary preservice teachers' understanding of algebraic concepts and applications in real-world contexts by guiding them in mathematics-focused physics activities employing technological tools in courses that utilize the newly developed instructional materials. The project's evaluation will include qualitative and quantitative feedback to guide the iterative process of creating and designing activities and assessments to support both the mathematics education instructors and their elementary preservice teachers. Data will specifically focus on content knowledge, because the goal of the course is primarily to improve elementary preservice teachers' mathematical content knowledge. Data will be gathered through surveys, pre- and post-tests and panel discussions involving both the mathematics education instructors and the elementary preservice teachers. A mixed methods approach will be used to examine the link between the implementation activities and project outcomes.

In the US, eastern forests have been less affected by droughts and fires than western forests. However, several eastern tree species -- notably eastern hemlock and American beech -- have experienced big population collapses over the last several thousand years.  Hence, eastern forests may be at greater risk of collapse than commonly thought.  This project will collect new data and apply powerful mathematical tools to test hypotheses about why hemlock and beech forests have suffered big declines. Researchers will focus on the roles of severe droughts, bigger and more frequent fires, and greater competition among tree species.  Ultimately, this project seeks to 1) better understand the fundamental processes that trigger abrupt collapse of tree populations and 2) thereby inform and reduce current risks to forest health.<br/><br/>The project will analyze long-term records (>6,000 years, at decadal resolution) of forest composition, fire regime, and drought, based on lake sediment cores to be collected at four sites -- two at places where beech and hemlock are abundant today and two where only beech is abundant.  At each site, the timing of past tree population declines will be established by records of fossil pollen and radiocarbon dates, while past fire events will be identified through analysis of the abundance of charcoal fragments in sediments.  Because plant water stress affects the kinds of carbon isotopes in plant tissue, this project will identify past drought episodes through an innovative approach that requires precise measurements of the carbon isotopic content of individual pollen grains.  Because all records will be co-located from the same sediment cores, the relative sequence of events will be precisely known.  At two sites, reconstructions of changes in lake water balance, based on characteristics of the lake sediments, will provide an independent check on the drought and water-stress signals inferred from carbon isotopes.  A new community-level statistical model will integrate data and be used to test hypotheses about the relative importance of drought, fire events, and competition on past declines of tree populations.  All data collected will be archived in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, an open public repository of long ecological records, curated by experts.  All source code for statistical software developed here will be made publicly available, and a workshop will be held to train students and early career scientists in the new methods that will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to address the challenges of sustainability via the design of new, robust materials with longer life spans that need to be replaced less frequently. Recyclable and self-repairing materials offer one route for extending the useful lifetime of a polymeric material. Unfortunately, many of the most commonly encountered polymers that are readily recyclable and repairable suffer from poor resistance to solvents or exposure to high temperatures. Conversely, polymers with enhanced solvent, thermal, and dimensional stability are generally not recyclable and cannot be rendered self-healing, because their molecular structure does not allow the mobility required to do so. This project aims to elucidate the fundamentals that will allow bridging the divide between these two classically disparate families of materials. By exercising precise control over key molecular-scale parameters, the factors governing processability, recyclability, self-healing, and utility will be determined to allow the design of next-generation materials. A key component of this project involves outreach and educational activities directed toward local K-12 students as well as training and professional development of graduate and undergraduate students in emerging areas of chemistry and polymer science.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>One of the traditional classification mechanisms for bulk polymeric materials relies on whether or not the chains that comprise the material are crosslinked. Crosslinked polymers (i.e., thermosets) may have significantly enhanced dimensional, chemical, mechanical, and solvent stability compared to their non-crosslinked analogs (i.e., thermoplastics), but these attributes are accompanied by an inability to be reshaped or recycled. There is a significant need for materials that combine the properties of thermosets and thermoplastics by relying on reversible crosslinks that can undergo exchange by either an associative or dissociative mechanism. The former method of crosslink exchange is particularly promising because it allows for network rearrangement without loss of connectivity (i.e., no change in crosslink density). Networks that undergo associative exchange have recently become known as ""vitrimers."" The goal of this project is the investigation and development of vitrimers that are accessible via a straightforward method that relies on the curing of vinyl monomer-derived prepolymers generated by controlled radical polymerization. Critically, this strategy decouples the network curing and backbone polymerization steps, allowing for precise manipulation of structure, topology, and functionality within the chains comprising the network. Three specific aims will be pursued to (1) interrogate the effect of structural elements of both the polymeric and crosslinker components of vitrimers derived from vinyl polymers, (2) determine the role of chain microstructure and topology on vitrimer (re)processability, and (3) prepare and investigate vitrimers with stimuli-activatable intrinsic catalysts. Successful completion of these aims will reveal fundamental structure-property relationships of dynamically crosslinked networks while generating design principles for vitrimers with unprecedented chemical and mechanical properties.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The memory illusion refers to memory errors that people make to remember information as an outcome of interpreting and making inferences from their past experience. This project will use social media data to examine the memory illusion with online information, and to understand how it is associated with people's trust in information on social media. Better understanding on the extent and impact of the memory illusion phenomenon using big data will inform machine-learning approaches to better measure trust in information with an additional human information-processing perspective, benefiting society by providing reliable online information, and increasing people's overall trust in information on social media.<br/><br/>This project pursues several research goals to advance the state-of-art of machine learning models to predict people's trust in information on social media. The first goal is to characterize the formation of associative inferences on Twitter information, and understand how it contributes to individuals' trust in tweets.  To advance this goal, the research will use big data and data-driven machine learning models. Based on the insights learned from big data, the second goal is to establish the causal relations between identified associative inferences and people's trust of social media information with laboratory and online user studies. The last goal is to model associative inferences into machine learning algorithms to improve the prediction of user trust in online information. The project will advance the state-of-the-art with regard to our understanding on people's trust in social media information in particular and human memory illusion in general. Through interdisciplinary socio-technical collaboration, the project will advance machine-learning models considering human information processing to improve the prediction of people's trust in information on social media, and improve understanding of human behavior using a big data approach to reveal relations among psychological phenomena on a scale that has not been possible with the smaller data sets collected in the laboratory.

From social networking to banking, from mobile devices to cloud computing, the PKI allows communicating parties to be sure of whom they are communicating with, that their communication is confidential, and that their communication has not been tampered with.  Despite its incredible importance, the PKI has been notoriously difficult to evolve to meet new security concerns and Internet demands.  This project introduces new, deployable alternatives to key parts of the PKI to make it more evolvable, manageable, and secure.<br/><br/>The project has three primary thrusts.  The first introduces a key enabling technology behind the subsequent thrusts, called assertion-carrying certificates (ACCs).  ACCs expand today's certificates with the capability of including a small amount of code (in the form of assertions) to be evaluated as part of the certificate validation process.  The second thrust applies ACCs to enable certificate authorities to more readily evolve to new demands for certificate delegation and automated issuance.  The third thrust applies ACCs and trusted execution environments to enable web-hosting services like content delivery networks to securely manage their customers' cryptographic keys.<br/><br/>Correct operation of the PKI is paramount to ensuring a secure, authenticated Internet.  Recent efforts have proven that progress towards a more secure PKI is possible, but a more fundamental focus is needed to address the underlying challenges.  This project will do just that by developing a new, extensible approach to constraining when identities on the Internet should be trusted.  This project will make it straightforward and safe to extend the basic abstractions offered by the PKI, thereby enabling it to evolve to meet changing trends.<br/><br/>The project's code and data will be made publicly available and maintained at https://securepki.org<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Equilibrium climate sensitivity is a central concept in climate science for estimating the future temperature under the scenario of a continuous increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration using climate models, as a large portion of the total climate warming results from other changes in the climate system in response to the radiative forcing due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, such as clouds, atmospheric moisture, and snow/ice coverage. The research has broader societal impacts as the central goal of this study is to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms that have controlled tropical climate and how it responds to warming. This is of significant practical value in establishing confidence in the ability of climate models to capture tropical feedbacks under future warming. <br/><br/>This award will support the careers and training of the PI (an early career female scientist), a graduate student, and a postdoctoral fellow. The PI will work with Geology graduate students through summer research visits and development of a website for students/researchers from across the country to access and analyze paleoclimate model data. She will mentor local undergraduate and high school students through George Mason's Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program and present a ""weather and climate"" module at a George Mason summer camp designed for females underrepresented in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.   <br/><br/>Constraining the range of climate sensitivity estimates beyond those established over the last three decades has proven to be one of the grand challenges in climate science. The limited timespan of the instrumental record makes it difficult to tease out natural, decadal-plus variability from cloud feedbacks in response to greenhouse gas induced warming, with signals further complicated by 20th century aerosol forcing. This project will take a new approach towards constraining the nature of cloud feedbacks under warming by examining climate sensitivities in past warm periods of paleo climate records. The current climate models lack ability to adequately reproduce the reduced meridional surface temperature gradients reconstructed for the past three warm climates, namely, the Pliocene, Miocene and Eocene, as constrained by large-scale surface temperature and hydrological cycle reconstructions. <br/><br/>The PI will seek answer about the required strength of the climate sensitivity, particularly from tropical cloud radiative feedback, for climate models to simulate these three very different past warm periods. This multi-warm-climate approach will help establish the extent to which robust tropical cloud feedback mechanisms can consistently explain the patterns of warming, and the hydrological cycle response, seen across the 20th century, Pliocene, Miocene and Eocene. The research project will integrate the latest scientific advances within both the climate modeling and paleoclimate reconstruction communities to: 1) address a fundamental gap in our understanding of the tropical feedbacks needed to simulate distinct past warm climates and the extent to which they are consistent across warm periods, and 2) test the robustness of climate mechanisms put forth within the paleoclimate community to aid in the interpretation and design of climate reconstructions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, starting with quantum mechanics, a great number of models emerged that led to mathematical problems involving variables that no longer commute. Noncommutative Algebra is one of the areas of mathematics that studies those structures. The research projects that are funded by this award investigate the interrelations between the commutative and noncommutative settings, using a branch of geometry called Poisson geometry. Three other approaches are used to study the noncommutative setting:  a combinatorial approach based on intricate internal transformations of the objects, called cluster mutations;  an algebraic approach that investigates intrinsically defined structures called Calabi-Yau categories; and  a noncommutative geometric approach using quantum versions of symmetric spaces. The four approaches are simultaneously used to carry out a detailed study of the properties and symmetries of noncommutative objects. Further, the noncommutative objects are shown to exhibit various forms of rigidity. This is used to settle problems in algebra, geometry, combinators, and dynamical systems that were previously posed without any reference to the noncommutative setting. These research activities will be used as the foundation for the training of graduate and undergraduate students and for mentoring mathematics postdocs.<br/><br/>The research projects funded under this awaard investigate problems in noncommutative algebra, quantum symmetric spaces, and noncommutative projective algebraic geometry and the relations of these problems to Poisson geometry, combinatorics, triangulated categories, and integrable systems. On the one hand, the program aims at using methods from the latter areas to describe the structure and representations of quantum cluster algebras at roots of unity, the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, the algebras that appear in the theory of quantum symmetric pairs, and the algebras that describe noncommutative projective spaces. In the opposite direction, previously posed problems in the latter areas are converted to problems for noncommutative algebras and their representation categories, and are then resolved within that setting. One of the directions of this program is the construction of universal K-matrices on the symmetric subalgebras of the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, and using this to study the ring theoretic properties of Nichols algebras. Another direction aims at the classification of irreducible representations of Nichols algebras of diagonal type using Poisson orders and noncommutative discriminants. A third direction develops a general setting for the study of finite dimensional representations of quantum cluster algebras at root of unity using Poisson geometry and Cayley-Hamilton algebras. Three additional directions investigate the geometry of noncommutative projective spaces modeled by higher dimensional elliptic algebras, the structure of 2-Calabi-Yau categories via categorical C-vectors and dynamical systems, and the construction of integral quantum cluster algebra structures on the canonical forms of quantized coordinate rings of varieties in theory of Lie groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through burrowing, constructing tubes, and feeding on sediments, these animals modify their physical and chemical environments to such an extent that they are considered ecosystem engineers. Bioturbation, the mixing of sediments by animals, is important in regenerating nutrients and transporting pollutants and carbon bound to mineral grains. Despite its importance, our ability to predict bioturbation rates and patterns from the community structure is poor, largely due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which animals mix sediments. This project builds on earlier work showing that animals extend burrows through muddy sediments by fracture to test the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of sediments that affect burrowing mechanics also affect sediment mixing. More broadly, this project examines the relative contributions of (i) the functional roles of the organisms in the community, (ii) the mechanical properties of sediments, and (iii) factors that might increase or decrease animal activity such as temperature and food availability to bioturbation rates. Burrowing animals modify the physical properties of sediments, and this project quantifies these changes and tests the hypothesis that these changes are ecologically important and affect community succession following a disturbance. In addition to this scientific broader impact, this project involves development of instrumentation to measure sediment properties and includes a substantial education plan to introduce graduate, undergraduate, and middle school students to the important role that technology plays in marine science. <br/><br/>Through burrowing and feeding activities, benthic infauna mix sediments and modify their physical environments. Bioturbation gates the burial of organic matter, enhances nutrient regeneration, and smears the paleontological and stratigraphic record. However, current understanding of the mechanisms by which infaunal activities mix sediments is insufficient to predict the impacts of changes in infaunal community structure on important sediment ecosystem functions driven by bioturbation. This project tests specific hypotheses relating infaunal communities, bioturbation, and geotechnical properties with the ultimate goal of understanding the dynamic changes and potential feedbacks between infauna and their physical environments. This project integrates field and lab experiments to assess the relative importance of infaunal community structure and activities to bioturbation rates. Additionally, this project builds on recent work showing that muddy sediments are elastic gels through which worms extend burrows by fracture to propose that geotechnical properties of sediments mediate bioturbation by governing the release of particles from the sediment matrix during burrow extension. Finite element modeling determines how the release of particles by fracture during burrowing depends on the fracture toughness (cohesion) and stiffness (compaction) of sediments and complements laboratory experiments characterizing the impact of geotechnical properties on burrowing behaviors. The proposed research also aims to determine whether impacts of infauna on geotechnical properties are ecologically important. Changes in infaunal communities and geotechnical properties following an experimental physical disturbance address the hypothesis that ecosystem engineering of bulk sediment properties facilitates succession.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Being a single parent is even harder. Nearly 90% of bird species exhibit a bi-parental care strategy, which means both mom and dad care for their young. However, unpredictable conditions including predation, sickness, and inclement weather can result in single parenthood. To continue caring for their young as the sole caregiver, the surviving parent must often compensate for the loss of a partner. To investigate the costs of single parenting, investigations have focused on understanding how being raised be a single parent affects offspring. However, what are the consequences of single parenting on the single parent? Even lesser known is how might these consequences differ between single mothers versus single fathers. The investigator has been successfully using the socially monogamous, bi-parental model of the rock dove (Columba livia) to study the neurobiology of parental care. Now, the investigator will use an integration of behavioral, neural, physiological, genomic, cellular, and evolutionary biology to produce a holistic view of the causes and consequences of single parenting on the single parent, between mothers and fathers, and at a scale and mechanistic depth unmatched by previous work. The information generated will have broad potential applications to be utilized by scientists in many fields, ranging from management of captive breeding programs for conservation or agricultural purposes, to treatment for neural deficiencies in parent-offspring bonding in humans and other animals.

Aims are necessarily independent and will generate their own novel contributions; however, when assessed together, their synergy will shine a bright light on genome to phenome to fitness relationships in single mothers and fathers and paired counterparts. This project will generate large genomic datasets and identify critical genes associated with tradeoffs experienced during single parenthood. All data and computer code will be made publicly available in established repositories and shared openly with the scientific community. Vital to this project is the creation of substantial research opportunities for predominantly Latino/a/x undergraduate trainees, resulting in a reciprocal relationship between research and undergraduate education while strengthening diversity in STEM.

We can look to past warm times in recent Earth history to better constrain how the Earth system will respond to warming over the coming century. At the end of the last ice age Earth's orbit was such that the Northern Hemisphere received nearly 10% more solar energy in summer than at present. That extra energy was sufficient to melt almost all Iceland's glaciers, and the Sagas say birch forests extended from the shores to the mountains. Molecular compounds that track changes in temperature, aridity, and vegetation history are contained within the sediment deposited in Icelandic lakes and nearby composite soils over the past 12,000 years. These ""proxies"" provide a means to accurately reconstruct a continuous history of climate and ecosystem status across Iceland since the end of the last ice age. This research benefits from recent advances in the recovery of DNA from sedimentary archives and in organic geochemistry to isolate biomarkers that track temperature and moisture balance. A pervasive feature of the contemporary Icelandic landscape is widespread soil erosion, but whether that erosion is a result of human settlement and pastoral activity or climate change remains debated. Geochemical proxies related to soil erosion preserved in well-dated lake sediment are targeted to disentangle the roles of climate and humans in Iceland's soil erosion history. This project helps launch an early-career Latino scientist, provides international exposure to a recent PhD as postdoc in a DNA laboratory in Norway, and supports a new PhD student, as well as supporting and mentoring motivated undergraduate students, who gain research experience in a highly relevant field. With an embedded journalist communicating the potential effects of climate change derived from this research to the wider public is enhanced. <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The Arctic is currently warming twice as fast as the global average with summer temperatures predicted to be 4 to 6 degrees C above late 20th Century averages by the year 2100.  Amplified warming in the Arctic is expected to result in a northward shift in woody plants. The increase in woody vegetation will reduce surface albedo and increase atmospheric water vapor, positive feedback mechanisms that are currently poorly constrained in climate models. In Iceland, stratified, securely-dated, lake sediment records span the current interglacial (Holocene) and contain a rich archive of sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and lipid biomarker proxies for temperature (brGDGTs), hydrology (delta2-Hwax) and human agency (fecal sterols and PAHs). The analysis of modern soil and lake surface sediment networks will provide calibrations that enhance the community's understanding of these promising new molecular proxies and facilitate the development of regional training sets. Merging the local calibrations with similar measurements downcore in lake sediment and stratified aeolianites will enable reliable reconstructions of past ecosystems and their dependence on summer temperature and hydroclimate. The novel integration of these datasets will provide transformative new insights into 1) how much warmer was the early Holocene in Iceland relative to today, 2) when and to what elevation woody plants established themselves during early Holocene warmth, and 3) to what extent climate, volcanism and/or Norse settlement led to the widespread soil erosion apparent across the Icelandic landscape today. Anticipated results from this project provide key datasets needed to inform policy and improve forecasts of a rapidly warming Arctic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An NSF funded expedition led by researchers from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar further explored the submerged caves to document fine-scale environmental changes and their relationship to major extinction events on the island. This project provides an opportunity to recover and document a large number of specimens of extinct crocodiles and giant tortoises and to document how alteration of ecological processes may have led to recent patterns of extinction and decline among the megafaunal communities of Madagascar. The sampling and documentation of the fauna will be used in ongoing ancient DNA work to resolve the evolutionary relationships of extinct species and to identify drivers of extinction over a period of 5000 years. <br/><br/>The research will specifically address hypotheses regarding the taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships between modern and recently extinct Madagascan crocodiles and giant tortoises. Additionally, these collections and associated stratigraphic data will allow us to identify the relationship between fine scale temporal dynamics of genomic diversity, diet and faunal change in these taxa and the arrival of humans in southwestern Madagascar during the pre-extinction period. Comparison of this intact depositional series with previous collections of these and other Holocene taxa across Madagascar will help explain changes in species composition, abundance, and genetic diversity within communities following the arrival of humans and during known climate shifts on the island. Societal impacts of the proposed work will include co-generation of knowledge by US and Malagasy researchers. Additional engagement is ensured through abundant opportunities for outreach and education via planned museum activities and public lectures.

Unpredictable weather patterns have led to more severe and frequent natural disasters and, therefore, mitigating the impact of hazards on building structures is important for continuity in national welfare and prosperity following a disaster. Aside from building structures that can sustain various extreme events, modern and future architecture has shifted towards complex freeform structures, beyond simple geometries, to achieve aesthetically pleasing structures and to make efficient use of space.  A solution that simultaneously addresses all the above issues will require redefining some of the conventional paradigms in construction material design and deployment.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will investigate a new construction material approach for building skins and facades that are moldable to various complex geometries and, at the same, have the ability to manipulate waves imparted to the buildings and dissipate energy from high velocity winds.  The moldability will be achieved by relief cutting solid panels made of wood and metals with certain microstructural patterns, which is a low-cost process and hence suitable for the building industry.  While relief cutting promotes flexible surfaces, this approach generally reduces the load carrying ability of the panels, which may not be desirable.  This study will provide a means to potentially turn the disadvantage of the cutting method into an advantage, i.e., utilizing the cut patterns for tuning the dynamic properties to better resist hazard loadings.  Because of the architected nature, the cut surfaces are expected to display a wide range of wave and vibration control and energy dissipation mechanisms.  Equipping buildings with the ability to redirect, localize, trap, and dissipate energy, instead of merely resisting the impacted forces, can lead to a more efficient hazard mitigation strategy. This research can advance structural engineering by pushing complex freeform shapes to a standard practice that intertwines aesthetic arguments, building performance requirements, and material design considerations. To a greater impact, freeform complex shapes can provide buildings with additional functionalities beyond their default load bearing and shelter capabilities.  This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary professional and research training opportunities.  Project data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research aims to provide fundamental knowledge regarding the interplay between complex freeform geometries, microstructural morphologies, constituent properties (viscoelastic and inelastic deformations), and mechanisms of wave propagation and energy dissipation in architectural materials. A technique known as relief cutting (or kerfing) will be used to endow thin material sheets with prescribed curved shapes and surface patterns. The objective of such patterning is two-fold. First, it will allow molding flat plates into a nearly endless array of complex freeform shapes to fulfill a variety of functional and aesthetic architectural needs. Second, it will induce a microstructural geometry and property modulation that can help manipulate a wide range of wave and vibration events, through energy absorption and dissipation mechanisms. After a simulation-based design stage exploring the design space available via kerfing, freeform components will be fabricated, molded into shape, and tested. In the design and testing of laboratory specimens, excitations that mimic the dynamic loads of high velocity winds will be accounted for to realize stress and deformation fields similar to those observed in realistic freeform structures used in actual architectural structures.  This research is high risk and high reward as it will be a significant departure from traditional construction methodologies: 1) it will lead to a paradigm shift in building design, in which freeform complex shapes will be demonstrated to offer better resistance to dynamic loadings; 2) it will introduce a new and bold modular fabrication philosophy for freeform shapes that will generate minimal material waste, eliminate the need for mold casting, and simplify the logistics of material transportation; and 3) it harmoniously will blend dynamic performance and architectural constraints - two requirements that are often perceived to be mutually exclusive - by taking advantage of the intrinsic mechanical and aesthetic attributes of complex shapes and microstructural patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a technique from cryptography that allows several participants, each with sensitive information, to analyze their data collectively without ever sharing it. Several companies, governments, and non-profit organizations have adopted MPC to provide people with socially beneficial information (e.g., computing the city-wide wage gap while hiding individual salaries) that may otherwise be impossible or near-impossible to learn due to the sensitivity of the raw data. MPC is well-suited toward analyses of protected education, healthcare, or judicial data; however, deployments of MPC in these areas are scarce, in part due to the difficulty of assessing whether MPC technology suffices to meet legal regulations on the disclosure of data that includes personally identifiable information. The core question for this project is to develop MPC technology that simultaneously provides cryptographic and legal protection of sensitive input data.<br/><br/>This project has three phases, with a bidirectional flow of knowledge among cybersecurity and legal researchers in each phase. First, the investigators are identifying use cases in which information to be analyzed using MPC algorithms is subject to multiple state, federal, and international regulations that impose privacy restrictions and limit data sharing, and they examine the relevant legal constraints on information use. Second, the investigators are designing MPC protocols that, in addition to the usual cryptographic security notion that each party's view can be simulated, also guarantee the impossibility of reconstructing any legally-protected information under legally-compliant assumptions of trust and collusion. Third, the investigators are examining critically whether the newly-developed protocols provide sufficient protection to allow parties to use regulated data without triggering additional legal constraints on data use, by analyzing the legal requirements and potential policy objections. This three-phase process will pave the way for greater adoption of MPC by demonstrating to the legal community that MPC can improve data analysis without triggering additional burdensome legal obligations or policy concerns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Important characteristics of the Critical Zone are buried within it: how does the ground beneath our feet vary, how has it developed over time, and, how can we predict changes that may occur across time and space. Addressing these questions will affect how we manage the projected increase in demand for food, energy, and water that will accompany the growth in human population to 9 billion people by 2050. This project is a Research Coordination Network (RCN) that will bring together scientific expertise and students to explore these topics.<br/><br/>This research coordination network (RCN) is intended to synthesize data and models to investigate a key research question: How has the structure of the Critical Zone evolved in the past and how will it respond to future perturbations resulting from increasingly intensive human activities? Quantifying the depth of Critical-Zone processes is important because it connects multiple areas of investigation: water storage, weathering, biogeochemical fluxes, and societal needs.  Coupling models to data is difficult, since different research domains define the Critical Zone by changes in conditions that are hard to reconcile. Quantifying the gradient in properties that may define the lower boundary of the Critical Zone requires an injection of new ideas, methods, and people from across disciplines. This RCN is built around the following four topics: 1) synthesis efforts that help guide the coming decade of research on Critical-Zone architecture; 2) exploration of a diverse set of complimentary approaches for identifying the lower boundary of the Critical Zone and its influence on processes; 3) training of scientists in multidisciplinary data collection and modeling approaches; and 4) pathways to develop the next generation of Critical-Zone models. This RCN will involve at least 100 scientists, including early-career faculty, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students.  Participants will be recruited from underrepresented ethnic, socio-economic, ability, and sexual identity groups.

The workshop also aims to foster interaction with and input from the leading scientists of the Human Cell Atlas project by inviting some of them to share their perspectives and participate in workshop activities. The workshop will feature presentations of initial data, along with broader ideas, in the form of invited talks and short talks from abstracts. In addition, breakout sessions and panel discussions will be organized around topics including technical challenges, community wants and needs, and the conceptual goals of the plant cell atlas.

In our recent work, we have shown that the chemicals released into the oceans from seafloor hot-springs can be dispersed all across the oceans.  Now our interest has focused in on one element in particular, iron.  This is one of the most abundant elements in every planetary body in the Universe yet it is vanishingly rare in Earth's oceans today.  Set against that, it is essential to just about every form of life on Earth from the simplest and most ancient strains of microbes to the most complex animals including humans.  In Earth's oceans, the lack of this ""essential micro-nutrient"" has been found to limit how much life can flourish near both the south and north poles in the Pacific Ocean in the sunlit surface ocean even though the supply of sunlight and other major nutrients (phosphorous, nitrogen) should be more than adequate.  Our newest research suggests that iron released from hydrothermal plumes (where the concentrations coming from vents are more than 1 million times higher than normal ocean water) could play a major role.  Despite undergoing massive dilution as hydrothermal solutions leave the vents and traverse thousands of kilometers through the oceans, we believe that at least some of the iron released from deep sea hot springs can survive this journey and make a significant impact on how much live exists in Earth's polar oceans and how much CO2 it draws down from the atmosphere.  To investigate that idea, this project will study the fate of iron released from a hydrothermal vent over a length scale that hasn't been studied before - from the first 1km through the ocean out to 100km away from the vent-site.  This will fill a gap in our knowledge between what happens right at a vent-site (as studied by research submarines) and what happens to ocean chemistry all across Earth's entire ocean basins (as studied by a huge international research project called GEOTRACES).   Our work will use a 3D computational model to predict where the plume of material from a vent in the Northeast Pacific Ocean should escape to after it is erupted from some vents at a volcanic system called the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  We will then use an advanced autonomous free-swimming robot to search out in the predicted plume area, first to test the accuracy of our predicted model and, second, to collect samples from the hydrothermal plume from where it first forms to as far out as we can follow it.  The samples we collect will include both filtered seawater and the particulate material (whether mineralogical or microbiological) that we can extract from the filters.  Together, this will allow us to track the fate of the iron and other key physical and geochemical tracers down-plume away from the vents, to work out where it ends up (in the water and in the sediments) and also how fast those processes happen.  The work we do will also help plan how to conduct similar robotics-based exploration on future space missions beyond Earth where it has been hypothesized that seafloor events also exist (e.g. Saturn's moon Enceladus) and where, if we are really lucky, we may find that life is hosted based on the energy from seafloor volcanoes, just as happens here on Earth.  We have a resident artist embedded in our program who has already begun experimenting with the use of air-flow and sound in her sculptures to help communicate the complex nature of these plumes.  She will join our cruise, and work with our team post-cruise to design and hopefully build a sculpture that that could potentially result in a large and long-term outdoor installation. <br/><br/><br/>The international GEOTRACES program has revealed that iron (Fe) is released ubiquitously from submarine ridges to the deep ocean.  Results from US GEOTRACES section GP16 showed that both dissolved and particulate (colloidal) Fe may persist so far as to be able to influence primary productivity in High-Nutrient/Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the Southern Ocean.  As a complement to these sectional studies, we propose a detailed process study to elucidate the mechanisms by which hydrothermally sourced Fe can persist across the oceans at the scale that GEOTRACES has revealed.  Specifically, while the ""persistent"" Fe in a hydrothermal plume appears to behave quasi-conservatively from 100km to 4000km across the SE Pacific Ocean, it is also known that the majority of the Fe present at the Southern EPR on that US GEOTRACES GP16 cruise did not persist over the 100km separation between that station and the next deep ocean station beyond the ridge crest.  To fill that gap, this project will conduct a coupled modelling and field study to investigate the fate of hydrothermally sourced Fe at ranges of 0-1, 1-10 and 10-100km down-plume away from a well established vent-source.  To begin, we will use the detailed micro-bathymetry and the long-term current meter data available from the Main Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to implement a recently developed 3D theoretical plume dispersion model that can predict both the detailed 3D dispersion trajectory and the rate of flow within the hydrothermal plume away from two long-studied and well characterized Main Endeavour Field (MEF) vents.  At sea, we will use that predictive model to guide Sentry autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys that will follow the plume ""down-wind"" and ""across-plume"" to compile a 3D survey using in-situ sensors [optical, redox, conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD)] that will allow us to (1) confirm (and better constrain) the predictive model, and to (2) map out the shape and trajectory of the plume to provide context for discrete water column samples that we will collect - both from the AUV and from a trace metal clean CTD-rosette.  Sampling from the AUV will use the latest generation of SUPR samplers designed for the CLIO trace-metal-clean water sampler.  This will suffice for samples of dissolved, colloidal and particulate trace metals and collection of filtered material for grain-by-grain mineralogical and biogeochemical analyses.  That sampling program will be backed up by larger volume sampling down-plume using a CTD-rosette to augment our AUV-based program with helium isotope analyses (to track extents of physical plume dilution at increasing distances downwind and across plume) and for complementary ligand and organic compound analyses to investigate the role that organic complexation might play in protecting reduced species of Fe [and manganese (Mn), too] against oxidative precipitation and removal from the oceanic water column.  Post cruise, our combination of biogeochemical measurements and improved 3D physical modelling will not only be able to provide new insights into the processes that control the fluxes of Fe and Mn to the oceans from hydrothermal venting but also the length scales over which those processes take effect.  Finally, because our 3D theoretical model includes velocities, we also anticipate being able to deduce the rates at which these processes occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Homological algebra is the branch of algebra related to the field of algebraic topology (the study of topological spaces, i.e.""shapes""). A central object of study in homological algebra is that of a complex of modules, which can be thought of an abstraction of the notion of a topological space (""shape""). One specific goal of this project is to settle some long-standing conjectures concerning such complexes and the analogous topological spaces.  The award will also support graduate students working on affiliated topics. <br/><br/>In more detail, this research project aims to settle various conjectures concerning bounded complexes of finite rank free modules over commutative rings, in particular concerning the possible ranks of the modules appearing in such complexes that have finite length homology.  These topics relate to conjectures of Halperin and Carlsson concerning free actions of tori and elementary abelian p-groups on topological spaces. The success of the proposed research on these topics will thus advance our understanding of homological algebra over commutative rings, of algebraic topology, and of the interaction of the two. This research also will pursue several conjectures about smooth and proper dg-categories, focusing on the example of the dg-category of matrix factorizations associated to a hyper-surface with an isolated singularity. Smooth and property dg-categories can be thought of as non-commutative analogues of smooth and proper algebraic varieties.

This proposal seeks to develop such sensors for the sensitive and selective detection of greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide at ambient temperatures. Due to their relatively inert nature, greenhouse gases are extremely hard to detect at room temperature and hence at low power.  More specifically, a transistor-based device will be developed employing a new class of porous material systems called metal-organic-frameworks. These novel chemicals will be engineered to bind selectively to the target gases. The broader impact of this work lies in its impact on other scientific fields, on society and in its educational and outreach activities. More broadly, insights will impact many disciplines and technologies using MOFs, such as gas separation and CO2 sequestration; proposed device designs have the potential to disrupt many sensing applications, such as workplace safety and air quality monitoring. Additional significant impact is on human resource development. The project will provide core training for graduate and undergraduate students who will benefit from interdisciplinary training at the crossroads of electrical engineering, surface chemistry, and materials science.<br/><br/>This proposal is centered on a new device architecture based on chemically gated field effect transistors, which can operate at room temperature, are compatible with integrated-circuit  fabrication techniques, and can be rendered extremely selective by suitable functionalization of the chemically sensitive gate. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been identified as the functional element for their demonstrated extreme selectivity to gaseous species. In particular, this proposal aims to demonstrate ultra-low power, chip-scale gas sensing of greenhouse gases. The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies both in the novel design architectures and in the selection of new materials for the dielectric and the chemically sensitive layers. From a fundamental point of view, the proposed research will allow understanding and predicting the factors affecting the growth of ultrathin MOFs, to achieve their integration in an electrical microdevices, and to optimize materials and designs for enhanced chemical sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project introduces new, deployable alternatives to key parts of the PKI to make it more evolvable, manageable, and secure.<br/><br/>The project has three primary thrusts.  The first introduces a key enabling technology behind the subsequent thrusts, called assertion-carrying certificates (ACCs).  ACCs expand today's certificates with the capability of including a small amount of code (in the form of assertions) to be evaluated as part of the certificate validation process.  The second thrust applies ACCs to enable certificate authorities to more readily evolve to new demands for certificate delegation and automated issuance.  The third thrust applies ACCs and trusted execution environments to enable web-hosting services like content delivery networks to securely manage their customers' cryptographic keys.<br/><br/>Correct operation of the PKI is paramount to ensuring a secure, authenticated Internet.  Recent efforts have proven that progress towards a more secure PKI is possible, but a more fundamental focus is needed to address the underlying challenges.

This project leverages collaboration with a local community of OST providers, parents, and educators to create a system of STEM learning opportunities, social supports and technical infrastructure.<br/><br/>The project will investigate several key research questions: <br/><br/>(1)	How can middle school girls better connect with STEM learning opportunities and how can organizations more effectively coordinate their offerings and connect them to girls?<br/>(2)	What factors contribute to the creation of a local STEM ecosystem that engages and sustains girls' STEM interest and participation?<br/>(3)	How can parents (or other caregivers) be engaged in supporting girls' participation in STEM and what impact does their involvement have?<br/>(4)	What impact does participation have on family STEM identity and on girls' long term participation and interest in STEM activities and programs?<br/><br/>The project will use a variety of research methods and date collection including: school district data such as student course registrations; youth surveys assessing participation levels, interest, and impacts; online participation data that will reveal levels and patterns of involvement; interviews with students, parents, and providers; and case study data of a sample of participating families.  The project will share research findings widely with the educational research community through academic venues such as professional conferences and journals and with practitioners through professional development workshops and by sharing resource materials and curriculum on the www.digitalyouthnetwork.org/divas website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners around the world with diverse background and expertise to share the most recent ideas, outcomes, and practices on resources management for sustainable urban systems. Given that more than half of the world population now lives in cities, urban centers have become the primary sink of resources and energy, and major source of emissions and waste. icRS Cities 2019 will bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss how to achieve urban sustainability through wise resources management policy and practices. Attending the conference will allow the U.S.-based early-career researchers to showcase their research and develop networks with their peers around the world.<br/><br/>A wide range of topics will be covered at the conference related to sustainable urban systems. Solutions to the complex urban sustainability challenges can only be developed via inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches. With participation of natural scientists, engineers, social scientists, industry practitioners, and policy makers, we expect that icRS Cities 2019 will provide an excellent venue for the broad sustainable resources management community to share their findings and opinions on urban sustainability.

Indeed, von Neumann is often credited with formulating the foundations of operator theory as a language for quantum mechanics, while Nobert Wiener initiated an approach to engineering prediction problems (such as jet tracking) based on ideas from operator theory and harmonic analysis.  In more recent decades, operator theory has been used in H-infinity control theory which has applications in automatic pilot design.  On the other hand, a stable polynomial is not a field per se but a basic concept in mathematics that has become profoundly useful in the study of a diverse range of problems in mathematics: combinatorics (enumeration problems), graph theory (the study of networks), and operator theory.  The purpose of this project is to use operator theory to study stable polynomials and vice versa.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on three problems: (1) the generalized Lax conjecture, (2) a quantitative understanding of linear preservers of stability, and (3) extensions of the theory of stable polynomials to entire functions.  Semi-definite programming is a powerful technique in optimization and the generalized Lax conjecture is a bold assertion about the sets on which this theory can successfully be implemented.  The conjecture claims that these feasibility sets have a geometric description in terms of hyperbolic polynomials (a slight generalization of the concept of a stable polynomial).  Although evidently important in optimization, this would further establish links between stable polynomials and operator theory as the question is closely related to the concept of representing stable polynomials via operator theoretic determinantal representations.  Problem (2) is about taking the highly successful theorems of Borcea-Branden that characterized the linear maps on stable polynomials that preserve stability and making them quantitative.  How exactly do stability preservers modify zero sets?  One approach to this problem is through analyzing how stability preservers affect various sums-of-squares formulas for stable polynomials.  Problem (3) is about a natural extension of stable polynomials to various classes of entire functions (the Polya class, Hermite-Biehler class) and would require developing multivariable theories of Hilbert spaces of entire functions.  This latter endeavor is important in its own right as the successes in one variable Hilbert spaces of entire functions have been profound (i.e. the Poltoratski approach to problems of uncertainty type).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Along with twenty-two plenary lectures there will be a session of lightning talks where early career mathematicians will have the chance to present their work. This award will support the attendance of approximately 30 US-based mathematicians at the conference. <br/><br/>Geometric group theory is a relatively recently recognized subfield of mathematics emerging from Gromov's work in the 1980s, which put the classical treatment of groups as geometric objects in a far broader context. The field is now quite large, and has interactions with many different fields of mathematics including low-dimensional topology, the topology of manifolds, complex dynamics, combinatorial group theory, logic and the study of various classical families of groups. The central idea of geometric group theory is to study a group through an action (typically an isometric one) on some space (typically a metric space) and then use properties of the space to deduce properties of the group. Perhaps the most successful instance of this is when the space has some form of negative curvature. While classically curvature is a concept of Riemannian geometry, another central insight of Gromov is that many properties of spaces of negative curvature in Riemannian geometry have ""coarse"" analogues and that this is the natural setting to study the geometry of groups. The study of groups that act on spaces with coarse versions of non-positive and negative curvature will be the focus of this week long conference.

Systems of food production and distribution are closely tied to the economic organization and social structure of a society, and can serve to reinforce social inequalities, particularly in cities in which many households do not directly produce their own food. Archaeology is ideally situated to investigate the many ways in which food systems contributed to urban developments in the world's earliest cities, providing a unique perspective that can inform on the potential impacts of today's growing urban populations. This project will provide a comparative data on one aspect of the food system from an important pre-modern city, foster international and interdisciplinary collaboration, and engage in public outreach within the research area.<br/><br/>This research examines the role of animals in the urban economy of a pre-modern city that is a vital case study in understanding the relationships between food production, urban economies and the development of social inequalities. Teotihuacan (100-550/650 CE), located in central highland Mexico, was a large, diverse city and is unique in the ancient world as a city that was provisioned in the absence of large domesticates, and one that was able to do so in a way that supported its everyday urban residents. The research will evaluate how urban and rural residents of Teotihuacan acquired animals, and the role of hunting and raising animals to the urban economy. To evaluate multiple trajectories of change over time, this study presents an innovative integration of zooarchaeological analysis, to identify the types of animals consumed by residents, and carbon stable isotope analysis to distinguish animals from natural environments, and those which lived in anthropogenic environments, such as agricultural fields or animal pens. In addition, this research employs zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS), a new technique for the identification of faunal remains based on collagen peptide fingerprints, to overcome limitations in the morphological identification of animal bones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At a microscopic level, chemical reactions determine how long light emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, and batteries will last. Recently it has become possible - and even routine - to make predictions about useful lifetimes using computer simulations.  These simulations complement experiments by providing insight into properties that might difficult to measure directly.  This project considers the use of embedding computer methods that may make it possible to simulate much larger systems with much higher accuracy than ever before. The fundamental idea of embedding involves breaking a large system up into many small, overlapping fragments that can then be stitched back together to describe the whole. The Van Voorhis group uses these embedding tools to study the photochemistry of molecules relevant to emerging organic light emitting device (OLED) and solar cell technologies.  Professor Van Voorhis is the departmental coordinator of MIT ACCESS - a joint program between Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science that invites a select group of underrepresented minority undergraduate students to visit MIT for a weekend during the academic year. The primary aim is to encourage the students to consider graduate school in chemistry. Professor Van Voorhis also empowers and equips graduate students within his group to introduce K-12 students to the beauty and power of science. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this award are encouraged to participate in the MIT chemistry ""Magic Show"" that performs at local schools; the Research Communication Laboratory that trains graduate students to communicate scientific concepts to K-12 students; MIT Women in Chemistry's ""Scientist for a Day"" middle school camp; and the MIT museum's ""Science on Saturdays"" program that targets children and families. <br/><br/>The Van Voorhis group is developing transformative electronic structure methods in which fragments are the fundamental building blocks. The goal is to create new tools that are both faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art approximations, facilitating chemical simulations that were previously inaccessible. As a starting point, they  develop a family of fragment embedding theories based on the Bootstrap Embedding method.  The key realization is that wave function embedding allows one to combine overlapping orbital fragments in a robust way. The resulting theory circumvents the scaling challenges inherent in most wave function theories by only requiring calculations on very small fragments, which are ultimately combined to obtain a picture of the entire system. Improvements are accomplished by dressing these embedding methods with dynamic correlation using the many pair expansion (MPE). Finally, these techniques are extended to excited states using a novel strategy that identifies such states as local minima of the energy variance.  As a signature application of these tools, the Van Voorhis Group studies the energetics and dynamics of triplet excitons in molecules relevant to emerging OLED and solar cell technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unpredictable weather patterns have led to more severe and frequent natural disasters and, therefore, mitigating the impact of hazards on building structures is important for continuity in national welfare and prosperity following a disaster. Aside from building structures that can sustain various extreme events, modern and future architecture has shifted towards complex freeform structures, beyond simple geometries, to achieve aesthetically pleasing structures and to make efficient use of space.  A solution that simultaneously addresses all the above issues will require redefining some of the conventional paradigms in construction material design and deployment.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will investigate a new construction material approach for building skins and facades that are moldable to various complex geometries and, at the same, have the ability to manipulate waves imparted to the buildings and dissipate energy from high velocity winds.  The moldability will be achieved by relief cutting solid panels made of wood and metals with certain microstructural patterns, which is a low-cost process and hence suitable for the building industry.  While relief cutting promotes flexible surfaces, this approach generally reduces the load carrying ability of the panels, which may not be desirable.  This study will provide a means to potentially turn the disadvantage of the cutting method into an advantage, i.e., utilizing the cut patterns for tuning the dynamic properties to better resist hazard loadings.  Because of the architected nature, the cut surfaces are expected to display a wide range of wave and vibration control and energy dissipation mechanisms.  Equipping buildings with the ability to redirect, localize, trap, and dissipate energy, instead of merely resisting the impacted forces, can lead to a more efficient hazard mitigation strategy. This research can advance structural engineering by pushing complex freeform shapes to a standard practice that intertwines aesthetic arguments, building performance requirements, and material design considerations. To a greater impact, freeform complex shapes can provide buildings with additional functionalities beyond their default load bearing and shelter capabilities.  This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary professional and research training opportunities.  Project data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research aims to provide fundamental knowledge regarding the interplay between complex freeform geometries, microstructural morphologies, constituent properties (viscoelastic and inelastic deformations), and mechanisms of wave propagation and energy dissipation in architectural materials. A technique known as relief cutting (or kerfing) will be used to endow thin material sheets with prescribed curved shapes and surface patterns. The objective of such patterning is two-fold. First, it will allow molding flat plates into a nearly endless array of complex freeform shapes to fulfill a variety of functional and aesthetic architectural needs. Second, it will induce a microstructural geometry and property modulation that can help manipulate a wide range of wave and vibration events, through energy absorption and dissipation mechanisms. After a simulation-based design stage exploring the design space available via kerfing, freeform components will be fabricated, molded into shape, and tested. In the design and testing of laboratory specimens, excitations that mimic the dynamic loads of high velocity winds will be accounted for to realize stress and deformation fields similar to those observed in realistic freeform structures used in actual architectural structures.  This research is high risk and high reward as it will be a significant departure from traditional construction methodologies: 1) it will lead to a paradigm shift in building design, in which freeform complex shapes will be demonstrated to offer better resistance to dynamic loadings; 2) it will introduce a new and bold modular fabrication philosophy for freeform shapes that will generate minimal material waste, eliminate the need for mold casting, and simplify the logistics of material transportation; and 3) it harmoniously will blend dynamic performance and architectural constraints - two requirements that are often perceived to be mutually exclusive - by taking advantage of the intrinsic mechanical and aesthetic attributes of complex shapes and microstructural patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biologists recognize several major transitions in evolution that resulted from smaller, simpler units (e.g., single cells) getting together to form larger, more complex forms (e.g., organisms). It is not known whether major transitions occur gradually or very quickly. The researchers will test this fundamental question, using the latest genetic tools applied to the major transition from solitary social living in bees and wasps. By comparing entire genomes (all of the DNA) of species that show solitary, weakly social, and highly social forms, the research asks whether major transitions are the result of small, gradual changes  or rapid changes in the genome. The outcomes are therefore of a fundamental nature, generating basic information on the building blocks of the natural world. The project will also include involvement of underrepresented minority trainees, as well as a substantial educational components, with the aim of inspiring and engaging the public in an understanding of evolution. This will be accomplished through educational websites, videos, outreach presentations and lectures, as well as participation in educational programs organized by the researchers.<br/><br/>To determine whether the major transition from solitary life to societies in insects evolved via gradual or punctuated processes, a collaborative team of US and UK researchers will generate comparable full genome datasets (high quality genomes including chromosomal maps) on multiple species of bees and wasps. They will then apply rigorous bioinformatic analyses on the consolidated datasets to test specific predictions made by the two contrasting hypotheses (gradual versus punctuated). Beyond the evolution of societies, a broader question is whether the same patterns and processes underpin other major evolutionary transitions. To test the predictions in other major transitions (e.g., the transition from single to multi-cellularity, or asexuality to sexuality) the researchers will draw together a community of theoreticians and empiricists with a united expertise in the theory of major transitions and the empirical nature of major transitions in order to evaluate the extent to which there may be common patterns or processes across major transitions. Synthesizing this information, they will develop a cross-disciplinary roadmap for determining the extent to which all major transitions evolved via common evolutionary routes, allowing them to evaluate the generality of evolutionary processes in the complexity of life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In our recent work, we have shown that the chemicals released into the oceans from seafloor hot-springs can be dispersed all across the oceans.  Now our interest has focused in on one element in particular, iron.  This is one of the most abundant elements in every planetary body in the Universe yet it is vanishingly rare in Earth's oceans today.  Set against that, it is essential to just about every form of life on Earth from the simplest and most ancient strains of microbes to the most complex animals including humans.  In Earth's oceans, the lack of this ""essential micro-nutrient"" has been found to limit how much life can flourish near both the south and north poles in the Pacific Ocean in the sunlit surface ocean even though the supply of sunlight and other major nutrients (phosphorous, nitrogen) should be more than adequate.  Our newest research suggests that iron released from hydrothermal plumes (where the concentrations coming from vents are more than 1 million times higher than normal ocean water) could play a major role.  Despite undergoing massive dilution as hydrothermal solutions leave the vents and traverse thousands of kilometers through the oceans, we believe that at least some of the iron released from deep sea hot springs can survive this journey and make a significant impact on how much live exists in Earth's polar oceans and how much CO2 it draws down from the atmosphere.  To investigate that idea, this project will study the fate of iron released from a hydrothermal vent over a length scale that hasn't been studied before - from the first 1km through the ocean out to 100km away from the vent-site.  This will fill a gap in our knowledge between what happens right at a vent-site (as studied by research submarines) and what happens to ocean chemistry all across Earth's entire ocean basins (as studied by a huge international research project called GEOTRACES).   Our work will use a 3D computational model to predict where the plume of material from a vent in the Northeast Pacific Ocean should escape to after it is erupted from some vents at a volcanic system called the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  We will then use an advanced autonomous free-swimming robot to search out in the predicted plume area, first to test the accuracy of our predicted model and, second, to collect samples from the hydrothermal plume from where it first forms to as far out as we can follow it.  The samples we collect will include both filtered seawater and the particulate material (whether mineralogical or microbiological) that we can extract from the filters.  Together, this will allow us to track the fate of the iron and other key physical and geochemical tracers down-plume away from the vents, to work out where it ends up (in the water and in the sediments) and also how fast those processes happen.  The work we do will also help plan how to conduct similar robotics-based exploration on future space missions beyond Earth where it has been hypothesized that seafloor events also exist (e.g. Saturn's moon Enceladus) and where, if we are really lucky, we may find that life is hosted based on the energy from seafloor volcanoes, just as happens here on Earth.  We have a resident artist embedded in our program who has already begun experimenting with the use of air-flow and sound in her sculptures to help communicate the complex nature of these plumes.  She will join our cruise, and work with our team post-cruise to design and hopefully build a sculpture that that could potentially result in a large and long-term outdoor installation. <br/><br/><br/>The international GEOTRACES program has revealed that iron (Fe) is released ubiquitously from submarine ridges to the deep ocean.  Results from US GEOTRACES section GP16 showed that both dissolved and particulate (colloidal) Fe may persist so far as to be able to influence primary productivity in High-Nutrient/Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the Southern Ocean.  As a complement to these sectional studies, we propose a detailed process study to elucidate the mechanisms by which hydrothermally sourced Fe can persist across the oceans at the scale that GEOTRACES has revealed.  Specifically, while the ""persistent"" Fe in a hydrothermal plume appears to behave quasi-conservatively from 100km to 4000km across the SE Pacific Ocean, it is also known that the majority of the Fe present at the Southern EPR on that US GEOTRACES GP16 cruise did not persist over the 100km separation between that station and the next deep ocean station beyond the ridge crest.  To fill that gap, this project will conduct a coupled modelling and field study to investigate the fate of hydrothermally sourced Fe at ranges of 0-1, 1-10 and 10-100km down-plume away from a well established vent-source.  To begin, we will use the detailed micro-bathymetry and the long-term current meter data available from the Main Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to implement a recently developed 3D theoretical plume dispersion model that can predict both the detailed 3D dispersion trajectory and the rate of flow within the hydrothermal plume away from two long-studied and well characterized Main Endeavour Field (MEF) vents.  At sea, we will use that predictive model to guide Sentry autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys that will follow the plume ""down-wind"" and ""across-plume"" to compile a 3D survey using in-situ sensors [optical, redox, conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD)] that will allow us to (1) confirm (and better constrain) the predictive model, and to (2) map out the shape and trajectory of the plume to provide context for discrete water column samples that we will collect - both from the AUV and from a trace metal clean CTD-rosette.  Sampling from the AUV will use the latest generation of SUPR samplers designed for the CLIO trace-metal-clean water sampler.  This will suffice for samples of dissolved, colloidal and particulate trace metals and collection of filtered material for grain-by-grain mineralogical and biogeochemical analyses.  That sampling program will be backed up by larger volume sampling down-plume using a CTD-rosette to augment our AUV-based program with helium isotope analyses (to track extents of physical plume dilution at increasing distances downwind and across plume) and for complementary ligand and organic compound analyses to investigate the role that organic complexation might play in protecting reduced species of Fe [and manganese (Mn), too] against oxidative precipitation and removal from the oceanic water column.  Post cruise, our combination of biogeochemical measurements and improved 3D physical modelling will not only be able to provide new insights into the processes that control the fluxes of Fe and Mn to the oceans from hydrothermal venting but also the length scales over which those processes take effect.  Finally, because our 3D theoretical model includes velocities, we also anticipate being able to deduce the rates at which these processes occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Silicate minerals that break down slowly comprise much of the bedrock, but carbonate minerals in limestone tend to react quickly, commonly leaving large voids that facilitate the transfer of water through the Critical Zone. The current Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network lacks a site that contains significant amounts of carbonate bedrock.  This Research Coordination Network will foster discussion among researchers about Critical Zones with elevated carbonate mineral contents, evaluate how properties and processes of carbonate-rich Critical Zones can be generalized to other lithologies, and integrate these findings with results from the CZO network.<br/><br/>A principal goal of this project is to create a Research Coordination Network (RCN) in which researchers can evaluate Critical-Zone properties and processes that are endemic to Critical Zones in carbonate terrains.  A related and equally important goal is to integrate new findings with on-going research within the CZO network.  These goals will be achieved through four primary technical objectives: (1) compile available data and models stemming from current research ;(2) convene workshops, in the field and at major disciplinary conferences to explore new research directions; (3) build capacity in state- of-the-art techniques used to study carbonate Critical Zones;  (4) use data compilation, workshop participation, and training to advance knowledge of properties and processes in all Critical-Zone environments.  Outcomes of these objectives will include expanding knowledge of how relative amounts of carbonate and silicate minerals may cause different properties and processes in the Critical Zone between regions.  This Research Coordination Network will also develop human capital of Critical-Zone science by including underrepresented groups in all project activities and by research collaborations created during workshops.  Outcomes will be disseminated among the research community through workshop reports, a series of three peer-reviewed papers, and the project website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, the practical use of metallic glasses as structural materials is currently limited to only a few applications such as eyeglass frames, surgical tools, or golf clubs. In this award, experimental and theoretical approaches are combined to advance our knowledge of the atomic-scale processes governing the response of bulk metallic glasses to deformation. An improved understanding of microstructural damage mechanisms is a necessary pre-requisite to establish structure-property relationships that will allow custom-designed alloys to be produced with characteristics tailored to best match their intended applications. The students working on the project will have the unique opportunity to be trained in an area that combines interdisciplinary skills in micro- and nanomechanics, to perform investigations of materials at the scale of single atoms, to implement new experimental approaches, and to develop novel atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations. The research team will also engage with local schools to give lectures and demonstrations designed to encourage students to pursue careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>Metallic glasses accommodate plastic flow through the emergence of shear transformation zones, which are the smallest identifiable units in inhomogeneous plastic flow. If many such zones aggregate, shear bands can form that localize large shear strain inside a thin region of material. Such shear bands in metallic glasses are analogous to shear planes in crystals. Here, joint experimental and computational modeling studies are employed to investigate the initiation and growth of shear transformation zones, the shear bands they form, and the mechanical properties they control. Towards this end, nanoscale mechanical testing such as indentation and compression will be carried out on samples produced by innovative preparation methods to study how plastic flow is affected by strain rate, sample size, probing volume, and the structural properties of the material during deformation, the results of which will then be compared to computer simulations. This work seeks to develop an ability to quantitatively predict the initiation and propagation of shear bands, which is a critical step towards a mechanistic understanding of deformation and failure properties as well as identifying ductility and toughness enhancement methods for metallic glasses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These decisions become even more complicated when they involve groups with substantial power differences. The archaeological record, with its numerous example cases and substantial time depth, holds valuable insights regarding these issues. This doctoral dissertation project, directed by Kaitlyn Davis and Dr. Scott Ortman of the University of Colorado-Boulder, will assess the interplay between Spanish impositions and Native agency with regard to Pueblo economic and agricultural practices in 16th and 17th century New Mexico. The goal is to better understand the Pueblo agricultural economy prior to and following Spanish contact. The data collected for this project will address gaps in the understanding of the implications of and responses to colonialism in the Americas, reassessing and complicating the colonial narrative in light of Native agency. The data will also help fill in gaps in the understanding of how indigenous arid-land agricultural systems operated, and continue to operate, in the Americas. The multi-crop agricultural potential model produced by this project will be instructive as to where good agricultural areas are in the study area today, and thus has environmental sustainability value and will be of use to scholars as well as farmers. Finally, working with local landowners and Pueblo community members through every step of this project will provide educational opportunities and a positive example of collaborative archaeology.<br/><br/>Spanish colonization of the Northern Rio Grande region in New Mexico contributed to demographic changes, additional demands on the finite land base, and changes in the economic system, including changes in trade networks and taxation. The recent literature on this period has tended to interpret changes in the archaeological record as deriving from the impositions of or resistance to Spanish colonization. While both did occur, what has been overlooked is the extent to which Pueblo people also took advantage of the opportunities presented by introduced Spanish crops, technologies, and livestock, adapting them for Pueblo use and incorporating them into Pueblo life. In previous scholarship, considerations of local agricultural production have been largely divorced from the economic system they fit into. In this project, the researchers will assess the role of Spanish introductions in Pueblo economics and settlement by: 1) creating spatial models of agricultural potential for indigenous and introduced crops and combining these with artifact and settlement data; 2) determining associations between field types and crop types by collecting and analyzing microbotanical samples from various field types at two pre-Hispanic Pueblos and two colonial-era Pueblos; and 3) assessing changing investment in various field types, technologies, and associated crops through surface survey of field features and dateable artifacts at these four sites. These efforts will yield a better picture of agricultural potential versus agricultural investment through time to reveal Native choices in a changing economic and social system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From social networking to banking, from mobile devices to cloud computing, the PKI allows communicating parties to be sure of whom they are communicating with, that their communication is confidential, and that their communication has not been tampered with.  Despite its incredible importance, the PKI has been notoriously difficult to evolve to meet new security concerns and Internet demands.  This project introduces new, deployable alternatives to key parts of the PKI to make it more evolvable, manageable, and secure.<br/><br/>The project has three primary thrusts.  The first introduces a key enabling technology behind the subsequent thrusts, called assertion-carrying certificates (ACCs).  ACCs expand today's certificates with the capability of including a small amount of code (in the form of assertions) to be evaluated as part of the certificate validation process.  The second thrust applies ACCs to enable certificate authorities to more readily evolve to new demands for certificate delegation and automated issuance.  The third thrust applies ACCs and trusted execution environments to enable web-hosting services like content delivery networks to securely manage their customers' cryptographic keys.<br/><br/>Correct operation of the PKI is paramount to ensuring a secure, authenticated Internet.  Recent efforts have proven that progress towards a more secure PKI is possible, but a more fundamental focus is needed to address the underlying challenges.  This project will do just that by developing a new, extensible approach to constraining when identities on the Internet should be trusted.  This project will make it straightforward and safe to extend the basic abstractions offered by the PKI, thereby enabling it to evolve to meet changing trends.<br/><br/>The project's code and data will be made publicly available and maintained at https://securepki.org<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the Bhatia and Grubbs groups at Stony Brook University will explore how including very small rigid domains, or nanoscale crystallites, into soft polymer gels impacts their structure, flow properties, and elasticity. These crystalline domains represent a novel method for controlling the structural and mechanical properties of polymer gels.  Thus, the work will impact design of improved materials for applications that contribute to national health and prosperity, including soft tissue engineering and drug delivery. The project will also contribute to the development of new experimental techniques to characterize polymeric materials that contain both ordered and disordered domains such as biopolymer gels, conductive polymer films, and thermoplastic elastomers.  The PI and Co-PI will train graduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of techniques for modern polymer materials research, including synthesis, chemical characterization, scattering studies, and mechanical characterization; and they will aim to recruit under-represented student populations for this project, benefiting STEM workforce development and inclusion of diverse students in STEM fields. Finally, examples from the research will be incorporated into video lectures on macromolecules and nanomaterials that can be used to update the core chemistry curricula at the college level and into demonstrations for K-6 students.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This work is focused on control of hydrogel nanostructure and microstructure while maintaining desired rheological and transport properties. In this project, the Bhatia and Grubbs groups at Stony Brook University will explore the impact of stereochemistry and crystallinity on the rheology and nano- to micro-scale structure of associative block copolymer gels. Although crystallinity has long been used as a means of controlling polymer properties in the solid state, studies of solutions and gels with crystalline domains have been limited. A major challenge in understanding the physics of these systems is quantifying ordering in multiphase systems that contain both amorphous and ordered domains, where the ordered domains are too small to easily discern through conventional diffraction methods. The researchers will overcome this by utilizing X-ray pair distribution analysis (PDF) to quantify chain ordering in these materials. The project will focus on ABA triblock copolymers in a selective solvent, where the midblock is poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and the endblocks are poly(lactic acid) (PLA). The overall goal is to build fundamental, comprehensive structure-property relationships for block copolymers with crystallizable blocks in selective solvents. Specific objectives are to: (1) Synthesize a series of PLA-PEO-PLA triblock polymers with varying PLA and PEO block length and L/D ratio; (2) Characterize the structure, assembly, and crystallinity of these polymers using DLS, SAXS/SANS, PDF, USANS, and confocal microscopy; (3) Measure the rheological properties of the gels and compare these to existing models of polymer networks; and (4) Integrate examples from the research into undergraduate and graduate core courses in chemistry and demonstrations for K-6 audiences.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In our recent work, we have shown that the chemicals released into the oceans from seafloor hot-springs can be dispersed all across the oceans.  Now our interest has focused in on one element in particular, iron.  This is one of the most abundant elements in every planetary body in the Universe yet it is vanishingly rare in Earth's oceans today.  Set against that, it is essential to just about every form of life on Earth from the simplest and most ancient strains of microbes to the most complex animals including humans.  In Earth's oceans, the lack of this ""essential micro-nutrient"" has been found to limit how much life can flourish near both the south and north poles in the Pacific Ocean in the sunlit surface ocean even though the supply of sunlight and other major nutrients (phosphorous, nitrogen) should be more than adequate.  Our newest research suggests that iron released from hydrothermal plumes (where the concentrations coming from vents are more than 1 million times higher than normal ocean water) could play a major role.  Despite undergoing massive dilution as hydrothermal solutions leave the vents and traverse thousands of kilometers through the oceans, we believe that at least some of the iron released from deep sea hot springs can survive this journey and make a significant impact on how much live exists in Earth's polar oceans and how much CO2 it draws down from the atmosphere.  To investigate that idea, this project will study the fate of iron released from a hydrothermal vent over a length scale that hasn't been studied before - from the first 1km through the ocean out to 100km away from the vent-site.  This will fill a gap in our knowledge between what happens right at a vent-site (as studied by research submarines) and what happens to ocean chemistry all across Earth's entire ocean basins (as studied by a huge international research project called GEOTRACES).   Our work will use a 3D computational model to predict where the plume of material from a vent in the Northeast Pacific Ocean should escape to after it is erupted from some vents at a volcanic system called the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  We will then use an advanced autonomous free-swimming robot to search out in the predicted plume area, first to test the accuracy of our predicted model and, second, to collect samples from the hydrothermal plume from where it first forms to as far out as we can follow it.  The samples we collect will include both filtered seawater and the particulate material (whether mineralogical or microbiological) that we can extract from the filters.  Together, this will allow us to track the fate of the iron and other key physical and geochemical tracers down-plume away from the vents, to work out where it ends up (in the water and in the sediments) and also how fast those processes happen.  The work we do will also help plan how to conduct similar robotics-based exploration on future space missions beyond Earth where it has been hypothesized that seafloor events also exist (e.g. Saturn's moon Enceladus) and where, if we are really lucky, we may find that life is hosted based on the energy from seafloor volcanoes, just as happens here on Earth.  We have a resident artist embedded in our program who has already begun experimenting with the use of air-flow and sound in her sculptures to help communicate the complex nature of these plumes.  She will join our cruise, and work with our team post-cruise to design and hopefully build a sculpture that that could potentially result in a large and long-term outdoor installation. <br/><br/><br/>The international GEOTRACES program has revealed that iron (Fe) is released ubiquitously from submarine ridges to the deep ocean.  Results from US GEOTRACES section GP16 showed that both dissolved and particulate (colloidal) Fe may persist so far as to be able to influence primary productivity in High-Nutrient/Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the Southern Ocean.  As a complement to these sectional studies, we propose a detailed process study to elucidate the mechanisms by which hydrothermally sourced Fe can persist across the oceans at the scale that GEOTRACES has revealed.  Specifically, while the ""persistent"" Fe in a hydrothermal plume appears to behave quasi-conservatively from 100km to 4000km across the SE Pacific Ocean, it is also known that the majority of the Fe present at the Southern EPR on that US GEOTRACES GP16 cruise did not persist over the 100km separation between that station and the next deep ocean station beyond the ridge crest.  To fill that gap, this project will conduct a coupled modelling and field study to investigate the fate of hydrothermally sourced Fe at ranges of 0-1, 1-10 and 10-100km down-plume away from a well established vent-source.  To begin, we will use the detailed micro-bathymetry and the long-term current meter data available from the Main Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to implement a recently developed 3D theoretical plume dispersion model that can predict both the detailed 3D dispersion trajectory and the rate of flow within the hydrothermal plume away from two long-studied and well characterized Main Endeavour Field (MEF) vents.  At sea, we will use that predictive model to guide Sentry autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys that will follow the plume ""down-wind"" and ""across-plume"" to compile a 3D survey using in-situ sensors [optical, redox, conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD)] that will allow us to (1) confirm (and better constrain) the predictive model, and to (2) map out the shape and trajectory of the plume to provide context for discrete water column samples that we will collect - both from the AUV and from a trace metal clean CTD-rosette.  Sampling from the AUV will use the latest generation of SUPR samplers designed for the CLIO trace-metal-clean water sampler.  This will suffice for samples of dissolved, colloidal and particulate trace metals and collection of filtered material for grain-by-grain mineralogical and biogeochemical analyses.  That sampling program will be backed up by larger volume sampling down-plume using a CTD-rosette to augment our AUV-based program with helium isotope analyses (to track extents of physical plume dilution at increasing distances downwind and across plume) and for complementary ligand and organic compound analyses to investigate the role that organic complexation might play in protecting reduced species of Fe [and manganese (Mn), too] against oxidative precipitation and removal from the oceanic water column.  Post cruise, our combination of biogeochemical measurements and improved 3D physical modelling will not only be able to provide new insights into the processes that control the fluxes of Fe and Mn to the oceans from hydrothermal venting but also the length scales over which those processes take effect.  Finally, because our 3D theoretical model includes velocities, we also anticipate being able to deduce the rates at which these processes occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, small mutations that change DNA base pairs within a gene may have different effects than mutations that change the number of copies of a gene.  This research will shed light on the fundamental question: how do different types of genetic mutations contribute to the evolution of the enormous biodiversity found on earth?  Surprisingly, the answer to this question remains unclear.  In studies of a unicellular organism, this research will find the rate at which different types of mutations happen and look at the effects of these mutations on organisms' fitness.  The results of this research will help to clarify the process of mutation and its role in generating diversity.  This research will make possible the training in modern genomic methods of a mid-career scientist and several underrepresented minority and first-generation college students.<br/><br/>Previous studies of mutation accumulation in a microbial eukaryote, the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, revealed a surprisingly low base-substitution mutation rate. This rate was so low that it could not account for the observed changes in fitness over the course of an experiment, indicating that there must be other types of mutations responsible for the observed changes in fitness.  To determine the relative importance of different types of mutations in generating fitness variance, this research will measure the rates of base-substitution, structural, and mitochondrial mutations in T. thermophila, using these previously generated mutation accumulation lines.  New genomic analyses of these lines will determine which types of mutations are most frequent and, by comparison to phenotypic data, will determine which types have the potential to generate the most variance in fitness-related traits.  The results of these analyses will provide valuable insight into the types of mutations most responsible for evolutionary novelty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the US, eastern forests have been less affected by droughts and fires than western forests. However, several eastern tree species -- notably eastern hemlock and American beech -- have experienced big population collapses over the last several thousand years.  Hence, eastern forests may be at greater risk of collapse than commonly thought.  This project will collect new data and apply powerful mathematical tools to test hypotheses about why hemlock and beech forests have suffered big declines. Researchers will focus on the roles of severe droughts, bigger and more frequent fires, and greater competition among tree species.  Ultimately, this project seeks to 1) better understand the fundamental processes that trigger abrupt collapse of tree populations and 2) thereby inform and reduce current risks to forest health.<br/><br/>The project will analyze long-term records (>6,000 years, at decadal resolution) of forest composition, fire regime, and drought, based on lake sediment cores to be collected at four sites -- two at places where beech and hemlock are abundant today and two where only beech is abundant.  At each site, the timing of past tree population declines will be established by records of fossil pollen and radiocarbon dates, while past fire events will be identified through analysis of the abundance of charcoal fragments in sediments.  Because plant water stress affects the kinds of carbon isotopes in plant tissue, this project will identify past drought episodes through an innovative approach that requires precise measurements of the carbon isotopic content of individual pollen grains.  Because all records will be co-located from the same sediment cores, the relative sequence of events will be precisely known.  At two sites, reconstructions of changes in lake water balance, based on characteristics of the lake sediments, will provide an independent check on the drought and water-stress signals inferred from carbon isotopes.  A new community-level statistical model will integrate data and be used to test hypotheses about the relative importance of drought, fire events, and competition on past declines of tree populations.  All data collected will be archived in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, an open public repository of long ecological records, curated by experts.  All source code for statistical software developed here will be made publicly available, and a workshop will be held to train students and early career scientists in the new methods that will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In our recent work, we have shown that the chemicals released into the oceans from seafloor hot-springs can be dispersed all across the oceans.  Now our interest has focused in on one element in particular, iron.  This is one of the most abundant elements in every planetary body in the Universe yet it is vanishingly rare in Earth's oceans today.  Set against that, it is essential to just about every form of life on Earth from the simplest and most ancient strains of microbes to the most complex animals including humans.  In Earth's oceans, the lack of this ""essential micro-nutrient"" has been found to limit how much life can flourish near both the south and north poles in the Pacific Ocean in the sunlit surface ocean even though the supply of sunlight and other major nutrients (phosphorous, nitrogen) should be more than adequate.  Our newest research suggests that iron released from hydrothermal plumes (where the concentrations coming from vents are more than 1 million times higher than normal ocean water) could play a major role.  Despite undergoing massive dilution as hydrothermal solutions leave the vents and traverse thousands of kilometers through the oceans, we believe that at least some of the iron released from deep sea hot springs can survive this journey and make a significant impact on how much live exists in Earth's polar oceans and how much CO2 it draws down from the atmosphere.  To investigate that idea, this project will study the fate of iron released from a hydrothermal vent over a length scale that hasn't been studied before - from the first 1km through the ocean out to 100km away from the vent-site.  This will fill a gap in our knowledge between what happens right at a vent-site (as studied by research submarines) and what happens to ocean chemistry all across Earth's entire ocean basins (as studied by a huge international research project called GEOTRACES).   Our work will use a 3D computational model to predict where the plume of material from a vent in the Northeast Pacific Ocean should escape to after it is erupted from some vents at a volcanic system called the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  We will then use an advanced autonomous free-swimming robot to search out in the predicted plume area, first to test the accuracy of our predicted model and, second, to collect samples from the hydrothermal plume from where it first forms to as far out as we can follow it.  The samples we collect will include both filtered seawater and the particulate material (whether mineralogical or microbiological) that we can extract from the filters.  Together, this will allow us to track the fate of the iron and other key physical and geochemical tracers down-plume away from the vents, to work out where it ends up (in the water and in the sediments) and also how fast those processes happen.  The work we do will also help plan how to conduct similar robotics-based exploration on future space missions beyond Earth where it has been hypothesized that seafloor events also exist (e.g. Saturn's moon Enceladus) and where, if we are really lucky, we may find that life is hosted based on the energy from seafloor volcanoes, just as happens here on Earth.  We have a resident artist embedded in our program who has already begun experimenting with the use of air-flow and sound in her sculptures to help communicate the complex nature of these plumes.  She will join our cruise, and work with our team post-cruise to design and hopefully build a sculpture that that could potentially result in a large and long-term outdoor installation. <br/><br/><br/>The international GEOTRACES program has revealed that iron (Fe) is released ubiquitously from submarine ridges to the deep ocean.  Results from US GEOTRACES section GP16 showed that both dissolved and particulate (colloidal) Fe may persist so far as to be able to influence primary productivity in High-Nutrient/Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the Southern Ocean.  As a complement to these sectional studies, we propose a detailed process study to elucidate the mechanisms by which hydrothermally sourced Fe can persist across the oceans at the scale that GEOTRACES has revealed.  Specifically, while the ""persistent"" Fe in a hydrothermal plume appears to behave quasi-conservatively from 100km to 4000km across the SE Pacific Ocean, it is also known that the majority of the Fe present at the Southern EPR on that US GEOTRACES GP16 cruise did not persist over the 100km separation between that station and the next deep ocean station beyond the ridge crest.  To fill that gap, this project will conduct a coupled modelling and field study to investigate the fate of hydrothermally sourced Fe at ranges of 0-1, 1-10 and 10-100km down-plume away from a well established vent-source.  To begin, we will use the detailed micro-bathymetry and the long-term current meter data available from the Main Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to implement a recently developed 3D theoretical plume dispersion model that can predict both the detailed 3D dispersion trajectory and the rate of flow within the hydrothermal plume away from two long-studied and well characterized Main Endeavour Field (MEF) vents.  At sea, we will use that predictive model to guide Sentry autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys that will follow the plume ""down-wind"" and ""across-plume"" to compile a 3D survey using in-situ sensors [optical, redox, conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD)] that will allow us to (1) confirm (and better constrain) the predictive model, and to (2) map out the shape and trajectory of the plume to provide context for discrete water column samples that we will collect - both from the AUV and from a trace metal clean CTD-rosette.  Sampling from the AUV will use the latest generation of SUPR samplers designed for the CLIO trace-metal-clean water sampler.  This will suffice for samples of dissolved, colloidal and particulate trace metals and collection of filtered material for grain-by-grain mineralogical and biogeochemical analyses.  That sampling program will be backed up by larger volume sampling down-plume using a CTD-rosette to augment our AUV-based program with helium isotope analyses (to track extents of physical plume dilution at increasing distances downwind and across plume) and for complementary ligand and organic compound analyses to investigate the role that organic complexation might play in protecting reduced species of Fe [and manganese (Mn), too] against oxidative precipitation and removal from the oceanic water column.  Post cruise, our combination of biogeochemical measurements and improved 3D physical modelling will not only be able to provide new insights into the processes that control the fluxes of Fe and Mn to the oceans from hydrothermal venting but also the length scales over which those processes take effect.  Finally, because our 3D theoretical model includes velocities, we also anticipate being able to deduce the rates at which these processes occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among these beams, Laguerre-Gaussian modes are very unique for their intensity profiles making them of particular interest in particle manipulation, optical communications, detection, atom trapping and quantum applications. The current generation methods of these beams have many limitations.  This collaborative research aims at the design, development and application of a novel high power, tunable, orbital angular momentum laser source at hard-to-reach wavelengths. It combines a novel vertical external cavity surface emitting laser design and intra-cavity generation of high order orbital angular momentum beams. The proposed laser source will be very efficient, compact and low cost, opening doors to new applications. The lasers will then be used to conduct novel experiments in the generation and study of ultra-cold atoms, atom trapping and quantum turbulence. The broader impact of the research focuses on the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of lasers, photonics and quantum physics. The research will seek to broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities through internship and summer REU programs. <br/>Technical Description: Lasers generating orbital angular momentum beams including Laguerre-Gaussian beams are of great interest in various fields of science and engineering. These beams have numerous applications including particle manipulation, underwater and free-space optical communications, imaging and detection.  Watt-level, high-order Laguerre-Gaussian beams in the visible band are particularly desirable in quantum optics and atom trapping. Experiments using Watt-level high-order Laguerre-Gaussian beams are proposed as traps for ultra-cold and Bose-condensed atoms and for experiments in quantum turbulence. The current orbital angular momentum sources have limitations in power, tunability, compactness or wavelength of operation, thereby constraining their broad deployment. The goal of the research is to develop a novel high-power, tunable laser source with targeted Laguerre-Gaussian modes at hard-to-reach wavelengths. The approach is based on intracavity mode conversion of Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes in a two-color Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser and efficient nonlinear frequency conversion for the generation of higher-order Laguerre-Gaussian modes in the visible and mid-IR wavelengths.  The research merges concepts of semiconductor laser engineering, nonlinear mode conversion, atomic molecular and optical physics. The intellectual merits of this high-risk high-reward research includes significant technical advancement in areas of semiconductor quantum well design and growth, intracavity laser mode mixing and manipulation, nonlinear optical materials, laser cavity design and applications in atom trapping, cooling and quantum turbulence research and applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Converting waste heat into electricity could improve energy efficiency dramatically and sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thermoelectric (TE) devices convert temperature differences into electrical power and have the potential to revolutionize the nation's energy portfolio. An ideal thermoelectric material conducts electricity, but not heat. Metals conduct both, whereas insulators conduct neither. This project challenges this dichotomy by using a novel strategy to dope tungsten disulfide, a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor. We will enhance its thermoelectric coefficient to maximize the output voltage, increase the electrical conductivity to minimize losses, and lower the thermal conductivity to maintain a large temperature difference. The proposed research will lead to efficient devices for waste heat recovery. This work will also enable high-performance 2D transistors, low-power memory devices, and nanoscale switches for thermal management. The team will work closely with local communities to encourage participation by students from all backgrounds in engineering careers and foster interest in nanotechnology. Outreach efforts will include lab demonstrations, summer internships, and career workshops.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this project is to improve the in-plane thermoelectric efficiency of two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS2) devices through engineering their electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties via electrochemical intercalation. WS2 has recently emerged as a promising TE candidate due to its large atomic mass (low thermal conductivity), small bandgap (high electrical conductivity), and high Seebeck coefficient. However, it remains challenging to optimize all of the material properties to maximize its TE efficiency and to dope this 2D material to create the p- and n-type pairs needed for TE devices. In this work, we will: (1) achieve p- and n-type doping in 2D materials via anion and cation intercalations; (2) optimize the in-plane power factor of WS2 through doping; (3) reduce the in-plane thermal conductivity of WS2 via phonon scattering by intercalants. Fundamentally, this project will study electrical, ionic, and thermal transport in 2D materials. Practically, this work will pave the way for the wide use of thermoelectric devices to scavenge heat from sources such as electronics and the human body. This work will also develop a doping method for 2D materials, addressing critical issues in 2D electronics such as low drive current and poor contact resistance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the reliability and availability of the networks that underlie the Internet are critical, and it is important to have a detailed and holistic understanding of their behavior.  However, as networks have become larger and more complex, visibility into fine-grained, network-wide behavior that allows network operators to identify and repair problems is increasingly difficult to come by. This project addresses that challenge, with a primary goal of developing tools and techniques that enable unprecedented visibility into the behavior of large and complex computer networks.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is the development of a novel primitive that provides whole-network visibility: the Network Motion Picture, a rapid sequence of network-wide snapshots, where each snapshot is a consistent set of local observations of state that provide a view of the network at approximately a single instant in time. In contrast to existing research that focuses on either developing more advanced metrics for individual components/paths or improving inference of network-wide conclusions from those measurements, the proposed primitive makes two key contributions: (1) it treats emergent and network-wide behavior as a first-class citizen, and (2) it develops an abstraction for scalable collection of and adaptation to changes in network-wide behavior. The planned research has three main technical components: i) the development of a practical framework for collecting Network Motion Pictures; ii) novel systems for diagnosing, managing, and repairing networked systems; iii) novel protocols for improving the performance of large, complex networks. Use cases will include data center, edge, and Internet of Things (IoT) networks.

Thus, protecting a user's privacy and security is complicated.

There are many uses in metadata usage (how is the data collected, is it aggregated with other data, etc.); this categorization will focus on developing clean types of information revealed through metadata capture and use.  Such a categorization of metadata usage will have several important applications. Delineating different types of knowledge gained through the use of metadata (e.g., information about the device, information about the user), will simplify providing better technical protections for user privacy and security against such attacks.

Practical realization of such applications of block copolymer materials typically require that they form geometrically ordered structures, such as cylindrical or lamellar (sheet-like) microstructure and more complex geometries. While block copolymers can form these ordered structures intrinsically by self-assembly at molecular scales, obtaining ordered structures over macroscopic scales useful for applications requires providing the block copolymer with sufficient molecular mobility via processing methods. Thermal and solvent vapor processing methods are currently used, however, they can be slow and often not possible due to concerns of thermal degradation.  The research here develops and examines in-depth a rapid processing approach that involves immersing the block copolymer into multi-component solvent mixtures that offer a controllable balance of swelling, non-swelling and block-interactions-tunable solvents.  A successful research will pave the way for continuous roll-to-roll industrial processing for large-scale self-assembly of block copolymer structures for various applications. The research will promote participation of women and minorities through several educational and outreach activities, develop a polymer nanotechnology course with a laboratory module for Chemical Engineering and Materials Science graduate students, and engage high school students in laboratory research with internship programs.    <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Block copolymers consist of chemically bonded monomer sequences whose ability to self-assemble renders them applicable for various potential nanotechnology applications, ranging from nanophotonics to nanoelectronics to nano-porous membranes. To accomplish these ordered self-assembly-driven microstructures requires advanced processing methods for  controlled morphology and long-range order with minimal defects over macroscopic scales. While thermal and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) are established methods of block copolymer ordering, the work here will enable ordering of block copolymers annealed by a newly developed method involving its immersion in a mixture of solvents, while at the same time elucidating molecular-level understanding of the resulting morphology. Termed Direct Immersion Annealing, or DIA, the method has already demonstrated promise for rapid ordering of 2D cylinder-forming block copolymer films with unique control over domain spacing. The present work will examine DIA induced ordering of block copolymer films to study 1) chemical-potential controlled partitioning of solvent mixture within BCP blocks and activation energy of ordering, 2) role of intrinsic block copolymer morphology (1D, 2D, and 3D) on domain collapse in dry state, 3) ionic-liquid as a processing aid for enhanced ordering and targeted transport of functional nanoparticles selectively within BCP block domains, 4) fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic differences between DIA and SVA, and 5) effect of substrate surface energy on DIA-induced orientation and morphology of BCP films. Workforce aspects will involve the training of women and minorities through several educational and outreach activities, developing a bridging undergraduate-to-graduate polymer nanotechnology course, and provide scientific internships to high school students to learn about polymers, from a basic to an advanced level. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study the molecular basis for heme-based N2O formation; this knowledge is relevant for developing more efficient agricultural practices along with reducing atmospheric pollution. By studying the influence of molecular structure on heme-catalyzed N2O formation, this project will also inform the design of synthetic enzymes for biotechnology. Undergraduate research is a key feature of this project, providing students with skills, experiences and motivation for future scientific career pathways.<br/>	<br/><br/>The means by which cytochromes P460 react with hydroxylamine to produce N2O has received recent attention, with a focus on enzymes from nitrifying bacteria. By contrast, little is known about the equivalent enzymes in methanotrophs. This project will focus on structure-function relationships in two evolutionarily related c-type heme proteins from the methanotroph, Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath): 1) a hydroxylamine oxidizing cytochrome P460 (McP460); and 2) a nitric oxide (NO)-binding cytochrome c'-beta (McCP-beta). Crystal structures of these proteins reveal common tertiary structures, but very different distal heme pockets; McP460 contains a Lys-porphyrin cross-link and a highly polar distal pocket tailored to enzymatic function, whereas McCP-beta has evolved a hydrophobic distal heme environment for NO binding. Specific aims are to (i) characterize reaction intermediates in McP460-catalyzed hydroxylamine oxidation and N2O formation, along with the influence of the P460 Lys-porphyrin cross-link and distal pocket hydrogen-bonding residues; and (ii) define the role of the McCP-beta 'distal Phe cap', as well as heme chemistry pertinent to its functional evolution from N2O generation to its proposed NO-binding role.

Harmonic analysis is a subject about the Fourier transform, which decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies. In other words, by taking the Fourier transform we effectively write a function as a superposition of monochromatic waves (waves with only one frequency). Of particular interest are the following restriction type problems: How large can a function be, in the pointwise sense or in some averaged sense, if its frequency lives in a particular restricted set? People have found that if the restricted frequency set is ""curved"", for example being the unit sphere, very nontrivial estimates about the function can be obtained/expected. This is useful in understanding physics phenomena dictated by certain natural partial differential equations such as the Schrodinger equation or the wave equation. Moreover, restriction type problems also turn out to be the key to the understanding of certain behaviors of natural numbers. It turns out that, for example, once people understand well on properties on waves whose frequencies are perfect 10-th powers, they can consequently answer a variety of questions on representing a natural number as a sum of a few perfect 10-th powers.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI proposes to study restriction type problems: If we have a subset M (usually a curved submanifold or a fractal set) in the frequency space and some measure in the physical space, we want to bound some norm of a function with respect of the given measure whenever the frequency support of that function is in the given M. One proposed direction is Stein's Restriction Conjecture, where the measure is just the Lebesgue measure and the manifold is the unit paraboloid. The PI is also interested in the situations when the measure is a fractal measure, or when M is a moment manifold or a fractal set. For most questions of this type, the optimal estimates are far from being well understood. The goal of this research would be to obtain new estimates (i.e. estimates with improved exponents) in the above setting. In particular, it is anticipated that improvements on Stein's conjecture can be obtained when this project develops. For the proposed approach, the PI anticipates a subset of analytic (induction on scales, decoupling and refined Strichartz type reasoning), algebraic (the polynomial method, differential geometry and real algebraic geometry), combinatorial (Multilinear Kakeya, sum-product theory, etc.) and geometric measure theoretic (radial projection theory, etc.) tools can come into play. He also anticipates emerging new connections between harmonic analysis and nearby areas will arise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stand-alone and self-sustained e-skins are essential to providing reliable, effective and sometimes life-saving functions. A stable power supply is the most critical factor in developing practical e-skins because the performance of their potential applications depends significantly on power availability. Thus, a realistic and accessible power source is urgently needed for a next-generation of smart, stand-alone, always-on e-skin systems. This is a challenge because human skin intimately integrated with e-skins is an extremely harsh environment for power generation. Skin is cool, dry, acidic and lacks potential energy sources. The overall objective of this proposal is to create the ability to generate an innovative, practical, and longstanding power from human sweat, which is one of the few available energy resources on the skin, by using the metabolisms of sweat-eating bacteria including human skin microorganisms or ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Given that the total non-human microbial cells inhabiting in and on our bodies outnumber the human cells by at least a factor of 10, the direct use of the microbial cells to produce power is conceivable for e-skins. Findings will first be disseminated within the discipline through local and international conferences and journal publications; then they will be distributed through educational venues maximizing the project's reach and impact. The project will train graduate students and outcomes will be integrated into post-secondary courses and K-12 outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project will establish an innovative strategy to revolutionize power generation on human skin, delivering on-chip energy to the next generation of e-skin paradigm. The proposed sweat-powered batteries will be based on microbial fuel cells (MFCs), exploiting sweat-eating bacteria including human skin-inhabiting or ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms as a biocatalyst to transform the chemical energy of sweat into electrical power through bacterial metabolism. A thin, soft, flexible MFC will be pre-inoculated with selected electrogenic (or electron-producing) sweat-eating bacteria and will operate with human sweat, delivered by an integrated battery-free skin-interfaced system. The two-fold central hypothesis is that (i) some sweat-eating bacteria are capable of extracellular electron transfer and act as a biocatalyst in the microbial fuel cell device to produce electrical power, and (ii) those microorganisms can feed off the human sweat including ammonia and other organic substances for constant and sustaining bioelectricity generation. The immediate potential benefits of the proposed research are that (a) the project will develop a skin-mountable bacteria-powered battery system and establish fundamental knowledge critical to increase its performance, (b) the work will promote and accelerate the discovery and characterization of electrogenically active sweat-eating microorganisms, and (c) it will also create a novel skin-interfaced microfluidic system for sweat collection, delivery and storage to drive the integrated bacteria-powered battery. (d) Finally, this project will allow the microbial fuel cell technology to find more realizable applications as ""biopower-on-skin"" enables an entirely new area of energy harvesting research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A clear temporal linkage has been established between basaltic large igneous provinces and mass extinction events in the Late Devonian (~364 Ma), Middle Permian (259 Ma), Late Permian (248 Ma) and Late Triassic (~206 Ma).  These large volcanic events are suspected to cause global warming and marine anoxia due to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Conversely, the role of silicic large igneous provinces and resultant acid rain, ozone depletion, sulphate aerosols and ocean Fe fertilization in mass extinction events has not been assessed.  The Permo-Triassic Choiyoi Group of Argentina-Chile is a major high-latitude silicic large igneous province that has a strike length of > 2000 km and a volume equivalent to >125 Yellowstone calderas erupting essentially simultaneously.  Choiyoi magmatism overlaps with several major early Permian climatic events including Olsen?s extinction (~272 Ma) and the Kamura cooling event (~262 Ma).  <br/>This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) proposal offers an innovative immersion experience designed to engage three cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students over three years in a hypothesis-driven, field-intensive research project investigating the linkage between silicic large igneous provinces (SLIPS) and global climatic change. This project will advance science by providing an assessment of the potential role of silicic volcanism in climate change, foster international collaboration between U.S. and Argentinian research teams, promote education through the intentional mentoring of three cohorts of graduate and undergraduate students and increase diversity in the geosciences by inclusion of students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  Both the Department of Geosciences at SDSU and in the Department of Geology at UW-Eau Claire are committed to expanding diversity within the geosciences and are actively recruiting students from underrepresented groups into STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>An accurate reconstruction of Choiyoi magmatic activity and its relation to climatic change requires an integration of stratigraphic, structural, geochronologic, petrologic, isotopic, geochemical, and thermochronologic data from several focus areas within the magmatic province.  Three focus areas will be targeted within the southern, central and northern portions of the magmatic province that will be addressed sequentially over the three year duration of the project.  There are five major emphases within each focus area, including 1) stratigraphy/volcanic facies; 2) petrology, including mineral chemistry and fluid inclusion analysis; 3) U/Pb zircon geochronology and Hf analyses; 4) major, trace and REE geochemistry; 5) structural analysis, including thermochronology. The south-central Andes are an ideal natural laboratory to study this system due to 1) exposure and accessibility; 2) established geologic framework; 3) availability of highly-qualified mentors; 4) access to analytical facilities in U.S. and Argentina; and, 5) experience of co-PIs in both regional geology and student experiential activities.<br/> <br/>This investigation evaluates the potential relationship between the spatial and temporal evolution of a silicic large igneous complex and global climatic change and provides an ideal opportunity to engage students in hypothesis-driven scientific research. This project involve three cohorts of five (5) students conducting hypothesis-driven, field intensive research in the south-central Andes under the mentorship of a highly qualified team of U.S. and Argentinian mentors. Student researchers will conduct fieldwork within integrated teams consisting of 2-3 student researchers and 1-2 mentors, with the composition of the teams rotating on a regular basis Student collaborators (3 M.Sc., 9 B.Sc.) will be involved in all aspects of field and laboratory analyses, including stratigraphic studies, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, and isotopic analyses at UW-Eau Claire, SDSU, U.

Disease outbreaks can be devastating for host populations, but also provide an opportunity to address gaps in our knowledge about how diseases work. For example, we need to better understand how outbreaks subside. Researchers hypothesize that host defenses (i.e., host immunity) influence pathogen infection patterns and reduce the long-term impacts of a disease. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the specific host defenses that reduce disease severity in natural populations. This project will test the hypothesis that host defenses alter infection patterns in a disease known as chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is a deadly fungal disease that impacts frogs, toads, salamanders, and other amphibians. This disease has caused - and continues to cause - dramatic losses of amphibian biodiversity around the world. The investigators will determine how skin secretions, an amphibian defense with anti-fungal properties, affect the severity and duration of chytridiomycosis outbreaks. This research will contribute to society by informing strategies to protect amphibian biodiversity. It will also advance scientific knowledge of emerging infectious diseases like chytridiomycosis. Finally, the project will broaden participation through training and research engagement for young women in STEM.<br/><br/>This study will combine cutting-edge experiments with field studies on host defense mechanisms in three species of amphibians. The research team will determine the role of skin secretions in host defense using immunosuppression treatments and pathogen-exposure experiments. The team will also use field and common-garden experiments to quantify how skin secretion defenses vary across populations, elevations, and seasons. In addition, the project will implement a ""20 in 2020"" program that will launch 20 young women in their pursuit of higher education in scientific fields. The educational plan includes engagement in the scientific research project; preparation for university coursework; and a tiered mentoring network to support high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.

Such representations of signals are heavily used in today's technology for storage, transmission, and noise reduction of signals. Unfortunately, harmonic analytic methods perform poorly in various circumstances, as they are designed based on the assumption that the outcome of a series of actions is unchanged, regardless of the order in which the actions are performed. However, actions are often not interchangeable. For example, the result of performing consecutive rotations in three-dimensional (3D) space is highly sensitive to the order of rotations. Indeed, the real world is a very ""non-commutative"" universe. The space of 3D rotations is a simple example of a Lie group, which arise naturally in physics. This project will use techniques of functional analysis and Lie theory to advance the theory of non-commutative harmonic analysis for Lie groups. <br/><br/>Fourier transforms and its analogues are the cornerstone of classical harmonic analysis. To generalize the concept of a Fourier transform to non-Abelian groups, the modern field of non-commutative harmonic analysis was initiated.  The broad philosophy here is to employ group representations and the theory of operators on Hilbert spaces to capture the non-Abelian nature of a group. A major trend in non-commutative harmonic analysis is to investigate function algebras related to the Fourier analysis (and representation theory) of non-Abelian groups. The Fourier algebra, which is associated with the regular representation of the ambient group, is a fundamental example of such function algebras. This project investigates Banach algebraic behavior, in particular derivation theory and spectral theory, of the Fourier algebra and its weighted versions for various classes of locally compact (Lie) groups. The ultimate goal is to investigate the connections between the Lie structure of a group and the Banach algebraic properties of its Fourier algebra. This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Poplar hybrids comprise the vast majority of trees in operational plantations due to their superior growth when compared to pure species. However, compared with hybrid crop plants, the undomesticated nature of trees makes predicting performance of their hybrids more challenging. Understanding how variation in hybrid genomes and in the environment lead to desirable (and undesirable) traits has the potential to benefit poplar breeding programs significantly. In this project, natural hybrids between two wide-ranging poplar species - black cottonwood and balsam poplar - are used to characterize, predict, and test how hybridization translates into complex adaptive traits of economic and ecological significance. In addition, a citizen science collaboration with ArbNet, an international community of arboreta, will coordinate establishment of 20 common garden experiments (mini gardens) across North America. These experiments will all be planted with the same set of different poplar genotypes that have had their full genomes sequenced. The project will work with ArbNet to develop a middle school curriculum focused on how traits vary in poplar trees originating from diverse environments. This curriculum will include hands-on collection of data, synthesis of data across sites and illustrating the principles of adaptation and genetic variation. Students will be exposed to biological responses to different environments, experimental design, and hypothesis testing. At each participating university, the project team will also provide interdisciplinary training to the next generation of scientists, spanning field ecology, genomics, and computational biology.<br/><br/>Natural Populus hybrid zones provide a 'living laboratory' in which there has been a long history of natural selection testing the genomic and phenotypic outcomes of hybridization. This project will sample across replicated Populus hybrid zones to capture the history of Genome x Genome x Environment interactions along environmental gradients, and couple this sampling with genome-wide re-sequencing and computational approaches to address the following questions: (i) How is introgression arrayed across the genome and landscape? (ii) What genomic regions control hybrid fitness and what are their environmental drivers? (iii) Can adaptive introgression be recapitulated using controlled crosses? Extensive short and long-read genome resequencing will be combined to characterize genomic variation across the hybrid zones. The team will then use admixture mapping to associate genomic ancestry with climate gradients and adaptive phenotypes, predict hybrid performance across a range of field test sites, and evaluate the contributions of environment and space in explaining patterns of hybridization. Finally, the project will test the repeatability of hybrid outcomes using controlled crosses among Populus species, assessing the predictive value of loci identified as being involved in hybrid vigor/heterosis, and the role of allele-specific expression in generating hybrid phenotypes. This project will provide the most comprehensive picture to date of the genomics of hybridization and heterosis in a tree species and enhance our understanding of the relationship between introgression and fitness across environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technological advances in recent years are changing Alabama's manufacturing industry. The number of jobs for technicians in this advanced manufacturing industry is growing rapidly, and there is shortage of skilled workers to fill this need. To help meet this need, Gadsden State Community College will work with industry partners to develop an advanced industrial automation program to prepare a greater number of technicians skilled in the blend of mechanical, electrical, and computerized technologies - also known as ""mechatronics."" The new program will be designed to provide students with the important knowledge and skills to operate, troubleshoot, repair, and make design changes to the kinds of equipment and operations that they would work with on the job. The program will also allow existing workers to upgrade their skills. This project will include activities that help to increase the interest of more female students in advanced technician careers. The Alabama Community College System will also promote the new program as a teaching model for other colleges to help fill the demand for skilled workers in Alabama and the nation.<br/><br/>The goal of this project will be to develop an advanced mechatronics program that has an integrated lab component to prepare highly-skilled technicians in advanced manufacturing. The curriculum will offer two new short-term programs leading to advanced certificates in Mechatronics and Robotics. The program will incorporate the innovative Mechatronics Laboratory comprised of an integrated and automated production line. The laboratory equipment consists of a line-based manufacturing system which integrates advanced programmable logic controllers, robotics, and electronics with the intelligent machines used in production. This line system will have the flexibility to be used as an entire production line for troubleshooting or divided into individual stations. This new approach to lab instruction will provide students with opportunities to learn integrated skills required for the workplace. The project will hold outreach events to enhance the interest and recruitment of females, high school students, as well as displaced or underemployed workers into mechatronics and robotics areas of the advanced manufacturing field.

These invariants have connections to many fields, ranging from number theory to symplectic geometry and high energy physics. <br/><br/>The project has three related parts. The first is to use Bridgeland stability conditions to prove results about the geometry and period mappings of Fano varieties; this relies on a newly developed notion of stability conditions in families, and the existence of noncommutative K3 surfaces in the derived categories of certain Fano varieties. The second part is to construct more examples of noncommutative K3 surfaces, and to further develop the theory of homological projective geometry (which gives a powerful tool for studying noncommutative varieties in general).

The control and stability of flexible and soft manufacturing robotic systems, which have complex geometries and experience desirable and undesirable deformations, are of major concern, particularly when lightweight softer materials are used. However, the mathematical foundation of such flexible and soft robots has not been established and our knowledge of their mechanics remains remarkably incomplete. The seriousness of this challenge is evident by the lack of advanced virtual prototyping techniques that are integral part of the design, analysis, and performance evaluation of other physics and engineering systems. This project will conduct fundamental research to create the mathematical foundation and new computational algorithms for flexible and soft manufacturing robot systems in order to address virtual prototyping challenges. The new mathematical foundation will improve the analysis and performance evaluation methods, capture significant details that cannot be captured by existing simplified approaches, allow for virtually testing new and improved designs, make such systems more affordable and safer, and accelerate the design, development, and commercialization of such machines. The new knowledge, approaches, and numerical algorithms developed in this research will be used in the education of undergraduate and graduate students at University of Illinois at Chicago. The broader impact will be realized through dissemination, training, and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The scientific challenges include the integration of the robot geometry and analysis; implementation of general and unconventional material models and actuation forces; use of new concepts for mechanical joint modelling; and developing efficient and robust algorithms for virtual prototyping. This research seeks to address these challenges by developing a new transformative continuum-based finite element and multibody system approach based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. This formulation allows modeling arbitrarily large and coupled displacements, correctly captures complex geometries, and allows implementing general and nonconventional material models. In this research project, accurate definitions of conventional and non-conventional actuation forces will be developed taking into consideration the complexity of the geometry of the robot components, which can be systematically captured using the finite elements of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, over the next eight years, Novo Nordisk plans to invest in a $1.8 billion production facility and to hire 800 employees, approximately 500 of whom will be maintenance and process technicians. In addition, Grifols plans to invest $375 million in production facility upgrades and plans to hire approximately 500 technicians. This project will help meet these workforce needs by blending concepts and skills of applied engineering and biotechnology into two existing Associate of Applied Science programs.  To this end, four new courses will be developed in close partnership with two biomanufacturing companies.  These courses will integrate applied engineering topics into the Bioprocess Technology AAS program and biotechnology topics into the Applied Engineering AAS program.  In addition, both AAS programs will be enhanced by the addition of certification in the industry-standard DeltaV distributed control system software.  At project conclusion, it is expected that the first cohort of approximately 15 students will have completed the biotechnology/applied engineering programs, completed internships, and be ready for work as biomanufacturing technicians.  Approximately 75% of all of North Carolina's biomanufacturing is located with one hour of the central Johnston Community College campus, making the College an ideal location for this project.  Thus, this project has the potential to directly contribute to the national need for a highly-trained advanced technical workforce.<br/><br/>The project will pursue three goals: 1) develop and implement a new curriculum that integrates biomanufacturing and applied engineering; 2) develop a multi-skilled talent pipeline from college to industry; and 3) provide hands-on education in a simulated drug manufacturing environment at the College's Workforce Development Center.  With support from two local biomanufacturing companies, this facility will be enhanced with additional automated machinery and an updated design to create learning environment that simulates drug production using DeltaV industry software to control equipment, similar to that of a modern biomanufacturing facility. Students on the Applied Engineering track will learn to troubleshoot and repair production equipment in these facilities, and students on the Bioprocessing Technology track will learn to manufacture life science products by monitoring conditions such as pH, temperature, and drug concentration during production. By practicing in this environment, students will gain better skills in mechanical and biological techniques. The project coordinator will provide students with career coaching, engage in outreach to high school students, and work with industries to develop internship opportunities that will ensure employment upon program completion.  By blending applied engineering and biomanufacturing, this project could provide a transferable model to better prepare students for skilled technical positions in modern biomanufacturing.

This paradigm is shifting; a new model of adaptive myelination proposes that experiences influence myelination, and adaptive changes in myelination alter circuit activity and spike timing in a way that is necessary for normal learning and cognition. An outstanding gap in knowledge is whether adaptive changes involve shifts between specific circuits and axon subtypes targeted for myelination. The purpose of this project is to identify the specific axon subtypes undergoing adaptive shifts in myelination, to determine the oligodendrocyte cell behaviors mediating these shifts, and to dissect molecular mechanisms of axon subtype-specific recognition. Studies will utilize larval zebrafish and in vivo imaging to directly observe changes to oligodendrocyte-axon interactions occurring in response to manipulations of gene function and neural activity. Expected outcomes will advance understanding of how oligodendrocytes and myelin remodeling contribute to neural plasticity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the present, there are two main techniques that are used to conduct these measurements in open waters.  One is the dropsonde, which is an instrument package that is dropped by an aircraft and takes measurements on the way down.  The main drawback of a dropsonde is the expense of making limited, point measurements.  The other technique is a remote sensing instrument called a microwave radiometer.  This project will test a new version of a microwave radiometer that has the potential to provide more precise and accurate measurements of wind speed.  Improvements in these measurements would provide researchers more information to test their theories and models against, thereby increasing the accuracy of hurricane forecasts.  In addition, the project will provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This funding will be used to deploy the UMass Simultaneous Frequency Microwave Radiometer (USFMR) on the NOAA P-3 research aircraft for the 2019 hurricane season.  The USFMR has potential advantages over the current Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer systems in that it adds dual-polarization and measures all frequencies in parallel, resulting in a 4 to 5-fold decrease in the measurement time.  The main work tasks are the testing and calibration of the USFMR in the laboratory, shipment and installation on the NOAA P-3, operation of the instrument on the calibration flights and during the hurricane missions, and then processing the measurements for brightness temperatures, 10m winds, and column-integrated rain rates.  The observations will be compared to those produced by the operational SFMR and dropsondes, with a focus on observations at the eyewall and in narrow rain bands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carballo, Mary Clarke of Boston University will undertake research to study the socioeconomic relationships that comprised ancient Maya economies, focusing specifically on labor relations and artisanal production. Previous scholarship on ancient economies has focused on a number of variables, including the organization of production, the level of commercialization, and the organization of marketplaces and marketplace exchange. While some contexts suggest that the work of producers was directly supported by consumers (they may have provided materials, subsistence goods, and, in some cases, housing for producers), others illustrate that producers worked independently and could directly profit from the commercial exchange or sale of the goods they produced. Commercial activities, however, can still be managed by representatives of the state: the price of goods can be fixed, entrepreneurial activities can be encouraged or prohibited, and financial institutions may control the means of and opportunities for exchange. The evaluation of commercialization in ancient societies requires knowledge of political organization and its strategies, which are reflected in the material records of marketplace exchange, such as marketplaces, household assemblages, and workshops. Archaeology is particularly well placed to provide relevant insight because it can evaluate the material evidence within these locations, which can then be compared across a community, a site, a region as a means of reconstructing ancient economies and economic transactions. Because this research will be conducted by MS Clarke as part of her doctoral dissertation research it will serve a valuable educational function.<br/><br/>Ms. Clarke will evaluate the ancient Maya economy through an investigation of limestone workshops and producer households. Limestone is a ubiquitous material in Mesoamerica that was used by the ancient Maya for a myriad of purposes, including the construction of monumental art and architecture. Stelae, altars, lintels, and temple stairways made of cut and carved limestone were inscribed with narratives documenting real and mythological events, as well as with depictions of key ritual performances and supernatural beings. At the site of Xultun, Guatemala, a stone production district was found where domestic architecture is integrated with quarry workshops wherein incomplete monuments were found still attached to the limestone bedrock. The limestone producers in this district were specifically producing materials for monumental state expressions, implying a single consumer, the state. Using this district as a case study, this project will assess multiple working hypotheses to address one broader question: how was limestone production organized, both socially and economically, at Xultun, and what does this tell us about labor and power in early societies? Through the analysis of chipped, ground, and pecked stone from Xultun, this project will establish the distribution and nucleation of limestone production work across the site. Moving from social to economic organization, this project will evaluate the systems of exchange visible in household consumption patterns to determine the commercialization of limestone and the extent of state involvement in its production and distribution. Results will be contextualized within the broader, multi-scalar frames of non-renewable resource management, commercialization and local exchange systems, and the production and projection of state identity in ancient society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A clear temporal linkage has been established between basaltic large igneous provinces and mass extinction events in the Late Devonian (~364 Ma), Middle Permian (259 Ma), Late Permian (248 Ma) and Late Triassic (~206 Ma).  These large volcanic events are suspected to cause global warming and marine anoxia due to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Conversely, the role of silicic large igneous provinces and resultant acid rain, ozone depletion, sulphate aerosols and ocean Fe fertilization in mass extinction events has not been assessed.  The Permo-Triassic Choiyoi Group of Argentina-Chile is a major high-latitude silicic large igneous province that has a strike length of > 2000 km and a volume equivalent to >125 Yellowstone calderas erupting essentially simultaneously.  Choiyoi magmatism overlaps with several major early Permian climatic events including Olsen?s extinction (~272 Ma) and the Kamura cooling event (~262 Ma).  This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) proposal offers an innovative immersion experience designed to engage three cohorts of U.S. undergraduate and graduate students over three years in a hypothesis-driven, field-intensive research project investigating the linkage between silicic large igneous provinces (SLIPS) and global climatic change. This project will advance science by providing an assessment of the potential role of silicic volcanism in climate change, foster international collaboration between U.S. and Argentinian research teams, promote education through the intentional mentoring of three cohorts of graduate and undergraduate students and increase diversity in the geosciences by inclusion of students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  Both the Department of Geosciences at SDSU and in the Department of Geology at UW-Eau Claire are committed to expanding diversity within the geosciences and are actively recruiting students from underrepresented groups into STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>An accurate reconstruction of Choiyoi magmatic activity and its relation to climatic change requires an integration of stratigraphic, structural, geochronologic, petrologic, isotopic, geochemical, and thermochronologic data from several focus areas within the magmatic province.  Three focus areas will be targeted within the southern, central and northern portions of the magmatic province that will be addressed sequentially over the three year duration of the project.  There are five major emphases within each focus area, including 1) stratigraphy/volcanic facies; 2) petrology, including mineral chemistry and fluid inclusion analysis; 3) U/Pb zircon geochronology and Hf analyses; 4) major, trace and REE geochemistry; 5) structural analysis, including thermochronology. The south-central Andes are an ideal natural laboratory to study this system due to 1) exposure and accessibility; 2) established geologic framework; 3) availability of highly-qualified mentors; 4) access to analytical facilities in U.S. and Argentina; and, 5) experience of co-PIs in both regional geology and student experiential activities.<br/> <br/>This investigation evaluates the potential relationship between the spatial and temporal evolution of a silicic large igneous complex and global climatic change and provides an ideal opportunity to engage students in hypothesis-driven scientific research. This project involve three cohorts of five (5) students conducting hypothesis-driven, field intensive research in the south-central Andes under the mentorship of a highly qualified team of U.S. and Argentinian mentors. Student researchers will conduct fieldwork within integrated teams consisting of 2-3 student researchers and 1-2 mentors, with the composition of the teams rotating on a regular basis Student collaborators (3 M.Sc., 9 B.Sc.) will be involved in all aspects of field and laboratory analyses, including stratigraphic studies, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, and isotopic analyses at UW-Eau Claire, SDSU, U.

This need is particularly critical in jobs related to air passenger safety.  The number of technicians needed to do aircraft inspections, preventative and routine maintenance, and repairs greatly exceeds the number of students who choose an education in avionics and aviation maintenance. At the same time, young women in high school continue to be less likely than young men to choose to enter or to stay in career and technical education classes tied to these careers. This proposal aims to help meet the need for aerospace technicians by broadening participation in aerospace technician education.  To achieve this goal, Everett Community College will work with regional aerospace companies, local schools, and a national organization to train teachers and counselors how to equally encourage all students along an aerospace education pathway. A specific emphasis will be on encouraging female students, so that more stay in this pathway. The project will offer an education model that could be used by secondary schools and colleges across the country.<br/><br/>This project intends to improve the capability of educators, career counselors, and academic advisors to encourage students, particularly young women, to enter and persist in aerospace education pathways. To achieve this goal, the project will support a partnership between Everett Community College, aerospace companies (Boeing, Delta Airlines, and Glasair Aviation), middle and high schools (Everett Public School District, Marysville Public School District, and Mukilteo Public School District), and the National Girls Collaborative Project, which is dedicated to advancing best practices for engaging females in STEM-related careers. The project will offer training and summer institutes for educators and counselors, focused on equity-based and culturally-responsive teaching strategies. The relevant technical curriculum will be examined through the lens of equity and inclusion. The training will include teaching and professional development strategies that are known to improve the interest, retention, and achievement of young women. Educator learning communities will be created to support exchange of ideas, curriculum materials, and best practices. Each secondary-school partner will identify a project liaison to engage cohorts of female students in career-connected afterschool activities, courses, and events. Female role models in aerospace careers will participate in after-school activities and support the students' engagement with technical coursework. The project team will also work with industry to provide students with early exposure to typical technician careers, near-peer mentoring experiences, and other identity-building activities. The project will enhance understanding about how to increase the ability of educators and counselors to nurture young women by enhancing their technical confidence to pursue aerospace and related career pathways.

Converting waste heat into electricity could improve energy efficiency dramatically and sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thermoelectric (TE) devices convert temperature differences into electrical power and have the potential to revolutionize the nation's energy portfolio. An ideal thermoelectric material conducts electricity, but not heat. Metals conduct both, whereas insulators conduct neither. This project challenges this dichotomy by using a novel strategy to dope tungsten disulfide, a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor. We will enhance its thermoelectric coefficient to maximize the output voltage, increase the electrical conductivity to minimize losses, and lower the thermal conductivity to maintain a large temperature difference. The proposed research will lead to efficient devices for waste heat recovery. This work will also enable high-performance 2D transistors, low-power memory devices, and nanoscale switches for thermal management. The team will work closely with local communities to encourage participation by students from all backgrounds in engineering careers and foster interest in nanotechnology. Outreach efforts will include lab demonstrations, summer internships, and career workshops.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this project is to improve the in-plane thermoelectric efficiency of two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS2) devices through engineering their electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties via electrochemical intercalation. WS2 has recently emerged as a promising TE candidate due to its large atomic mass (low thermal conductivity), small bandgap (high electrical conductivity), and high Seebeck coefficient. However, it remains challenging to optimize all of the material properties to maximize its TE efficiency and to dope this 2D material to create the p- and n-type pairs needed for TE devices. In this work, we will: (1) achieve p- and n-type doping in 2D materials via anion and cation intercalations; (2) optimize the in-plane power factor of WS2 through doping; (3) reduce the in-plane thermal conductivity of WS2 via phonon scattering by intercalants. Fundamentally, this project will study electrical, ionic, and thermal transport in 2D materials. Practically, this work will pave the way for the wide use of thermoelectric devices to scavenge heat from sources such as electronics and the human body. This work will also develop a doping method for 2D materials, addressing critical issues in 2D electronics such as low drive current and poor contact resistance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Human populations which depend on these regions for their livelihood have had to adapt to these changes and learn to manage these landscapes and their food resources over the course of millennia. Archaeology is well-positioned to understand how foragers, farmers, pastoralists, and ranchers have used these dryland resources through time in sustainable or unsustainable ways. The Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia is a yet little-studied region of dryland steppe, which has had at least 40,000 years of human occupation, and a long record of dramatic environmental change. Dr. Arlene Rosen, of the University of Texas at Austin, will lead a team of Mongolian and US archaeologists, and environmental specialists to the Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in the southern Mongolian Gobi in order to study the social, economic, and environmental dynamics of human and natural systems during episodes of climate change over the past 5,000 years. The team will include Mongolian archaeologists and students whose heritage derives from a long cultural tradition of rangeland maintenance and use. The project will benefit from the exchange of information between Mongolian and US scientists about traditional herding practices, ecological knowledge, and culture histories, combined with expertise in reconstructing landscape and vegetation histories for the region. The aim is to develop a model for studying dry-land ranges of other regions as well as the Gobi.<br/><br/>This research will investigate how human inhabitants of the Gobi Desert took an active role in altering the desert-steppe environments either with purposeful intent or as a result of unintended consequences of their impact on vegetation and landscapes. It is commonly believed that ancient pastoralists accelerated desertification when they settled in semi-arid environments. However, preliminary evidence from geomorphology and archaeological botany suggests that the first cattle, sheep-goat pastoralist groups to use this region might have improved the sustainability of the area by inadvertently bringing in the seeds of northern steppe grasses along with their herds, thus improving the sustainability of their economic way of life. By excavating sites from these early time periods, the project will expand knowledge of the many ways in which these herder-hunters and later specialized herders were able to maintain their livelihood over the course of thousands of years of increasing climatic desiccation. The excavation of the Burgasny Enger site, in the Ikh Nart Reserve will provide elements of culture history, lifeways, and economic orientation through the analyses of artifacts, settlement structures and plant and animal remains. This will be paired with geomorphological studies of landscape change and water sources in the immediate vicinity of the site. The result will be a holistic picture and roadmap to sustainable practices in dry-land steppe regions of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The FASEB conference on the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) was established in 2007 to fill a critical need for an ER focused research conference.  This FASEB Conference will bring together an international research community that investigates the structure, function and regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum.  The conference will expose early career scientists to a broad range of experimental systems and approaches that are being used by the leading laboratories in this research field.  Conference attendees are strongly encouraged to submit poster session abstracts.  In addition to the thirty invited speakers, twelve additional speakers will be selected for ""late breaking talks"" based upon their submitted poster abstracts, giving strong preference for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  A critical objective of this FASEB conference is to stimulate discussion and the exchange of information between the established leaders in the field and early career scientists during all sessions of the meeting including the platform talks, meet the speaker sessions, and career development workshops.  The FASEB summer conference on the endoplasmic reticulum is a critical driving force for the application of new technologies, development of novel concepts and fostering research collaborations between investigators with complementary expertise.  Achieving the objectives of this project is critical to maintain the viability of this research field by promoting broader participation in the ER field and the development of the next generation of ER researchers.<br/><br/> <br/>This multi-disciplinary meeting brings together a diverse international community of biochemists, cell biologists, molecular biologists, geneticists and physiologists who investigate protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum.  The conference is focused on elucidating the mechanisms for biosynthesis; processing and folding of proteins in the ER; protein quality control mechanisms that discriminate between folded and misfolded proteins; ER stress response pathways that allow the cell to alleviate protein-misfolding stress; and the ER associated degradation pathway that protects cells from the toxic accumulation of unfolded protein aggregates in the ER.  While there has been tremendous progress in this research field, there remain critical knowledge gaps that can now be addressed using experimental methods that were not previously available and by cross-disciplinary approaches to synergistically expand knowledge in this research field.

The outreach brings new understanding of molecular systems to children, students, and the general public.  Dr. Fennell's Molecular World Building program uses molecular modeling, virtual reality, and 3D printing and laser cutting to craft interactive chemical experiences that are accessible to novice learners aged 7 through 70+ years old.  This work provides unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and reaches the public by way of focused on-site summer camp sessions, portable hands-on activities for external venues, and broadly accessible internet resources that convey structure, interactions, and diversity in molecular systems.<br/><br/>Molecular modeling is a rapidly growing area of science that can provide an atomic-level view and unprecedented insight into the driving forces in chemical systems.  This growth is critically dependent on the development of models and techniques that are able to  accurately capture microscopic molecular behavior and properties.  Dr. Fennel and his research group work to advance the field of classical molecular modeling by developing a new approach for modeling matter using molecular distributions. Molecular Distribution Modeling uses sets of simple functions to develop ideal liquid mixtures that encode how molecules change in response to their local environments. Molecular distribution liquids do this without the direct need for more complex and computationally expensive polarizable and quantum mechanical considerations, leading to over 500x performance gains over costly polarizable methods. These models are straightforward to develop, extend directly from recently popularized techniques for improving classical molecular force fields, and inherit all the computational benefits of classical molecular simulations. Finally, Dr. Fennel is building and extending synergistic education activity modules and experiences for his Molecular World Building program that can translate into university chemistry courses and impact external science instructors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In our recent work, we have shown that the chemicals released into the oceans from seafloor hot-springs can be dispersed all across the oceans.  Now our interest has focused in on one element in particular, iron.  This is one of the most abundant elements in every planetary body in the Universe yet it is vanishingly rare in Earth's oceans today.  Set against that, it is essential to just about every form of life on Earth from the simplest and most ancient strains of microbes to the most complex animals including humans.  In Earth's oceans, the lack of this ""essential micro-nutrient"" has been found to limit how much life can flourish near both the south and north poles in the Pacific Ocean in the sunlit surface ocean even though the supply of sunlight and other major nutrients (phosphorous, nitrogen) should be more than adequate.  Our newest research suggests that iron released from hydrothermal plumes (where the concentrations coming from vents are more than 1 million times higher than normal ocean water) could play a major role.  Despite undergoing massive dilution as hydrothermal solutions leave the vents and traverse thousands of kilometers through the oceans, we believe that at least some of the iron released from deep sea hot springs can survive this journey and make a significant impact on how much live exists in Earth's polar oceans and how much CO2 it draws down from the atmosphere.  To investigate that idea, this project will study the fate of iron released from a hydrothermal vent over a length scale that hasn't been studied before - from the first 1km through the ocean out to 100km away from the vent-site.  This will fill a gap in our knowledge between what happens right at a vent-site (as studied by research submarines) and what happens to ocean chemistry all across Earth's entire ocean basins (as studied by a huge international research project called GEOTRACES).   Our work will use a 3D computational model to predict where the plume of material from a vent in the Northeast Pacific Ocean should escape to after it is erupted from some vents at a volcanic system called the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  We will then use an advanced autonomous free-swimming robot to search out in the predicted plume area, first to test the accuracy of our predicted model and, second, to collect samples from the hydrothermal plume from where it first forms to as far out as we can follow it.  The samples we collect will include both filtered seawater and the particulate material (whether mineralogical or microbiological) that we can extract from the filters.  Together, this will allow us to track the fate of the iron and other key physical and geochemical tracers down-plume away from the vents, to work out where it ends up (in the water and in the sediments) and also how fast those processes happen.  The work we do will also help plan how to conduct similar robotics-based exploration on future space missions beyond Earth where it has been hypothesized that seafloor events also exist (e.g. Saturn's moon Enceladus) and where, if we are really lucky, we may find that life is hosted based on the energy from seafloor volcanoes, just as happens here on Earth.  We have a resident artist embedded in our program who has already begun experimenting with the use of air-flow and sound in her sculptures to help communicate the complex nature of these plumes.  She will join our cruise, and work with our team post-cruise to design and hopefully build a sculpture that that could potentially result in a large and long-term outdoor installation. <br/><br/><br/>The international GEOTRACES program has revealed that iron (Fe) is released ubiquitously from submarine ridges to the deep ocean.  Results from US GEOTRACES section GP16 showed that both dissolved and particulate (colloidal) Fe may persist so far as to be able to influence primary productivity in High-Nutrient/Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the Southern Ocean.  As a complement to these sectional studies, we propose a detailed process study to elucidate the mechanisms by which hydrothermally sourced Fe can persist across the oceans at the scale that GEOTRACES has revealed.  Specifically, while the ""persistent"" Fe in a hydrothermal plume appears to behave quasi-conservatively from 100km to 4000km across the SE Pacific Ocean, it is also known that the majority of the Fe present at the Southern EPR on that US GEOTRACES GP16 cruise did not persist over the 100km separation between that station and the next deep ocean station beyond the ridge crest.  To fill that gap, this project will conduct a coupled modelling and field study to investigate the fate of hydrothermally sourced Fe at ranges of 0-1, 1-10 and 10-100km down-plume away from a well established vent-source.  To begin, we will use the detailed micro-bathymetry and the long-term current meter data available from the Main Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to implement a recently developed 3D theoretical plume dispersion model that can predict both the detailed 3D dispersion trajectory and the rate of flow within the hydrothermal plume away from two long-studied and well characterized Main Endeavour Field (MEF) vents.  At sea, we will use that predictive model to guide Sentry autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys that will follow the plume ""down-wind"" and ""across-plume"" to compile a 3D survey using in-situ sensors [optical, redox, conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD)] that will allow us to (1) confirm (and better constrain) the predictive model, and to (2) map out the shape and trajectory of the plume to provide context for discrete water column samples that we will collect - both from the AUV and from a trace metal clean CTD-rosette.  Sampling from the AUV will use the latest generation of SUPR samplers designed for the CLIO trace-metal-clean water sampler.  This will suffice for samples of dissolved, colloidal and particulate trace metals and collection of filtered material for grain-by-grain mineralogical and biogeochemical analyses.  That sampling program will be backed up by larger volume sampling down-plume using a CTD-rosette to augment our AUV-based program with helium isotope analyses (to track extents of physical plume dilution at increasing distances downwind and across plume) and for complementary ligand and organic compound analyses to investigate the role that organic complexation might play in protecting reduced species of Fe [and manganese (Mn), too] against oxidative precipitation and removal from the oceanic water column.  Post cruise, our combination of biogeochemical measurements and improved 3D physical modelling will not only be able to provide new insights into the processes that control the fluxes of Fe and Mn to the oceans from hydrothermal venting but also the length scales over which those processes take effect.  Finally, because our 3D theoretical model includes velocities, we also anticipate being able to deduce the rates at which these processes occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a collaboration among UWA's College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and College of Education, two local community colleges, an area public school, and a charter school, INSPIRE will recruit and prepare STEM teachers for positions in high-need school districts in the geographic area of western Alabama and eastern Mississippi.  The project will provide a strong undergraduate teaching program that focuses on developing subject matter comprehension and skill in proven pedagogical practices. It will also develop a strong mentoring environment between scholars and practicing teachers in the school district during the induction years.  <br/><br/>Over the course of a five year period, the project seeks to fund a total of 15 undergraduate junior and senior STEM majors with scholarships and 10 area STEM professionals with stipends to become licensed science and mathematics teachers. The leaders at the University of West Alabama will work with Bevill State Community College, Coastal Alabama Community College, the Demopolis City Schools, and the University Charter School to recruit and train scholars from both community colleges and the university. The foci of the training includes cultural competencies and pedagogical knowledge. Three goals guide the project. First, to increase the number and quality of certified STEM teachers entering the workforce. Second, to develop a collaborative mentoring environment among program participants and clinical master teachers. Third, to create an induction program for INSPIRE graduates to continue developing subject matter expertise and improved pedagogical practices after graduation and certification. By recruiting from a specific geographical area and then placing the new teachers in the same area, the project will contribute to the educational community in western Alabama and eastern Mississippi. In addition the project holds promise to serve as a national model. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electronic properties of most solids are understood within a quantum mechanical description that accounts for a large number of interacting electrons moving in the background of the charged atomic cores of the elements that comprise the solid. In simple solids the physics can be understood within an approximation that treats the electrons as quantum mechanical particles that move independently of one another. A major theme of modern materials research is on materials in which this approximation fails and the motion of different electrons is in fact correlated. Fascinating phenomena emerge in such materials; examples include high-temperature superconductivity, and other novel phenomena where the electrons appear to break apart inside the solid. An important recent experimental advance is the observation of such strong correlation of electronic motion in a particularly simple and tunable system, namely in atomically thin layers of graphene. The PI will develop new concepts and methods to deal with such electronic systems in diverse contexts. He will apply the lessons learnt from one platform, such as the graphene system mentioned before, to other known platforms that have long resisted understanding, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Historically, such fundamental research on electronic materials has generated many of the concepts that underlie modern electronic technology. The proposed research will contribute to the continuum of scientific and technological knowledge that will enable future technology that harvests the quantum mechanical behaviors of systems with many degrees of freedom in fundamental ways.

The emphasis will be on general development of new theoretical concepts and field-theoretic methods. When possible, these will be placed in the context of either experiments on specific materials, or of numerical work on specific microscopic models. The proposed projects in this broad area include: i) a study of microscopic models for the Moire superlattice in ABC-stacked trilayer graphene and related systems through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, ii) a microscopic Lowest Landau Level theory of a particular non-abelian quantum Hall state, seeking to establish analytically a theory that captures both topological and non-universal properties, iii) several general questions on disorder effects in 2D frustrated quantum magnets. The project will provide key insights and methods that will be useful in interpreting the results from experiments on Moire graphene systems, quantum magnets, and possible future cold-atom realizations of bosonic quantum Hall states.<br/><br/>The PI will continue his efforts to design lectures to expose graduate students to experimental methods and the phenomenology of modern correlated materials.

Sustainable agriculture aims at preserving the natural reserves for the future, demands minimum chemical inputs, promotes efficient nutrient recycling, and enhances the critical microbial-driven processes, such as nutrient acquisition and protection against plant pathogens. Rhizobia and mycorrhizal fungi are the primary groups of beneficial soil microbes, which help the plants in meeting their demand for nitrogen and phosphorous, thereby significantly reducing the exogenous application of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. Although mycorrhizal associations are widely prevalent among most land plants, nitrogen-fixing rhizobial associations are limited only to legumes. This project aims at dissecting the molecular mechanisms of legume-rhizobia symbiosis to engineer and introduce this symbiotic machinery into cereal crops. This will be a great boon to the farmers, as the availability of cereal crop cultivars that are capable of establishing symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia will minimize their cost of cultivation manifold. In addition to furthering existing knowledge on plant-microbe symbioses, the project will provide ample scope for the integration of research and educational goals of the researcher and support unique educational programs dedicated to provide a research based-learning platform to undergraduate students from first-generation, low-income, under-represented minority groups, K-12 teachers and students of Wisconsin public schools. <br/><br/>Symbiotic associations between crops and microbes play an essential role in enhancing the productivity and sustainability of our agriculture. The two most important symbioses in agroecosystems that promote crop nutrition are legume root nodulation and arbuscular mycorrhization. Genetic studies in the model legumes, such as Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus led to current understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the establishment of these mutualistic associations and suggest the existence of a Common Symbiotic Pathway (CSP) between both symbioses, in which Medicago truncatula DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS 1, 2 and 3 (DMI1, DMI2 and DMI3) play a central role. This opens the exciting possibility of manipulating this conserved CSP to improve the associations between symbiotic microbes and crop plants. To achieve this exciting goal, a thorough understanding of symbiotic signal transduction machinery is required. This CAREER project aims at identifying and characterizing novel genetic players in the early signaling pathway through genetic suppressor screening followed by mapping the suppressor loci through whole genome sequencing to clone the novel genes for functional characterization. This project will allow the investigators to identify novel components that have been missed in conventional screens for nodulation-defective mutants and generate new knowledge of the molecular mechanisms allowing symbiotic associations that could be applied to legume and non-legume crops.  Therefore, this project will not only provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling plant-microbe symbioses, but will also identify potential targets for engineering more efficient nitrogen-fixing associations in cereal crops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From social networking to banking, from mobile devices to cloud computing, the PKI allows communicating parties to be sure of whom they are communicating with, that their communication is confidential, and that their communication has not been tampered with.  Despite its incredible importance, the PKI has been notoriously difficult to evolve to meet new security concerns and Internet demands.  This project introduces new, deployable alternatives to key parts of the PKI to make it more evolvable, manageable, and secure.<br/><br/>The project has three primary thrusts.  The first introduces a key enabling technology behind the subsequent thrusts, called assertion-carrying certificates (ACCs).  ACCs expand today's certificates with the capability of including a small amount of code (in the form of assertions) to be evaluated as part of the certificate validation process.  The second thrust applies ACCs to enable certificate authorities to more readily evolve to new demands for certificate delegation and automated issuance.  The third thrust applies ACCs and trusted execution environments to enable web-hosting services like content delivery networks to securely manage their customers' cryptographic keys.<br/><br/>Correct operation of the PKI is paramount to ensuring a secure, authenticated Internet.  Recent efforts have proven that progress towards a more secure PKI is possible, but a more fundamental focus is needed to address the underlying challenges.  This project will do just that by developing a new, extensible approach to constraining when identities on the Internet should be trusted.  This project will make it straightforward and safe to extend the basic abstractions offered by the PKI, thereby enabling it to evolve to meet changing trends.<br/><br/>The project's code and data will be made publicly available and maintained at https://securepki.org<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The major fundamental difficulty in describing and theoretically representing quantum many-body systems is the vast number of parameters required. The number of such parameters increases exponentially with the number of constituents of a system, and thus quickly becomes intractable for numerical computations, even for small quantum systems. Thus, efficient descriptions of quantum systems are of fundamental importance to our understanding of complex systems and of their applications. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will study a new representation for certain quantum systems that is exact and efficient. Another front of the research is the development of models of quantum systems that efficiently describe their dynamics, for example quantum detectors under the influence of measurements and external disturbances. The detailed understanding of such dynamics may find a crucial role in the development of a host of new experimental diagnostic tools, and of platforms for quantum computing.<br/><br/>The project will require the use and development of new theoretical tools in the arsenal of theoretical physics of many-body quantum states. Also, in tandem with the research, the project will involve the training of graduate students in cutting-edge methods of theoretical physics, which are vital for a scientific career but also form a core of ideas that often find new uses in industry.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education to advance our grasp of quantum aspects of condensed matter theory at low dimensions through the study of entanglement, dynamics, and fluctuations in many-body states. There are three main topics of study:<br/><br/>The first topic is a study of the interplay of locality and entanglement and its relation to variational methods like tensor network states. The PI will focus on recently discovered Hamiltonians that exhibit highly entangled ground states and new phase transitions, and unusual dynamical scaling properties.<br/><br/>The second topic will deal with a set of quantum nonequilibrium problems, a topic of current interest due to advancement in theory and experiment. Theory lags significantly behind experimental abilities primarily due to the inability to effectively simulate many-body dynamics. Via a numerical framework based on closed hierarchies of equations, the PI will study nonequilibrium current generation, effects of the motion of detectors and sources in a Fermi sea, quantum wakes, and role of the interplay between disorder and measurements.<br/><br/>In a third topic, the PI will investigate a new class of boson impurity models that can be mapped into certain photonic cluster states, with particular emphasis on relating these states to ground states of interesting physical disordered systems that may ultimately be amenable to quantum simulation.<br/><br/>The methods and approaches employed and developed will allow for a fruitful exchange of ideas between researchers in condensed matter, quantum information, high-energy physics, and in mathematics. Nonequilibrium quantum physics plays a role in a wide swath of applications from fundamental physics understanding to the development of devices.  Finally, an essential component of the project is that it will provide opportunities for the training of new researchers, whose development as scientists is a vital goal of the proposed activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cell surface charge pattern also reflects the in situ dynamic status of cell membrane, which is critical for membrane-regulated cell functions such as endocytosis, muscle cell contraction, nutrient transport, T cell activation and insulin release. Recent evidences show that a variety of cell functions including cell aggregation, cell division and cell migration can be modulated by manipulating cell surface charge patterns.  Therefore rapid mapping of single cell surface charge patterns will provide a unique and important approach in advancing analysis of cells and regulation of their functions. However, to date rapid mapping of living cell surface charge remains a large challenge owing to lack of robust techniques capable of measurements at the micro and nano scale.  Scanning ion conductance microscopy has been used for quantitative cell surface charge mapping. This method employs a single nano pipette to approach the cell surface point by point, resulting in a low efficiency, labor intensive and destructive measurement. The proposed research aims to address this long standing challenge by exploring a universal method for rapid, non-destructive characterization and mapping of cell surface charge.  In addition, with educational and outreach activities, the proposed research is poised to enhance the interdisciplinary learning experience for undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to explore a lab-on-a- chip platform for rapid, non-destructive living cell surface charge mapping. Such a device will 1) foster the breakthrough of discovering new biomarkers for cell identification, sorting and real time monitoring, and 2) greatly advance the knowledge in understanding the roles cell electrical properties play on cell functions. To achieve the objective, the following tasks will be pursued: 1) demonstration of acoustic cell manipulator that will rapidly focus/release individual living cell onto/off the probe surface in a continuous flow, 2) study of an array of nanopores that can accurately map the cell surface charge with high temporal resolution and accuracy, 3) implementation of signal multiplexing that will enable simultaneous measurement of surface charge distributions via a nanopore array, and 4) validation of the platform for rapid cell surface charge mapping using human dermal fibroblasts cells.  The use of non-intrusive cell manipulation enables quick focus/release cells onto/off the nanopore array's surface, allowing rapid, high-throughput surface charge mapping in continuous flow. The use of nanopore array in combination with signal multiplexing enables rapid mapping of the cell surface charge characteristics at one time without complex measurement electronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Objects are called chiral if they cannot be superimposed with their mirror images -- just like the left and right hands of humans.  Many molecules such as amino acids (in DNA) and sugars that are important for the functions of the human body are chiral. They exist in right-handed and left-handed pairs, called enantiomers.  Notably, when it comes to medicine, only one enantiomer is wanted in many drug applications.  Often one chiral form is beneficial and the other may have no activity or may be harmful. Laboratory syntheses of drugs frequently result only in mixtures, and it is difficult and costly to separate enantiomers. For a small fraction of drug molecules, crystallization can be used to produce solids from solution that contain only one of the enantiomers.  Crystallization, when it works, separates entantiomers cheaply and efficiently. The Gruenwald research group is exploring separations that use crystallization to understand how they are guided by such aspects as molecular shape and interaction forces. Computational models are being developed to help predict when crystallization to form pure enantiomers will happen; This understanding has great potential value for drug development and other chemical syntheses. The models at the heart of this work are used in extensive educational outreach to introduce chemical principles to young students. An educational workshop is being created that leverages the strong visual connections between chiral molecules, their crystal structures, and artwork by M.C. Escher.<br/><br/>Research supported by this award aims to understand why racemic or other mixtures of chiral molecules in solution spontaneously form enantiopure crystals. Molecular models and computational methods are being developed to reveal the driving forces and guiding principles for the formation of both enantiopure and racemic crystals. Computationally efficient models are used to consider a broad range of molecular shapes and interactions within molecular dynamics computer simulations, including specific methods of trajectory sampling as well as coarse-graining. Large data sets of computational crystallization experiments are created, and models will be characterized according to their propensity to form enantiopure or racemic crystals. Of particular interest is the development of computational methods that can enumerate all low-energy crystal structures of these models and thus determine the thermodynamic landscape for chiral crystallization. By determining distributions of small molecular clusters, fundamental differences in the nucleation dynamics of enantiopure and racemic crystals can be identified. Statistical models are being developed that allow one to predict the likelihood of enantiopure crystallization from knowledge of racemic and enantiopure crystal structures. One ultimate aim is to inform computational screening procedures to pre-determine the likelihood of a racemic mixture to separate and thus to allow the rational synthetic modification of molecules to enhance the separation. Another is for the molecular models and methods of crystal structure enumeration developed here to be useful for future studies of the self-assembly of chiral and non-chiral building blocks on different length scales, including proteins and inorganic nanostructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the models archaeologists typically employ are strongly conditioned by a limited number of historical and ethnographic cases that are inextricably linked to modern states.  Archaeologists are now recognizing great organizational variability among ancient complex societies, and in the pathways by which societies become complex. This project will investigate the varied roles that secondary centers play within the development of complex, non-state systems, highlighting organizational postures not documented in the ethnographic or historical present.  This research will contribute directly to the theoretical understanding of emergent social complexity and the alternate pathways this development may take.  It will also provide international research experience for American students, training in modern excavation and analytical techniques, and opportunities for student research<br/><br/><br/>The site of Rabe ""Anka Siget"" (Serbia), provides the opportunity to investigate these questions in the context of a well-dated Bronze Age polity.  The researchers will conduct a program of excavation and analysis at this secondary center to investigate its position within the Middle Bronze Age Maros (Mori) Group.  The project will test alternative hypotheses concerning the potential roles Anka Siget may have played within the Maros polity.  Activities and developments at Rabe with be compared with those recently documented by the researchers' NSF funded project at Pecica ""Anul Mare"" (Romania), the primary center of the polity.  Additional lines of evidence will evaluate the strength and nature of the connections between Anka Siget and Pecica, with other Maros settlements, and with the wider set of peer polities in the Carpathian Basin.  This project will be the first community-scale excavation of a Maros tell.  The use of multi-tiered geophysical survey methods, combined with targeted excavations, will produce an unprecedented view of the internal organization of a Bronze Age settlement.  Through this work, the investigators will not only elucidate the development of a pivotal Bronze Age polity, but also will contribute to the wider anthropological debate surrounding emergent social complexity by providing an alternative case of organization within a pre-state polity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some types of SMAs also respond to magnetic fields and in some cases the reversible shape change is accompanied by dramatic changes in the magnetic properties of the material. These SMAs are known as meta-magnetic SMAs- 'meta' in this case indicates 'beyond' conventional magnetic behavior- and the very strong coupling between mechanical and magnetic fields make them ideal for sensors, actuators, and even solid-state refrigeration. Beyond their practical applications, meta-magnetic SMAs are fascinating materials because their shape-change behavior is extremely sensitive to minute changes in their configuration, which can in turn be changed by different processing techniques. While many groups have proposed different mechanisms by which heat treatments induce changes in the behavior of meta-magnetic SMAs, most explanations rely on changes to global properties of the alloys, such as the overall degree of order/disorder in their atomic configuration. Recent work by the PIs and others suggest that more local effects (i.e., microstructure) may play an unexpected role. This award supports a combined experimental/theoretical effort that seeks to elucidate the role of microstructure evolution on the response of these systems. The knowledge gained can be used to increase the degree of control over the behavior of meta-magnetic SMA-based devices. This award also supports the training of undergraduate (UG) and graduate students in state-of-the-art experimental and computational materials techniques. The PI and Co-PI currently lead an REU program on Multi-functional Materials and students recruited into this program will be mentored by graduate students involved in the project or undergraduate research projects related to meta-magnetic SMAs. Moreover, the PhD students involved in the project will receive training in materials science, informatics and design through enrollment in an interdisciplinary graduate training program (D3EM) directed by the PI. Elements of the research produced in this project will also be used as case studies at the Texas A&M Computational Materials Science Summer School, co-organized by the PI for over eight years.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: The PIs propose an experimental/theoretical program to elucidate the underlying microstructural mechanisms and the corresponding length scale effects on the martensitic transformation (MT), in NiMnIn-based meta-magnetic Shape Memory Alloys. Meta-magnetic SMAs exhibit a wide range of complex phenomena resulting from the interplay between microstructure, configurational disorder and several phase transitions (ordering, ferromagnetic, ferroelastic/martensitic). Recent work by the PIs has demonstrated that NiCoMnIn alloys show complex, non-linear, non-monotonic dependence of the MTs, as well as their suppression and re-appearance, on small compositional changes and heat treatments. This behavior, however, cannot be explained by changes in global (thermodynamic) degrees of freedom, such as, vacancy concentration or overall degree of order/disorder. The underlying hypothesis of this project is the existence of a very strong connection between mesoscale microstructural features and the phase transformation behavior of meta-magnetic SMAs. The main goal of this project is to establish a fundamental understanding of the underlying microstructural mechanisms responsible for the observed complex chemistry and heat treatment dependence of multiple phase transitions in NiMnIn-based meta-magnetic SMAs through the close coupling of experiments and simulations. Advanced synthesis and characterization will be combined with state-of-the-art multi-scale computational materials science frameworks to understand the connection between microstructural features and the martensitic transformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Essential for controlling this information flow is both production and degradation of RNA, processes that are carried out by energy-utilizing polymerase protein machines and exosomes, respectively.  A third type of energy-utilizing RNA processing proteins are helicases, which are ubiquitous and modify the structure of RNA by unzipping RNA duplexes. An emerging theme is that RNA helicases are multi-functional machines playing additional roles beyond RNA unzipping, including energy requiring RNA anchoring and directly regulating the activity of other RNA processing proteins. The Ski2-like helicases are a new family of helicases, which act in close coordination with polymerases and the exosome to affect a broad range of RNA processing activities. These helicases have novel activity coupling RNA duplex sensing and motion. The project will investigate the fundamental molecular mechanisms of this novel activity to reveal how these diverse functions can arise from the accessory modification of core, conserved helicase components. The project will also investigate how these novel helicases cooperate and compete with other RNA processing proteins, e.g., a helicase and polymerase. The project will also leverage the optical tweezers developed and strong science outreach activities at MSU to expand an existing education and outreach program, which is based on hands-on interactions with biophysical science experiments at the levels of individual cells and RNA molecules both within and out of the lab. <br/><br/><br/>This project will investigate RNA-processing protein dynamics of single proteins and larger protein machine assemblies by developing and applying high-resolution, multi-modal single-molecule techniques. The project will specifically investigate the yeast Mtr4p helicase and the associated TRAMP helicase + polymerase system along with the related yet functionally distinct yeast DEAD-box helicase Ded1p. Mtr4p and TRAMP have emerged as key players in nuclear RNA surveillance and processing in part via precise modification of RNA for degradation by the exosome. While TRAMP is composed of only three proteins, two are opposing polarity molecular machines - the 3' to 5' Mtr4p helicase and the 5' to 3' Trf4p polymerase. Mtr4p performs multiple functions including unwinding RNA, discriminating substrates, and modulating polymerase activity to achieve precise poly(A) labeling of RNA. How these machines coordinate or compete to achieve function is controversial in large part due to their highly dynamic, multi-degree of freedom interactions on the scale of only 5-10 nucleotides of RNA. The project will be able to address the fundamental questions regarding how Mtr4p and TRAMP function using frontier single-molecule methods simultaneously combining high-resolution optical tweezers and fluorescence. The project will investigate: (1) How the recently discovered RNA-duplex-sensing translocation mechanism of Mtr4p is achieved via comparison to mutants, in particular one where the loss of a key domain dramatically alters activity, and to the related Ded1p helicase. (2) How the TRAMP polymerase activity is modulated in turn by Mtr4p via direct, simultaneous measurements of helicase and polymerase activity using fluorescence and tweezers. (3) How the related RNA helicase Ded1p unwinding mechanism occurs at the same mechanistic resolution as the Mtr4p studies. Advanced techniques combining high-resolution optical trapping and multi-color fluorescence will apply broadly across all biophysical molecular dynamics investigations towards the emerging need for tools to investigate protein-nucleic acid interactions beyond the individual molecule scale towards multi-protein, multi-degree of freedom complex systems.   The project provides strong science outreach activities at MSU to expand an existing education and outreach program, which is based on hands-on interactions with biophysical science experiments at the levels of individual cells and RNA molecules both within and out of the lab.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Real-world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion of vehicles, packets in a communication network, fluid particles in a tube, wetting transitions where fluid spreads in a porous medium, epidemics advancing in a population, or the fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid.

Unpredictable weather patterns have led to more severe and frequent natural disasters and, therefore, mitigating the impact of hazards on building structures is important for continuity in national welfare and prosperity following a disaster. Aside from building structures that can sustain various extreme events, modern and future architecture has shifted towards complex freeform structures, beyond simple geometries, to achieve aesthetically pleasing structures and to make efficient use of space.  A solution that simultaneously addresses all the above issues will require redefining some of the conventional paradigms in construction material design and deployment.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will investigate a new construction material approach for building skins and facades that are moldable to various complex geometries and, at the same, have the ability to manipulate waves imparted to the buildings and dissipate energy from high velocity winds.  The moldability will be achieved by relief cutting solid panels made of wood and metals with certain microstructural patterns, which is a low-cost process and hence suitable for the building industry.  While relief cutting promotes flexible surfaces, this approach generally reduces the load carrying ability of the panels, which may not be desirable.  This study will provide a means to potentially turn the disadvantage of the cutting method into an advantage, i.e., utilizing the cut patterns for tuning the dynamic properties to better resist hazard loadings.  Because of the architected nature, the cut surfaces are expected to display a wide range of wave and vibration control and energy dissipation mechanisms.  Equipping buildings with the ability to redirect, localize, trap, and dissipate energy, instead of merely resisting the impacted forces, can lead to a more efficient hazard mitigation strategy. This research can advance structural engineering by pushing complex freeform shapes to a standard practice that intertwines aesthetic arguments, building performance requirements, and material design considerations. To a greater impact, freeform complex shapes can provide buildings with additional functionalities beyond their default load bearing and shelter capabilities.  This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary professional and research training opportunities.  Project data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research aims to provide fundamental knowledge regarding the interplay between complex freeform geometries, microstructural morphologies, constituent properties (viscoelastic and inelastic deformations), and mechanisms of wave propagation and energy dissipation in architectural materials. A technique known as relief cutting (or kerfing) will be used to endow thin material sheets with prescribed curved shapes and surface patterns. The objective of such patterning is two-fold. First, it will allow molding flat plates into a nearly endless array of complex freeform shapes to fulfill a variety of functional and aesthetic architectural needs. Second, it will induce a microstructural geometry and property modulation that can help manipulate a wide range of wave and vibration events, through energy absorption and dissipation mechanisms. After a simulation-based design stage exploring the design space available via kerfing, freeform components will be fabricated, molded into shape, and tested. In the design and testing of laboratory specimens, excitations that mimic the dynamic loads of high velocity winds will be accounted for to realize stress and deformation fields similar to those observed in realistic freeform structures used in actual architectural structures.  This research is high risk and high reward as it will be a significant departure from traditional construction methodologies: 1) it will lead to a paradigm shift in building design, in which freeform complex shapes will be demonstrated to offer better resistance to dynamic loadings; 2) it will introduce a new and bold modular fabrication philosophy for freeform shapes that will generate minimal material waste, eliminate the need for mold casting, and simplify the logistics of material transportation; and 3) it harmoniously will blend dynamic performance and architectural constraints - two requirements that are often perceived to be mutually exclusive - by taking advantage of the intrinsic mechanical and aesthetic attributes of complex shapes and microstructural patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From social networking to banking, from mobile devices to cloud computing, the PKI allows communicating parties to be sure of whom they are communicating with, that their communication is confidential, and that their communication has not been tampered with.  Despite its incredible importance, the PKI has been notoriously difficult to evolve to meet new security concerns and Internet demands.  This project introduces new, deployable alternatives to key parts of the PKI to make it more evolvable, manageable, and secure.<br/><br/>The project has three primary thrusts.  The first introduces a key enabling technology behind the subsequent thrusts, called assertion-carrying certificates (ACCs).  ACCs expand today's certificates with the capability of including a small amount of code (in the form of assertions) to be evaluated as part of the certificate validation process.  The second thrust applies ACCs to enable certificate authorities to more readily evolve to new demands for certificate delegation and automated issuance.  The third thrust applies ACCs and trusted execution environments to enable web-hosting services like content delivery networks to securely manage their customers' cryptographic keys.<br/><br/>Correct operation of the PKI is paramount to ensuring a secure, authenticated Internet.  Recent efforts have proven that progress towards a more secure PKI is possible, but a more fundamental focus is needed to address the underlying challenges.  This project will do just that by developing a new, extensible approach to constraining when identities on the Internet should be trusted.

However, they decay over short distances while also generating Joule heat losses. Electronic spin current impinging onto a magnetic insulator is converted into spin current carried by collective motion of localized magnetic moments. Such spin wave or magnon spin currents can propagate over long distances without Joule heat losses since electrons do not move through an insulator. Even slower spatial decay of spin currents becomes possible when they are transported by spiraling textures of precessing magnetic moments within room temperature magnetic insulators with easy-plane anisotropy, sharing many features of coherent and  superfluid transport  without dissipation at cryogenic temperatures. In addition, the spin waves can interfere and exhibit nonlinear wave interaction which can be exploited for novel wave-based logic gates, as well as for mixing of logic and memory on the same chip to evade the so-called memory wall as a bottleneck in data exchange between distant slow memory and fast logic gates in conventional electronics. The superfluid spin transport can be exploited to create magnetic analogues of superconducting Josephson junctions. The proposed research will employ newly developed computational tools to simulate interconversion between electronic spin currents and spin wave or superfluid spin currents, thereby offering a precise guidance for device fabrication with optimal control of long-distance and low-dissipation spin-encoded information flow across magnetic insulators and its probing in the bulk or near interfaces with normal metals contacts.  Broader impact of the proposed research will include: design of building blocks for novel computing technologies with ultralow power consumption; training for graduate students in advanced quantum device modeling and supercomputing simulations; and creation of new publicly available device modeling software.<br/><br/>The scalability of magnon spintronic devices requires efficient schemes to excite exchange spin waves of short wavelength, which will be investigated by simulating spin waves of nanoscale wavelength generated by annihilation of two magnetic domain walls or by a single current-driven domain wall. These setups will also underlie simulations of logic-in-memory devices where domain walls store binary information while spin waves perform logic operations by traversing them. Magnon valves and transistors which modulate spin wave spin current across ferro- and antiferromagnetic insulators with easy-axis anisotropy will be simulated. Schemes to modulate superfluid spin currents across magnetic insulators with easy-plane anisotropy will be investigated, including magnetic analogues of Josephson junctions. In all of these devices, readout of information processed by magnetic insulator requires to eventually convert spin currents carried by the dynamics of localized magnetic moments into conventional electronic spin and charge currents. The whole process will be modeled microscopically by utilizing and further advancing theoretical and computational capabilities of recently developed multiscale framework which self-consistently combines time-dependent nonequilibrium Green function algorithms for electrons with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments. This framework makes it possible for the first time to directly, and in time-resolved fashion, investigate how injection of electronic spin current (steady or pulsed) excites spin waves or superfluid spin transport by spin torque and, how they excite electronic spin currents via the spin pumping effect.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project specifically responds to a national and local shortage in qualified and certified secondary mathematics and science teachers.  This project has two main goals.  One is to increase the number of chemistry, life science, and mathematics secondary teachers by increasing the number of STEM majors who  successfully complete teacher licensure in these majors.  The second is to increase the effectiveness of Noyce Scholars as educators and teacher leaders in high-need classrooms.  In addition to their coursework, Noyce Scholars will participate in diverse field experiences, mentoring from STEM and education faculty, and professional development activities.  It is expected that these Noyce Scholars will distinguish themselves from other teachers through engagement in a curriculum focused on Universal Design for Learning and culturally sustaining pedagogy.<br/><br/>The project aims to produce 30 secondary mathematics or science teachers who are equipped with pedagogies based in Universal Design for Learning principles and cultural competency.  Undergraduate students majoring in mathematics or science will earn both a teacher certification and a STEM degree (as warranted by the Ohio Dominican University's Vice-Provost for Academic Affairs).  These students will receive up to two years of Noyce financial support beginning in their junior year.  Students who have already achieved a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field and wish to pursue teacher certification will receive one year of support.  Scholars will be prepared to work with students across different cultures and ability levels through exposure to culturally sustaining pedagogy and the tenets of Universal Design for Learning.  The University has cultivated partnerships with local high-need school districts, South-Western City Schools and Whitehall City Schools, to ensure field experiences that allow Scholars to apply Universal Design for Learning principles and cultural sustaining pedagogy practices.  This project will investigate the impact of Universal Design for Learning and cultural competency instruction on Scholars' teacher self-efficacy.  It will also examine the impact of changes in methods courses on student teaching skills and at what stage these interventions have the most impact on teacher effectiveness.  An increase in highly qualified STEM educators in high-need schools has the potential to positively affect the entire greater Columbus area.  Publications and presentations about the project will provide insights about the potential benefits of equipping pre-service STEM teachers to use Universal Design for Learning and cultural sustaining pedagogy. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Application of traditional fracture testing methods in fracture assessment of soft materials is quite challenging due to poor repeatability as well as large creep deformations that occurs during the test. The research outcome of this project could enable a paradigm shift in fracture behavior characterization of soft adhesive materials. Moreover, the research will provide understanding of cracking in film/substrate systems, which is essential in designing crack-resistant coatings. Knowledge created through this research will empower researchers to precisely interpret cracking patterns in important applications areas, such as thermal barrier coatings, reflective coatings in optical applications, modern high-performance ceramics (e.g. turbine blades in jet engines), micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), and medicine. Other potential benefits to the US economy and society include manufacturing of durable and high-performance fracture resistant materials, such as paint, epoxies, and hydrocarbon polymers. <br/><br/>The primary objective of this EAGER project is to effectively utilize spiral cracking pattern as a powerful diagnostic tool to obtain valuable information about the composition and fracture behavior of soft adhesive materials. An innovative integrated approach coupling acoustic emissions (AE) technique with Digital Image Analysis (DIA) will be explored: (1) to determine the precise 3D geometry of spiral cracks; (2) to find the best mathematical model to represent the cracking patterns; and (3) to measure the AE-based fracture energy of the material. Multi-sensor AE source-location approach will be used to provide real-time accurate visualization of the 3D geometry of fracture process zone along the spiral crack path. Finally, quantitative assessment of mud (channeling) cracking patterns, morphology of cracks, and statistical analysis of shape and size of fragmentation will be explored. The relationship between fracture energies from spiral and mud crackings will be thoroughly investigated to predict the mud cracking patterns in thin films using the spiral cracking-based fracture energy of the material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this study is to determine how plants sense a class of chemicals found in smoke known as karrikins. Karrikins influence important agronomic traits such as germination, seedling growth, and stress tolerance. Several genes that are involved in karrikin perception and response have been found, but accumulating evidence suggests that karrikins must be converted into active signals within plants before they can be recognized. This project will identify genes that carry out the activation of karrikins. It is likely that these same genes are involved in production of an unknown plant hormone that karrikins mimic. Discovery of these genes will be a significant steppingstone to understanding how plants grow after fires, as well as to finding a novel class of plant growth regulators that may offer new opportunities for agricultural improvement. This project uses cutting-edge techniques for identifying members of protein complexes that may regulate karrikin metabolism, and then tests candidate genes with a high-throughput gene-editing approach. This project will enhance the U.S. scientific workforce by providing training for one postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and over 150 undergraduates, many of whom will be underrepresented minorities, from low-income families, and/or first-generation college students. Monthly public outreach events that teach the local community about plant science and STEM disciplines will be held. Discoveries from this project will be communicated to the public through publications, press releases, and social media.<br/><br/>KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) is the putative receptor in plants for karrikins (KARs) and an as-yet-unknown endogenous KAI2 ligand (KL). However, recent observations suggest that KAI2 does not recognize KARs directly and that KARs must first be metabolized into a bioactive signal. Mutations in KARRIKIN UPREGULATED F-BOX1 (KUF1), a transcriptional marker of KAR signaling, cause phenotypes that are consistent with hyperactive KAI2 signaling and also cause hypersensitive responses to KAR1, but not other KAI2 agonists. KUF1 may act in a proteolysis-dependent negative feedback loop that regulates KL biosynthesis and KAR1 metabolism. This hypothesis will be tested by examining how KUF1 influences KAR1-induced degradation of the KAI2 target SMAX1; growth responses of a KAR-specific, KL-insensitive Arabidopsis transgenic line; and the rates of KAR1 disappearance from pulse-treated plants. To determine how KUF1 functions and is regulated, a complementary series of biochemical and genetic experiments will be performed. The primary objectives are to identify proteins that are targeted by KUF1 for polyubiquitylation and degradation, as well as define the components and dynamics of the KUF1 protein complex. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid screens will be primary approaches to identify a set of potential KUF1 interactors that will be validated by biochemical assays in mammalian cells and plants. Genes encoding candidate interactors will be investigated through a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9-mediated reverse genetic screen to identify kuf1 suppressors and modulators of KAI2-dependent signaling activity. Putative KUF1 targets will be tested for KUF1-dependent polyubiquitylation and degradation in plants. <br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It supports theoretical and computational research, computational tool development, and education in support of the prediction of new materials and their properties by computer simulation. Materials scientists can model the ""building blocks"" of new materials, from atoms to molecules to nanoparticles, and solve those models on fast computers. Although much work is still needed to improve the fidelity of models with additional physics, inform the models with measurements from experiments, and develop faster algorithms on modern architectures to solve these models, the paradigm of predictive materials simulation is well in hand.  Predictive materials simulation can be thought of as a ""forward-type"" simulation, where one essentially runs computer experiments from initial conditions for a given system and observes the result. <br/><br/>Materials scientists are now at the threshold of a paradigm shift in materials simulation, where it is becoming feasible to design for materials structure and properties, rather than simply predicting them based on physical models. This use of molecular simulation for the ""inverse problem"" approach to design materials - that is, the determination of attributes of building blocks such that those building blocks will self-assemble into materials with specific structural, optical, mechanical, thermodynamic or other properties - would represent a major leap forward.<br/><br/>Moving into an era of inverse materials design requires new computational tools capable of performing simulations that flip the usual forward-type simulations on their head. These tools must be scientifically valid, robust, accessible and easy to use, and should exploit the fastest available hardware. This project will develop computational tools, share them broadly with an existing and rapidly growing user base, and apply them to the important problems of nanoparticle self-assembly and colloidal crystallization. The new tools will run efficiently on laptops, desktops, and even massive GPU (graphics processing units) supercomputers, thereby serving multiple user types. The approaches and tools developed under this award are transferable and will be of immediate and even broader interest to the materials, engineering, and chemistry communities interested in inverse design.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical and computational research, computational tool development, and education in support of the prediction of new materials and their properties by computer simulation. Missing in today's computational materials research ecosystem is inverse-type predictive software; that is, software that enables materials design starting from desired properties. In ""inverse problem"" simulations for design, a target materials property, behavior, and/or structure, is specified and the building blocks and thermodynamic conditions that will achieve that target are predicted. Inverse design methods may still require molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, or other workhorse algorithms, but the entire conceptual approach is flipped on its head. <br/>The PI and her group recently developed an inverse design algorithm called ""digital alchemy.""  The algorithm is grounded rigorously in statistical thermodynamics, and is based on the idea of generalized thermodynamic ensembles. They have developed a way to simulate materials in an ""alchemical ensemble,"" where particle attributes like shape or interparticle interactions are treated as thermodynamic variables, and change during the course of the simulation, sampling many millions of possibilities in minutes.  In these simulations, a target structure is defined, and the simulation finds the optimal set of building block attributes that will self-assemble the target structure. They have applied digital alchemy to the design of nanoparticle and colloidal particle shapes for target, one-component colloidal crystal structures, including some very complex ones.<br/>Under this project, the PI will fully develop digital alchemy into a method that can treat other, experimentally relevant particle attributes and implement the method into the publicly available, open source, particle simulation toolkit, HOOMD-blue. HOOMD-blue will be able to ""discover"" building block attributes and thermodynamic conditions optimized for a target structure, target properties, and/or target behavior.  The research team will demonstrate the use of this new inverse design capability of HOOMD-blue to design multicomponent colloidal crystals, colloidal crystals of patchy particles, and reconfigurable colloidal crystals. <br/>The overarching goals of this project are to provide open-source software capable of inverse materials design to the materials community, and demonstrate the power and possibilities of GPU-enabled inverse design simulations via several scientific use cases relevant to nanoparticle self-assembly and colloidal crystallization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cardiovascular system is essential for the distribution of oxygen and metabolic fuels to active tissues. In some developing vertebrates, including humans, the function of the immature cardiovascular system can be negatively affected by environmental challenges such as low oxygen, and these changes can adversely affect the health of the adult. By contrast, species that naturally experience low oxygen during development, such as alligators, can benefit later in life from the changes to the cardiovascular system resulting from developmental hypoxia. Cardiovascular function will be assessed in two-year-old juvenile American alligators that were exposed to hypoxia as embryos, under active conditions (while exercising and after feeding). An integrative assessment will be conducted from the level of individual proteins to that of the whole animal. The broader impacts of the project include a significant number of opportunities for training students at multiple education levels in skills relevant to biomedical research, which will have a direct impact on the future work force, and training and practice in communicating science to the public. <br/><br/>Developmental plasticity is a phenomenon that enables multiple environmentally mediated phenotypes to be generated from a single genotype. This plasticity, which is present in all multicellular taxa, can result in beneficial or adaptive changes that enhance function during juvenile and adult life. Hypoxia is an ecologically relevant environmental condition that, if encountered during embryonic life when organ systems are developing, can result in altered juvenile phenotypes that can impact organismal performance and affect animal fitness. Despite the important role hypoxia plays in causing phenotypic change, fundamental questions remain regarding the long-term effects of developmental hypoxia in vertebrates. This project investigates the impact of hypoxia experienced during a critical period of development on cardiovascular function of juvenile alligators at multiple levels of biological organization: from whole-animal performance, to functional studies of the cardiovascular system, to the organ, cellular, protein, and gene levels of organization. Alligators will be studied because they can naturally experience hypoxia during development and as adults. This approach will establish links between molecular and cellular traits, including changes in expression of genes involved in calcium dynamics and in cardiomyocyte contractility that underpin differences in cardiac output at the whole organism level. This multi-level approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of how embryonic hypoxia impacts cardiovascular function, with applicability to other vertebrate systems. The research findings will provide basic information that will be needed to make informed animal management decisions in the era of global climate change, and could lead to future treatment options for cardiovascular disease states.

Iron and aluminum are abundant and widely distributed, but major deposits of many other critically important metals are scarce, so these must be obtained by international trade. The southern third of the African continent is unusually rich in the rarer metals. It has the world's largest reserves of platinum, cobalt, copper and manganese, and has historically produced more gold than any other region.  Mining and metallurgy now account for a major proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most nations in central and southern Africa, but few know that mining in this region began long ago.  Iron and copper have been mined and smelted here since at least 200 AD, and gold since at least 1200 AD.  Copper objects are often found in archaeological sites far from any potential source of copper. Few citizens of southern and central African are aware of the extent of precolonial mining, or of trade in copper in this region.  The anticipated results of this project on ancient copper mining and trade will likely be widely covered in African print and electronic news media, and will be incorporated into educational materials for African schools and universities. <br/><br/>The research funded by this award will study the circulation of copper within southern Africa between 200 CE to about 1700 CE. Dr. David Killick and graduate student Jay Stephens will collaborate with archaeologists in southern Africa, and with geochemists at the University of Arizona, to reconstruct long-distance movements of copper in prehistoric times by matching the lead isotope ratios of copper objects to those from ore deposits throughout the region.  This research will provide a novel way to study some key issues in the archaeology of southern Africa.  These include: tracing the routes taken by the earliest metal-using peoples (the Bantu migration) into South Africa; establishing when mining of specific copper deposits began; documenting trade links between the major prehistoric states in the region; and providing a new way to look at the changes that occurred in these trading systems after Europeans settled in the region, from the early sixteenth century.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these versatile materials have enabled population expansion and globalization, a new need has arisen: the capability to make high-volume plastics with the functional properties needed for next-generation challenges while simultaneously incorporating sustainability into the material design. To tackle this challenge, the research team of Professor Leibfarth of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill develops synthetic methods to enable the precise control of the polymer structure and the use of building blocks from biorenewable resources. Accomplishing the goals enumerated in this project will make significant contributions to the scientific community and the broader population, both in contributing new fundamental knowledge and in introducing novel material solutions for contemporary societal challenges. This fundamental research in polymer chemistry couples with an education program that develops inquiry-guided scientific activities to educate and bring the joy of discovery to children undergoing long-term hospitalization. This underserved group ranges in age from K-12. These patients/students not get the same interactive scientific experiences as their peers. Professor Leibfarth and his group create structured modules that introduce inpatients to contemporary aspects of polymer science through an interactive mix of hands-on and multimedia activities. Six scalable modules that can be implemented across a range of hospital settings are available at UNC Children's Hospital and will impact 50+ patients per year. Detailed instructions and multimedia resources are publicly available online.  In addition, graduate students receive formal training in interacting with diverse patient populations and communicating science with the public, building a sustainable group culture that values the importance of diversity and outreach.<br/><br/>The tacticity (stereochemistry) of vinyl polymers is intimately linked to their resultant material properties. Despite the well-developed stereoselective methods for the polymerization of propylene and other nonpolar alpha-olefins, stereoselective polymerization of polar vinyl monomers has proven more challenging.  The Leibfarth group has recently developed catalysts that systematically bias the chain-end stereochemical environment during cationic polymerization and enable the synthesis of isotactic poly(vinylether)s with unprecedented isotacticities.  With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, the Leibfarth group seeks to gain a deeper fundamental understanding of this polymerization method.  The first objective of this project is to examine the influence of monomer sterics and chirality on reaction performance in order to understand the interactions that enable the catalyst to direct stereoselective polymerization of these monomers. The second objective seeks to expand the diversity of chemical functionality amenable to stereoselective polymerization and explore strategies (e.g., continuous flow methods) to control the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymers. The third objective leverages the fundamental understanding gained throughout the project to develop a new class of biorenewable vinyl ether monomers that are amenable to stereoselective polymerization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cardiovascular system is essential for the distribution of oxygen and metabolic fuels to active tissues. In some developing vertebrates, including humans, the function of the immature cardiovascular system can be negatively affected by environmental challenges such as low oxygen, and these changes can adversely affect the health of the adult. By contrast, species that naturally experience low oxygen during development, such as alligators, can benefit later in life from the changes to the cardiovascular system resulting from developmental hypoxia. Cardiovascular function will be assessed in two-year-old juvenile American alligators that were exposed to hypoxia as embryos, under active conditions (while exercising and after feeding). An integrative assessment will be conducted from the level of individual proteins to that of the whole animal. The broader impacts of the project include a significant number of opportunities for training students at multiple education levels in skills relevant to biomedical research, which will have a direct impact on the future work force, and training and practice in communicating science to the public. <br/><br/>Developmental plasticity is a phenomenon that enables multiple environmentally mediated phenotypes to be generated from a single genotype. This plasticity, which is present in all multicellular taxa, can result in beneficial or adaptive changes that enhance function during juvenile and adult life. Hypoxia is an ecologically relevant environmental condition that, if encountered during embryonic life when organ systems are developing, can result in altered juvenile phenotypes that can impact organismal performance and affect animal fitness. Despite the important role hypoxia plays in causing phenotypic change, fundamental questions remain regarding the long-term effects of developmental hypoxia in vertebrates. This project investigates the impact of hypoxia experienced during a critical period of development on cardiovascular function of juvenile alligators at multiple levels of biological organization: from whole-animal performance, to functional studies of the cardiovascular system, to the organ, cellular, protein, and gene levels of organization. Alligators will be studied because they can naturally experience hypoxia during development and as adults. This approach will establish links between molecular and cellular traits, including changes in expression of genes involved in calcium dynamics and in cardiomyocyte contractility that underpin differences in cardiac output at the whole organism level. This multi-level approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of how embryonic hypoxia impacts cardiovascular function, with applicability to other vertebrate systems. The research findings will provide basic information that will be needed to make informed animal management decisions in the era of global climate change, and could lead to future treatment options for cardiovascular disease states. The project involves research training of graduate students and undergraduate students recruited from groups under-represented in science, as well as outreach to K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite nearly a century of research on the mechanics of thin structures, questions remain about simple reduced models commonly employed to describe bending and stretching of these bodies in response to pressure or other applied forces.  Superficially similar shell models make qualitatively different predictions, such as whether a bent shell will expand or contract under the same conditions.  Existing strip models fail to capture experimentally observed shape changes during manipulations. This work will both explain these issues and develop new simple models that will agree with experiments and be useful in a variety of settings, including the design of new flexible and reconfigurable devices, and origami and kirigami structures for engineering applications.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained as part of this project.  The PI and students will develop related laboratory demonstrations and a module for a summer science program for young women in high school.  Public outreach efforts will exploit the connections between thin structure mechanics and the behavior of toys such as snap bracelets.<br/> <br/>This work has two parts.  First, an elastic theory will be developed based on systematic expansions in stretch.  When applied to shells, this theory will preserve simple relationships between stress and generalized strain and provide the simplest definitions of bending energies.  Second, a uniformly valid theory of elastic curves will be developed that interpolates between rod and inextensible wide strip models.  This theory will capture bifurcation phenomena of narrow strips and allow numerical integration of strip deformations that create inflection points.  More broadly, the work will relate direct and dimensional reduction approaches to thin structures.  The new shell theory will be compared with theoretical and numerical results on soft shells from the literature, and the new strip theory will be validated using prior experimental results on bifurcations from the PI?s prior work and the literature.  The issues to be addressed in this work are relevant to research areas such as the incompatible elasticity of soft and other materials, design of programmable elastomeric and structured sheets, and instabilities and bifurcations of flexible components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As are most states, California is experiencing critical shortages of qualified mathematics teachers and these shortages disproportionately affect high-poverty and high-minority schools. This project will develop and implement an intensive outreach program to recruit 44 undergraduate mathematics majors with the expertise, interest, and passion to teach.  These students will receive scholarships and other supports to help them become highly effective mathematics teachers for high-need schools throughout the San Joaquin Valley. The Scholars will: 1) participate in seminars that will help prepare them to meet the diverse needs of students; 2) engage in high impact research experiences to develop their knowledge about teaching mathematics;  and 3) participate in carefully structured early field experiences in high-need schools. By tapping talent throughout the Valley's high schools and community colleges, this project will produce mathematics teachers who reflect the demographics of the region.  <br/> <br/>Over its five-year duration, the project aims to prepare 44 new mathematics teachers for high-need schools. The project activities include a bi-weekly seminar series in which Scholars will meet with master teachers and education researchers to learn about best teaching practices for their future classrooms. It will also provide scholarships and a high impact support system to facilitate the success of undergraduate mathematics majors in a rigorous, newly-designed four-year Single Subject Teaching Credential program at California State University, Fresno. The new, innovative program will allow students to graduate in four years rather than following the state's widespread fifth-year post-baccalaureate pathway to a teaching credential. The project will also deliver single subject, content-focused mentoring, an evidence-based approach that may help novice teachers guide student understanding of what it means to authentically engage in mathematics. The project will support a partnership with three high-need school districts (Fresno, Clovis, and Sanger) and the Education Futures Project, a collaborative of 14 local community colleges through the Valley.  These partners will collaborate on outreach activities and new teacher mentoring of new teachers. The project will disseminate findings throughout the California State University system, for potential adaptation of the teacher education model at other California State University campuses. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Light is one of the most appealing stimuli because it can be delivered remotely with precise control over space, time, intensity, and color. The research group of Professor Julia Kalow at Northwestern University studies how light can be used to control the formation and breakage of reversible chemical bonds in polymers. When these photoswitchable chemical bonds are used to link polymer strands, the resulting polymer networks exhibit reversibly-controlled changes in properties, such as stiffness and adaptability. The novel materials and insights from this research help to create the next generation of high-performance, re-processable polymers. Additionally, the polymer materials may mimic tissue mechanics, acting as user-controlled matrixes to study biological processes like muscle contraction and to build synthetic organs. The broader impacts expand the exposure of students with visual impairment to STEM.  The educational program develops assistive technologies for visually impaired students and their teachers.  Students with visual impairment are often left out of traditional outreach activities and laboratory experiences. Professor Kalow's team works to fully include these students in STEM as the newly created polymer materials are used to create assistive tactile displays.<br/><br/>With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, the Kalow group prepares new photoswitches and elucidates how control is translated from the molecular to macroscopic level.  This fundamental research combines physical organic techniques, synthesis, and mechanical characterization to study three distinct mechanisms for photoswitching dynamic covalent crosslinkers: crosslink stability, crosslink exchange rate, and crosslink topology.  The research aims to marry photoswitch conformation and dynamic covalent bonds to achieve dramatic and reversible physical changes in soft materials.  The expected outcomes of the research are the development of new photoswitches containing dynamic covalent bonds, improvement in the reversibly photocontrolled gels, elastomers, and vitrimers, and increased fundamental insight into the relationship between molecular reactivity and viscoelasticity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Depending on a variety of factors such as temperature, pressure and stressing rate a rock can either fail abruptly in an earthquake or deform slowly by creep. Experimental rock deformation studies provide fundamental insights into the processes that accommodate plate tectonic movement at different depths in the Earth and quantify the strength and stability of tectonic plates. Development of new capabilities open new horizons for experimental geophysics and provide tools for studying many poorly understood phenomena such as intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes as well as non-impulsive slow-slip events, low frequency earthquakes and non-volcanic tremor in the laboratory at relevant pressure and temperature conditions. <br/><br/>The aim of this proposal is to develop and integrate a multi-channel ultrasound recording system into an existing state-of-the-art solid medium rock deformation apparatus. The apparatus is capable of deforming large volume samples (~380 cubic mm) at pressures of up to 2.5 GPa and temperatures of up to ~1400 degrees C and is specifically designed to allow for the integration of an ultrasound recording system. It is planned to use several miniature needle piezoelectric sensors in the frequency range of 1 - 10 MHz to monitor the sample. Triggered acoustic emission data will be recorded at sampling speeds of up to 50 Ms/s per channel and continuous data will be recorded at sampling speeds of up to 10 Ms/s. A high-energy pulser will be synchronized with the recording system and will generate known pulses that will travel through the deforming sample and will be used to characterize the microstructural evolution in-situ. The investigator will be able to locate acoustic emissions within the sample volume and measure the evolution of p-wave velocities. These data will give us fundamental new insights into a number of natural phenomena ranging from seismicity, influence of stress and strain on metamorphic reactions, to the influence of stress on melt alignment and acoustic wave propagation to name just a few possible applications. The PecLab, where the apparatus will be installed, is part of a Collaborative Organization for Rock Deformation (CORD) which was formed between MIT and Brown University. The goal of CORD is to encourage and facilitate participation in experimental rock deformation studies by a broader spectrum of scientists within the Earth science community.

Grenning at the University of Florida. His group is streamlining how bioactive terpenoid natural products, organic molecules commonly derived from plants with important biological activity, are prepared in the laboratory. There are several reasons why this modern challenge needs to be addressed: first, nature often only produces minute quantities of natural products and significant amounts of the chemical are needed for study and use in society. From a given natural product, a limited set of similar compounds can be prepared via what chemists call ""semi-synthesis"". Semi-synthesis refers to specific limited changes to a natural product. When performing studies designed to understand the way these molecules interact with biological systems, access to a variety of similar compounds is crucial for understanding and improving the reactivity of the parent molecule. Second, the laboratory synthesis of highly complex molecules (""total synthesis"") forming large quantities in efficient  ways is inherently challenging. Although targeted for decades, there are few general strategies to make the complex terpene molecules. The Grenning lab is studying the laboratory terpene synthesis to better understand the function of this molecule in the body and to enable the advanced manufacturing of the best molecules in large quantities. Educational aspects of this project are aimed at informing the public about the natural products. The Grenning lab is designing freely available ""infographics"" on terpenes for distribution to the general public. The Grenning lab is also organizing events and conferences ranging from the ""Chemathon,"" a day-long celebration of chemistry for high-school students, to the ""Florida Heterocyclic and Synthetic Conference (FloHet),"" a specialized international meeting that gathers synthetic organic chemistry leaders to disseminate their research findings. Additional benefits include the recruitment of underrepresented groups, both at the undergraduate and graduate student level, for participation in the projects outlined in this CAREER Award.<br/><br/>The Grenning lab is focusing on the synthesis of polycycloalkane natural products bearing tricyclic motifs. This is a common terpenoid architecture that is difficult to access due to its inherent structural complexity. Ketones, malonic acids, and allylic electrophiles serve as starting materials and through an operationally simple and generalized reaction sequences consisting of deconjugative allylations, sigmatropic rearrangements, and ring-closing metathesis, a variety of ""terpene scaffolds"" are accessible. These terpene scaffolds then serve as platforms for reaction development aimed at preparing terpenoid targets and target-analogs. Select molecules are subject to biological evaluation to validate our chemical advancements. The molecules targeted include the tigliane, daphnane and rhamnofolane families of natural products and their analogs. Broader Impacts include the increased interaction with Santa Fe Community College. By educating the local community on organic chemistry and natural products, Professor Grenning and his group create a dialogue and inspire students to consider careers in chemistry. The team also designs terpenoid infographics and organizes events and conferences for educating students and disseminating results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this study is to determine how plants sense a class of chemicals found in smoke known as karrikins. Karrikins influence important agronomic traits such as germination, seedling growth, and stress tolerance. Several genes that are involved in karrikin perception and response have been found, but accumulating evidence suggests that karrikins must be converted into active signals within plants before they can be recognized. This project will identify genes that carry out the activation of karrikins. It is likely that these same genes are involved in production of an unknown plant hormone that karrikins mimic. Discovery of these genes will be a significant steppingstone to understanding how plants grow after fires, as well as to finding a novel class of plant growth regulators that may offer new opportunities for agricultural improvement. This project uses cutting-edge techniques for identifying members of protein complexes that may regulate karrikin metabolism, and then tests candidate genes with a high-throughput gene-editing approach. This project will enhance the U.S. scientific workforce by providing training for one postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and over 150 undergraduates, many of whom will be underrepresented minorities, from low-income families, and/or first-generation college students. Monthly public outreach events that teach the local community about plant science and STEM disciplines will be held. Discoveries from this project will be communicated to the public through publications, press releases, and social media.<br/><br/>KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) is the putative receptor in plants for karrikins (KARs) and an as-yet-unknown endogenous KAI2 ligand (KL). However, recent observations suggest that KAI2 does not recognize KARs directly and that KARs must first be metabolized into a bioactive signal. Mutations in KARRIKIN UPREGULATED F-BOX1 (KUF1), a transcriptional marker of KAR signaling, cause phenotypes that are consistent with hyperactive KAI2 signaling and also cause hypersensitive responses to KAR1, but not other KAI2 agonists. KUF1 may act in a proteolysis-dependent negative feedback loop that regulates KL biosynthesis and KAR1 metabolism. This hypothesis will be tested by examining how KUF1 influences KAR1-induced degradation of the KAI2 target SMAX1; growth responses of a KAR-specific, KL-insensitive Arabidopsis transgenic line; and the rates of KAR1 disappearance from pulse-treated plants. To determine how KUF1 functions and is regulated, a complementary series of biochemical and genetic experiments will be performed. The primary objectives are to identify proteins that are targeted by KUF1 for polyubiquitylation and degradation, as well as define the components and dynamics of the KUF1 protein complex. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid screens will be primary approaches to identify a set of potential KUF1 interactors that will be validated by biochemical assays in mammalian cells and plants. Genes encoding candidate interactors will be investigated through a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9-mediated reverse genetic screen to identify kuf1 suppressors and modulators of KAI2-dependent signaling activity. Putative KUF1 targets will be tested for KUF1-dependent polyubiquitylation and degradation in plants. <br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Mingjiang Zhong of Yale University develops a novel approach to synthesizing polymers with well-defined and desirable branching structures.  The fundamental discoveries may have a broader technological impact on next-generation applications, including matrices for cellular and tissue engineering (human health), membrane materials for water treatment (environmental sustainability), and photolithography (semiconductor industry).

The cardiovascular system is essential for the distribution of oxygen and metabolic fuels to active tissues. In some developing vertebrates, including humans, the function of the immature cardiovascular system can be negatively affected by environmental challenges such as low oxygen, and these changes can adversely affect the health of the adult. By contrast, species that naturally experience low oxygen during development, such as alligators, can benefit later in life from the changes to the cardiovascular system resulting from developmental hypoxia. Cardiovascular function will be assessed in two-year-old juvenile American alligators that were exposed to hypoxia as embryos, under active conditions (while exercising and after feeding). An integrative assessment will be conducted from the level of individual proteins to that of the whole animal. The broader impacts of the project include a significant number of opportunities for training students at multiple education levels in skills relevant to biomedical research, which will have a direct impact on the future work force, and training and practice in communicating science to the public. <br/><br/>Developmental plasticity is a phenomenon that enables multiple environmentally mediated phenotypes to be generated from a single genotype. This plasticity, which is present in all multicellular taxa, can result in beneficial or adaptive changes that enhance function during juvenile and adult life. Hypoxia is an ecologically relevant environmental condition that, if encountered during embryonic life when organ systems are developing, can result in altered juvenile phenotypes that can impact organismal performance and affect animal fitness. Despite the important role hypoxia plays in causing phenotypic change, fundamental questions remain regarding the long-term effects of developmental hypoxia in vertebrates. This project investigates the impact of hypoxia experienced during a critical period of development on cardiovascular function of juvenile alligators at multiple levels of biological organization: from whole-animal performance, to functional studies of the cardiovascular system, to the organ, cellular, protein, and gene levels of organization. Alligators will be studied because they can naturally experience hypoxia during development and as adults. This approach will establish links between molecular and cellular traits, including changes in expression of genes involved in calcium dynamics and in cardiomyocyte contractility that underpin differences in cardiac output at the whole organism level. This multi-level approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of how embryonic hypoxia impacts cardiovascular function, with applicability to other vertebrate systems. The research findings will provide basic information that will be needed to make informed animal management decisions in the era of global climate change, and could lead to future treatment options for cardiovascular disease states.

By varying the monomer's chemical structure, chemists can create polymers that absorb light, fluoresce, and conduct electricity, making them useful for cell phone displays, solar photovoltaics, and even in medical imaging.    Despite these advantages, polymers degrade upon exposure to oxygen and light, and their fluorescence decreases when the chains pack together to form the films used in devices. With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism A and Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Programs in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Linda Peteanu of Carnegie-Mellon University is addressing these challenges.  Working with her students, she is using a wide array of spectroscopic tools to understand why polymer chains degrade less when placed onto metal films, as well as why their fluorescence is reduced when the chains pack together.  The team's discoveries are helping chemists to create improved polymers for consumer electronics applications, which could have significant societal broader impact.  The educational broader impacts lie in the training of students with expertise in optics and novel imaging methods.  In addition, outreach to K-12 students and to the public demonstrate how light interacts with matter.

From a fundamental perspective, extended or electronically-delocalized structures, such as these polymers and their aggregates, are of interest because their electronic properties lie in the gap between those of small molecules and extended solids.  The goals of this project are two-fold.  The first is to perform a comprehensive investigation utilizing a variety of spectroscopic and imaging tools, molecular modeling, and synthetic modification to understand how the emission spectra, dynamics and yields are controlled by ground-state conformation and by the rates and efficiencies of intersystem crossing and internal conversion.  The second is to explore the effects of two local environmental perturbations, solvent polarity and plasmonic field effects, on the fluorescence yield and the rates and efficiencies of singlet-triplet relaxation, energy transfer and charge separation.  These data may yield a better understanding of how the structure, morphology, and local environment of this important class of materials can be optimized for existing and novel applications that require high emissivity and efficient charge transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disrupting replay causes memory deficits, but it remains unclear why. Early theories of replay function suggested that replay should recapitulate previous experience as accurately as possible, but recent work has shown that replay content is much more diverse -- including, for instance, spatial paths to a goal, paths not taken, and never-experienced paths. The proposed work investigates what factors determine the content of replay, and what function(s) replay serves. The content of replay is measured under various conditions, and the consequences of disrupting its effects on a target brain region tested. This work will provide new insights into the mystery of how the brain organizes experience to build knowledge structures and then draws upon that knowledge to support adaptive behavior. Accessing replay content, and many other questions in systems neuroscience, rely crucially on statistics and computational models, which are barriers to entry for many otherwise talented young neuroscientists. This project provides a multi-pronged training environment for quantitative skills in neuroscience, with activities ranging from short, visually driven introductory workshops aimed at demystifying terminology, to fully immersive research experiences at summer schools and in the laboratory. The project plans include making all materials, including videos and hands-on tutorials working with real neural data, publicly available online.<br/><br/>Prominent theories of hippocampal replay posit that specific factors such as experience, surprise/uncertainty, and economic value determine what is replayed. However, the effects of manipulating these factors have rarely been tested with controlled, parametric experimental designs. Similarly, the suspicion that replay content should differ depending on whether a task actually requires the hippocampus or not remains untested. The proposed work addresses these issues through the recording and decoding of hippocampal replay content on tightly controlled tasks that manipulate these factors while holding the others constant. Complementing these classic proposals about replay are new ideas derived from reinforcement learning models, which suggest that replay serves to update state and/or action values following errors in the prediction of reward. This idea is tested by optogenetically inhibiting neural activity in the ventral striatum, a structure important for reward learning, specifically during hippocampal replay events, and observing the effects on behavior and on replay content. Supporting these experimental aims are two methodological aims that seek to improve rigor and reproducibility of replay analysis: (1) construction of open data analysis pipelines that follow best practices in software engineering such as unit testing, and (2) development of models that generate synthetic replay events so that the outcomes of different analysis approaches can be tested against a known ground truth. Together, this work provides strong tests of the leading proposals regarding the content and function of hippocampal replay.

Weak interactions are used to assemble larger molecules, frameworks and scaffolds.  For example, DNA strands are held together by hydrogen bonds to form a double-stranded structure (double helix).  These hydrogen bonds can be broken relatively easily to allow separation of the strands when single-stranded DNA is needed for cell replication and protein synthesis.  Hydrogen bonds are well studied and widely used not only in nature but also for controlling the assembly and properties of man-made materials.  With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, the research group of Professor Cozzolino at Texas Tech University studies weak interactions that lead to larger assemblies of molecules and explores their potential applications. Possible applications range from molecular sensing to crystal engineering, self-assembly of large polymers and gels to solar cells and liquid crystals - all of which are beneficial to society and the economy.

The research plan takes advantage of the unique ability of these pnictogens to support up to three interactions at three well-defined sigma-holes.  By examining the influence of the pnictogen element, the polarity of the primary bond, the symmetry of the supporting ligand, bond angles, and steric factors on the secondary interactions, this project develops/refines a set of rules for designing supramolecular systems (e.g., inverted bilayer membranes and vesicles) that exploit pnictogen bonding.  The second objective of the resesarch is to design and study pnictogen compounds that self-assemble through heteromolecular recognition events that are analogous to the self-assembly of Watson-Crick base pairs.

Although these two hormones often antagonize the actions of each other, ethylene generally being considered a hormone that promotes aging of plant tissues while cytokinin promotes greening, these same two hormones sometimes act in a cooperative manner. The goal of this project is to uncover how these two hormones interact in the regulation of plant growth and development. A better understanding of plant hormone signaling will enable optimization of crops to improve their performance in various agricultural settings.

The focus of the research is on the EIN3 and type-B ARR families of transcription factors that regulate the primary transcriptional responses to ethylene and cytokinin, respectively. The first objective is to characterize the role of combinatorial interactions between EIN3 and the type-B ARR transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression, initial results supporting both cooperative and antagonistic interactions. The second objective of this project is to characterize the role that physical interactions between EIN3 and the type-A ARRs, a family of negative regulators whose expression is strongly induced by cytokinin, play in modulating the activity of EIN3 and ethylene signaling. The third objective is to characterize the role that ethylene plays in activating the type-B ARRs independently of their activation by the cytokinin signaling pathway, this serving as an alternative pathway by which to regulate a subset of the ethylene responses. These studies will incorporate global analyses of gene expression and target binding by the transcription factors, using RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. Models for interaction derived from these studies will be tested by mechanistic, transcriptomic, and genetic approaches, and placed within the context of the roles of ethylene and cytokinin in seedling growth.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary goal is to engage a diverse cohort of REU students in a variety of experiences, both in and out of the laboratory, that will nurture creativity, communication and other important skills for the 21st Century workforce. Emphasizing innovative thinking in particular is essential since the future competitiveness of the U.S. in the global economy depends on innovators to create products and processes of value to society. REU students will grow as researchers by engaging in team-based learning on projects focused on porous materials, which have a wide-variety of biomedical and chemical applications. With a host of variables that can be altered and tested, this field of research is ideal for tinkering and ripe for discovery and innovation. Training activities will also help students build a solid understanding of size and scale, two concepts that tend to be under-developed but essential for scientific literacy and discovery. <br/><br/>During the 10-week summer program, this REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in research on topics relating to porous materials that range from fundamental to applied. For example, participants will be immersed in how to design stable delivery systems for vaccines, adsorbents for chemical separations, nanofiber scaffolds for tissue engineering, and catalysts for hydrogen generation and biomass conversion.  In addition, students will gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art biophysical and analytical techniques for characterizing porous materials and how these materials interact with other molecules. The REU students? will be supported in the laboratory by specially trained faculty and graduate student mentors. The students will also engage in tours of nearby companies, boredom-busting unseminars, interactive workshops, social mixers and team-building activities. The extensive partnerships with nine companies and an art museum, as well as active-learning classrooms and high-tech labs make this REU Site uniquely positioned to create a successful and inclusive learning experience for all students. Furthermore, synergistic benefits will arise from partnering with a KU Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site, leading to broader impacts for high school level educators and students.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These 'premies' require weeks or months of care in specialized hospital units (e.g. NICU). In the United States, a typical NICU stay costs about $80K, and the total cost of healthcare during the first year of life is about $16B annually. These babies are at elevated risk for a range of serious lifelong complications that economically burden society by over $30B. This project has the potential to make a substantial impact to one of the most core vital elements of neonatal growth and development by improving the baby's sleep-wake-feed cycle. Today that cycle is irregular, episodic and disrupted almost 80% of the time which prolongs hospitalization. If successful, this project and technology would provide clinicians with a new tool and approach to help babies establish regularity, build up more energy and take on more calories so they can be discharged 20% faster. More importantly, this technology could lower the rate of downstream neuro developmental complications which are linked directly to poor sleep patterns.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a simple miniature wearable patch and display system that clinicians can use to monitor neonatal sleep and development patterns. This new tool will help clinicians achieve their goals of improving sleep-wake-feed cycles. In Phase I the team developed a prototype sensor configured to work on tiny babies and demonstrated that it could be used to accurately measure sleep cycles. In Phase II, the main objective is to advance the design and performance of this instrument to enable routine reliable use. It should be simple and non-intrusive for any clinician to reliably position the sensor and monitor any baby for multi-day periods. Analysis data should be presented real-time in an easy-to-interpret and actionable format. The work includes further biomedical engineering to improve attachment, amplifier circuit modelling to widen dynamic range and signal processing to automate artifact handling. The team will develop and test machine learning routines that will display detailed accurate and reliable instantaneous and trend data of brainstem-based sleep patterns that are not available today. These new advances, built on novel brainstem biomeasures will open up broad adoption supporting the development of a business and substantial medical advances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By gaining a deeper understanding of how, where, and why plumes form, and their composition and their relationship to the deep interior's large low shear wave velocity structures (LLSVPs) under Africa and the Pacific, the PIs will make a significant step towards understanding the dynamical and geochemical evolution of the mantle. Their efforts should provide a basis to better understand the three-dimensional flow structure surrounding LLSVPs and where, how, and why plumes form. This may help answer the question: How is the relationship between plumes and LLSVPs reflected in hotspot lavas such as those found in Hawaii? The new research directions will enrich cross-fertilization between the fields of mantle dynamics and geochemistry and contribute to the growing body of work on mantle plumes and LLSVPs. The PIs are engaged in a number of activities aimed at education and training at all levels. The PIs have and will continue to engage undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups in their research activities. As part of this proposal the PIs aim to augment the content associated with related Wikipedia entries and develop a series of educational films to post on specifically dedicated YouTube channels. The lab lends itself to site visits by elementary, middle school and high school students. PI Lithgow-Bertelloni intends to continue providing lab tours and opportunities for elementary and middle-school children to be involved in simple experiments.<br/><br/>Amongst the most enigmatic aspects of the Earth's deep interior are the anomalous large low shear wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) under Africa and the Pacific. The origin, composition, and dynamics of these provinces remain controversial. For example, it has been suggested that plumes predominantly form at the edges of LLSVPs and that entrained material from LLSVPs explains the distinct chemical asymmetries found at certain hotspots. The PIs are proposing an experimental fluid dynamical study to explore how three proposed LLSVP structures control and interact with mantle plumes. These three structures represent the range of LLSVP formation hypotheses so far proposed: a) purely thermal; b) dense and deformable; c) undeformable and uncoupled. They will use state-of-the-art visualization tools, including scanning particle image velocimetry and thermometry to measure the three-dimensional temperature and flow fields, laser induced fluorescence, and Lagrangian analysis tools to locate plumes and quantify entrainment to very high spatial and temporal resolutions.

The PI will combine insights obtained from the recent discovery of new materials and the idea of simulating extra dimensions, whereby a periodically driven system appears to have an extra spatial dimension for each periodic drive it is subject to. For example, using these two ideas, one can take a microscopic magnet, illuminate it with two modulated light beams, and turn it into an energy pump which draws energy from one beam and gives it in full to another. The PI aims to show how this principle could be implemented into solid-state devices based on newly discovered semiconductors.<br/> <br/>In addition, the PI will develop a microscopic theory for a new type of phase transition, the many-body localization transition, which occurs when a system of quantum particles, such as electrons, stops obeying the common rules of thermodynamics due to the presence of sufficient disorder. <br/><br/>Graduate students and postdocs will participate in the research and will receive training and education in a subject of high national priority. The PI will also conclude the writing of a textbook on how to model a variety of technologies and natural phenomena using fundamentals known to any physics undergraduate.

Quantum dynamics is among the most challenging fields in condensed matter. Experiments can now observe the dynamics of electrons, atoms, and light in a variety of environments. The theory of quantum control needs to harness these developments. Topological physics on the one hand, and disorder leading to many-body localization on the other, present parallel themes that enrich quantum many-body dynamics.<br/><br/>The project will explore new tools for controlling electromagnetic radiation that are based on topological physics. The PI will study how these topological control tools behave when realized in interacting light-matter systems. This will require developing a comprehensive theory for multi-driven many-body quantum optics and solid-state electronic systems. The emerging theory will predict the electronic response of complex materials to strong external drives in the presence of electronic relaxation and many-body interactions. In the second part of the work, the PI will derive a new method for analyzing disordered and interacting many-body quantum systems through study of the many-body localization transition. The method envisioned combines unitary flow methods with strong-disorder renormalization group approaches and will not be restricted by the nature or the range of the interactions. It has the potential to lead to the discovery of fundamentally new universality classes.<br/><br/>Beyond education and training of graduate students and postdocs, the work could pave the way to new photonic devices based on topological principles. Potential technological impacts include new tools for controlling low THz electromagnetic radiation for which only few control tools are available. In addition, the PI will complete a book addressed to all physics enthusiasts describing an analysis of real-world physics problems, natural phenomena, and technological breakthroughs drawing on college physics curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these systems however were developed and some deployed without a careful assessment of their societal impact. For example, AI systems have been shown to exhibit gender and racial biases in making hiring and sentencing decisions. Yet, many data science students and practitioners are still unaware of the prevalence and seriousness of these issues. Equipping them with the knowledge to understand the implications of algorithm design decisions as well as tools that they can use to mitigate the biases in these systems is the key to ensure that the data-driven decision making systems they build are fair and trustworthy.

These two forms of global change have the potential to impact human, wildlife, and livestock exposure to infectious disease. Notably, these include vector-borne diseases which are carried and transmitted by blood-feeding invertebrates such as ticks, flies, and mosquitoes. Changes in environmental conditions may increase development rates of these vector species, or increase temperature-induced mortality. Similarly, removing or replacing large wildlife with livestock may alter food availability and reproductive ability for these vector species. Understanding the separate and combined impacts of these two forms of environmental change is thus of critical importance for both public health and wildlife conservation. This is particularly true for tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease, where medical treatment can be problematic and costly. This study aims to understand how tick-borne disease risk will be impacted by environmental change and wildlife or livestock management to better prevent disease transmission. Notably this project will also support K-12 education by providing new scientific training to underserved 5th grade students in the Kids in Nature program.  It will further support a Citizen Science mobile phone application on tick borne disease, which both engages the public in data collection and provides valuable information on tick abundance and risk of tick-borne disease.  Many undergraduate and graduate students from underserved backgrounds will receive training in both field and lab components of this project. <br/><br/>This project will mechanistically examine the effects of large wildlife loss coupled and the addition of livestock on tick abundance, tick-borne disease prevalence, and disease risk, under a range of climatic conditions. The study will use 1) a large-scale field exclosure experiment, replicated across a strong climate gradient serving as a proxy for regional environmental change predictions, and 2) a large-scale observational study across the same climate gradient and utilizing natural variation in wildlife/livestock densities. This project will be conducted in California, which is experiencing both warming and drying climates and strong declines in large wildlife with concomitant increases in livestock. In order to understand generality across systems, this study will investigate impacts on multiple tick species with variable life histories. Specifically, this project will evaluate the following  hypotheses: 1) the effects of large wildlife removal on density of infected ticks will vary by tick species depending on the tick?s life history, 2) livestock and large wildlife will have very similar effects in this system, with effects proportionate to their biomass, 3) density of infected ticks will be lower in more arid environments and the effects of large herbivores on ticks will be stronger in more arid climates, and 4) both the magnitude and direction of the effect will vary based on tick life history strategy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harbron of the Department of Chemistry at the College of William and Mary prepares and studies nanoparticles which act as amplifiers for photochemical (light-induced) reactions. As one example, chemotherapy drugs can be attached to light-reactive (photoreactive) molecules which release their drug only at the site of the tumor instead of throughout the body. Photoreactive molecules must react efficiently so that the dose of light is minimized, but not so efficiently that they react when exposed to normal room light. In order to optimize this process, Professor Harbron's research group synthesizes photoreactive nanoparticles by combining fluorescent polymers with photoreactive molecules. In these new nanoparticles, the polymer gathers light energy and delivers it to the attached photoreactive molecules. The current project develops applications in the photorelease of small molecules and in the production and detection of reactive oxygen species. Applications are envisioned in photodynamic therapy and sensor development. This project also serves as training for undergraduate and master's level research students, who learn organic, physical, and analytical chemistry techniques while receiving academic and career planning advise. Outside of the lab, Professor Harbron continues to work as a mentor with the Chemistry Women Mentorship Network and with the William and Mary Scholars Undergraduate Research Program, which seeks to develop research skills in students from underrepresented groups. Professor Harbron founded and chairs a new Diversity, Outreach, and Publicity committee in her department that is working to broaden participation in science and promote scientific dialogue on campus. <br/><br/>Light is an appealing stimulus for molecular transformations because it can be delivered to a sample with high spatiotemporal resolution and control of exposure energy and intensity. In conjunction with light stimulation, photoresponsive molecules are being used in an increasing number of exciting applications, from imaging to catalysis. The ideal photoresponsive substance reacts efficiently with light and yet not so efficiently that it responds to ambient light in an uncontrolled fashion. Achieving this balance in reactivity is one of the major challenges in the field.  Other challenges include water solubility and tuning light responsiveness into the visible to near-infrared region. To address these challenges, the current project pairs photoresponsive dyes with conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs).  These are exceptionally bright fluorophores that absorb and emit in the visible to near-infrared.  They can be suspended in water. When doped with dyes, CPNs act as powerful light harvesters, funneling the energy of hundreds of chromophores to a single dye molecule via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Pairing the CPNs' efficient excitation and energy transfer processes with a dye's less efficient photochemical reaction amplifies the reactivity of the dye in a controlled fashion. This project optimizes the ""controlled amplification"" approach and extends it to address photoreactivity challenges. The specific aims are: to develop CPNs doped with photoremovable protecting groups to enhance and control photorelease, and to use CPNs doped with photochromic dyes to quantify the CPN properties that maximize photoreactivity.  The research also seeks to develop CPNs that both generate superoxide and report on its relative concentration via ratiometric fluorescence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way to predict the consequences of future climate change is to examine how vulnerable species have been affected by historical climatic patterns.  Collections of preserved specimens in natural history museums provide such a window into the past. New methods for extracting and sequencing DNA from these specimens open up exciting opportunities to reveal evolutionary changes in the western fence lizard over the last century.  This research examine specimens from two studies about 50 and 100 years ago. The lizards were collected at specific sites along a latitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. They will be compared with population samples from their modern day descendants. The DNA sequences will be paired with detailed 3D morphological scans of each specimen for analysis. The research will evaluate how population demographics in this species have changed through time. The analysis will reveal how populations have moved in response to a changing climate. It will assess which genes and traits are involved in local adaptation. A new research and learning experience will be developed using the data and workflow from this study to teach undergraduates critical skills in big data and scientific computing. This will be conducted through a program at UC Berkeley designed to address underrepresentation in all areas of data science.  Additionally, the data collected in this project will be used to develop an augmented reality educational game. The game will challenge high school student groups to collect and analyze data on the effects of climate change while exploring a real outdoor space.<br/><br/>	Understanding how species will respond and adapt to non-stationary environmental change is a major challenge in modern biology. Research on population-level responses is critical for understanding how genetic diversity, population connectivity, and adaptive potential can be maintained in the face of ongoing climate change.  This project will conduct analyses at multiple scales to examine high resolution genomic and morphometric datasets that capture responses to climate change in natural populations across space and time.  These datasets will be built from contemporary collections of western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) paired with specimens collected from the same study area 50 years and 100 years ago and will be analyzed alongside environmental GIS data corresponding to each time period.  These longitudinal analyses of microevolutionary responses to climate change will address questions about the population-level effects of environmental change. Which genes and traits are involved in adaptation to climate change? How do changing environments affect population dynamics and genetic diversity?

Developers use a combination of the rules for human languages and programming languages to understand code.  The act of trying to understand code is referred to as program comprehension; it is an activity that precedes all other programming-related activities a developer might undertake when coding. For example, before fixing a bug, a developer needs to understand the code where the bug is present; to add a new software feature, a developer must understand the code which will support the new feature.  If a piece of code is highly comprehensible, then developers will have an easier time maintaining, debugging, and adding to it.  To support comprehension, research must attempt to formally model how human language describes program behavior. With such a model, source code could be optimized to be maximally understandable by automatically improving, or generating, human language to best describe it.  This project aims to build such a model by combining information from natural language part of speech with a model of program behavior to assist, improve and measure comprehension. <br/><br/>This project aims to formally model how human language describes source code behavior. This will be achieved by combining a static-analysis-based taxonomy of identifier type categorizations with natural language techniques and identifier definition-use chains. The combination of these three activities allow the model to measure 1) how the type constrains the behavior of an identifier, 2) what role, in English, the words in an identifier correlate to, and 3) what function calls the identifier is used in. These will allow the model to understand how the English of an identifier relates to the usage (function calls) and behavior constraints (type constraints). The goal of this model is to formally measure the way human languages are used to describe source code behavior such that it could be used to train a machine to do the same. The completed model will increase the current understanding of how developers express program behavior through human languages and allow for this expression to be measurably optimized for increased comprehensibility. Additionally, the model will improve modern program comprehension techniques by allowing them to be more aware of how the underlying source code structure and rules influence the way human languages are used to describe program behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current techniques used to study submarine earthquakes are expensive and cannot be applied to most earthquakes of interest. The lack of observations has hindered the understanding of whether an earthquake will displace the seafloor and increase the likelihood of generating a significant tsunami. The theory developed in this project will provide a new fundamental tool for the study of submarine earthquakes with significant scientific and societal implications. A new framework will be developed that overcomes previous theoretical limitations and allows us to develop an easily utilized, inexpensive tool which will allow for the detection of slip on the seafloor from distant recordings of ground motion alone.  This tool will then be used to examine giant earthquakes in the last 15 years that produced devastating tsunamis, as well as recent moderate-size earthquakes from around the world. By studying a large number of earthquakes with the newly developed tool, a better understanding will be obtained of why some earthquakes displace the seafloor while others do not.  This project could provide an improvement for tsunami hazard assessment.  The project supports the training of a postdoctoral investigator.<br/><br/>The first component of this project will establish the theoretical and observational framework required to distinguish events for which slip reached and did not reach the surface. This theory will provide a simple seismological diagnostic tool, and has the added benefit of complementing numerical models, seafloor instrumentation, drilling, or marine surveys. The second component of this project will provide the necessary observations required to determine the physical mechanisms controlling submarine surface rupture by applying the diagnostic to long-period seismic data from a large number of events recorded by the Global Seismographic Network. The new framework will be validated using the large amount of shallow slip that was measured to have occurred during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake. To what extent this type of shallow slip is observed in giant megathrust earthquakes, such as the 2010 and 2015 Chile and the 2004 and 2010 Sumatra tsunami earthquakes, as well as recent moderate-size earthquakes will be determined. Using the outcome of the survey of large and moderate-size earthquakes, an attempt will be made to determine the properties of fault zones (e.g., presence of accretionary wedge, subducted sediment thickness, fault dip-angle, etc.) that govern the rupture of the shallowest part of plate boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The upper mantle, which lies beneath the crust to depths of 410 km, is largely unreachable.  Seismology is, thus, a major tool when investigating mantle features.  Seismic-wave energy can be absorbed by the materials through which they pass, a process called seismic attenuation. This allows to identify structures at depth like the presence of melt. Each attenuation process must first be characterized in the laboratory.  Wave amplitude can be attenuated by back-and-forth motions of dislocations, which are linear defects shearing minerals during deformation. Here, the team measures experimentally the effects of rocks' microstructure, such as dislocations and grain orientations, on the attenuation of seismic waves.  The researchers use water ice as analog for mantle rocks because ice physical properties are well known. Ice can also be deformed to high strain at modest pressure and stress conditions. During deformation, ice specimens are here exposed to low-amplitude oscillating stress like those induced by seismic waves, while the attenuation is quantified. Results from this research provide critical insights to understand glaciers' and ice-sheet behavior and the role of rocks microstructures on seismic attenuation. The project has direct implications in Seismology and broader impacts in Material Sciences and Planetary Science (icy planetary bodies). It also provides support for an early-career female scientist, training for a post-doctoral associate in the field of Rocks Physics and outreach to high-school students.<br/><br/>The team expands on their previous studies of ice behavior by exploring seismic-wave attenuation as a function of strain in polycrystalline ice. The study is designed to explore upper mantle conditions in terms of microstructure: dislocation density,  sub-grain size and crystal preferred orientation. The goal is to measure the attenuation signature for materials experiencing a high background stress in the dislocation creep regime. Preliminary laboratory studies have identified an increase in attenuation in highly strained samples. Yet, the controlling parameters and the nature of how dislocation damping scales to the mantle is not known. Here, samples are pre-deformed to high strain in either shear torsion or compression in the high-pressure cryogenic deformation apparatus at University of Pennsylvania. Their microstructure is characterized by light microscopy and back scatter diffraction in a cryo-scanning electron microscope. Specimens are then tested for attenuation over a broad frequency range in the ambient-pressure cryogenic apparatus at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (Columbia University). The results are used to estimate the effect of both mantle stress magnitude and fabric strength on seismic attenuation. They will also have applications to glaciers and ice sheets on Earth and icy planetary bodies experiencing tidal forcing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every 50,000 to 100,000 years, a volume of seawater equivalent to the entire global ocean circulates through cracks and fissures of this basement beneath the seafloor, forming one of the largest reservoirs for microscopic life on Earth. While high temperature fluids discharging at iconic hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges are visually striking, the fluid flowing in and out of the flanks of these ridges is around three orders of magnitude greater and rivals the discharge of all rivers to the ocean. As it travels through the deep subseafloor, this fluid is significantly altered by water and rock interaction and the metabolic activity of microorganisms that are thought to ultimately help shape nutrient and energy budgets of the global ocean. However, our knowledge and understanding of this system suffer greatly from logistical difficulties in accessing it for scientific inquiry. Initial evidence suggests uncharacterized microbes that possess ancient homologs of enzymes involved in key metabolic pathways thought to be important to Earth's early microbial inhabitants populate this biome and are infected by novel viruses. In this study, the investigators are performing an integrated set of observations, experiments, and analyses aimed to advance our understanding of deep subseafloor microbes and their viruses by providing new, fundamental insights into which organisms and metabolisms are active in this environment, their evolutionary history and genetic characteristics, and their interactions. This project contributes to the development of a diverse STEM-educated workforce, and incorporate the training of one postdoctoral scientist, two graduate students, and ~29 undergraduate students in field-based research, wet-lab experimentation, and bioinformatics.

These fluids will be collected from different sampling depths for an integrated set of geochemical, genomic, and cultivation studies. The project's specific objectives are to (i) use genomics to characterize microbial and viral populations inhabiting crustal fluids of the JdFR flank, (ii) use transcriptomics to identify the active metabolic pathways that are performing transformations relevant to elemental cycling within microorganisms of the JdFR flank, as well as identify active viral infections in these microbes, and (iii) generate microbial and viral pure cultures or limited diversity enrichments from crustal fluids of the JdFR flank. It combines bioinformatic analyses, controlled laboratory experiments, and field sampling to pursue both hypothesis-driven and discovery-based cultivation experiments, viral assays, and strain-level ecogenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses.

Common understanding is that these mounds were created by the accumulation of bird guano, but archaeological research has revealed that prehistoric Aleutians constructed at least one of these earth mounds, highlighting the need to more thoroughly research the origins of these mounds. This project investigates these earth mounds to better understand their construction history, then linking to established discussions of Aleut monumentality in the eastern Aleutian Islands and potentially bringing to light a pan-Aleutian tradition of monumental construction spanning at least three millennia. This research will dovetail with regional and global data sets to expand the theoretical understanding of the form and function of monuments and their relationship to human behavior. Better understanding these earth mounds will also advance socioenvironmental theories about the impacts of small-scale societies on their landscapes and will contribute to global anthropological debates regarding group-identity amongst hunter-fisher-gatherer communities.<br/><br/>This archaeological research project investigates how earthen mound constructions can signal and reinforce expressions of perceived group identity among prehistoric hunter-fisher-gatherer communities in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.

The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from four European nations, seeks to predict new invasions of terrestrial plants and marine organisms that are linked to climate change in North America and Europe ecosystems. This is important because invasive alien species are significant drivers of species extinction and ecosystem degradation. Thus, their introduction into a new environment, almost always, negatively impacts ecosystem services and human well-being. This research targets climate change as a driver because there is now significant documentation that a large number of species' ranges are shifting in response to warming temperatures. This creates a type of invasion that is different from that caused by physical transportation via anthropological or other means. Prevention and/or containment of new species invasions is the first and most effective stage of invasive species management. However, it is only effective if potential invaders can be identified and prioritized for management before they arrive. Goals of this research are to identify likely terrestrial plan and marine organism species invasions and develop scenarios to prevent them via a participatory process that brings together scientists and stakeholders. Results of the work will include a searchable database of potential invaders and their probable ecological and socio-economic impacts to help managers and policymakers to prioritize high-risk species for intervention. Broader impacts of the work include research that supports proactive regulation and management of problematic alien invasive species, particularly those expected to invade and spread across the United States and Europe, as the climate changes. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between the US and France, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland. Each country will fund the component of the work carried out by its scientists. The project has strong societal benefits because invasive species have serious impacts economically and environmentally, as well as in terms of ecosystems and different regions maintaining beneficial biodiversity. Results of the project will help policy makers, industry, and other interested parties better understand possible implications of such invasions and more effectively and efficiently explore possible mitigation practices and policies. The Program notes the project is attentive to gender issues and the impact it has on broadening participation by having a gender-balanced team (4 female and 4 male PIs). It also has a strong transdisciplinary student training component.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this research seeks to understand and anticipate the multi-faceted impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity and ecosystem services and to provide tools for their management. The US component of this international collaboration focuses on predicting impacts of alien invasive and native range-shifting species. Tasks include the creation of a database of the ecological and socio-economic impacts of 100 terrestrial plants and 250 marine species. Data will be supplemented with additional empirical data from field experiments of high priority, yet presently understudied, invasive aquatic species. The resulting data will be used, in conjunction with an existing international protocol (the Environmental Impact Classification of Alien Taxa; EICAT), to examine the potential impacts of invasive terrestrial plants and marine organisms on native communities, agricultural systems, and human health. The assessment protocol will be adapted to consider both detrimental and beneficial impacts. Spatial planning tools will be used to evaluate the costs and benefits of different management and policy scenarios for preventing and mitigating invasions. Results of the analysis will be used to develop scenarios and models of biodiversity and ecosystem services to inform resource managers and policy makers about possible management of invasive species across multiple ecosystems and geographic scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, reefs are among the most threatened marine environments, and coral disease is having a devastating impact on these valued systems. In early 2019, a multi-species rapid tissue loss disease matching the description of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) was found severely affecting a reef off the southwest coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). SCTLD has been devastating coral reef communities in southeast Florida for the last four years, and was very recently reported from disparate areas around the Caribbean, including Mexico, Jamaica, and St. Martin. Rapid surveys by the investigators at the University of the Virgin Islands believe that a 50 km2 area southwest of St. Thomas is the initial incidence area of the disease, but will likely spread across the USVI, British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This study performs  experiments to understand how this disease affects coral species immune traits and compares the microbiology and physiology of disease samples in the USVI to samples from Florida. It also examines how changing the species composition of a coral community affects the spread and impact of the disease. The overall aim is to produce a model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. The project contributes to the research training of at least 2 undergraduates, 2 M.S. students, and 3 Ph.D. students, who benefit from cross-investigator mentoring. The research team includes representatives to the Coral Disease Advisory Committees for the USVI and Florida, which ensures rapid communication of  findings to management bodies in both regions. <br/><br/>Coral disease is a significant and increasing threat to Caribbean coral reef systems. Recent results demonstrate that coral species immune traits can predict disease resistance, and thus, forecast impacts to coral community structure, under multi-species coral disease. The onset of this epizootic in the USVI offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the impact of coral resistance, tolerance and immune traits on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak that could profoundly change the diversity of Caribbean reefs. It is hypothesized that the abundance of highly susceptible species dictates 1) the onset of disease at reef sites downstream of the initial incidence area, and 2) the spread of disease within reef sites. Furthermore, 3) downstream reef sites where highly susceptible species are removed or treated show lower immune responses in all susceptible corals, later onset of disease, and slower within-site disease spread. To test these hypotheses, two experiments directly compare species responses to disease exposure and test the effect of species assemblage on coral immune function and disease spread. Results from these experiments aim to inform a generalizable model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. Results of this project include direct comparison of the USVI disease to Florida SCTLD and a better understanding of how the abundance of highly susceptible host species impacts the spread of disease during the early onset of a multi-species panzootic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this project, the iron-containing enzymes are reprogramed to alter their functions.  Where they used to break down molecules, they now add chemical groups to create new compounds. The research plan is integrated with educational activities to inspire the next generation of students to pursue interdisciplinary research at the interface between chemistry and biology. The ""science express"" outreach activity uses a simple biochemical reaction that turns ordinary sugar into a blue dye (the ""blue genes for blue jeans"" hands-on experience) to show students how chemical biology impacts the world around them. These activities engage underrepresented K-12 students from diverse cultural, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds in rural areas of North Carolina. <br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a substrate decoy approach to redirect the reactions catalyzed by mononuclear non-heme iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent (Fe/2OG) while maintaining their catalytic efficiencies. Dr. Chang's goal is to explore the potential of utilizing this approach to biosynthesize industrially important molecules. The research objective is to redirect the reaction outcome of these enzymes from hydroxylation to nitrile group installation. A complementary objective is to elucidate, through various chemical probing and kinetic approaches, the mechanism by which Fe/2OG hydroxylases catalyze this non-native reaction. Dr. Chang's educational objectives include developing an undergraduate course in enzyme kinetics that integrates chemical and biochemical concepts through active learning methods. In addition, his group has developed an easy-to-understand enzyme catalyzed reaction (""blue genes for blue jeans"") as part of  the science express outreach program. This program, established in collaboration with local teachers, introduces middle school students to exciting research in chemical biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will involve studies with people to investigate how algorithmic understanding impacts system trust and decision-making for learning, as well as the development of ""explainables"" or brief, engaging interactive tutoring systems to provide algorithmic understanding to classroom stakeholders. These two thrusts will yield a framework for designers of algorithmically enhanced learning environments to determine what level of algorithmic understanding is necessary to achieve the goals of informed decision-making by users of their systems.  The explainables developed by this project will be publicly accessible and usable by external projects, increasing algorithmic understanding for the initially intended stakeholders, but also for the general public.  The main contributions of this work include a methodologically rigorous investigation of the knowledge components of algorithmic understanding for learning contexts that can be applied to model interpretability discussions in the wider machine learning community.<br/><br/>The research involves systematically identifying the concepts that qualify as ""understanding"" an AI algorithm, building brief interactive tutoring systems to target those concepts, and observing resultant changes in system trust and decision-making for learning contexts.

Student researchers will perform cognitive task analyses to identify hierarchical models of expert comprehension of AI models, apply a user-centered design process to develop explainables to teach the varying levels of expert comprehension, and perform evaluation studies comparing various explainables' impact on algorithmic understanding, trust, and decision making. The results will add to ongoing discussions about ethical algorithmic transparency in the larger machine learning community, but also provide an actionable framework for developing a more AI-informed student and teacher body as well as lightweight explainables for appending to external algorithmically enhanced learning environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Gordon Research Conference on Animal-Microbe Symbioses provides a unique opportunity for researchers at all career stages to meet and discuss the latest developments in this burgeoning scientific discipline.    A key topic at this conference is the mechanisms by which microorganisms protect animals against pathogens (functioning as a ""second immune system""), provide nutrients, and generally sustain the health and vigor of their animal host.  A second important theme for the conference is how the microbial inhabitants of one animal influence the host's interactions with other animals and plants, with the potential for cascading effects through natural ecosystems (e.g., oceans, forests), as well as managed agricultural landscapes.  These scientific discussions will be facilitated by the great breadth of expertise among the conference participants, including internationally-acclaimed invited speakers and also early-career scientists, who will present their research at highly-interactive sessions.  In addition to providing the opportunity for the exchange of information and views in the science sections, this conference has sessions on professional development.  In particular, the two-day Gordon Research Seminar for early-career researchers includes a panel event on Science Communication, in collaboration with distinguished science journalists.  As such, the conference will shape the future of how we study, understand, and manage symbiotic associations.<br/> <br/>The recognition that all higher organisms live in symbiotic association with microorganisms has opened up a new perspective in biology. Animals and humans alike are now considered as complex ecosystems each consisting of the host and its associated microbiome, which together serve as functional units of selection. Like a Russian doll, the metabolic processes of the symbionts are translated into organism functions which can have profound effects on the ecosystem scale. The conference addresses recent technological and conceptual advances in a uniquely broad range of hosts (from sponges to humans) and with diverse symbionts (from organelles, viruses, bacteria to fungi).  The broad sweep of systems and approaches adopted in this conference will facilitate new insights into common mechanisms shaping diverse associations, and enhance understanding of the causes and consequences of the loss of symbiotic equilibrium (dysbiosis). The linked Gordon Research Seminar will offer a venue for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to present their findings and discuss ideas in an informal setting, in conjunction with sessions on Science Communication. Both the Gordon Research Conference and Research Seminar on Animal-Microbe Symbioses will promote the fullest participation of scientists of diverse disciplinary backgrounds, all career stages and ethnicities, with particular attention to ensuring gender balance and support for under-represented minorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groundwater is a fundamental component of the global hydrologic cycle and a vital natural resource. It sustains many rivers, lakes, wetlands, and other groundwater dependent ecosystems, and is a significant source of freshwater for human consumption. Groundwater is also the foundation for irrigated agroecosystems, food production, ecosystem services, energy-extraction and production, and other industries. As a result of this demand, excessive groundwater (over)extraction, particularly in many of the largest and most important food producing aquifer systems in arid and semi-arid regions, has resulted in rapidly declining water levels and substantial loss of storage, referred to as the global groundwater crisis. Climate variability and change and the associated modifications to the hydrologic cycle are exacerbating concerns over the global groundwater crisis and societal implications. The sustainability of groundwater resources, particularly in California, is a well-recognized and urgent concern from local to global scales. Our students and exceptionally well-qualified Research Mentors will address knowledge gaps and practical solutions to the global groundwater crisis, with particular emphasis on California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). We will also use a formative and summative evaluation plan to rigorously assess and continually improve the quality and impact of our REU Site. The REU Site will have the following positive impacts: (1) help create an engaged U.S. workforce; (2) contribute to the diversification of the U.S. workforce; (3) help prepare students for careers to meet the unprecedented challenges of sustainable freshwater resources, particularly related to SGMA; (4) promote increased research productivity and new research ideas for all participants; and (5) help build academic capacity and practical solutions for rural and urban communities across California.<br/><br/>The REU Site will provide genuine research experience and training in groundwater sustainability science for undergraduate students, particularly women and underrepresented minorities (URM), at an early stage in their scientific careers. There are five primary objectives. (1) To provide junior- and senior-level undergraduates the opportunity to engage in independent research and make original intellectual contributions. (2) To provide community based research experience and professional development opportunities that create an engaged workforce in hydrologic sciences and engineering. (3) To expand the participation and increase the retention of women and URM students in STEM. (4) To integrate cutting edge research and training about groundwater sustainability science, particularly related to California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). (5) To provide a framework for productive collaboration between interdisciplinary Research Mentors and undergraduates across the CSU system.  The REU Site has five components. (1) A two-week, inquiry-based learning orientation that exposes students to the scientific process and fundamental concepts and skills. (2) A seven-week independent research experience where students will take primary responsibility for their project, while under their RM's guidance and resources. (3) A weekly professional development seminar where students engage with professionals to learn about graduate school and careers. (4) Social and professional activities to foster a strong cohort experience. (5) A community-wide research symposium where REU students will present their research results to the California groundwater community, friends, and family. We will recruit 10 students per year from the diverse URM student talent pool in the 23-campus California State University system and from across the U.S., training a total of 30 REU fellows over the three-year REU Site. We will target women and URM students who have completed at least one year of college-level hydrology or related courses, and interest in pursuing a graduate degree(s).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CI is formed of a combination of high performance computing (HPC) systems, software, application developers, and application users. Among these high-end applications, a growing number require repeated runs on HPC systems that are not designed optimally for their executions. These challenges are further exacerbated by the continuously changing hardware landscape. Faced with these challenges how is a CI application developer expected to develop and deploy applications in an efficient and sustainable manner? This is the central research question that this project seeks to address. The overarching goal is to develop a systematic and structured way to explore design spaces of CI configurations using machine learning techniques, and to demonstrate value in application and discovery potential through real-world applications. Other project activities integrate and leverage upon the research outcomes of this project, while preparing the next generation scientific workforce. The project is also leading to the development of curricular modules in parallel algorithms/applications and machine learning, and conference tutorials for broader outreach. The project will lead to the training of two PhD students in performing interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This project lays the foundations for a novel computational framework referred as Sust-CI that enables the developers to design and optimize cyber infrastructures for efficiency. This framework synergistically combines algorithmic abstractions, programming tools, and machine learning techniques to enable adaptive cyber infrastructures. This approach will automatically learn policies to make design decisions to optimize an objective specified by the developer (e.g., performance) in a data-driven manner. The project is leading to the development of sample-efficient machine learning algorithms for CI design space exploration and optimization. The key idea is to provide advanced CI applications a new capability to derive knowledge by exploring different execution traces (computational behavior) on the given training problem instances. The research will lead to a first-of-its-kind design space exploration framework to enable a sustainable use of CI resources toward leadership applications in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proceedings of this meeting is among the most cited publications in computational linguistics, and the meeting itself is the most important meeting for North American researchers in the field on years when it is held. This project will subsidize travel, conference and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the NAACL Student Research Workshop, which will take place during the main NAACL conference June 2-7, 2019 in Minneapolis, MN. The Student Research Workshop helps create a new generation of researchers with a more thorough understanding of their field, with connections and collaborations across institutions, and with innovative and exciting research programs. This contributes to America's pool of researchers with the needed scientific and engineering knowledge and skills. The workshop encourages a spirit of collaborative research and builds a supportive environment for a new generation of computational linguists. By sponsoring student travel, the workshop can reach a wider audience, broadening the horizons of the computational linguistics community and helping bring diversity to computer science research.<br/><br/>The Student Research Workshop solicits two categories of submissions: research papers and research proposals. The research proposal can have only one author who must be a student. The research papers can have multiple authors, with the first author being a student (at either the graduate or undergraduate level). Unlike typical workshops and conferences, student authors have the opportunity to receive explicit mentoring prior to submitting their work: they are put into contact with world-class researchers in the field who provide guidance and help the authors polish their submissions. The workshop is then a venue for students to receive constructive critical feedback on their work from experts outside of their institution; the early-stage work that students present here may later form the basis for full conference papers, journal articles, or dissertations. These features are particularly useful for students from underprivileged backgrounds or institutions where they might not have access to such strong mentoring resources. In addition, the workshop is organized and run by students. The student organizers gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, little is known about how single celled organisms evolve to form multicellular groups, and how these groups subsequently evolve into complex, integrated multicellular individuals. These questions persist because these transitions are deep in the past. This project overcomes this limitation with a novel experimental yeast system and directly examines the evolution of multicellularity in the lab. Using synthetic biology, the team will construct a yeast strain capable of expressing all possible early multicellular life cycles: a single-celled stage, an aggregative multicellular stage, and a clonally-developing multicellular stage. The project examines how yeast expressing these different life cycles evolve, over thousands of generations in the lab, examining two key steps necessary for the evolution of multicellularity: the origins of interdependent cells and cellular differentiation. Using this unique experimental system and the powerful tools of modern cell biology, this project stands to make fundamental insights into the origins of multicellularity. In parallel to the experiments described above, the team will pursue a broad-based educational outreach platform, explaining the wonder and elegance of major evolutionary transitions to children, high school students, undergrad/graduate students, and scientifically-curious adults. This will be accomplished primarily by developing novel high school and college curricula, holding workshops to train teachers how to use this material, and writing books aimed at a general audience.<br/><br/>Recent experiments have shown that unicellular organisms readily evolve to form multi-celled clusters, but little is known about how cellular clusters subsequently evolve greater multicellular complexity. The proposed research addresses this subject directly, using the snowflake yeast model system, by asking the following questions: How are cells stripped of their evolutionary autonomy, evolving from organisms into mutually-reliant parts of the new multicellular organism? How does novel cellular differentiation arise? Can specific life cycles (i.e., obligate clonal development) catalyze the evolution of the above traits? Conversely, are these processes undermined by the inclusion of other common life history stages (i.e., an extended single-cell phase or aggregation)? The project will address these questions with yeast strains engineered to express different life cycles, as detailed above, and then allowed to evolve over many generations. The tools of modern cell biology, such as synthetic biology, single cell RNA-seq, and 3D confocal microscopy, will allow the research team to follow the evolutionary dynamics and characterize specific changes in these lineages. Answering the above questions will provide fundamental insight into the evolutionary origins of multicellularity and will provide a theoretical foundation for similar investigations in other major evolutionary transitions. The educational aims for this CAREER award have three major components: i) Develop, disseminate and support snowflake yeast lab kits for use in high school and college courses. The PI will also host monthly summertime teacher training workshops, recruiting teachers from predominantly African American Atlanta public schools, and give talks to audiences of high school teachers. ii) Develop a novel course 'Origin of Complex Life: from Cells to Societies' at Georgia Tech, and help create a three-week snowflake yeast module for a graduate-level biophysics course. iii) Reach a general audience through books. The PI will write two books on major evolutionary transitions, a picture book aimed at children (~5-8 years old) and a book for an adult audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex life has experienced countless rounds of such changes over the last 500 million years varying in geographic scale from local to global, in timing from days to tens of millions of years, and in scope from single species to all life. Despite the numerical dominance and ecological importance of fishes in modern oceans, little is known about their specific responses to events like mass extinction or the triggers of their proliferation. This project is assembling and analyzing the first comprehensive databases for all known fossil fishes through time. Processing this data involves training teams of undergraduates in cutting-edge 'Big Data' analytics and programming, imparting essential skills for multiple careers. These efforts are revealing the origins of modern fishes and fundamental biodiversity processes and are informing fisheries and conservation efforts.<br/><br/>Fishes are vastly diverse (34,000 living species) and are key components of aquatic ecosystems, functionally distinct from both benthic invertebrates and terrestrial tetrapods. Patterns and processes of fish turnover are therefore essential for understanding modern biodiversity, selective mechanisms driving its origins, and biosphere evolution. There is growing evidence that fishes have exhibited distinct sequences of biodiversity loss and gain over their 500 million year history. However, elucidation and understanding of this record is hampered by a lack of appropriate, comprehensive datasets for most intervals. This project is creating global diversity, environmental and ecological compendia for fossil fishes. These data are revealing temporal patterns of turnover and are enabling direct testing of when fish diversity trends were primarily driven by 1) selective mass extinctions ('Big Five' and others, including unknown or second-order extinctions), 2) longer-term environmental changes ('Ice House' vs. 'Hot House' Intervals), or 3) competitive replacement. Creating the database of fossil fishes is enhancing infrastructure for research and education.

A large and diverse STEM workforce is critical to global competitiveness. This REU site will help increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in engineering careers through two proven strategies: (1) providing undergraduate research experience and (2) teaching students the societal importance of engineering through exposure to a variety of industrial, entrepreneurial, and academic career options; tours; and discussions with engineers. Students will study research topics involving heat and power, ranging from novel battery technologies, to enhanced cooling of micro-electronics and power electronics, to radiation in carbon capture processes. This will expose students to a range of engineering challenges, research methodologies, and careers that address the ever-expanding need for thermal-fluids engineers. The site will prepare students for their careers by teaching them how to communicate through oral presentations, posters, and written papers or reports. To further broaden participation, students will undertake an outreach project by assisting in teaching a short engineering course to underserved high school students in Washington University's College Prep program. <br/><br/>The ability to control temperature and the transfer of thermal energy (thermal management) is critical to addressing the most important global challenges: clean and renewable energy production; inexpensive, efficient and reliable transportation; and ever-increasing data storage and processing demands. This REU site will advance the current understanding of fundamental heat and mass transfer, while translating discoveries to applied technologies for thermal management at the nano-/microscale, component, and system scales. For 10 weeks during the summer, students will be immersed in research projects tied to emerging technologies, such as metal-air batteries and nanofluidic and micro-/nanostructural thermal transport enhancement, while also learning the role of thermal-fluids engineers in the micro-/power electronics, chemical/material processing, transportation, and energy industries. The site will be interdisciplinary, approaching topics in thermal management from mechanical and chemical engineering perspectives. Activities will include lunches with faculty, research skills seminars, lab/industry tours, preparation for the GRE, and social activities. Participants will have multiple one-on-one advising sessions with the Principle Investigator to define and develop a plan for achieving personal goals, and students' progress will be tracked after the summer ends. The summer will culminate with students preparing a technical report, conference proceeding, or journal article as well as presenting their research results through a poster and oral presentation at a final research symposium.

During the Eocene, a shift to cooler temperatures at high latitudes resulted in the inception of polar glaciation. This in turn affected the environment for living organisms. This project looks to uncover the interaction between biological, oceanographic, and climate systems for the Eocene in Antarctica using chemical analysis of fossil shark teeth collected during past expeditions. The combination of paleontological and geochemical analyses will provide insight to the past ecology and ocean conditions; climate models will be applied to test the role of tectonics, greenhouse gas concentration and ocean circulation on environmental change during this time period. The study contributes to understanding the interaction of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and ocean circulation. This project also seeks to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion within the geosciences workforce with efforts targeted to undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and early career faculty.<br/><br/>The research goal is to elucidate the processes leading from the Eocene greenhouse to Oligocene icehouse conditions. Previous explanations for this climate shift centers on Antarctica, where tectonic configurations influenced oceanic gateways, ocean circulation reduced heat transport, and/or greenhouse gas declines prompted glaciation. The team will reconstruct watermass, current, and climate fluctuations proximal to the Antarctic Peninsula using geochemical indicators (oxygen and neodymium isotope composition) from fossil shark teeth collected from Seymour Island. The approach builds on previous shark paleontological studies, incorporates geochemical analyses for environmental reconstruction (i.e., temperature gradients and ocean circulation), and tests hypotheses on Earth System dynamics using novel global climate model simulations with geochemical tracers. This project will advance global climate modeling capabilities with experiments that consider Eocene tectonic configuration within isotope-enabled climate model simulations. A comparison of geochemical results from Eocene climate simulations and empirical records of shark teeth will reveal processes and mechanisms central to the Eocene Antarctic climatic shift.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2010, a group of scientists discovered that nearly instantaneous full densification can occur (within five seconds) for certain ceramics when a high-level voltage or current pass through a compact of these ceramic powders. Thus, this rapid densification technique was named flash sintering. Since then, flash sintering has become one of the most promising techniques for ceramics processing. However, the mechanisms for this rapid sintering process are unclear; this project attempts to reveal the underlying reasons. The experimental work in this study is complemented by computational modeling, enabling a more comprehensive understanding on the rapid densification mechanisms of flash sintering of ceramic powders. This new knowledge then serves as fundamental guidance to extend the flash sintering technique into a wider range of ceramic materials. Graduate and undergraduate students (including minority and other underrepresented students) are being trained in mechanical engineering and materials science and engineering for careers in academia or high-technology manufacturing. Virtual reality technology is used to provide an immersive and interactive teaching and learning environment for materials sciences topics, and helps to educate a workforce capable of using adaptive new technologies in a rapidly changing society.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The technique, flash sintering, has demonstrated the ability to rapidly densify powder compacts of ceramic materials. In this technique, an applied electric field initiates a ""flash"" event and sintering occurs within a few seconds (at a threshold temperature for a given applied electric field). Although flash sintering has been observed in a variety of ceramic systems, the exact effects of electric field or current on enhancing the densification rate and influencing the microstructure evolution remain elusive, apart from the known thermal runaway Joule heating ohmic mechanisms. A series of experimental and theoretical modeling research activities are being carried out on ionic ceramic systems to clarify the thermal and non-thermal factors of electric field in the flash sintering process. In situ nanoscale imaging is used to observe the flash sintering process of yttrium-stabilized zirconia ceramic systems as a function of applied electric field, providing insights into the flash sintering mechanism. In addition, multiscale atom-to-continuum modeling is being used to simulate the flash sintering process of ionic ceramics in the presence of an electric field. The modeling is revealing the rapid densification mechanisms of flash sintering of ionic ceramics at the atomic level. Students are being educated to become experts in the practice of experimental and computational aspects of ceramic sintering technologies. As a result, graduates are being well prepared to create sustainable engineering solutions to complex problems, and thereby contributing to the cutting-edge of science and technology of ceramics processing and materials science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These two forms of global change have the potential to impact human, wildlife, and livestock exposure to infectious disease. Notably, these include vector-borne diseases which are carried and transmitted by blood-feeding invertebrates such as ticks, flies, and mosquitoes. Changes in environmental conditions may increase development rates of these vector species, or increase temperature-induced mortality. Similarly, removing or replacing large wildlife with livestock may alter food availability and reproductive ability for these vector species. Understanding the separate and combined impacts of these two forms of environmental change is thus of critical importance for both public health and wildlife conservation. This is particularly true for tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease, where medical treatment can be problematic and costly. This study aims to understand how tick-borne disease risk will be impacted by environmental change and wildlife or livestock management to better prevent disease transmission. Notably this project will also support K-12 education by providing new scientific training to underserved 5th grade students in the Kids in Nature program.  It will further support a Citizen Science mobile phone application on tick borne disease, which both engages the public in data collection and provides valuable information on tick abundance and risk of tick-borne disease.  Many undergraduate and graduate students from underserved backgrounds will receive training in both field and lab components of this project. <br/><br/>This project will mechanistically examine the effects of large wildlife loss coupled and the addition of livestock on tick abundance, tick-borne disease prevalence, and disease risk, under a range of climatic conditions. The study will use 1) a large-scale field exclosure experiment, replicated across a strong climate gradient serving as a proxy for regional environmental change predictions, and 2) a large-scale observational study across the same climate gradient and utilizing natural variation in wildlife/livestock densities. This project will be conducted in California, which is experiencing both warming and drying climates and strong declines in large wildlife with concomitant increases in livestock. In order to understand generality across systems, this study will investigate impacts on multiple tick species with variable life histories. Specifically, this project will evaluate the following  hypotheses: 1) the effects of large wildlife removal on density of infected ticks will vary by tick species depending on the tick?s life history, 2) livestock and large wildlife will have very similar effects in this system, with effects proportionate to their biomass, 3) density of infected ticks will be lower in more arid environments and the effects of large herbivores on ticks will be stronger in more arid climates, and 4) both the magnitude and direction of the effect will vary based on tick life history strategy<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This instrument operates by focusing a beam of high energy electrons at a target sample inside a vacuum chamber, and then measuring the different X-rays inherently produced by this process. The rationale for this work is to better understand physical processes - both in geological and earth materials, but also in man-made materials at smaller and smaller scales - with a relatively simple instrument that is available in many universities, industrial and governmental research laboratories. Many times the very smallest features in a material can give critical information about how the material was created, and for manmade materials, how it will break or fail. <br/><br/>In a just completed NSF-supported project (EAR-1554269), to develop a technique for extending the utility of the smaller electron beam field emission electron probe microanalyzer, we operated at lower accelerating voltage (i.e., 7 kV) vs traditional 15-20 kV. At these voltages, the higher energy K-series X-ray lines such those of the transition metals (e.g. Fe), are not generated - requiring that the lower energy L-series X-rays be measured and quantified. However, there are series difficulties with using these L-series X-rays, as they become complex entities due to spectral peak shift/shape changes, resulting from chemical bonding effects exacerbated by the adjacent absorption edge which adds more complexity. Thus, one single or simple reference standard is no longer a valid approach to quantification. In that project, we developed an innovative procedure to handle these iron L-alpha X-rays--and iron is an important element in many relevant geological materials. This research focused on the Fe-bearing mineral olivine and iron-silicides (found in meteorites and on the surface of the moon). This new project has several components to extend this technique: (1) extend this low kV Fe-L series work to other important important minerals such as sulfides, pyroxenes, garnets and amphiboles, (2) expand to look at L-lines of some Ni-bearing and Mn-rich minerals, (3) evaluate possible ways to improve measurements with ""plasma"" cleaning samples, (4) develop protocols using the innovative Soft X-ray Emission Spectrometer for the low energy X-rays generated at low kV, (5) investigate the feasibility of utilizing DFT (density functional theory) to simulate the complex spectral shapes of the L-series transition metals as well as the M-series of some rare earth elements (which have a similar set of conditions as the L-lines of Fe, etc.), and (6) investigate sample damage by the higher-electron-density field emission beam. This work will be done in a joint collaboration between the electron microprobe labs of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis.

The award to Claflin University has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of this project is to study optimal control strategy in satellite communication system to allocate power among competing user terminals, who share a frequency-selective interference channel, and would be competing for limited radio resources; as well as to enhance teaching and learning at the university by involving undergraduate students in mathematical modeling. <br/><br/>Differential game (DG) models will be used to solve for optimal control strategies, because of special features of the system - competitive and dynamical. The major components of this dynamic game are as follows: In a frequency-selective Gaussian interference channel model, there are K transmitters and K receivers in the system. Each transmitter and receiver pair will be viewed as a user or a player. The whole frequency band is divided into N frequency bins. In frequency bin f, player k allocates power in a pattern of some function, which is referred to as player k's control. With this control, if treating interference as noise, the data rate player k can achieve at time t is a function of time. Player k's objective is to maximize the data gain in a specific period of time interval, which is an integration of the data rate function over this time interval. The dynamics of the system is the rate of change of channel gain, which is a function of controls and noises. Thus, all players are combined in a same dynamic system, using their controls to realize their own data needs. Under the assumption of nonexistence of collaboration between players, a non-cooperative differential game model will be constructed to solve for optimal power allocation strategy for each player. Furthermore, cooperative and hierarchical competition models will also be studied for different types of competition. Mathematical analysis will be conducted to analyze the optimality condition of DG models. Numerical methods will be developed to solve models.  The broader impacts of the project will be to directly supply satellite communication controllers with a power allocation strategy design, and to generalize solution methods developed for solving DG models and improve applicability of differential game models.

Forensic scientists are required to use a standardized set of categories when determining how a person dies, however, many forms of death are uncertain or occur in situations that challenge official categories. As a result, forensic scientists must often relate causes of death in ways that defy the actual nature of the death under investigation. This process shapes related social outcomes, such as the nature of potential criminal investigations and insurance claims and can lead the justice system to function in ways that obfuscate the collection of valid scientific knowledge. Understanding how manner of death categories are constructed and how they might be changed could lead to more accurate conceptions of death categories, particularly for socially vulnerable categories of people, and a to improvements in the justice system.<br/><br/>This is a multi-method investigation of 'manner of death' categories as they are employed in forensic science, and how these matter for jointly shaping science, medicine, and the criminal justice system. Data come from documentary analyses of policy documents at the federal, state, and local levels, and of forensic science textbooks. These will be complemented by ethnographic observations and interviews at forensic science departments, and at the offices of coroners and medical examines. The main goal of the project is to show how academic research practices and seemingly mundane forms of scientific typologies and categorizations affect legal practices and the effective functioning of the criminal justice system. In doing so, it helps build on existing scholarship in science studies indicating that science and technology not only assist in resolving legal disputes, but can also actively produce them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to develop mathematical modeling and analysis of nanofluid in axisymmetric and three-dimensional flows, and to enhance teaching and learning at the university by involving undergraduate students in mathematical modeling. <br/><br/>The project will develop mathematical modeling and analysis of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations in axisymmetric and three-dimensional flows that arise in nanofluid flow in unsteady mixed convection. The specific goals of this project are to: (i) obtain deterministic solutions to the unsteady mixed convection nanofluid flow in axisymmetric bodies; (ii) develop stochastic solutions to unsteady mixed convection nanofluid flow over axisymmetric and three-dimensional bodies; and (iii) investigate the stability properties of the mixed convection flow over moving axisymmetric bodies. The success of this project will provide fundamental understanding of unsteady convective heat transfer phenomena in complex nanofluids. The results of such studies could be used to optimize fluid properties and for existing critical applications such as coolant for automobiles, air conditioning, and supercomputers, as well as emerging and novel applications. This project will be conducted in collaboration with the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at Ohio State University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The application of photochemistry to organic synthesis has traditionally required hazardous reagents and/or high energy, ultraviolet light. In this project, Dr. Stephenson is studying the use of complexes that harvest sunlight to power chemical reactions. Importantly, this research project is being carried out in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies. This collaboration enables the rapid incorporation of the new methods into practical applications. Dr. Stephenson's research group participates in several outreach programs to engage grade school (3rd-12th grade) students, with the intention of inspiring the next generation of scientists and leaders. For example, the research team is contributing to the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering, and the Science (FEMMES) and the Michigan Math and Science Scholars (MMSS) programs at the University of Michigan.

This was the most destructive wildfire in California history, resulting in 15,000 structures burnt. The extensive number of structures and vehicles that burnt has resulted in concerns that the ash can transport toxic metals and organic contaminants into the surrounding waterways. The upland watershed drains directly into Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the California State Water Project. This reservoir provides drinking and irrigation water to millions of users. The potential for mobilization is strong because precipitation occurred prior to emergency clean up and erosion mobilized fire debris into downstream creeks and reservoirs. This research will help understand the concentrations and persistence of contaminants in the watershed post-fire. Such information is necessary to identify potential threats to human and ecological health. Broader impacts to society result from an increased understanding of upland fire impacts on water supplies. Such information can lead to better management strategies to protect water quality.<br/><br/>The Camp Fire in November 2018 was the most destructive fire in California history, resulting in 15,000 structures and thousands of vehicles being burnt. There is concern that overland flow of ash and debris from burned structures, cars, and other buildings may transport toxic metals such as arsenic, copper, cadmium, mercury, lead, as well as toxic organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, brominated fire retardants, dioxins and other contaminants into the surrounding waterways. This is particularly important given that the watershed drains directly into Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the California State Water Project that provides drinking and irrigation water to millions of users. In addition to the threats to Lake Oroville, Butte Creek hosts the last stable Chinook spring run Salmon population in all of California. The potential for contaminant mobilization following the Camp Fire is strong because precipitation occurred prior to emergency clean up, and erosion mobilized fire debris into downstream creeks and reservoirs. To better characterize these potential threats, a multi-institutional team with complimentary expertise in environmental chemistry and transport will assess the concentrations of these and many other heavy metal and organic pollutants in the Camp Fire watershed for 12 months post-fire. The research team will use this information to evaluate the fate and transport of contaminants from the burn area. Specific research will seek to understand 1) how does burning, ash deposition, and rainfall influence contaminant mobilization within the urban area and in downstream waters, 2) how long will contaminants persist in the watershed post-fire, and 3) what are the acute and chronic threats to human and aquatic health associated with contaminant mobilization into surrounding surface waters. The results of this research will improve our understanding of contaminant fate, persistence, and transport following burning. This information will help urban/rural planners, as well as forest and watershed managers to better identify, mitigate, and reduce threats to water quality resulting from forest fires.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One source of nitrogen to surface waters is deposition from the atmosphere, which is the result of reactive nitrogen emissions from both human (anthropogenic) activities and natural processes. Anthropogenic nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere and nitrogen deposition to the oceans have increased exponentially since preindustrial times. In fact, global modeling studies have suggested that as much as 80% of total nitrogen deposition to the oceans is anthropogenic in origin, and that the magnitude of input to the global oceans rivals estimates of biological nitrogen fixation. The impacts associated with this increased nitrogen deposition are clear in both terrestrial and coastal systems, but the implications for open ocean biogeochemistry are less well studied. Recent work in the North Pacific Ocean (NPO) has suggested that increased nitrogen due to anthropogenic atmospheric deposition is detectable even in the open ocean, while other work can explain nutrient dynamics based upon natural biological and physical processes. The investigators propose to study the influence of both anthropogenic and natural sources on the deposition of nitrogen (as nitrate, ammonium, and organic nitrogen) in the NPO. This will be based on collection of aerosol and rainwater samples year-round at two sites: (1) Chang-Dao Island, China where they expect high anthropogenic nitrogen inputs; and (2) Oahu, Hawaii where they expect marine sources to dominate. They will also collect ship-based samples in the marine boundary layer via already planned short-term research cruises in each season. In addition to the scientific outcomes, this project will provide for human resources and professional development of the team members (faculty members, a graduate student, undergraduate student, and technicians), advance international collaborations, and contribute to education and public outreach. <br/><br/>Identifying the sources of nitrogen deposition to the open ocean is crucial for understanding anthropogenic impacts on biogeochemical cycles. A primary question is, is nitrogen deposition the result of external, anthropogenic processes or does it represent recycled nitrogen from the ocean's point of view? The specific objectives of this project are to: characterize the atmospheric composition and sources of inorganic (ammonium and nitrate) and organic nitrogen with an emphasis on seasonality; diagnose the influence of air-sea exchange versus anthropogenic sources of nitrogen on atmospheric deposition; and determine the isotopic composition of gaseous and particulate inorganic nitrogen in the marine boundary layer via ship-based sample collections in the NPO. Using concentration and isotopic measurements of reactive nitrogen species, in addition to transport and chemical box modeling, the study aims to characterize nitrogen deposition in two locations with very different source influences. This study will provide the first comprehensive, seasonal analysis of the isotopic values of reactive nitrogen species in the NPO atmosphere where nitrogen deposition is considered intense. Ultimately this project will lead to a better understanding of how anthropogenic changes in the atmospheric nitrogen cycle may influence the biogeochemistry of the surface ocean as well as the composition of the marine atmosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant provides support for approximately 18 U.S.-based graduate students to participate in the IEEE VIS Doctoral Colloquium to be held in conjunction with the IEEE Visualization Conference (VIS 2019), October 20-25, 2019, in Vancouver, Canada. IEEE VIS is the premier annual international forum for advances in the science and engineering of visualization across academia, government, and industry. IEEE VIS brings together the world's leading researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology for interactive data analysis, data exploration, and data communication. The focus of the VIS Doctoral Colloquium is advancing PhD students' doctoral dissertation research through mentoring and networking with global research leaders in the science of visualization. Students participating in the Doctoral Colloquium are selected chiefly on the grounds of research excellence, meaning that supported students are advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of visualization. The Doctoral Colloquium provides an opportunity the students' projects to be shaped and improved through intellectual exchange, and for the students themselves to present and communicate the character of their work to a key group of their peer professionals. Since the students and mentors are a diverse group (nationality, gender, ethnicity, scientific discipline, and research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. Supporting participation of U.S. students in the VIS 2019 DC is important for the development of the next generation of researchers, practitioners and educators in this important scientific field. <br/><br/>IEEE VIS was established in 1996 and has become the worldwide largest and most important conference on Scientific Visualization, Information Visualization and Visual Analytics. The IEEE VIS conference regularly draws over 1,000 participants from dozens of countries to a week of research presentations, tutorials, workshops, panels, demonstrations, posters, exhibitions and scientific discussions. The IEEE VIS Doctoral Colloquium was initiated in 2006, and has been highly successful in providing mentorship opportunities to leading PhD students at a key time in their scientific development. Students at the Doctoral Colloquium present their doctoral dissertation research and receive feedback from senior professionals in the visualization community. This event provides key feedback that shapes the students' research and professional development, helps the participants build a professional network both among themselves and with senior researchers in the field, and prepares them to emerge as future leaders of the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concerned over the possibility that the decline in biodiversity may reduce the ability of natural and managed ecosystems to provide products and services for humanity, ecologists have studied relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions (e.g., crop production). These studies have significantly improved our knowledge on the consequences of biodiversity loss. Nevertheless, the majority of these studies have focused on species diversity, that is, the number of species in an ecological community, and relatively little attention has been paid to other components of biodiversity. As a result, there is a significant gap in our knowledge on the consequences of the loss of biodiversity components other than species diversity. This project will explore the ability of phylogenetic diversity (PD), a component of biodiversity that accounts for species evolutionary relationships, for predicting the structure of ecological communities and the functions of ecosystems. This project will also provide high-quality research training for a postdoctoral fellow, and graduate and undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Using freshwater ciliated protists as model organisms, the proposed experiments will advance knowledge in four specific areas. First, it will link ecologically important traits and species niche and fitness differences in a phylogenetic context. Second, it will investigate mechanisms underlying phylogenetic diversity (PD)-ecosystem function relationships by testing the novel hypotheses that PD-ecosystem function relationships depend on how PD translates into species niche and fitness differences. Third, it will examine the role of the PD of the species pool in modulating the historical contingency of community assembly by linking PD with species niche and fitness differences. Fourth, it will provide a rigorous test of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis by examining both invader success and impact, with novel hypotheses informed by recent meta-analysis of existing empirical studies. Together, the proposed research marries phylogenetic ecology with contemporary species coexistence theory to gain a more mechanistic understanding of the role of PD for community assembly and ecosystem functioning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Minerals in the slab containing water break down when exposed to the high temperatures encountered at depth beneath the seafloor, releasing fluids which ultimately lead to the production of magmas and explosive volcanism. In addition, these fluids are thought to influence the occurrence of earthquakes in the subduction zone. Fluids released by the subducting slab contain fluid mobile elements, such as lithium, chlorine and boron, and the composition of the fluids is diagnostic of the source in the subducting slab (sediments, oceanic crust, mantle) from which they derived. Cold and thermal springs located above the subducting slab provide a window into the fluids released at depth in a subduction zone. This project will investigate the geochemistry of spring fluids located off of Costa Rica between the subduction trench and the volcanoes produced by magmatism to identify the sources and amount of slab-derived fluids released at depth within a subduction zone. This information is necessary to understand volcano and earthquake behavior along active plate margins. This work will also provide scientific training for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach presentations on subduction zones and associated hazards to the public in both the United States and Costa Rica.<br/><br/>Subduction zones are crucial for understanding the chemistry deep and shallow reservoirs of Earth, yet very little is known about volatile behavior in forearc regimes. Here we propose to quantify the Li, B, and halogen budget throughout the inner subaerial forearc of Costa Rica through a geochemical investigation of forearc cold and thermal spring fluids. Lithium, boron, and the halogens (Cl, F, Br, I) are all highly fluid-mobile elements. Their incompatibility in minerals limits modification by fluid-rock interaction, thereby making them reliable tracers of fluid source. Costa Rica is an ideal locality for study because it is one of the few subduction zones in which forearc springs are subaerial due to the presence of several peninsulas and therefore easily accessible to sampling. Two of the peninsulas (Nicoya and Osa) are directly over the seismogenic zone and both are sites of large megathrust earthquakes. Slow slip events have also been observed in the Nicoya Peninsula. Elevated fluid pressures, commonly thought to be derived from metamorphic dehydration reactions, lower the effective stress and are therefore commonly invoked as a mechanism for aseismic slip. Fluids from forearc springs provide us with a direct window to fluid sources at seismogenic depths in subduction zones. Through the combined use of Li, B, and Cl stable isotopes, elemental concentrations, and elemental ratios (e.g., Br/Cl, I/Cl, B/Cl, Li/B), the following will be completed: 1) Identify the change(s) in slab-derived source along and across the forearc and how prograde metamorphism of the subducting slab controls Li, B, and halogen concentrations and isotope compositions across the forearc; 2) Provide an integrated view of loss of fluid-mobile elements during shallow subduction processes contributing to an improved evaluation of cycling through subduction zones; and 3) Evaluate correlation, or lack thereof, between varying fluid sources and seismic behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Virtually all forests in the Eastern US are recovering from such disturbances, whether natural or human-caused. It is, however, not well understood what mechanisms control recovery times of forest carbon and nutrient stocks following disturbance.  Also not well known is how plant growth, soil development and climate variation interactively regulate recoveries of carbon and nutrients in aging forests. This project uses long-term experimental plots at the University of Michigan Biological Station (a 110-year-old field station in northern Michigan) to investigate how changes in forests lead to overall carbon capture and storage. Globally, forests remove approximately 1/4 of carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion, with temperate forests, like those studied here, being responsible for almost half of that carbon removal from the atmosphere. However, it is uncertain whether forests will continue to partially offset human-derived carbon emissions as they age and mature following past large-scale disturbances. This project provides critical data and mechanistic understanding needed to predict the magnitude and duration of continued temperate forest carbon uptake, and the ability of forests to provide fiber, fuel, habitat, and many other benefits to society.<br/><br/>This long-term (10-year) project began to answer globally significant questions in its productive first 5 years. Researchers are measuring the forests and soils in 6 forest stands (approx. 2 acres each) that were experimentally cut and burned in either 1936, 1948, 1954, 1980, 1998, or 2017. These cutting and burning treatments replicate larger-scale cutting and burning that occurred in the early 1900s across the Great Lakes region within which the experimental stands are nested. Forest structural measurements include patterns of tree, leaf, and branch density and arrangement. Soil measurements include both nutrient distribution and availability and soil carbon fluxes. By using nearby old forests (130- to >200-yr-old) that were not severely cut and burned as reference points, the team is linking disturbance, climate, soil, and vegetation controls to long-term patterns of carbon sequestration in forests that are representative of other forests across the northern U.S. and similar regions in Canada, Europe and Asia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A diverse and highly-skilled workforce is needed to support the economic growth in this area of manufacturing. To help address his need, Mohawk Valley Community College will partner with two colleges to develop a new training model for manufacturing technicians. These partners will develop courses that cover the most advanced technologies in this field, including metal 3D printing. The project team will partner with local industries to ensure that the courses contain the knowledge and skills desired for the workforce. The courses will include the use of remotely-shared 3D printing equipment for student design projects. The remote lab equipment will represent a model for colleges across the country to prepare students with the necessary skills, even if the colleges have limited budgets to purchase their own equipment. This model will reduce cost barriers for institutions and help increase the number of technicians that can be trained. The training model will provide options for current workers who want to upgrade their skills. The project will also create introductory courses for secondary school students, who will also be able to use the remotely-shared 3D printing equipment.<br/><br/>This project seeks to increase the number of skilled technicians in additive manufacturing design processes, with a special focus on metal 3D printing. The goals include: the development of a one-semester, 18-credit curriculum comprised of five courses that cover modeling, materials, and additive manufacturing topics; the development of a remote lab-sharing model for the curriculum that will be tested with the partner institutions, Finger Lakes Community College and Western Technical College; and research on the efficacy of the curriculum on student outcomes when used in local-lab versus remote-lab learning environments. Students at the partnering institutions will be able to remotely access the lab equipment to print prototypes, which will then be shipped back to their campuses. The curriculum will be designed for either seamless integration into existing two-year engineering technology programs or as a standalone microcredential option for incumbent workers. Dual-credit high school courses and mini modules for existing high school courses will also be developed and implemented. An emphasis of this project will be on engaging and recruiting students from underrepresented populations to promote their interest in manufacturing careers and broaden participation in the technician workforce. Course materials, project results, and best practices will be widely disseminated to encourage the adoption or adaptation of the approach by other colleges and institutions across the country.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, reefs are among the most threatened marine environments, and coral disease is having a devastating impact on these valued systems. In early 2019, a multi-species rapid tissue loss disease matching the description of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) was found severely affecting a reef off the southwest coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). SCTLD has been devastating coral reef communities in southeast Florida for the last four years, and was very recently reported from disparate areas around the Caribbean, including Mexico, Jamaica, and St. Martin. Rapid surveys by the investigators at the University of the Virgin Islands believe that a 50 km2 area southwest of St. Thomas is the initial incidence area of the disease, but will likely spread across the USVI, British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This study performs  experiments to understand how this disease affects coral species immune traits and compares the microbiology and physiology of disease samples in the USVI to samples from Florida. It also examines how changing the species composition of a coral community affects the spread and impact of the disease. The overall aim is to produce a model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. The project contributes to the research training of at least 2 undergraduates, 2 M.S. students, and 3 Ph.D. students, who benefit from cross-investigator mentoring. The research team includes representatives to the Coral Disease Advisory Committees for the USVI and Florida, which ensures rapid communication of  findings to management bodies in both regions. <br/><br/>Coral disease is a significant and increasing threat to Caribbean coral reef systems. Recent results demonstrate that coral species immune traits can predict disease resistance, and thus, forecast impacts to coral community structure, under multi-species coral disease. The onset of this epizootic in the USVI offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the impact of coral resistance, tolerance and immune traits on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak that could profoundly change the diversity of Caribbean reefs. It is hypothesized that the abundance of highly susceptible species dictates 1) the onset of disease at reef sites downstream of the initial incidence area, and 2) the spread of disease within reef sites. Furthermore, 3) downstream reef sites where highly susceptible species are removed or treated show lower immune responses in all susceptible corals, later onset of disease, and slower within-site disease spread. To test these hypotheses, two experiments directly compare species responses to disease exposure and test the effect of species assemblage on coral immune function and disease spread. Results from these experiments aim to inform a generalizable model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. Results of this project include direct comparison of the USVI disease to Florida SCTLD and a better understanding of how the abundance of highly susceptible host species impacts the spread of disease during the early onset of a multi-species panzootic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The translation initiation rate is the key measure of translational output, as this rate specifies how much protein can be made from each mRNA and hence how much of a particular protein will be available in a cell.  The aim of this project is to examine and optimize a novel approach for determining translation initiation rates at a genome-wide level.  This approach will allow transcriptome-wide translation initiation rates to be determined quickly and efficiently in a single experiment and for any type of cell.  Ultimately, this technique will allow researchers to address fundamental questions about the process of translation more broadly and deeply.  The staff exchanges between the theoretical and experimental laboratory groups will allow graduate students and post-doctoral scholars to learn complementary experimental and theoretical skills that will enhance their training as quantitative biologists and biophysicists.<br/><br/>Ribosome profiling is widely used to obtain high-resolution profiles of in vivo translation.  Typically, ribosome profiling experiments are carried out in parallel with RNA sequencing experiments on the same sample.  The resulting ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data, however, are not quantitatively comparable due to substantial technical differences in library generation and the lack of an absolute standard permitting normalization between these two independent experiments.  This conventional approach also doubles the amount of sequencing required and introduces additional statistical uncertainty in comparing the generated DNA libraries.  In this EAGER proposal, the theoretical and experimental expertise of the investigators will be combined to create a new experimental protocol to quantitatively measure messenger RNA abundance and translation from a single experiment, and thereby quantify absolute transcriptome-wide in vivo translation initiation rates.  This new experimental protocol will be a variant of ribosome profiling by combining features of RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling into one experimental method.  This eliminates the technical differences encountered in comparing the independent experiments of ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing thus allowing direct quantification of transcriptome-wide translation initiation rates.  This technique will go beyond conventional qualitative measures of translation control, such as ""translation efficiency"", and measure quantitative rates of protein production in vivo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The upper mantle, which lies beneath the crust to depths of 410 km, is largely unreachable.  Seismology is, thus, a major tool when investigating mantle features.  Seismic-wave energy can be absorbed by the materials through which they pass, a process called seismic attenuation. This allows to identify structures at depth like the presence of melt. Each attenuation process must first be characterized in the laboratory.  Wave amplitude can be attenuated by back-and-forth motions of dislocations, which are linear defects shearing minerals during deformation. Here, the team measures experimentally the effects of rocks' microstructure, such as dislocations and grain orientations, on the attenuation of seismic waves.  The researchers use water ice as analog for mantle rocks because ice physical properties are well known. Ice can also be deformed to high strain at modest pressure and stress conditions. During deformation, ice specimens are here exposed to low-amplitude oscillating stress like those induced by seismic waves, while the attenuation is quantified. Results from this research provide critical insights to understand glaciers' and ice-sheet behavior and the role of rocks microstructures on seismic attenuation. The project has direct implications in Seismology and broader impacts in Material Sciences and Planetary Science (icy planetary bodies). It also provides support for an early-career female scientist, training for a post-doctoral associate in the field of Rocks Physics and outreach to high-school students.<br/><br/>The team expands on their previous studies of ice behavior by exploring seismic-wave attenuation as a function of strain in polycrystalline ice. The study is designed to explore upper mantle conditions in terms of microstructure: dislocation density,  sub-grain size and crystal preferred orientation. The goal is to measure the attenuation signature for materials experiencing a high background stress in the dislocation creep regime. Preliminary laboratory studies have identified an increase in attenuation in highly strained samples. Yet, the controlling parameters and the nature of how dislocation damping scales to the mantle is not known. Here, samples are pre-deformed to high strain in either shear torsion or compression in the high-pressure cryogenic deformation apparatus at University of Pennsylvania. Their microstructure is characterized by light microscopy and back scatter diffraction in a cryo-scanning electron microscope. Specimens are then tested for attenuation over a broad frequency range in the ambient-pressure cryogenic apparatus at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (Columbia University). The results are used to estimate the effect of both mantle stress magnitude and fabric strength on seismic attenuation. They will also have applications to glaciers and ice sheets on Earth and icy planetary bodies experiencing tidal forcing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

OMZs play an important role in biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem function and any change in the expanse of their low oxygen waters can have far reaching implications for marine life and valuable fisheries resources. Marine oxygenation is variable on multiple timescales in response to global climate change, with recent observations showing that OMZs have expanded over the past half century. This project will explore promising new geochemical and morphologic proxies applicable to low-oxygen environments in the planktic foraminifer Globorotaloides hexagonus, a unicellular calcifying organism whose fossil record in seafloor sediments is well suited to reconstructing past low-oxygen environments in the water column. The project will focus on the extensive OMZ of the eastern tropical Pacific. The first goal is to evaluate and calibrate the targeted measurements for modern G. hexagonus collected live in plankton tows. The second goal is to apply these proxies to fossil specimens in sediment cores to generate records of glacial-Holocene change. The outcomes will be useable proxies for generating records of the OMZ environment, and a better understanding of how a major regional OMZ changed during the most recent period of rapid climate change. Both outcomes represent important progress towards understanding natural oscillations in the OMZ as well as modeling and planning for a changing OMZ in the face of global climate perturbations. The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate researchers as well as support a female early career researcher.<br/><br/>The marine sedimentary record is the most promising archive from which to reconstruct long term marine oxygenation. However, significant limitations exist in the available proxies for low oxygen marine environments. This project aims to address this need by evaluating and applying a range of promising geochemical (trace element and stable isotope) and morphologic (area-density and porosity) proxies relevant to low oxygen environments in the planktic foraminifer Globorotaloides hexagonus. The project will develop viable proxies based on the morphology and geochemistry of G. hexagonus shells previously collected in depth-distributed MOCNESS (Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System) tows from the eastern Pacific. The results from this proxy development in modern shells will then be ground-truthed and applied to two already well characterized sediment cores from the Mexican Margin and Panama Basin that span from the Last Glacial Maximum through the Holocene. The sediment records will be used to reconstruct past conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific OMZ, where significant questions about glacial-interglacial oxygenation persist.

One source of nitrogen to surface waters is deposition from the atmosphere, which is the result of reactive nitrogen emissions from both human (anthropogenic) activities and natural processes. Anthropogenic nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere and nitrogen deposition to the oceans have increased exponentially since preindustrial times. In fact, global modeling studies have suggested that as much as 80% of total nitrogen deposition to the oceans is anthropogenic in origin, and that the magnitude of input to the global oceans rivals estimates of biological nitrogen fixation. The impacts associated with this increased nitrogen deposition are clear in both terrestrial and coastal systems, but the implications for open ocean biogeochemistry are less well studied. Recent work in the North Pacific Ocean (NPO) has suggested that increased nitrogen due to anthropogenic atmospheric deposition is detectable even in the open ocean, while other work can explain nutrient dynamics based upon natural biological and physical processes. The investigators propose to study the influence of both anthropogenic and natural sources on the deposition of nitrogen (as nitrate, ammonium, and organic nitrogen) in the NPO. This will be based on collection of aerosol and rainwater samples year-round at two sites: (1) Chang-Dao Island, China where they expect high anthropogenic nitrogen inputs; and (2) Oahu, Hawaii where they expect marine sources to dominate. They will also collect ship-based samples in the marine boundary layer via already planned short-term research cruises in each season. In addition to the scientific outcomes, this project will provide for human resources and professional development of the team members (faculty members, a graduate student, undergraduate student, and technicians), advance international collaborations, and contribute to education and public outreach. <br/><br/>Identifying the sources of nitrogen deposition to the open ocean is crucial for understanding anthropogenic impacts on biogeochemical cycles. A primary question is, is nitrogen deposition the result of external, anthropogenic processes or does it represent recycled nitrogen from the ocean's point of view? The specific objectives of this project are to: characterize the atmospheric composition and sources of inorganic (ammonium and nitrate) and organic nitrogen with an emphasis on seasonality; diagnose the influence of air-sea exchange versus anthropogenic sources of nitrogen on atmospheric deposition; and determine the isotopic composition of gaseous and particulate inorganic nitrogen in the marine boundary layer via ship-based sample collections in the NPO. Using concentration and isotopic measurements of reactive nitrogen species, in addition to transport and chemical box modeling, the study aims to characterize nitrogen deposition in two locations with very different source influences. This study will provide the first comprehensive, seasonal analysis of the isotopic values of reactive nitrogen species in the NPO atmosphere where nitrogen deposition is considered intense. Ultimately this project will lead to a better understanding of how anthropogenic changes in the atmospheric nitrogen cycle may influence the biogeochemistry of the surface ocean as well as the composition of the marine atmosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every 50,000 to 100,000 years, a volume of seawater equivalent to the entire global ocean circulates through cracks and fissures of this basement beneath the seafloor, forming one of the largest reservoirs for microscopic life on Earth. While high temperature fluids discharging at iconic hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges are visually striking, the fluid flowing in and out of the flanks of these ridges is around three orders of magnitude greater and rivals the discharge of all rivers to the ocean. As it travels through the deep subseafloor, this fluid is significantly altered by water and rock interaction and the metabolic activity of microorganisms that are thought to ultimately help shape nutrient and energy budgets of the global ocean. However, our knowledge and understanding of this system suffer greatly from logistical difficulties in accessing it for scientific inquiry. Initial evidence suggests uncharacterized microbes that possess ancient homologs of enzymes involved in key metabolic pathways thought to be important to Earth's early microbial inhabitants populate this biome and are infected by novel viruses. In this study, the investigators are performing an integrated set of observations, experiments, and analyses aimed to advance our understanding of deep subseafloor microbes and their viruses by providing new, fundamental insights into which organisms and metabolisms are active in this environment, their evolutionary history and genetic characteristics, and their interactions. This project contributes to the development of a diverse STEM-educated workforce, and incorporate the training of one postdoctoral scientist, two graduate students, and ~29 undergraduate students in field-based research, wet-lab experimentation, and bioinformatics. This project also fosters a unique collaboration between scientists and the University of Hawaii Academy for Creative Media that supports undergraduate interns from the Academy to work with project personnel and produce creative videos and graphics to communicate aspects of our research to diverse audiences. Finally, this project supports two early career female scientists who started faculty positions in 2017.<br/><br/>This project leverages existing sampling infrastructure, DNA sequencing by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, and a research expedition to the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR) flank off the coast of Washington, USA, that is already supported by NSF. Here, subseafloor observatories have been previously installed to aid in exploring actively flowing subseafloor crustal fluids. These fluids will be collected from different sampling depths for an integrated set of geochemical, genomic, and cultivation studies. The project's specific objectives are to (i) use genomics to characterize microbial and viral populations inhabiting crustal fluids of the JdFR flank, (ii) use transcriptomics to identify the active metabolic pathways that are performing transformations relevant to elemental cycling within microorganisms of the JdFR flank, as well as identify active viral infections in these microbes, and (iii) generate microbial and viral pure cultures or limited diversity enrichments from crustal fluids of the JdFR flank. It combines bioinformatic analyses, controlled laboratory experiments, and field sampling to pursue both hypothesis-driven and discovery-based cultivation experiments, viral assays, and strain-level ecogenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses. Importantly, the investigators intend to generate new cultivated microbes and viruses to serve as model systems for investigating the characteristics of life in the deep ocean crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The elastic behavior is due to stretching and coiling of polymers under flow. Even weak elasticity can have a profound effect on fluid behaviors, which are essential in many industrial applications, ranging from spraying and pesticide deposition to drag reduction in piping flows. To achieve the desired outcomes in those applications, it is critical to accurately measure the fluid viscosity and elasticity. While viscosity is easy to measure, the elasticity of weakly elastic fluids has been challenging to measure. One potential method to measure elasticity is to use steady flows caused by a micro-sized bubble that is vibrating in an acoustic field. The flow patterns that are induced by the bubble will change depending on the acoustic frequency and the fluid properties, allowing inferring of the fluid elasticity. The principal aim of this award is to provide a deep understanding of the key factors governing the microbubble induced flows in a viscoelastic fluid. This award will also incorporate significant educational activities, which disseminate applications of microfluidics as well as concept of viscoelastic fluids through undergraduate research projects, engagement of minority and underrepresented students into research, and outreach modules that are aimed at middle and high school students.<br/><br/>Accurate measurement of relaxation times of low-viscosity elastic fluids is still a challenging task. This award will tackle this challenge by using acoustically driven microbubbles. The steady streaming flows arising from the bubble are shown to depend on the driving acoustics and fluid elasticity, suggesting feasible microbubble-based rheometry devices for measuring small relaxation times. In this research, the PIs will combine experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling to elucidate the interplay between elasticity and acoustic streaming flows by: 1) conducting systematic experiments to characterize the bubble dynamics and streaming flow behavior, 2) deriving appropriate theory based on the asymptotic method to understand the interaction of the fluid elasticity and acoustic oscillations, 3) establishing numerical models to accurately predict the flow patterns, by validating the simulations with the outcome of Task 1, and 4) engineering novel rheometer-on-a-chip devices using the developed models in task 3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A more systematic and fundamentally sound approach for expansive soil classification is required to alleviate the severe economic and social burden of damages resulting from these materials. The new paradigm in this project for soil classification is viewed as central to solving current global societal and environmental challenges, including energy and resource needs, infrastructure development, environmental protection and enhancement, and protection and recovery from natural disasters. The framework will allow designers to more effectively quantify site variability by allowing a larger and more diverse suite of samples to be tested in a short amount of time. Improved basic understanding of expansive clays will impact the tremendously broad range of applications where they have found use, including environmental applications such as waste containment, filtration and membranes, and as industrial adsorbents. Activities will be integrated with the research to capitalize on the collaborative nature of the project, including a summer exchange program for students at the University of Wisconsin (UW) and the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and education/diversity initiatives implemented through existing programs at UW and CSM. A hands-on training workshop will be organized to disseminate the new soil classification system to the practicing geotechnical engineering community.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to modernize geotechnical engineering practice by developing a new paradigm for expansive soil characterization based on fundamental soil properties and behavior. Two distinct physicochemical mechanisms responsible for clay swelling behavior - crystalline swelling and osmotic swelling - will form the basis of the new framework. The approach in this project explicitly differentiates these mechanisms to glean specific information about fundamental clay properties including specific surface area and cation exchange capacity and to classify expansive clays using independent mineralogy and pore fluid chemistry criteria. Modern experimental approaches, including automated measurements of water vapor sorption isotherms and soil shrinkage curves, will replace historical index measurements (e.g. Atterberg Limits) in the new expansive soil classification system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the Eocene, a shift to cooler temperatures at high latitudes resulted in the inception of polar glaciation. This in turn affected the environment for living organisms. This project looks to uncover the interaction between biological, oceanographic, and climate systems for the Eocene in Antarctica using chemical analysis of fossil shark teeth collected during past expeditions. The combination of paleontological and geochemical analyses will provide insight to the past ecology and ocean conditions; climate models will be applied to test the role of tectonics, greenhouse gas concentration and ocean circulation on environmental change during this time period. The study contributes to understanding the interaction of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and ocean circulation. This project also seeks to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion within the geosciences workforce with efforts targeted to undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and early career faculty.<br/><br/>The research goal is to elucidate the processes leading from the Eocene greenhouse to Oligocene icehouse conditions. Previous explanations for this climate shift centers on Antarctica, where tectonic configurations influenced oceanic gateways, ocean circulation reduced heat transport, and/or greenhouse gas declines prompted glaciation. The team will reconstruct watermass, current, and climate fluctuations proximal to the Antarctic Peninsula using geochemical indicators (oxygen and neodymium isotope composition) from fossil shark teeth collected from Seymour Island. The approach builds on previous shark paleontological studies, incorporates geochemical analyses for environmental reconstruction (i.e., temperature gradients and ocean circulation), and tests hypotheses on Earth System dynamics using novel global climate model simulations with geochemical tracers. This project will advance global climate modeling capabilities with experiments that consider Eocene tectonic configuration within isotope-enabled climate model simulations. A comparison of geochemical results from Eocene climate simulations and empirical records of shark teeth will reveal processes and mechanisms central to the Eocene Antarctic climatic shift.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This 2-day event will take place on May 4-5 in conjunction with the ACM 2019 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2019) sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI), which will be held May 4-9 in Glasgow, UK.  This will be the first time that CHI has taken place in the UK and it will be hosted at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.  The annual CHI conferences are the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and they are attended by more than 3,000 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about this year's conference, whose theme is ""Weaving the Threads of CHI,"" is available online at https://chi2019.acm.org/.  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  To increase the broad impact of the event, the organizers are committed to diversity.  Due to timing issues, the student participants for 2019 have already been selected; there are a total of 20 students (approximately 10 females and 10 males) who represent a wide range of topic areas and backgrounds; in addition, no more than two students will be from any given institution.<br/><br/>The CHI Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  This year's DC will once again adopt the successful schedule implemented in 2017 and 2018, where the group breaks into clusters of 3-4 students paired with one faculty panelist.  Each student participant will have a time slot of approximately 20 minutes in which to make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research and to receive feedback both from the faculty panelist and the other student participants.  The feedback will be constructive and geared to help the students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other HCI research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Follow up activities, including two poster sessions, are planned during the technical program of the conference, and the students' work will be published in the CHI 2019 Extended Abstracts.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral research consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Clementi and her group are developing machine learning tools to combine the results from microscopic simulation and experimental data into a data-driven modeling framework. The last several years have seen an immense increase in high-throughput and high-resolution technologies for experimental observation.  These advances are combined with high-performance techniques to simulate molecular systems at a microscopic level resulting in vast and ever-increasing amounts of data. Professor Clementi is taking advantage of this abundance of data and uses machine learning to extract information, in order to formulate general principles regulating the behavior of molecular systems. Understanding chemical processes at the molecular level is essential for a large number of applications, from energy storage to drug design. Additionally, as the need to represent massive data sets in terms of a model bears similarity across different fields, Professor Clementi's work may have an impact on a broad range of completely different disciplines from genomics to finance. This research impacts an interdisciplinary community of students and researchers. Her project includes the development of undergraduate and graduate courses, and outreach activities focused in the recruiting and mentoring of minority students, especially through collaboration with the Tapia Center at Rice University.<br/><br/>Professor Clementi is developing a data-driven framework to design effective molecular models at multiple resolutions, to address questions currently out of reach to existing computational and experimental approaches. The main idea is to use state-of-the-art machine learning methods to ""learn"" the coarse-grained dynamical models governing molecular systems (structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics/mechanism) at the mesoscale, by combining simulation data generated from microscopic simulation, and experimental data. By integrating different sources of data, this modeling approach reconciles bottom-up and top-down methods. This approach generates functional building blocks that can be embedded in higher-order simulations in order to bridge the gap to macroscopic systems. This modeling framework may serve as a keystone to integrate vast amounts of chemical data into quantitative, mechanistic and comprehensible models. Such models may explain how different molecular components organize and interact as a function of time and space in performing functions at the macroscopic scale. In particular, the developed framework is applied to investigate one specific biomolecular process: the binding of peptides to Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is concern that overland flow of ash and debris from burned structures, cars, and other buildings may transport toxic metals such as arsenic, copper, cadmium, mercury, lead, as well as toxic organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, brominated fire retardants, dioxins and other contaminants into the surrounding waterways. This is particularly important given that the watershed drains directly into Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the California State Water Project that provides drinking and irrigation water to millions of users. In addition to the threats to Lake Oroville, Butte Creek hosts the last stable spring run of Chinook Salmon population in all of California. The potential for contaminant mobilization following the Camp Fire is strong because precipitation occurred prior to emergency clean up, resulting in washing of fire debris into downstream creeks and reservoirs. To better characterize these potential threats, a multi-institutional team with complimentary expertise in environmental chemistry and transport will assess the concentrations of these and many other heavy metal and organic pollutants in the Camp Fire watershed for 12 months post-fire. The research team will use this information to evaluate the fate and transport of contaminants from the burn area. Specific research will seek to understand 1) how does burning, ash deposition, and rainfall influence contaminant mobilization within the urban area and in downstream waters, 2) how long will contaminants persist in the watershed post-fire, and 3) what are the acute and chronic threats to human and aquatic health associated with contaminant mobilization into surrounding surface waters. The results of this research will improve our understanding of contaminant fate, persistence, and transport following burning. This information will help urban/rural planners, as well as forest and watershed managers to better identify, mitigate, and reduce threats to water quality resulting from forest fires.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rationale for this work is to better understand physical processes - both in geological and earth materials, but also in man-made materials at smaller and smaller scales - with a relatively simple instrument that is available in many universities, industrial and governmental research laboratories. Many times the very smallest features in a material can give critical information about how the material was created, and for manmade materials, how it will break or fail.<br/><br/>In a just completed NSF-supported project  (EAR-1554269), to develop a technique for extending the utility of the smaller electron beam field emission electron probe microanalyzer, we operated at lower accelerating voltage (i.e., 7 kV) vs traditional 15-20 kV. At these voltages, the higher energy K-series X-ray lines such those of the transition metals (e.g. Fe), are not generated - requiring that the lower energy L-series X-rays be measured and quantified. However, there are series difficulties with using these L-series X-rays, as they become complex entities due to spectral peak shift/shape changes, resulting from chemical bonding effects exacerbated by the adjacent absorption edge which adds more complexity. Thus, one single or simple reference standard is no longer a valid approach to quantification. In that project, we developed an innovative procedure to handle these iron L-alpha X-rays--and iron is an important element in many relevant geological materials. This research focused on the Fe-bearing mineral olivine and iron-silicides (found in meteorites and on the surface of the moon). This new project has several components to extend this technique: (1) extend this low kV Fe-L series work to other important important minerals such as sulfides, pyroxenes, garnets and amphiboles, (2) expand to look at L-lines of some Ni-bearing and Mn-rich minerals, (3) evaluate possible ways to improve measurements with ""plasma"" cleaning samples, (4) develop protocols using the innovative Soft X-ray Emission Spectrometer for the low energy X-rays generated at low kV, (5) investigate the feasibility of utilizing DFT (density functional theory) to simulate the complex spectral shapes of the L-series transition metals as well as the M-series of some rare earth elements (which have a similar set of conditions as the L-lines of Fe, etc.), and (6) investigate sample damage by the higher-electron-density field emission beam. This work will be done in a joint collaboration between the electron microprobe labs of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis.  The project will support a postdoctoral research fellow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study was initiated by von-Neumann in the 30s, motivated by mathematics related to quantum mechanics, and originates from single operator theory and complex analysis. These days, operator algebras are successfully used to provide novel perspectives for classical mathematical theories and to lay the foundations for physical theories. The main overarching goal of this project is to create and expand upon existing interaction between the seemingly separate theories of ""irreversible"" and ""reversible"" operator algebras. Such interactions have led to substantial breakthroughs in the field, with impact to the aforementioned areas of mathematics and physics.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project aims to bring together techniques from non-self-adjoint operator algebras, Arveson's non-commutative boundary theory and C*-algebras to bear on semigroup and group theories, dilation theory, non-commutative dynamical systems and classification of representations of C*-algebras up to unitary equivalence. The project has three main goals. The first goal, inspired by work of Kalantar and Kennedy, is to find characterizations of nuclearity, simplicity and other C*-algebraic properties of boundary quotient C*-algebras of semigroups using Hamana's injective envelope theory. The second goal is to import ideas of Exel on graded and coaction C*-algebras to extend work of the PI with Katsoulis on characterizations of the C*-envelope in the context of product systems to the non-abelian case. The third goal is to continue the investigation initiated by Davidson, B. Li and the PI where non-self-adjoint operator algebras are used to distinguish representations of C*-algebras associated to directed graphs. Progress on the above-mentioned goals will enhance the two-way interaction between the reversible and irreversible theories and will lead to new approaches for resolving several open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses genetics and biochemistry to understand how the tomato synthesizes flavor and nutritional chemicals.  Flavor and nutrition are critical targets for improvement of agricultural crops in our modern society. Unhealthy shifts in diets can be countered by producing more flavorful, attractive and nutritious foods. Globally, biofortified food crops can address micronutrient malnutrition affecting millions of the poorest people. Better tasting, more nutritious, longer shelf-life food crops could have far reaching effects on world food production and sustainability. If fruits and vegetables taste better, people will eat more of them. Tomato fruit ripening involves simultaneous expression of more than 1000 genes. How the many metabolic pathways involved in different aspects of ripening are regulated is largely unknown. This project uses systems approaches to identify the regulators of each pathway, defining a regulatory hierarchy of genetic control on the entire process. The knowledge gained will in turn facilitate improvements in specific traits such as flavor and vitamin content. In addition to interdisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists, a citizen science project will leverage the public's keen interest in tomatoes. Individuals will be enrolled in an amateur plant breeding program to identify new varieties for the home garden. They will collect data on performance of experimental lines relative to a standard check variety, Better Boy, across North America. The citizen input will be the basis for which varieties are released.<br/><br/>Prior efforts have established the tomato fruit as a paradigm for understanding the genetic control of complex, multigenic traits. The unifying project objective is to identify regulators of important fruit ripening, nutrient and flavor pathway genes to facilitate both more complete understanding of fruit maturation and develop tools for crop improvement. This project uses a systems approach involving genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, genomics, informatics and metabolomics to define important components of the regulation of fruit quality-related processes and pathways and functionally characterize identified genes. Public genomics resources enabling additional tomato and translational research for improvement of additional fruit crops will be developed. Specific research objectives center on development of data sets that shed light on regulatory interactions, analysis of resulting data with the goal of functional characterization of a subset of high priority regulatory genes and public release of data through existing databases (http://ted.bti.cornell.edu and http://ted.bti.cornell.edu/epigenome/).

A more systematic and fundamentally sound approach for expansive soil classification is required to alleviate the severe economic and social burden of damages resulting from these materials. The new paradigm in this project for soil classification is viewed as central to solving current global societal and environmental challenges, including energy and resource needs, infrastructure development, environmental protection and enhancement, and protection and recovery from natural disasters. The framework will allow designers to more effectively quantify site variability by allowing a larger and more diverse suite of samples to be tested in a short amount of time. Improved basic understanding of expansive clays will impact the tremendously broad range of applications where they have found use, including environmental applications such as waste containment, filtration and membranes, and as industrial adsorbents. Activities will be integrated with the research to capitalize on the collaborative nature of the project, including a summer exchange program for students at the University of Wisconsin (UW) and the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and education/diversity initiatives implemented through existing programs at UW and CSM. A hands-on training workshop will be organized to disseminate the new soil classification system to the practicing geotechnical engineering community.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to modernize geotechnical engineering practice by developing a new paradigm for expansive soil characterization based on fundamental soil properties and behavior. Two distinct physicochemical mechanisms responsible for clay swelling behavior - crystalline swelling and osmotic swelling - will form the basis of the new framework. The approach in this project explicitly differentiates these mechanisms to glean specific information about fundamental clay properties including specific surface area and cation exchange capacity and to classify expansive clays using independent mineralogy and pore fluid chemistry criteria. Modern experimental approaches, including automated measurements of water vapor sorption isotherms and soil shrinkage curves, will replace historical index measurements (e.g. Atterberg Limits) in the new expansive soil classification system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The associated ice mass loss is responsible for approximately half the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea level rise thus far this century. For the remainder of the century and beyond, gaps in our understanding of iceberg calving and glacier retreat result in large uncertainties in predictions of mass loss and consequent sea level rise. This collaborative project is designed to reveal the factors controlling terminus retreat and iceberg calving in the diverse settings of Greenland's marine terminating glaciers. The project contributes to STEM workforce development by providing support to two early-career scientists from EPSCoR states, undergraduate student participation at both institutions, and for training of a graduate student.  The principal investigators will continue their active outreach, including museum and classroom visits in the rural settings around their universities, presentations to non-technical groups, and media features.<br/><br/>This project will substantially improve our understanding of marine terminating glacier dynamics via the analysis of recently-available observational datasets. Through these data, the project will evaluate the performance of terminus parameterizations used in numerical ice sheet models, known as ""calving laws."" Application at 49 diverse marine-terminating glaciers around Greenland (nearly a quarter of the ice sheet total) ensures that project results will be representative. Calving laws applied to conditions at and near glacier termini will predict terminus locations. Predictions will be compared to terminus positions observed in satellite and time-lapse images to identify model misfits. This calibration and validation analysis will reveal when and where specific calving laws reliably reproduce terminus positions and calving rates. Furthermore, extensions of this approach will (1) yield insight into the impact of crevasse water storage on iceberg calving, (2) guide the inclusion of submarine melting to improve prediction by calving laws, and (3) quantify the critical timescales over which glacier properties must be characterized for the prediction of calving rates and terminus positions."

However, reefs are among the most threatened marine environments, and coral disease is having a devastating impact on these valued systems. In early 2019, a multi-species rapid tissue loss disease matching the description of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) was found severely affecting a reef off the southwest coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). SCTLD has been devastating coral reef communities in southeast Florida for the last four years, and was very recently reported from disparate areas around the Caribbean, including Mexico, Jamaica, and St. Martin. Rapid surveys by the investigators at the University of the Virgin Islands believe that a 50 km2 area southwest of St. Thomas is the initial incidence area of the disease, but will likely spread across the USVI, British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This study performs  experiments to understand how this disease affects coral species immune traits and compares the microbiology and physiology of disease samples in the USVI to samples from Florida. It also examines how changing the species composition of a coral community affects the spread and impact of the disease. The overall aim is to produce a model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. The project contributes to the research training of at least 2 undergraduates, 2 M.S. students, and 3 Ph.D. students, who benefit from cross-investigator mentoring. The research team includes representatives to the Coral Disease Advisory Committees for the USVI and Florida, which ensures rapid communication of  findings to management bodies in both regions. <br/><br/>Coral disease is a significant and increasing threat to Caribbean coral reef systems. Recent results demonstrate that coral species immune traits can predict disease resistance, and thus, forecast impacts to coral community structure, under multi-species coral disease. The onset of this epizootic in the USVI offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the impact of coral resistance, tolerance and immune traits on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak that could profoundly change the diversity of Caribbean reefs. It is hypothesized that the abundance of highly susceptible species dictates 1) the onset of disease at reef sites downstream of the initial incidence area, and 2) the spread of disease within reef sites. Furthermore, 3) downstream reef sites where highly susceptible species are removed or treated show lower immune responses in all susceptible corals, later onset of disease, and slower within-site disease spread. To test these hypotheses, two experiments directly compare species responses to disease exposure and test the effect of species assemblage on coral immune function and disease spread. Results from these experiments aim to inform a generalizable model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. Results of this project include direct comparison of the USVI disease to Florida SCTLD and a better understanding of how the abundance of highly susceptible host species impacts the spread of disease during the early onset of a multi-species panzootic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study seeks to determine and elucidate the evolutionary adaptation<br/>of the Escherichia coli bacteria and how their acquired resistance mutations influence their fitness and susceptibility to common antibiotics.<br/><br/>Evolutionary trade-offs are ubiquitous in nature and have important consequences for organismal adaptation, especially to harsh environments. The discovery of evolutionary trade-offs and/or trade-ups is imperative to determine the sustainability of bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents. Understanding these interactions is essential in addressing the global health concern of antimicrobial resistance. This project seeks to explore potential evolutionary trade-offs and co-selection mechanisms that occur because of acquired resistance to a class of natural antibacterial agents, bacteriophages, and to explore their potential trade-offs against metal resistance, specifically excess amounts of iron. The primary focus will be on the evolutionary adaptation of Escherichia coli to bacteriophage T4 and how acquired phage resistance mutations influence bacterial fitness and susceptibility to metals and common antibiotics. Bacteriophage T4-Ferric iron (Fe3+) resistance interactions are of significant interest since phage T4 and iron (III) share similar targets including outer membrane proteins used for phage attachment and iron entry.

This project has three parts:  1) a summer teaching internship program for undergraduate STEM majors, which is designed to recruit students into the teaching profession; 2) scholarships and mentoring for a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program; and 3) a mentoring program and continuing professional development for newly-minted teachers to retain them as teachers.  An innovative feature of the project is its plan to support 40 summer teaching internships for STEM undergraduates, as a pathway to recruit students into the MAT scholarship program.  Through this effort, undergraduate STEM majors will serve as teaching interns at science museums, summer science camps, and local non-profit science educational organizations.  While interning, the students will be actively mentored by University faculty, staff at the partner facilities, and local high school teachers.  These internships are intended to help students gain confidence in their ability to teach and inspire them to continue participation in the project as Noyce Scholars in the MAT program.     <br/><br/>Over five years, this project plans to provide scholarships to 30 STEM graduates to support their entry into and completion of the MAT program.   The MAT program will provide pedagogical knowledge and residency experiences to prepare STEM graduates for a career in teaching.  The project will target graduates in Physics, Chemistry, Engineering Technology, Computer Science, and Mathematics, which represent the highest need STEM fields in the region.  This program has three sequential goals to recruit, prepare, and retain highly qualified STEM high school teachers in high-need districts in eastern Tennessee.  The summer internship will be an essential component of the recruitment program.  To capture the impact of the internship, the Noyce team will use regular journal entries written by the interns and a survey developed by the American Physical Society to investigate whether participation in such internships changes undergraduate attitudes toward teaching as a profession.  The results of this study will be disseminated to the STEM education community at science education conferences and submitted for publication in science education journals.  Once the STEM undergraduate students graduate and are recruited as Noyce Scholars, the MAT program will provide them with a comprehensive background in education, including STEM teaching strategies and pedagogy.  When the Scholars transition to full-time teaching, the project will provide three years of induction support to enhance their success. The recruitment, training, and retention strategies used in this program will build a strong network and develop partnerships that will support a long-term goal of increasing the number of highly-qualified STEM teachers who are placed into high-need schools.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Normally when assessing seismic hazards on land, the movement of the ground is measured using the Global Positioning System (GPS), which informs where an earthquake may happen in the future and how large it may be. However, GPS can not be used in offshore regions like the Cascadia subduction zone because a seafloor instrument cannot directly communicate with an orbiting satellite through the water column. Instead, an analogous technique called GPS-Acoustic is used. GPS-Acoustic couples the satellite signals from GPS with sound waves from instruments deployed on the seabed to measure the movement of the seafloor. However, GPS-Acoustic instruments are not as accurate as onshore GPS stations because of difficulties in predicting how fast sound will travel through the ocean at any specific time and place. This project seeks to use improved oceanographic models of sound speed to improve measurements of seafloor movement along the Cascadia subduction zone.  This will in turn allow a more accurate assessment of the seismic hazard in the region. Broader impacts of the work include the support of a postdoctoral scholar, potential improvements in subduction-zone seismic hazard assessments and potential cross-disciplinary impact for both geodesy and physical oceanography.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to test the assumptions of a stationary and horizontally layered sound velocity structure for GPS-Acoustic positioning.  Oceanographic hindcast models will be used to inform a strategy to filter out the variations in sound velocity from the GPS-Acoustic residuals.  This will allow implementation of methods to more accurately and efficiently isolate the geologic and oceanographic signal in the travel time residuals collected during GPS-Acoustic deployment.  This approach will be evaluated using GPS and acoustic ranging data previously collected by a Wave Glider for sites above the Cascadia subduction zone. If successful, the accuracy of GPS-Acoustic displacement measurements will be improved from the cm-scale to the mm-scale, as well as the efficiency of GPS-Acoustic by shortening the required data collection window.  With improved GPS-Acoustic measurements, refined boundary conditions will be generated for fault locking models along the Cascadia margin and aid in the monitoring of the seismic cycle, in line with the goals of the GeoPRISMS initiative to improve understanding of subduction cycles and deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This over enrichment has compromised the ability of saltmarshes to provide key ecosystem services such as buffering coastal cities from storms, providing habitat for fish and shellfish, and mitigating climate impacts by storing carbon. The U.S. is investing millions of dollars to reduce nitrogen to coastal regions and embarking on large-scale saltmarsh restoration costing millions to billions of dollars to restore lost ecosystem services. Currently, it is unknown how quickly or if ecosystem services will return after nutrient inputs are cut. This research will provide insight into nitrogen pollution as a cause of marsh loss and the potential for ecosystem recovery with management strategies. There are several education efforts associated with this project that will train students. The project enhances education by developing high school curriculum on ""Research and Resiliency: Investigating the Local Effects of Global Changes"" in collaboration with the Massachusetts Audubon Society. A program for mid-career journalists about environmental science will also be developed. This project will facilitate sustainability and provide a science-based foundation for state and federal nutrient standards. <br/><br/>This project will address how the effects of historical nutrient over enrichment influences the ability of marshes to recover their ability to provide ecosystem services. The project will use a combination of whole-ecosystem experimental manipulations, field measurements of key species, assays of genetic change, nutrient and carbon cycle processes, and food-web structure in six experimental sites to determine recovery trajectories. Researchers will measure changes in the decomposer community genetic diversity and activity by sequence amplicons of functional genes responsible for encoding key enzymes in the nitrogen cycling processes. The project will measure plant traits and genotypic diversity. The recovery of carbon and nitrogen cycling will be determined from marsh geomorphology, habitat-specific denitrification rates, nitrogen exchange with the open bay, and decomposition.

Dr. Marty is addressing this challenge through the development of novel chemical measurement techniques based on native mass spectrometry (MS) methods and lipoprotein nanodisc membrane mimetics. By measuring the mass of the entire nanodisc assembly with embedded MAC complexes, it is possible to characterize the oligomeric states of MACs in different lipid environments. This CAREER project provides the foundation for these experiments by uncovering the mechanisms of nanodisc stability under native MS conditions, creating native MS-compatible nanodiscs that model natural membranes, and developing algorithms for the analysis of complex MS data.

The upland watershed drains directly into Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the California State Water Project. This reservoir provides drinking and irrigation water to millions of users. The potential for mobilization is strong because precipitation occurred prior to emergency clean up and erosion mobilized fire debris into downstream creeks and reservoirs. This research will help understand the concentrations and persistence of contaminants in the watershed post-fire.

Such information can lead to better management strategies to protect water quality.<br/><br/>The Camp Fire in November 2018 was the most destructive fire in California history, resulting in 15,000 structures and thousands of vehicles being burnt. There is concern that overland flow of ash and debris from burned structures, cars, and other buildings may transport toxic metals such as arsenic, copper, cadmium, mercury, lead, as well as toxic organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, brominated fire retardants, dioxins and other contaminants into the surrounding waterways. This is particularly important given that the watershed drains directly into Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the California State Water Project that provides drinking and irrigation water to millions of users. In addition to the threats to Lake Oroville, Butte Creek hosts the last stable Chinook spring run Salmon population in all of California. The potential for contaminant mobilization following the Camp Fire is strong because precipitation occurred prior to emergency clean up, and erosion mobilized fire debris into downstream creeks and reservoirs. To better characterize these potential threats, a multi-institutional team with complimentary expertise in environmental chemistry and transport will assess the concentrations of these and many other heavy metal and organic pollutants in the Camp Fire watershed for 12 months post-fire. The research team will use this information to evaluate the fate and transport of contaminants from the burn area. Specific research will seek to understand 1) how does burning, ash deposition, and rainfall influence contaminant mobilization within the urban area and in downstream waters, 2) how long will contaminants persist in the watershed post-fire, and 3) what are the acute and chronic threats to human and aquatic health associated with contaminant mobilization into surrounding surface waters.

Many scientific and engineering models feature data with inherently discrete characteristics, where discrete means that the data takes on a finite set of possible values. Examples of such data include phrases in text to objects in an image. Similarly, nearly all aspects of data science involve discrete tasks such as data summarization and model explanation. As computational methods pervade all aspects of science and engineering, it is of great importance to understand which discrete formulations can be solved efficiently and how to do so. Many of these problems are notoriously hard, and even those that are theoretically solvable may only be possible for only small amounts of data. However, the problems of practical interest are often much more well-behaved and possess inherent structure that allows them to be solved more efficiently. This CAREER award aims to substantially advance the frontiers of large-scale discrete optimization in data science and machine learning by developing fundamentally new algorithms. This project will also provide a number of educational opportunities such as outreach to local high school and middle school students through Yale's Pathways to Science program.<br/><br/>Just as convexity has been a celebrated and well-studied condition under which continuous optimization is tractable, submodularity is a condition for which discrete objectives may be optimized. While current research in submodular optimization has led to fundamental breakthroughs in discrete mathematical programming, there is still a large gap between the theory and the limitations of the existing algorithms used by practitioners in the real world. In particular, most of the existing submodular optimization methods fail miserably when faced with the numerous sources of uncertainty inherent in machine learning tasks, from noise in the data to variability of the true objective.  Moreover, submodularity is too strong an assumption for a variety of novel machine learning applications, necessitating the development of completely new algorithms. In order to lift current provable methods out of the sterile lab environment and scale them into the messy real world, it is important to carefully reexamine their limitations, consider more realistic but less perfect conditions, and develop correspondingly robust yet scalable algorithms. This CAREER project presents a research plan towards designing, analyzing, and evaluating new approaches for robust submodular optimization at a massive scale that leads to solving a broad array of optimization problems of significant practical importance. Furthermore, it addresses generalizations of submodular functions that widely broaden the applicability of these methods, moving to a realm beyond submodularity. The research directions in this project have deep and far-reaching societal benefits, as robust and scalable computational methods play a central role in nearly every scientific and industrial venture in today's information age. Such advances are expected to play crucial roles in enabling data-driven scientific discoveries, promoting fairness in machine learning, and supporting STEM education by helping these communities handle the computational challenges associated with big data. The results of this project will be broadly disseminated to the greater scientific community through tutorials, workshops, and open-source software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet the diverse needs and future demands of a STEM workforce, national initiatives have highlighted the importance of encouraging students from underserved groups to explore STEM careers. This project, called Virtual Access to STEM Careers (VASC), investigates a problem-based learning curriculum designed to remove some of the traditional barriers that prevent underserved students from participating in authentic STEM learning opportunities.  Focused on grades 3-5, VASC employs a range of activities in Immersive Virtual Environments using multiple platforms and in different interaction modalities to meet the needs of schools which lack the resources and infrastructure to invest extensively in costly technologies. The strategic emphasis placed at the elementary level underscores the importance of preventing ""a crack in the STEM pipeline"" when transitioning to middle school level coursework where research indicates students who once had interest in a STEM career often lose interest. The first phase of VASC focuses on STEM career exposure in marine, geological, and computer sciences. To capture learner curiosity, students will investigate the life cycle of the loggerhead sea turtle, a species that nests widely on North Carolina beaches and is currently listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The sea turtle is a wonderful and powerful model for building the VASC learning platform because during their lifespan, they travel great distances (thousands of miles during migrations) and experience a wide range of physical and chemical ocean conditions, as well as substantial ecological interactions with numerous marine plant and animal species. Thus, understanding the life cycle of a sea turtle exposes young learners to numerous STEM applications as well as the careers of those that investigate and protect sea turtle populations. Students will also take on the roles and responsibilities of different STEM occupations ""in the field"" as well as in the ""lab"" when engaging in the problem-based learning model. <br/><br/>Goals for this project include 1) developing virtual technologies using input from conservationists, scientists, and the educational team, 2) constructing a STEM curriculum that is accessible to underserved populations, and 3) implementing an iterative assessment process of the curriculum which will allow for testing and retesting modifications effectively and efficiently. Researchers aim to advance Situated Cognition Theory through combining Problem Based Learning and Immersive Virtual Environments as an innovative pedagogical model to effect change. In order to test the efficacy of the VASC curriculum, the following research questions will be examined: (1) What learning experiences involving emerging technologies effectively enable diverse populations of students to gain familiarity and relevant competencies with these technologies, and what factors influence the outcomes of the learning experiences? and (2) What culturally-responsive instructional and curricular practices and models used by teachers enhance student understanding of and interest in STEM occupations and what factors influence the outcomes of the practices and models? The research team of science education, special education, and computer science faculty from the University of North Carolina Wilmington works closely with community stakeholders including Bald Head Island Conservancy, Fort Fisher State Recreation Area, and MarineQuest which serves as an educational outreach program situated at the university. This partnership is equipped to provide the necessary real-world examples of STEM careers, programming to engage participants, and locations to inspire curricular, technological, and experimental development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This center jointly conducts international research and professional training activities for US graduate students. Built environment sustainability as a global challenge affects the well-being of hundreds of millions of people, their communities, and the future of their lives. Hong Kong's unique sustainable urban development challenges and solutions can offer US students exceptional international research experiences on this topic. This project prepares US graduate students to deal with this global challenge and develops a diverse, globally competitive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce.  Drs. Yimin Zhu, Tracey Rizzuto, and Tyree Mitchell at LSU, Dr. Yong Tao at ASTFE, and Dr. Geoffrey Shen at HKPU are key members of the project. The Center utilizes the US universities' strengths in research and leadership training, the ASTFE?s vast professional networks, and an NSF-funded research network (i.e., RCN-SEES-SHBE) to develop the Center's infrastructure. Faculty at the Research Institute of Sustainable Urban Development (RISUD) at HKPU form an initial pool of multidisciplinary experts in architecture, engineering, construction, computer science, and social sciences to provide mentorship for US students in Hong Kong. The broad network established by the collaboration among ASTFE, professional societies, and academic communities enables the PIs to recruit graduate students from underrepresented groups throughout the nation. This project serves as a prototype for providing international research experiences for graduate students in an immersive environment beyond the typical academic circles.  <br/><br/>The Center pilots three annual programs involving a total of 19 US graduate students. Each annual program lasts for nine months including a pre-visit virtual training camp, an eight-week visit to Hong Kong by US students, and an eight-week post-visit program. The pre-visit virtual training camp provides self-paced online learning programs on leadership development and built environment sustainability, information of program logistics, and virtual teaming opportunities for US and Hong Kong students and mentors. The eight-week visit to Hong Kong engages the students with an innovation lab and culturally immersed research and professional development activities in Hong Kong. The post-visit program highlights US students and mentors hosting Hong Kong peers in the US, continued collaboration between US students and Hong Kong peers. An annual event is held at the end of the nine-month program. Throughout the program, US students with their Hong Kong peers conduct research in areas of built environment sustainability. The program also organizes student-led activities such as developing student chapters and activities, poster sessions, and webinars for students to practice leadership skills and develop professional networks. It is an objective of the project for the PIs to explore a model focusing on scalability and reciprocity to ensure the best chance of maximizing benefits for all stakeholders, increase the partnership among academia, industries, and professional societies domestically and internationally, and sustain the project beyond its proposed duration. In Years 2 and 3, the PIs seek to include additional universities in Hong Kong that are interested in participating with their own funding. The Center plans to work with other professional societies to explore the extension of this model to other disciplines.  In addition to publishing research results, the project team utilizes ASTFE's media and outreach programs, a website of the Center, and social media to publicize student activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These vulnerabilities are very tricky to detect, and there are no existing automated techniques to protect critical software from being released with these dangerous flaws. This project is developing new and transformative approaches for detecting code injection vulnerabilities in complex, large-scale systems. The line between high-assurance and general-purpose software is increasingly blurred, as nowadays nearly any insecure software can have severe economic consequences. Hence, this project is developing, validating and disseminating better tools that any engineer can use to detect code injection vulnerabilities in their applications during testing (without requiring specialized security knowledge).<br/><br/>To detect these vulnerabilities, this project harnesses the combined power of both human developers and automated dynamic program analysis, combining existing test suites with dynamic dataflow analysis. Given an existing (and perhaps low quality) developer-written test suite, this project simultaneously increases the depth of each test (adding new security-related checks to each test) and the breadth of each test (ensuring that the test suite thoroughly validates each security check). When one of these tests suggests that there might be a vulnerability, the tool will generate a proof-of-exploit test case that demonstrates the existence of the exploit and allows developers to understand and debug the issue, preventing it from escaping to the wild. The tools will be carefully designed to be adoptable by everyday software engineers without requiring specialized knowledge of program analysis, with easy integration with existing tooling and continuous integration infrastructure. This project involves undergraduate and graduate students in research. All software and curricula resulting from this project will be freely and publicly available; the resulting tools will be publicly disseminated and are expected to be useful for other testing and security researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To fight potential pathogens, plants have evolved a complex defense system that detects the presence of potential pathogens and activates multiple responses to restrict pathogen proliferation and prevent tissue damage. Some of these responses include the fortification of the cell wall and the release of molecules with antimicrobial properties. In spite of these and other defense responses diseases still occur because pathogens have also evolved multiple strategies to avoid the plant defense system. The objective of this project is to understand how plants fortify the cell wall and release antimicrobials, and how pathogens interfere with these processes. This knowledge will shed light into new approaches to control plant diseases and reduce their economic and societal impact. The research activities from this project will be used to engage undergraduate students from under-represented minorities, and will provide multi-disciplinary training for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, who will also be mentors in the outreach activities. <br/><br/>The plant endomembrane system is essential for pathogen recognition, and for the deployment of defense responses such as the remodeling of the cell wall and the delivery of proteins with antimicrobial properties to the extracellular milieu (apoplast). Both of these responses require protein secretion, a process that has been investigated but remains poorly understood, especially in plants, as it involves multiple and highly dynamic subcellular compartments, trafficking pathways and protein networks. Because endomembrane-mediated processes are essential in plant-pathogen interactions, these processes are also targets of pathogen's virulence factors, but the strategies that pathogens use have not been well characterized. The main objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding into secretory pathways and signaling networks regulating plant defense responses and how these processes are targeted by virulence factors from bacterial pathogens. This project will use multi-disciplinary approaches involving live-cell imaging and proteomics technologies in combination with biological, genetic and biochemical assays to identify subcellular compartments, trafficking pathways and protein networks operating in cell wall remodeling and delivery of antimicrobial proteins to the apoplast. The project will also provide a framework to compare how bacterial pathogens with contrasting lifestyles trigger distinct sets of molecular and cellular responses, and how synergistic interactions between virulence factors from adapted bacterial pathogens subvert plant immune responses.

Minerals in the slab containing water break down when exposed to the high temperatures encountered at depth beneath the seafloor, releasing fluids which ultimately lead to the production of magmas and explosive volcanism. In addition, these fluids are thought to influence the occurrence of earthquakes in the subduction zone. Fluids released by the subducting slab contain fluid mobile elements, such as lithium, chlorine and boron, and the composition of the fluids is diagnostic of the source in the subducting slab (sediments, oceanic crust, mantle) from which they derived. Cold and thermal springs located above the subducting slab provide a window into the fluids released at depth in a subduction zone. This project will investigate the geochemistry of spring fluids located off of Costa Rica between the subduction trench and the volcanoes produced by magmatism to identify the sources and amount of slab-derived fluids released at depth within a subduction zone. This information is necessary to understand volcano and earthquake behavior along active plate margins. This work will also provide scientific training for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach presentations on subduction zones and associated hazards to the public in both the United States and Costa Rica.<br/><br/>Subduction zones are crucial for understanding the chemistry deep and shallow reservoirs of Earth, yet very little is known about volatile behavior in forearc regimes. Here we propose to quantify the Li, B, and halogen budget throughout the inner subaerial forearc of Costa Rica through a geochemical investigation of forearc cold and thermal spring fluids. Lithium, boron, and the halogens (Cl, F, Br, I) are all highly fluid-mobile elements. Their incompatibility in minerals limits modification by fluid-rock interaction, thereby making them reliable tracers of fluid source. Costa Rica is an ideal locality for study because it is one of the few subduction zones in which forearc springs are subaerial due to the presence of several peninsulas and therefore easily accessible to sampling. Two of the peninsulas (Nicoya and Osa) are directly over the seismogenic zone and both are sites of large megathrust earthquakes. Slow slip events have also been observed in the Nicoya Peninsula. Elevated fluid pressures, commonly thought to be derived from metamorphic dehydration reactions, lower the effective stress and are therefore commonly invoked as a mechanism for aseismic slip. Fluids from forearc springs provide us with a direct window to fluid sources at seismogenic depths in subduction zones. Through the combined use of Li, B, and Cl stable isotopes, elemental concentrations, and elemental ratios (e.g., Br/Cl, I/Cl, B/Cl, Li/B), the following will be completed: 1) Identify the change(s) in slab-derived source along and across the forearc and how prograde metamorphism of the subducting slab controls Li, B, and halogen concentrations and isotope compositions across the forearc; 2) Provide an integrated view of loss of fluid-mobile elements during shallow subduction processes contributing to an improved evaluation of cycling through subduction zones; and 3) Evaluate correlation, or lack thereof, between varying fluid sources and seismic behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is problematic for robust discrimination of species, and in turn impedes efforts to understand their ecology, protect biodiversity and control diseases. In this project, a data-rich genomic approach will be used to comprehensively analyze the evolutionary relationships in this superfamily, revise higher taxonomy, describe new species, and match adult and juvenile helminth stages.

However, reefs are among the most threatened marine environments, and coral disease is having a devastating impact on these valued systems. In early 2019, a multi-species rapid tissue loss disease matching the description of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) was found severely affecting a reef off the southwest coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). SCTLD has been devastating coral reef communities in southeast Florida for the last four years, and was very recently reported from disparate areas around the Caribbean, including Mexico, Jamaica, and St. Martin. Rapid surveys by the investigators at the University of the Virgin Islands believe that a 50 km2 area southwest of St. Thomas is the initial incidence area of the disease, but will likely spread across the USVI, British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This study performs  experiments to understand how this disease affects coral species immune traits and compares the microbiology and physiology of disease samples in the USVI to samples from Florida. It also examines how changing the species composition of a coral community affects the spread and impact of the disease. The overall aim is to produce a model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. The project contributes to the research training of at least 2 undergraduates, 2 M.S. students, and 3 Ph.D. students, who benefit from cross-investigator mentoring. The research team includes representatives to the Coral Disease Advisory Committees for the USVI and Florida, which ensures rapid communication of  findings to management bodies in both regions. <br/><br/>Coral disease is a significant and increasing threat to Caribbean coral reef systems. Recent results demonstrate that coral species immune traits can predict disease resistance, and thus, forecast impacts to coral community structure, under multi-species coral disease. The onset of this epizootic in the USVI offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the impact of coral resistance, tolerance and immune traits on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak that could profoundly change the diversity of Caribbean reefs. It is hypothesized that the abundance of highly susceptible species dictates 1) the onset of disease at reef sites downstream of the initial incidence area, and 2) the spread of disease within reef sites. Furthermore, 3) downstream reef sites where highly susceptible species are removed or treated show lower immune responses in all susceptible corals, later onset of disease, and slower within-site disease spread. To test these hypotheses, two experiments directly compare species responses to disease exposure and test the effect of species assemblage on coral immune function and disease spread. Results from these experiments aim to inform a generalizable model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. Results of this project include direct comparison of the USVI disease to Florida SCTLD and a better understanding of how the abundance of highly susceptible host species impacts the spread of disease during the early onset of a multi-species panzootic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the project is to simulate an economy in the laboratory within which we can trigger a permanent decline in economic activity along with falling prices, and then to explore various policy interventions that have the potential to repair the stagnant economy. In particular, the project focuses on what actions policy makers can take (monetary and fiscal policy) to restore the experimental economy to full employment.  The research explores whether the timing and contextual communication of policy can influence the efficacy of policy. <br/> <br/>The laboratory experiments in this project are designed to explore secular stagnation in a closed economy. Specifically, the research implements a recent formalization of secular stagnation that uses an overlapping-generations structure to break the representative agent assumption and allow for endogenous bouts of activity at the zero lower bound (ZLB).  Exogenous deleveraging shocks can trigger spending gluts that create deflation, and lead to a secular stagnation equilibrium, which can be unique. The objective of the research is to identify whether deflationary and inflationary equilibria emerge when they are unique, and to explore equilibrium selection when multiple equilibria exist. Additionally, the project investigates the ability of monetary policy, in the form of inflation targeting, and fiscal policy, consisting of ""helicopter drops"" financed using lump-sum taxes levied on the middle-aged cohort in our experimental economy, to pull the economy out of a deflationary equilibrium following a debt-deleveraging shock. Both potential remedies improve economic conditions through an expectations channel by making households more optimistic about future economic conditions. Finally, the project studies the effect of variation in both the timing and contextual communication of policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a widely used form of DL, is a key behind much of this progress. With such spectacular growth in traditional applications, DNNs and other DL technologies are also increasingly being used in safety-critical systems such as autonomous cars, medical diagnosis, malware detection, and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Such a wide adoption of DL techniques carries with it concerns about the reliability of these systems, as several high-profile instances of DL-based behavior have already been reported. Thus, it has become crucial to rigorously test these applications with realistic corner cases to ensure high reliability. However, due to the fundamental architectural differences between DL implementations such as DNNs and traditional software, existing software testing techniques do not apply to them in any obvious way. In fact, companies like Google, Tesla, etc. are increasingly confronting software testing challenges to ensure reliable and safe DL applications.  Therefore,  systematically testing DL-based software systems will be a significant step towards increasing safety and reliability of sensitive and safety-critical DL systems.<br/><br/>This project will design, implement, and evaluate a novel software testing framework to assess the reliability of the Deep Learning applications and detect buggy behaviors during the application development and maintenance phase. In particular, the proposed framework will develop novel white-box testing strategies, realistic test-case generation techniques, and regression testing techniques to assess DL applications. A unique characteristic of the DL-based programming paradigm is that the end applications highly depend on the training data. Therefore, the research will build novel white-box testing strategies to evaluate both the model and the training data together as a whole system. In addition, this research will design and deploy techniques to generate new test cases that capture the real-world corner-case behavior where the DL applications may fail. The project will also investigate how any changes in data or model architecture can impact a pre-trained model in order to guide regression test case selection and prioritization process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Differential privacy has emerged as a leading notion supporting efficient and accurate data analyses that respect privacy. But designing and implementing efficient differentially private data analyses with high utility can be challenging and error prone. Even privacy experts have released code with bugs or designed incorrect algorithms. Programming platforms and formal verification tools can assist data analysts in designing differentially private data analyses without bugs. However, the current approaches have two limitations: first, they support reasoning about privacy but not about accuracy and efficiency which are two other important aspects of data analyses; second, they support reasoning about idealized data analyses but not about their implementations on finite computers. The goal of this project is to overcome these two limitations by developing novel formal verification techniques and tools supporting formal reasoning combining privacy, accuracy, and efficiency guarantees for both data analyses, and their implementations. The results of this project will contribute to develop foundational methods for privacy-preserving technology which can benefit society by improving and promoting safer practices in handling private or sensitive data. Moreover, the project will support educational activities aimed at training students with a global view on data privacy and its practices, and outreach activities aimed at investigating ways in which privacy policies and standards can be impacted by the results of this research.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this proposal is the theoretical and technological development of verification techniques and tools that can enable the design of data analyses that are private, accurate, efficient, and with verified implementations. To achieve this goal the project will focus on three concrete directions: first, it will develop formal verification techniques to reason in a formal way about the accuracy of differentially private data analyses; second, it will develop resource analysis techniques to reason about the efficiency of a data analysis in terms of computing time and space, and in terms of the number of needed data samples; third, it will develop reasoning techniques to verify the privacy, accuracy and efficiency of implementations of differentially private algorithms on finite computers. These techniques will be implement as a type-based verification framework, named FormalDP, which will thus support type-based formal reasoning combining privacy, accuracy and efficiency for data analyses and their implementations. The effectiveness of this approach will be assessed through experimental studies about the level of accuracy and efficiency that verified differentially private implementations can achieve.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. is investing millions of dollars to reduce nitrogen to coastal regions and embarking on large-scale saltmarsh restoration costing millions to billions of dollars to restore lost ecosystem services. Currently, it is unknown how quickly or if ecosystem services will return after nutrient inputs are cut. This research will provide insight into nitrogen pollution as a cause of marsh loss and the potential for ecosystem recovery with management strategies. There are several education efforts associated with this project that will train students. The project enhances education by developing high school curriculum on ""Research and Resiliency: Investigating the Local Effects of Global Changes"" in collaboration with the Massachusetts Audubon Society. A program for mid-career journalists about environmental science will also be developed. This project will facilitate sustainability and provide a science-based foundation for state and federal nutrient standards. <br/><br/>This project will address how the effects of historical nutrient over enrichment influences the ability of marshes to recover their ability to provide ecosystem services. The project will use a combination of whole-ecosystem experimental manipulations, field measurements of key species, assays of genetic change, nutrient and carbon cycle processes, and food-web structure in six experimental sites to determine recovery trajectories. Researchers will measure changes in the decomposer community genetic diversity and activity by sequence amplicons of functional genes responsible for encoding key enzymes in the nitrogen cycling processes. The project will measure plant traits and genotypic diversity. The recovery of carbon and nitrogen cycling will be determined from marsh geomorphology, habitat-specific denitrification rates, nitrogen exchange with the open bay, and decomposition. Measuring the species diversity, abundance and productivity and stable isotope of invertebrates and fish will assess food web recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It does so by examining the emergence of a new policy mandate of the US National Institutes of Health. Called 'Sex as a Biological Variable,' these policies require the inclusion of equal numbers of male and female cells and animals in all pre-clinical research funded by the NIH. While scholars have shown that the production of biological knowledge is shaped by the assumptions of scientific researchers, far less is known about the role of government agencies and regulatory processes in reproducing certain forms of biological difference. Using archival data and other textual materials, as well as interviews with stakeholders, this project examines the processes by which the NIH developed policies mandating the examination of sex differences in basic and pre-clinical research. The overall aim is to show how particular accounts of sex and gender become institutionalized through regulation and rule-making. <br/><br/>This is a multi-method investigation into the ways in which embodied difference, knowledge, institutions, and rule-making serve to produce sex and gender as distinct categories of personhood.

The project synthesizes data from archives, public policy documents, and interviews with stakeholders to understand how biological difference comes to be constructed as an object of scientific and medical inquiry that is knowable by certain experts who are granted legitimacy as knowledge-producers, while other accounts are denied institutional support. In doing so it advances literature in science and technology studies on the intersection of gender roles and regulatory interventions and on the influence of gender ideology on the work of scientific researchers and medical practitioners. Overall, the project seeks to explain how certain forms of difference come to be presumed biological and privileged as such within research policy and to examine how actors and organizations located outside of the NIH influence or attempt to influence such policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to turn genes on or off can determine the fate of a cell.  With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division, with cofounding from the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences is supporting Dr. Angela Koehler from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Dr. Koehler is designing and synthesizing new chemical compounds that can change the ""master program"" that turns genes on and off in a cell. One such compound acts as a molecular glue that holds two molecules of a gene regulator together and, in doing so, turns off a set of genes that have been implicated in human disease. The studies in this project capture atomic level snapshots of the genes and complex together. These pictures allow the design of new molecules that can serve as stronger molecular glues. The results from these studies may provide researchers with molecular tools to reprogram cells and change their activity. The research program is integrated with an education plan to train graduate students and visiting undergraduates (including those from groups that are under-represented in STEM) in advanced biochemical methods. These methods include X-ray crystallography (used to develop atomic pictures of molecules), computer modeling (to help design new molecules), and chemical synthesis (to create the newly designed molecular glues). Dr. Koehler participates in the Broad Institute Summer Research Program, which provides research opportunities to students from under-represented groups from various colleges and universities.  She leads an outreach project to develop an interactive game and coloring books as resources to teach the concepts of ""good"" and ""bad"" molecular interactions (through analogies to comic book type characters) at the K-12 level. The research group also participates in the Cambridge Science Festival Cancer Program at the Boston Museum of Science, in which the concepts of small molecule-protein binding are presented through analogy to interactions among people. <br/> <br/>This research project applies chemical approaches to reprogram gene expression networks by targeting master regulator transcription factors. Molecular compounds that reprogram transcription and alter the fate of cells are tools in synthetic biology, and facilitate the study of cellular development or causes of human disease. The focus of this project is to design molecular compounds that act as glues that can stabilize the repressive homodimeric form of the MAX transcription factor. A published chemical probe (KI-MS2-008) that binds to and stabilizes MAX serves a starting point for structure-guided design of new molecular glues with different chemical core scaffolds. The crystal structure of KI-MS2-008 with MAX elucidates details for how this asymmetric binder stabilizes the homodimeric protein. Structures of the MAX/KI-MS2-008 complex in the presence or absence of DNA guides the design of new molecular glue chemotypes with improved chemical properties and enhanced cellular activity. These new chemotypes are characterized for their effects on the binding of MAX to chromatin and subsequent effects on global patterns of transcriptional activity. General principles resulting from this study aid in the development of molecular glues for other transcriptional homodimers. The project provides graduate students and visiting undergraduates from under-represented groups with opportunities to acquire specialized training in X-ray crystallography, molecular modeling, and synthetic chemistry. The project also contributes to a module in an undergraduate lab course focused on cutting-edge methods in molecular-level engineering of protein interactions and perturbation of cellular systems. Finally, the project forms the basis of a ""small molecule detectives"" effort for K-12 students interested in perturbing cellular systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project seeks to develop a new method of separating agriculture biomass residues based on their electrostatic properties rather than size and density. <br/><br/>Conventional wet processes to the purification of protein-rich biomass residues require large amounts of water and energy and the native functionality of the proteins is lost due to pH changes and temperature effects required for dehydration. This project will employ a tribo-electrostatic technique to pneumatically transfer milled agricultural residues into a fluidized bed reservoir where protein and fiber particles in the flour will be charged to different levels through collisions with the wall of the bed and/or interparticle contact, before being separated under the influence of an electric field. The long-term research goals are to expand the application of tribo-electrostatic separation (TES) technology to fractionate lignocellulosic biomass residues to further evaluate their tribo-charging behavior and to investigate the quality of the produced fractions for biofuel production. Moreover, these principles can be potentially used for food powder coating as well as coating solid pharmaceutical dosage forms to eliminate the use of organic solvents during conventional liquid coating technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historical sources, which are few in number, describe how these communities fought or fled slave raiders, but a key question remains unanswered - how did these strategies transform political, economic, and cultural relations among societies on the edge of the Atlantic world? Archaeology is well-placed to answer this question by examining evidence for changing social relations within and between village communities before, during, and after the rise of the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. Most broadly, this research will cast new light on the historical causes and consequences of a violent social rupture shared by both Africans and the African Diaspora in the Americas. More specifically, it will foster innovative research opportunities for university students and public outreach collaborations with local communities, including the installation of  a museum exhibit at a UNESCO world heritage cultural center in the region. By exploring local responses to global processes over the long-term, this research can also inform forward-looking approaches to US political and economic engagement in rural Africa and other regions on the periphery of the modern world system. <br/><br/>Dr. Gokee and his research team will examine how the Atlantic slave trade impacted social life in a West African ""hatter zone"" - a region where people fought, fled, and/or joined the predatory political economies of neighboring states. Focusing on the Bandafassi region of eastern Senegal, this project will identify the social rules of of inclusion and exclusion that defined who could be enslaved by whom, and under what conditions, over the past several centuries. Researchers will identify these patterns through landscape survey and detailed mapping of past village sites, including riverside locales associated with merchants and militias and highland settlements associated with the people avoiding them. Analyses of the artifacts from these sites, including a microscopic study of pottery, will document how economic processes of production and exchange also shaped the social relations within and between different village communities. The specialized collection and luminescence dating of pottery samples will then reveal how the village societies of Bandafassi did or did not change over time, particularly in response to the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. These methods will generate new data for better modelling how global forces impact local communities in shatter zones past and present, while also providing novel opportunities for public outreach and student education and research in the US and Senegal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Driven by the rich profit, relentless malware developers apply various obfuscation schemes to circumvent malware detection. Binary packing is the most common obfuscation adopted by malware authors to camouflage malicious code and defeat popular signature-based malware detection. Binary packing first encrypts or compresses malware code as data, making it immune to static analysis. At run time, the attached unpacking routine writes the decoded code to memory and then resumes malicious payload execution. Over the past two decades, packed malware has been a challenge in the anti-malware landscape. This project addresses this problem from new angles and advances the state of the art in terms of better performance and stronger anti-analysis resistance. The project's novelties are new methods and efficient tools to extract packed malware payload without the prior knowledge of packers. The project's impacts are paving the way for large-scale malware analysis and helping people respond to emerging malware attacks promptly.<br/><br/>Existing generic binary unpacking work suffers from high runtime overhead and lack of anti-analysis resistance. This project conducts an in-depth study on an enormous variety of malware packers and reveals promising research directions to address the long-standing binary unpacking problem. Based on the investigator's encouraging preliminary results, this project goes one step further to address the unsolved challenges and pave the last mile to a complete generic unpacking solution. This project develops a novel machine learning model to extract the semantics of the original entry point. The proposed technique notably outperforms existing search heuristics. This project's hybrid de-obfuscation approaches enable unpacking tools to recover a fully functional version of the original binary, which is the ultimate goal of unpacking technique. To achieve stronger resilience to various anti-analysis attacks, the investigator advances the use of hardware supported lower-level features to detecting the end of unpacking.  The proposed methods can handle a broader range of malware packers, even brand new packers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Police departments rely increasingly on various policing technologies, including the use of biometric and spatial profiling data. Yet there is little research on the interplay of these policing technologies and their social and geographic impacts on local communities, particularly communities of color. Understanding how these technologies impact children's perceptions of policing, identity, place, and personal security have the potential of improving law enforcement and public well-being. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising young scholar to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>The doctoral student will examine perceptions and spatial interactions between police and children from minority groups. Specifically, this research asks, what are the spatial interactions between law-enforcement and children from minority communities, and what are the impacts on children's well-being of those interactions. The doctoral student will use a mixed-method approach to collect data through interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. Children's perceptions and spatial interactions will be understood via the production of visual interpretive materials such as drawings, comics, and mental maps. Findings will be presented in community workshops, community-council meetings and police-community meetings in ways designed to open dialog regarding police policies, practices, and community impacts.

In fact, all plants on Earth live in close association with diverse microorganisms that greatly impact plant health. As a result, the microbial communities that associate with plants can have large implications for agriculture, forestry, and ecosystems. Mycorrhizal fungi are among the most common beneficial fungi, mining soil nutrients and delivering them to plants in exchange for sugars. However, the impact they have on plants depends on the type of fungal species present. Environmental factors and dispersal determine microbial community structure, but little is known about how microbes disperse long distances. This CAREER award combines multiple approaches using data science, laboratory, and large-scale field experiments at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to study fungal dispersal. This proposal will involve high school students in science activities and improve graduate education in ecological data science. Finally, this project will study barriers that limit the participation of minority students in ecology to develop recommendations to improve recruiting and retention.<br/><br/>For nearly 100 years, the ""everything is everywhere"" hypothesis has dominated microbial ecology, suggesting that microbial dispersal is unlimited and community assembly mechanisms are primarily deterministic. However, certain fungi vary with respect to traits that could impact their long-distance dispersal capabilities. Coupling knowledge of traits with physical laws that govern movement could provide a powerful framework to predict dispersal, a key component of biogeography. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form no aboveground structures, and reproduce via asexual spores with substantially varying traits (e.g. size, surface ornamentation) that are likely to impact long-distance dispersal. The mechanisms and extent of AM fungal dispersal are poorly understood, yet, to manage AM fungal communities for improved symbiotic functioning, taxon-specific information regarding dispersal capabilities is required. This study combines trait-based ecology, macroecology, and physical laws to study aerial dispersal of AM fungi through the following research objectives: 1. Create an AM fungal trait database to examine conservatism among phylogenetic groups in all spore traits that potentially facilitate aerial dispersal, 2. Examine community structure and spore traits of aerial AM fungi at NEON sites and Chicago urban sites to identify eco-climatic properties that predict aerial dispersal, and 3. Compare the observed terminal velocity to that predicted by Stokes's Law for movement of a smooth sphere for AM fungal spores with different morphological traits. This CAREER award will illuminate the thus far speculative role of dispersal in driving continent-scale patterns in microbial biogeography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the mechanism through which temperature influences gonad development has been a puzzle since the discovery of this phenomenon 50 years ago. Previously, the Capel lab identified two genes that show strong expression differences in the turtle gonad at male- versus female-producing temperatures. In this project, the lab will determine how the expression of these genes is controlled by temperature, and how the activity of these genes controls testis versus ovary development. Results from this work will establish the mechanism underlying the effect of temperature on male or female development. The lab is actively involved in using this project as a platform to engage young students and the public in scientific research. This project is also a strong platform to advocate for evidence-based science in setting environmental policies to mitigate the effects of climate change, expected to strongly bias male/female ratios in species where temperature influences gonad development.<br/><br/>The Capel lab previously showed that transcription of the epigenetic regulator KDM6B and the RNA-splicing factor, RBM20, are elevated in the turtle gonad at male-producing temperature. KDM6B activates the testis pathway by removing repressive histone marks at DMRT1, a conserved regulator of testis development. In this project, the lab plans to identify the molecular pathway linking temperature with changes in KDM6B and RBM20 transcription and splicing. The lab hypothesizes that a known repressor of KDM6B, pSTAT3, is differentially phosphorylated at high female-producing temperatures through activation of TRP channels, Ca2+ influx, and high activity of CAMK. To test this hypothesis, markers of the male and female pathways will be measured after knockdowns of TRP channels expressed in the gonad, after interference with Ca2+ signaling, or after of pSTAT3 inhibitors. Experiments will (1) determine whether RBM20 is also a target of pSTAT3, or downstream of KDM6B, and (2) test the role of RBM20 using a knock-down approach. Splicoform variants will be analyzed at the two temperatures using the lab's new T. scripta genome assembly. Results will establish the molecular basis for temperature-dependent gonad determination, and may uncover a conserved role for splicing in gonad development.

Understanding how such a diversity of plants can exist in these areas, without a handful of species taking over, remains a long-standing issue in ecology.  Processes acting on seedlings may be particularly important for determining the number and types of plants found in these forests. The present study will examine how factors such as light and water availability, and the types and number of neighboring plants influence seedling survival and help maintain plant diversity. Understanding how diversity is maintained is important for conserving and managing forests and preserving the services they provide.  This project will integrate research with educational activities, including classroom-based and field trip courses on tropical forest ecology and conservation.  Videos for online training programs targeting environmental decision makers will also be developed.<br/><br/>The project will take advantage of a strong rainfall gradient in central Panama to investigate how the relative importance of different drivers of seedling growth and survival shift with changes in rainfall and dry season severity. In addition, the project will examine how species characteristics -traits like wood density and leaf area- determine seedling responses to their local environment. Data collected at field sites in Panama will be used to develop new computer models that simulate forest dynamics over multiple generations in order to assess the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic drivers of seedling performance to tree species coexistence. This integration of field data and novel forest simulation models will significantly advance understanding of the key mechanisms shaping tropical tree communities and will provide a framework for predicting changes in tropical forest diversity and species composition in response to shifts in climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach is to create open source analytics solutions to enable novel transportation applications that utilize data from low-cost video sensors. Video data are processed using edge computing (inexpensive computing hardware that performs analysis without storing significant amounts of data) in order to reduce the amount of data stored. Social dimensions of the research project emerge from the deep research partnership between the City and the University, with the goal to provide replicable and near-term social impacts. The project aligns with the Vision Zero concept to reduce traffic fatalities, with programs that are based on education, enforcement and design. By understanding the risk profile of an intersection through automated detection of near miss events, communities will be able to proactively design and alter streets and intersections to be safer. <br/><br/>The goal of designing a smart city, when addressing the technical challenges at the intersection, street and system levels, has several research components. (i) Development of new algorithms for multi-target tracking: The problems of occlusion, temporal assignment of features to objects and target motion will be jointly formulated. (ii) Integrated optimization and simulation for signal control: We formulate the problem of estimating signal control parameters (offsets, phasing etc.) in a network as one of global optimization. (iii) Real-time reinforcement learning is a natural choice when online machine learning meets real world feedback from the City. Our ability to obtain and analyze continuous-time data at the network level will provide insights on how conflict points and patterns can change through the network. This is expected to impact decisions in traffic management, smart city planning and safety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data sharing between the child welfare system and other institutions thus facilitates the investigation of and intervention in cases of child maltreatment. One consequence of this collaboration, however, is that families may avoid institutions that provide necessary resources out of fear of coming into contact with the child welfare system. This project analyzes under what circumstances institutional engagement is associated with a greater likelihood of child protective services involvement, as well as how child protective services involvement is related to future institutional engagement. Exploring how interactions with the child welfare system constrain family willingness to access needed services sheds light on one understudied mechanism in the reproduction of social stratification. Findings from this project will generate policy and policy implementation strategies for encouraging appropriate social service uptake and better collaboration between social service workers and clients.<br/><br/>This project utilizes both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative portion of project will analyze data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study (FFCWS). Currently available FFCWS data follow nearly five thousand children and their families from the focal child's birth to age fifteen, with an oversampling of children born to unmarried mothers. Statistical techniques such as generalized linear models will be used to estimate associations between child welfare system involvement and service utilization. In addition, the project involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 40 social service employees. Interview topics will include how and when respondents decide to report child maltreatment, what evidence they use, and how professional norms shape these decision-making processes. This project will provide evidence regarding social service usage among low-income families, with implications for sociological theories regarding stratification, family and child outcomes, and maternal contact with the child welfare system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The students will also engage in career development activities through the Leadership Alliance,  which is a national consortium comprised of 36 PhD-granting Institutions, Minority-Serving Institutions and private industry dedicated to training and mentoring students from diverse cultural and academic backgrounds for competitive graduate programs and professional research-based careers. A primary goal of this REU Site is to recruit eight students, primarily from underrepresented minority groups, to engage in research in Earth and environmental science.  The program will support a different group of students for nine weeks in each of three summers.  Research projects will include work on the record and consequences of climate change, the physics of volcanic eruptions, the structure of the Earth's interior inferred from seismic waves, and other fundamental topics in the Earth and environmental sciences. This research experience will help the students to develop skills with critical thinking, research methodologies, scientific writing and oral presentations.  Through their research and a range of other activities, students will also gain insight on possible pathways through graduate school and research careers.  These activities include a weekly study group, the Leadership Alliance National Symposium, participation in a national science meeting, as well as other professional development and networking events. This project is jointly funded by the Earth Sciences REU program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This REU Site, Dynamic Earth in the 21st Century: Undergraduate research on the evolution of Earth's interior, surface and climate, is a collaborative venture between the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS) at Brown University and the Leadership Alliance. Our goals are to: 1) enable a diverse group of undergraduates from outside of Brown to investigate fundamental processes regulating the evolution of the Earth's interior, surface and climate; 2) help students develop critical research, communication and professional skills, in order to increase their confidence and gain greater understanding of the research process and research careers; and 3) promote student awareness and understanding of graduate school to facilitate transition into competitive graduate programs in Earth science and the broader physical sciences. This REU Site builds on a successful three-year DEEPS-Alliance partnership that engaged 12 diverse undergraduates in innovative research and aided them on their pathways to research careers.  The Site will continue to focus on recruiting  students from underrepresented minority groups in the geosciences, women, first generation college students, students from lower income households, students who attend schools where STEM research opportunities are limited, and students with disabilities. Research projects will include those that address key questions about paleoclimate changes inferred from marine and lake sediments; ice sheet albedo and its implications for melting; human interactions with atmospheric chemistry; magma chamber properties and their potential for eruption; the determination of igneous rock thermal histories; and the properties of the lithosphere and asthenosphere measured by seismic waves. During three summers, eight student-interns will work for nine weeks with a member of the DEEPS faculty, and will be further supported by their surrounding research team, a weekly study group, and the highly effective professional development and networking programs of the Leadership Alliance, both at Brown and nationally.  The students will learn to communicate their work in writing, and through presentations at the Leadership Alliance National Symposium, a research symposium at Brown, and either the Fall American Geophysical Union or the Geological Society of America meetings. This REU Site will synthesize the well-established network of Leadership Alliance minority-serving and undergraduate-focused institutions with DEEPS research opportunities to create a new pool of research-focused, highly qualified scholars for graduate programs in the geosciences.

This is limiting advances in understanding of how cities develop and function. Ecological features like biodiversity, energy flow, nutrient cycling, hydrology and pollution loads, remain poorly understood, especially to those responsible for urban design. The flow of scientific information to urban planning, design, and policy professionals has been relatively slow. Scientific advances that may contribute to solving pressing urban problems have not been adequately incorporated into policy and practice. To improve communication between urban ecological science and the practitioners that plan, design, and manage cities, the PIs propose to bring scientists and professionals together at a unique international summit about the ecology of cities.<br/><br/>This summit is uniquely designed to equally advance both scientific understanding of cities as well as better urban societal outcomes. The PIs wish to ensure participation from a broad range of U.S. students, ecosystem scientists, and practitioners in urban ecological planning and design. They seek to broaden participation in urban ecological research and urban practice by funding attendance from members of underrepresented groups, researchers from predominantly undergraduate institutions, and practitioners who lack the funds to attend an international summit. The intended scientific outcomes are to ensure that urban ecological research addresses the most pressing uncertainties in meeting social and environmental challenges in modern cities. There is great potential for integrating cutting edge ecosystem science into many elements of city creation and management, yet currently, there are very few avenues for doing so. This summit presents a rare opportunity to create meaningful and lasting collaborations between scientists, planners, designers, artists, developers, community leaders, and elected officials who share these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This over enrichment has compromised the ability of saltmarshes to provide key ecosystem services such as buffering coastal cities from storms, providing habitat for fish and shellfish, and mitigating climate impacts by storing carbon. The U.S. is investing millions of dollars to reduce nitrogen to coastal regions and embarking on large-scale saltmarsh restoration costing millions to billions of dollars to restore lost ecosystem services. Currently, it is unknown how quickly or if ecosystem services will return after nutrient inputs are cut. This research will provide insight into nitrogen pollution as a cause of marsh loss and the potential for ecosystem recovery with management strategies. There are several education efforts associated with this project that will train students. The project enhances education by developing high school curriculum on ""Research and Resiliency: Investigating the Local Effects of Global Changes"" in collaboration with the Massachusetts Audubon Society. A program for mid-career journalists about environmental science will also be developed. This project will facilitate sustainability and provide a science-based foundation for state and federal nutrient standards. <br/><br/>This project will address how the effects of historical nutrient over enrichment influences the ability of marshes to recover their ability to provide ecosystem services. The project will use a combination of whole-ecosystem experimental manipulations, field measurements of key species, assays of genetic change, nutrient and carbon cycle processes, and food-web structure in six experimental sites to determine recovery trajectories. Researchers will measure changes in the decomposer community genetic diversity and activity by sequence amplicons of functional genes responsible for encoding key enzymes in the nitrogen cycling processes. The project will measure plant traits and genotypic diversity. The recovery of carbon and nitrogen cycling will be determined from marsh geomorphology, habitat-specific denitrification rates, nitrogen exchange with the open bay, and decomposition. Measuring the species diversity, abundance and productivity and stable isotope of invertebrates and fish will assess food web recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the application becomes older and larger, program changes become more complex. It becomes more difficult for developers to change or maintain the software efficiently and correctly. Slowly and incorrectly evolved software systems negatively impact both software producers and consumers; these systems can cause tremendous economic costs, put customers' data and privacy at risk, and even threaten people's lives. This project addresses this problem by helping computers and developers better understand, check, and apply complex changes. The project's novelty is in new methods and tools to characterize, model, validate, and suggest code modifications. The project's impacts are increasing programmer productivity, improving software reliability, reducing software cost, and protecting people and privacy data from issues caused by problematic software upgrades. <br/><br/>The project will conduct empirical studies of software projects (in the GitHub repository) to understand and characterize multi-change edits ""in the wild"" to discover frequently co-changed patterns among code and non-code entities. Using these inferred patterns, the project will classify multi-change edits into different types such as bug fixes, refactorings, and feature enhancements. Techniques will be devised to make multi-edit changes, to ensure their correctness, and to automatically repair programs' multi-change edit sequences. These capabilities will be combined with delta debugging and dynamic patch validation in a a prototype editing and testing tool called Oedit, which will automatically recover programs from erroneous software updates and upgrades. The long-term vision is to provide a programming environment that supports complex, multi-change edits, with attention to their correctness, and with self-healing capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from four European nations, seeks to predict new invasions of terrestrial plants and marine organisms that are linked to climate change in North America and Europe ecosystems. This is important because invasive alien species are significant drivers of species extinction and ecosystem degradation. Thus, their introduction into a new environment, almost always, negatively impacts ecosystem services and human well-being. This research targets climate change as a driver because there is now significant documentation that a large number of species' ranges are shifting in response to warming temperatures. This creates a type of invasion that is different from that caused by physical transportation via anthropological or other means. Prevention and/or containment of new species invasions is the first and most effective stage of invasive species management. However, it is only effective if potential invaders can be identified and prioritized for management before they arrive. Goals of this research are to identify likely terrestrial plan and marine organism species invasions and develop scenarios to prevent them via a participatory process that brings together scientists and stakeholders. Results of the work will include a searchable database of potential invaders and their probable ecological and socio-economic impacts to help managers and policymakers to prioritize high-risk species for intervention. Broader impacts of the work include research that supports proactive regulation and management of problematic alien invasive species, particularly those expected to invade and spread across the United States and Europe, as the climate changes. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between the US and France, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland. Each country will fund the component of the work carried out by its scientists. The project has strong societal benefits because invasive species have serious impacts economically and environmentally, as well as in terms of ecosystems and different regions maintaining beneficial biodiversity. Results of the project will help policy makers, industry, and other interested parties better understand possible implications of such invasions and more effectively and efficiently explore possible mitigation practices and policies. The Program notes the project is attentive to gender issues and the impact it has on broadening participation by having a gender-balanced team (4 female and 4 male PIs). It also has a strong transdisciplinary student training component.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this research seeks to understand and anticipate the multi-faceted impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity and ecosystem services and to provide tools for their management. The US component of this international collaboration focuses on predicting impacts of alien invasive and native range-shifting species. Tasks include the creation of a database of the ecological and socio-economic impacts of 100 terrestrial plants and 250 marine species. Data will be supplemented with additional empirical data from field experiments of high priority, yet presently understudied, invasive aquatic species. The resulting data will be used, in conjunction with an existing international protocol (the Environmental Impact Classification of Alien Taxa; EICAT), to examine the potential impacts of invasive terrestrial plants and marine organisms on native communities, agricultural systems, and human health. The assessment protocol will be adapted to consider both detrimental and beneficial impacts. Spatial planning tools will be used to evaluate the costs and benefits of different management and policy scenarios for preventing and mitigating invasions. Results of the analysis will be used to develop scenarios and models of biodiversity and ecosystem services to inform resource managers and policy makers about possible management of invasive species across multiple ecosystems and geographic scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also provides a quantitative measure of the quality of heart failure care provided in hospitals and clinics. Optimal management of heart failure requires adherence to evidence based clinical guidelines. The Heart Failure Guidelines were created by a multi-disciplinary committee of experts and is based on thorough review of best available clinical evidence on management of heart failure. This guideline represents a consensus among experts on the appropriate treatment and management of heart failure. However, low adherence to the clinical guideline by physicians and cardiologists is one of the major challenges in the management of heart failure. This proposal seeks to overcome this challenge. The addressable market for this technology is about $106 million yearly in the United States alone with an even larger global market and the potential to develop additional extensions to manage similar diseases. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project automates the entire set of rules in the current guideline for heart failure management. The system is based on answer set programming, a form of declarative programming suited for simulating human-style reasoning. Given a patient's information, the system generates a set of guideline-compliant recommendations. We conducted a pilot study of the system on 20 real and 10 simulated patients with heart failure. The results show that the system recommends treatments that are compliant with the guidelines for heart failure management. Out of 179 recommendations made by the system, expert cardiologists agreed upon 168 of them. The 11 recommendations that our system made not in agreement with cardiologists are due to misunderstanding of the doctor's notes or guideline which will be fixed in the future version of the software. Our research has established the foundation for automating the generation of guideline-compliant recommendations. Our plan is to develop the system into a point-of-care tool for clinic visits. The system would give real-time feedback of guideline-appropriate care recommendations, and be a quality assessment tool to measure the quality metrics of heart failure care of institutions. The same method applies to the management of other diseases such as Asthma and Cancer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It embodies many challenges and new, exciting mathematics. The conjecture was originally made around 2000, and a large body of literature has been accumulated on the subject while many unsolved problems remain. It has connections with and applications to many other parts of mathematics; for example, it is connected to index theory, which attracts the attention of many researchers from various fields.  Another connection is to the holomorphic extension problem in several complex variables, another important branch of mathematical analysis.   The extension problem itself goes back to the 1970s, and recent progress on the Arveson-Douglas Conjecture sheds new light on this old problem.  An important part of any research in mathematics is the search for new tools and methods, and the principal investigator will take concrete steps toward that goal.<br/> <br/>On the technical side, the Arveson-Douglas Conjecture makes strong connections with geometry and several complex variables. The concrete steps in this research include: the study of a recently defined property - the asymptotic stable division property - for submodules; a generalized version of the holomorphic extension problem; identifying index elements and index formulas on modules; extending known results to strongly pseudoconvex domains. The research is aimed at building machinery that allows one to treat global properties of complex analytic sets, especially algebraic sets, through local analysis. New techniques involving tools from operator theory, harmonic analysis, several complex variables and topology will be developed to treat these problems. The principal investigator will also study Toeplitz operators and Toeplitz algebra on strongly pseudoconvex domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every 50,000 to 100,000 years, a volume of seawater equivalent to the entire global ocean circulates through cracks and fissures of this basement beneath the seafloor, forming one of the largest reservoirs for microscopic life on Earth. While high temperature fluids discharging at iconic hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges are visually striking, the fluid flowing in and out of the flanks of these ridges is around three orders of magnitude greater and rivals the discharge of all rivers to the ocean. As it travels through the deep subseafloor, this fluid is significantly altered by water and rock interaction and the metabolic activity of microorganisms that are thought to ultimately help shape nutrient and energy budgets of the global ocean. However, our knowledge and understanding of this system suffer greatly from logistical difficulties in accessing it for scientific inquiry. Initial evidence suggests uncharacterized microbes that possess ancient homologs of enzymes involved in key metabolic pathways thought to be important to Earth's early microbial inhabitants populate this biome and are infected by novel viruses. In this study, the investigators are performing an integrated set of observations, experiments, and analyses aimed to advance our understanding of deep subseafloor microbes and their viruses by providing new, fundamental insights into which organisms and metabolisms are active in this environment, their evolutionary history and genetic characteristics, and their interactions. This project contributes to the development of a diverse STEM-educated workforce, and incorporate the training of one postdoctoral scientist, two graduate students, and ~29 undergraduate students in field-based research, wet-lab experimentation, and bioinformatics. This project also fosters a unique collaboration between scientists and the University of Hawaii Academy for Creative Media that supports undergraduate interns from the Academy to work with project personnel and produce creative videos and graphics to communicate aspects of our research to diverse audiences. Finally, this project supports two early career female scientists who started faculty positions in 2017.<br/><br/>This project leverages existing sampling infrastructure, DNA sequencing by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, and a research expedition to the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR) flank off the coast of Washington, USA, that is already supported by NSF.

These fluids will be collected from different sampling depths for an integrated set of geochemical, genomic, and cultivation studies. The project's specific objectives are to (i) use genomics to characterize microbial and viral populations inhabiting crustal fluids of the JdFR flank, (ii) use transcriptomics to identify the active metabolic pathways that are performing transformations relevant to elemental cycling within microorganisms of the JdFR flank, as well as identify active viral infections in these microbes, and (iii) generate microbial and viral pure cultures or limited diversity enrichments from crustal fluids of the JdFR flank. It combines bioinformatic analyses, controlled laboratory experiments, and field sampling to pursue both hypothesis-driven and discovery-based cultivation experiments, viral assays, and strain-level ecogenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses.

Fuzzing is the de facto standard technique for finding software vulnerabilities.  However, despite their tremendous promise, popular fuzzers, especially for large programs, often tend to get stuck trying redundant test inputs and struggle to find security vulnerabilities hidden deep into the program logic. To find interesting test inputs, most popular fuzzers use evolutionary algorithms, which start from a set of inputs, apply random mutations and crossovers on these inputs to generate new inputs, and apply a fitness function (e.g., achieved code coverage) to select the most promising new inputs for the next set of mutations. The key insight of this research is that an approach using continuous optimization techniques can do better, by more efficiently using the structure of the underlying functions (e.g., gradients or higher-order derivatives).  The key benefit of this approach is that continuous gradient-guided optimization can efficiently generate new promising inputs with a few targeted mutations based on the gradient value and the step size rather than random unguided mutations used in evolutionary techniques. Gradient-guided optimizations have already been shown to significantly outperform evolutionary techniques in popular tasks like training of neural networks. Better fuzzers will significantly improve the security, reliability, and robustness of critical infrastructure software used by billions of users across the world. Data and tools will be made available through open source. Curriculum and training will be developed to disseminate the results. <br/><br/>This project will develop a set of novel techniques and tools that will enable fuzzers to fully exploit the power of continuous optimization techniques like gradient descent. One of the key challenges behind applying continuous optimization for fuzzing is that real-world program behaviors often contain many discontinuities and thus are not directly amenable to smooth optimization. Therefore, the target programs must be smoothed before performing continuous optimization. This project will develop a new technique involving surrogate neural networks and graybox instrumentation that will automatically learn smooth approximations of discontinuous program behaviors. This project will further use global optimization schemes like branch-and-bound and cutting plane algorithms to avoid getting stuck at local optima due to the non-convexity of the target program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While electronic circuits have been sufficient for advancing technology until this point, the challenging computational, energy-efficiency, and communication demands of the 21st century require a radically new paradigm. This can be found in silicon photonics, an emerging technology which allows the manipulation of light by integrating optical devices on the same chips as electrical circuits. The ability to control light on a chip has already led to important technological advancements, including ultra-high-speed wired and wireless communications, lens-free imaging, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), gyroscopes without moving parts, gas sensors, and label-free biosensors. This project seeks to solve device simulation and design difficulties which currently severely limit the potential of silicon photonics, ushering in a new generation of chips with unprecedented levels of performance and design complexity, and paving the way for on-chip optical computation and ultra-fast, efficient communication. Leveraging mathematical and computational modeling, this research will engage and train graduate and undergraduate students in multi-disciplinary fields spanning from mathematics to computer engineering and applied physics. Another objective is to engage high school students from local schools interested in STEM, with a specific focus on women and underrepresented groups. This project will spur the growth of powerful new design tools for silicon photonics which will allow human designers to maximize their efforts designing at the system level, rather than at the device level, allowing them to develop highly intricate systems.<br/><br/>Due to their large size, small features, and complexity, photonic devices are very challenging to numerically simulate, and the lack of analytical or even approximate solutions further complicates the design of new devices. Advanced numerical techniques based on boundary integral equation methods will be developed in this project and applied to model photonic devices. Unlike present approaches which necessitate volumetric meshing of devices to be simulated, the project's approach only requires meshing the surfaces or boundaries of devices, leading to a significant reduction of problem size and dramatic increases in speed and CPU and memory efficiency. High-order polynomial functions will be used to approximate the electromagnetic unknowns, leading to an almost exponential rate of convergence to the exact solution with respect to the mesh size, in contrast to present methods which can only achieve linear or quadratic convergence. An optimization framework will be designed and implemented which will be capable of automatically designing new, ready-to-fabricate photonic devices without any human intervention other than specification of desired functionality and performance. The efficacy of the new simulation and optimization platform will then be demonstrated by utilizing the framework to design and evaluate real silicon photonic devices such as wavelength demultiplexers, power splitters, and grating couplers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous  studies document the key role INGOs play in transmitting global norms and adapting those norms in local contexts. But more recent research has established that INGO programming is shaped by its local political economy. We know relatively little about how this variation affects the way that INGOs organize their operations and with what consequences for local stakeholders. This project explores how the practices, beliefs and priorities of INGOs are transmitted along aid chains, or the links through which programs travel from INGO headquarters to INGO country offices, and finally to implementing partners. Specifically, this project asks: (1) To what degree, and how, do aid chains organized by INGOs from different countries vary?; (2) How do implementing partners, such as employees in government ministries connected to these aid chains, understand and negotiate the priorities of the funding INGOs in local political and cultural context?; and, (3) To what extent does engagement with INGOs shape the self-understandings of these local practitioners, including their professional identities? The project will advance policy debates regarding the role of international development aid in promoting global civil society, and more specifically, the changing landscape of the development sector and the emergence of important new actors, with implications for how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. aid provided to non-U.S. countries.<br/><br/><br/>Data from this project are comprised of 100 in-depth interviews, 10 months of participant observation, and a textual analysis of 20 documents. It is collecting qualitative data on each organization within two aid chains. First, it conducts in-depth interviews in U.S. INGO headquarters organizations, as well as interviews in the U.S. bilateral agency. Then, through 10 months of fieldwork, the project collects ethnographic observation and interviews in three sites: the field office of a U.S.-based INGO; an INGO field office abroad; and an implementing partner organization of these offices. Finally, the project will conduct short-term observation and interviews in an INGO headquarters office abroad. To supplement interview and ethnographic findings, textual analysis of INGO documents will be completed. All data will be coded using ATLAS.TI and open coding techniques. This research design will enable the project to analyze how international development programs are articulated and communicated across the three links, from INGO headquarters and donors, to INGO field offices, to local partners. This project will extend sociological theories of global civil society by demonstrating the micro-level organizational and inter-organizational processes through which national priorities shape global norms. It will also help to inform sociological theories of development, particularly those that inform issues related to gender in the developing world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, there are few empirical studies that establish a causal effect of  microcredit credit access on women's empowerment, economic outcomes and other social outcomes.  This proposed research project will use field experiments to study the long-term effects of micro-finance access on a number of outcomes for low income women.  The study will be based on a follow-up survey of low income women in a 2012 experimental study of access to micro-credit.  The study will gather and analyze information about health, and education as well as women's empowerment (decision making power within their households) seven years after their initial access to micro-credit.  This will be one of the first experimental studies of microcredit that focuses on long run outcomes rather than on short-run outcomes.   The evidence would help determine whether microcredit provision can be used as an effective anti-poverty program.  The results of this research project will provide important inputs into the formulation of policies to reduce poverty in the U.S. and around the world.   <br/><br/><br/>In contrast to earlier studies that find positive and significant short-run effects of microcredit on investments in education, health and women's decision-making power, recent randomized control trial (RCT) studies find no such effects.  An important question is whether these differences in outcomes are due to differences in time frames or differences in methodologies.  This research project will investigate the long-term effects of micro-credit access on investment in health, education, and three aspects of women empowerment---economic, demographic, and psychological---women empowerment.  It will  conduct an RCT follow-up of a 2012 study of the effects of microcredit access among low income women on their socioeconomic outcomes.   This project will contribute to our understanding of the linkage between women's access to credit and improvements in health and educational outcomes as well as women?s empowerment.

The vast majority of this data, coming from high-performance high-fidelity simulations, high-resolution sensors, or Internet connected devices, arise from physical processes that, while complex and nonlinear, depend on only few parameters. However, these low-dimension parameters are often hidden in the deluge of high-dimensional data, and are frequently impossible to discover, and thus reason about, by the existing methods. This project will develop new efficient methods to help scientists and engineers, especially in manufacturing and robotics, to simplify complex data such that dynamic processes underlying the data can be better represented, understood and controlled. By leveraging nation?s advanced cyberinfrastructure, these methods will accelerate pace of materials design, reduce the cost and time-to-market of tailored devices, and aid the design, control, and operation of new complex robotic systems. The research outcomes of the project are closely integrated with the educational components, to train the next generation of scientists and engineers on these new technologies, resulting in a skilled and globally competent workforce, especially in the high-priority areas of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Scientific Computing. This project thus promotes advancement of science, welfare and prosperity, as stated by NSF's mission.<br/><br/>This multidisciplinary research project aims at developing scalable end-to-end non-linear dimensionality reduction based solutions to accurately learn the dynamic behavior of complex systems. To this end the project introduces new parallel primitives and algorithmic innovations to enable deployment of non-linear spectral dimensionality reduction (NLSDR) and manifold learning methods on the next generation extreme scale computing systems. The project is based on the following key components: i) development of novel locality-aware data distribution and task scheduling strategies for individual NLSDR building blocks taking into account their inter-dependencies when executing in distributed memory environments such as Message Passing Interface and Map/Reduce clusters of multi-core processors, ii) design of new algorithmic strategies to manage data influx while maintaining crucial properties of the sub-manifold characterized by the data, and, iii) development of end-to-end solutions for two transformative example applications pertaining to advanced manufacturing and robotics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the Eocene, a shift to cooler temperatures at high latitudes resulted in the inception of polar glaciation. This in turn affected the environment for living organisms. This project looks to uncover the interaction between biological, oceanographic, and climate systems for the Eocene in Antarctica using chemical analysis of fossil shark teeth collected during past expeditions. The combination of paleontological and geochemical analyses will provide insight to the past ecology and ocean conditions; climate models will be applied to test the role of tectonics, greenhouse gas concentration and ocean circulation on environmental change during this time period. The study contributes to understanding the interaction of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and ocean circulation. This project also seeks to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion within the geosciences workforce with efforts targeted to undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and early career faculty.<br/><br/>The research goal is to elucidate the processes leading from the Eocene greenhouse to Oligocene icehouse conditions. Previous explanations for this climate shift centers on Antarctica, where tectonic configurations influenced oceanic gateways, ocean circulation reduced heat transport, and/or greenhouse gas declines prompted glaciation. The team will reconstruct watermass, current, and climate fluctuations proximal to the Antarctic Peninsula using geochemical indicators (oxygen and neodymium isotope composition) from fossil shark teeth collected from Seymour Island. The approach builds on previous shark paleontological studies, incorporates geochemical analyses for environmental reconstruction (i.e., temperature gradients and ocean circulation), and tests hypotheses on Earth System dynamics using novel global climate model simulations with geochemical tracers. This project will advance global climate modeling capabilities with experiments that consider Eocene tectonic configuration within isotope-enabled climate model simulations. A comparison of geochemical results from Eocene climate simulations and empirical records of shark teeth will reveal processes and mechanisms central to the Eocene Antarctic climatic shift.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, little is known about underlying genomic mechanisms that resulted in the observed changes in the shape and structure of these bones. This project will investigate portions of the genome that were previously identified as having potential activity and regulatory functions during embryonic pelvis and scapula development. The genomic sequences being specifically investigated overlap with regions of DNA that show signs of having been under positive selection in the human lineage. For each of these regulatory sequences, the researchers will test whether the human and chimpanzee versions of the sequence control gene activity, and whether there are differences in gene activity between the two species. This work will help to identify sequences likely to have been under selection during human evolution to produce the modern human pelvis and scapula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In one such method, apprenticeship learning, a robot learns to perform a task by watching an expert. This project's goals are to decrease the time required to set up the robot for learning and to offer college students hands-on robotic research activities. Most related work describes techniques that require the robot's programmer to identify features of the task. This project will reduce the programmer's setup work by using automatically generated features. A new method ensures the accuracy of the robotic learner by determining the number of observations required of the expert. <br/><br/>Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse-Reinforcement Learning learns feature weights from demonstration, and like other maximum entropy models, offers strong performance guarantees and analysis possibilities. Proven generalization bounds are available that allow an estimate on the number of observed samples needed for a given expected level of error.  However, they require knowledge of the covering number or complexity of the feature functions and/or known limits on the feature weights. When features are automatically extracted from a robot's sensor stream it is likely that many spurious features will be selected for use which could greatly increase the estimated number of samples needed, rendering the technique impractical.  This project is developing an iterative, online variant of the maximum causal inverse-reinforcement learning algorithm that runs during the demonstrations and selects high-valued features as a critical subset which are then used to calculate the sample bounds. Once the required number of samples have been observed an offline inverse-reinforcement learning technique is run to ensure the feature weights are learned accurately.  The new algorithm will be evaluated on a robot tasked with sorting previously-unknown objects. In this task, students will demonstrate the sorting of objects, then the robot will be required to do the same. Afterwards, the robot will be reset and the experiment repeats with a new set of objects. Critically, the software on the robot should not be changed or updated between these tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is structured to maximize engagement and information sharing among an estimated 185 participants at all career stages from academic, industry, and government research teams and promote public sector?industry exchanges. The impact will be especially great on early-career plant scientists, all of whom will spend their careers in the SynBio era and many of whom will pursue careers in SynBio research and development. Accordingly, up to 34 early career researchers will be supported by this award, with a special emphasis on broadening participation. The Plant SynBio Satellite Meeting will leverage its association with the annual American Society of Plant Biology 2019 meeting, which typically attracts more than 1,300 scientists from 40 countries and which will be held at the same site (San Jose, CA) just prior in August 2019. The two conferences will be integrated via a shared plenary symposium on SynBio, further extending the impact of this award to the broader plant science community that ASPB serves.<br/><br/>Synthetic biology (SynBio) is a transformative combination of DNA technologies, engineering principles, and computational tools that makes it possible to design new life processes and to repurpose existing, natural ones to generate new knowledge, devices, and products. SynBio is already transforming plant science in fields ranging from biosynthetic pathways to the interactions between plants and microorganisms. As both a conceptual and an operational revolution, SynBio promises to be even more creatively disruptive than the molecular biology revolution that began in the 1970s. This is because SynBio (i) opens access to the vast ""design space"" that plants and other organisms have that is not represented in the natural world, and (ii) industrializes biology by augmenting step-by-step work with computationally guided, automated, and standardized engineering procedures. SynBio-based companies are burgeoning, as are the career pathways that they create; however, plant scientists at all career stages are only just starting to appreciate the extent to which SynBio will impact training needs and the design and execution of experiments. The Plant SynBio Satellite Meeting, convened by the American Society of Plant Biologists, aims to raise community consciousness of what SynBio is and what it can do in key areas of economic and intellectual pursuit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To fabricate reliable electronic components, the thickness of this oxide layer must be precisely controlled, which presents significant challenges as devices become smaller and smaller. Present methods of creating the silicon-oxide film require heating the semiconductor at high temperature.  This process leads to a non-uniform oxide layer.  In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Sylvia T. Ceyer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her students are using sophisticated molecular beam techniques to study the oxide formation process.  Their discoveries could lead to improved methods using lower temperatures, which would have significant societal and economic benefit.  This research is also providing a broad-based education in scientific problem solving for students embarking on careers in chemical industry.  Professor Ceyer leverages MIT?s Summer Research Program (MSRP) to recruit underrepresented undergraduate students for summer research engaging them in the excitement of scientific discovery.  Professor Ceyer also authors and narrates compelling general chemistry lectures on YouTube as a part of educational and outreach activities designed to make science understandable and accessible for all. <br/><br/>This work proposes a novel method using (O2)2 dimer to easily synthesize O2 in its first electronically excited singlet state with the aim of bypassing a spin-forbidden reaction that limits oxidation activity of semiconductors.  This idea may lead to precise control of ever-thinner oxide layers in devices. The comparison between the experimentally-determined interaction dynamics of O2 versus (O2)2 are providing insights into the origin of the low, but non-zero probability of this spin forbidden reaction.  This research program also explores a non-equilibrium phenomenon involving lattice electronic excitations due to the initial collision of the incident O2 in the quest for understanding the non-zero O2 reactivity.  Finally, these experiments test a hypothesis that an alternate mechanism for dissociative chemisorption, atom abstraction, which does not require a spin forbidden transition, may be operative via a metastable, non-equilibrium precursor state or a direct atom abstraction associated with a transient potential energy maximum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, reefs are among the most threatened marine environments, and coral disease is having a devastating impact on these valued systems. In early 2019, a multi-species rapid tissue loss disease matching the description of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) was found severely affecting a reef off the southwest coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). SCTLD has been devastating coral reef communities in southeast Florida for the last four years, and was very recently reported from disparate areas around the Caribbean, including Mexico, Jamaica, and St. Martin. Rapid surveys by the investigators at the University of the Virgin Islands believe that a 50 km2 area southwest of St. Thomas is the initial incidence area of the disease, but will likely spread across the USVI, British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This study performs  experiments to understand how this disease affects coral species immune traits and compares the microbiology and physiology of disease samples in the USVI to samples from Florida. It also examines how changing the species composition of a coral community affects the spread and impact of the disease. The overall aim is to produce a model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. The project contributes to the research training of at least 2 undergraduates, 2 M.S. students, and 3 Ph.D. students, who benefit from cross-investigator mentoring. The research team includes representatives to the Coral Disease Advisory Committees for the USVI and Florida, which ensures rapid communication of  findings to management bodies in both regions. <br/><br/>Coral disease is a significant and increasing threat to Caribbean coral reef systems. Recent results demonstrate that coral species immune traits can predict disease resistance, and thus, forecast impacts to coral community structure, under multi-species coral disease. The onset of this epizootic in the USVI offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the impact of coral resistance, tolerance and immune traits on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak that could profoundly change the diversity of Caribbean reefs. It is hypothesized that the abundance of highly susceptible species dictates 1) the onset of disease at reef sites downstream of the initial incidence area, and 2) the spread of disease within reef sites. Furthermore, 3) downstream reef sites where highly susceptible species are removed or treated show lower immune responses in all susceptible corals, later onset of disease, and slower within-site disease spread. To test these hypotheses, two experiments directly compare species responses to disease exposure and test the effect of species assemblage on coral immune function and disease spread. Results from these experiments aim to inform a generalizable model to predict the impact of multi-species disease spread on reefs based on coral species assemblages. Results of this project include direct comparison of the USVI disease to Florida SCTLD and a better understanding of how the abundance of highly susceptible host species impacts the spread of disease during the early onset of a multi-species panzootic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of this include white nose syndrome which is devastating bat populations in the US, and Chytrid fungus outbreaks that have caused declines in frog populations worldwide.  Some diseases of wildlife, for example, Rabies, Ebola, and West Nike Virus, can cause outbreaks of disease in people, while other infections of wildlife, such as Brucellosis and African Swine Fever, can be fatal to domestic animals and livestock.  Extraordinary new tools greatly improve our ability to detect infection and understand why it sometimes is devastating and sometimes not. While these new technologies make this an exciting time for new discoveries and understanding that will improve wildlife disease management, many researchers would benefit from training in their use. To address this need, we offer hands-on training with real-world data through an intensive workshop ""Genomics of Disease in Wildlife"" (GDW).  The first two workshops offered in 2017 and 2018 were very successful and provided training for nearly 50 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty in Next Generation DNA Sequencing analysis to use in projects about wildlife diseases. Going forward, this project will provide scholarships to 12-14 graduate students or fellows (US citizens) with financial need to attend workshops in 2019 and 2020.  We will preferentially use these funds to enhance diverse or underrepresented minority participation and have been successful in recruiting women and diverse attendees to maximize training impacts. This financial assistance will also facilitate building a cohesive, effective scientific community making breakthroughs in control of infectious wildlife diseases. For example, we have recently published a manuscript helping the scientific community identify critical next challenges, and the GDW workshop alumni are also involved in a listserv to promote communications among a growing number of researchers with interest and expertise in GDW problems.  <br/><br/><br/>Recent technological advances in genomic sciences, and increasingly affordable Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay costs, have coalesced to result in powerful tools to monitor, detect, and reconstruct the past, present, and future role of pathogens impacting wildlife populations. Wildlife researchers are thus uniquely positioned to merge ecological, biological, and evolutionary studies with such genomic technologies to exploit unprecedented ""Big Data"" tools in disease research; however, most researchers lack the training and expertise required to use these computationally intensive methodologies. Previous workshops have consisted of lectures, daily computer labs, and analysis of real-world NGS data.  Previous workshops have provided comprehensive training in the use of genomic tools for investigations of a broad range of interactions between wildlife host species and their pathogens, and provided unique networking opportunities among instructors, guest speakers, and participants. This project will provide support for two additional years of workshops. Funds will be awarded as scholarships for US graduate students and post-doctoral fellows interested in obtaining skills in this emerging area. This award will encourage participation by early career researchers.  Participants will learn modern genomics techniques and generate powerful genomic solutions to ameliorate the local, regional, and global impact of wildlife disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scholars have increasingly come to view Classic Maya rulers as being reliant on ceremony to bring followers together, due to a lack of overt political power. In contexts where the ruling classes lack the tangible power to affect the everyday lives of their subjects, intermediate elites (those between the highest rulers and the commoner masses) often fulfill important roles as mediators between the ruling family and their followers. By identifying how the relative wealth and status and ceremonial and economic bases of power of three autonomous local elite families changed as they became co-opted by the emergent Lower Dover polity, Walden will show how incorporation impacted the agency of intermediate elites. Did the local elites lose wealth and status, and their bases of power upon incorporation into a polity? If so, this would suggest Maya rulers wielded high degrees of political, economic and ceremonial power. Conversely, if little change is apparent or the co-opted intermediate elites witness an increase in their power, then this would corroborate current perspectives envisaging ruling elites as lacking explicit political power. The approach is grounded in an anthropological perspective on the co-option of local political leaders by external powers, and consequentially offers a comparative window into contemporary foreign policy and incorporation in the developing world. The results of the study will be made accessible in Walden's dissertation, and a series of academic publications. All data will be freely available through the University of Pittsburgh Center for Comparative Archaeology. The project will form the basis for training local and international students in archaeological practice and serve to educate local Belizeans about their past through a series of outreach events, lectures and workshops. <br/><br/>Walden will examine changes at three intermediate elite centers situated around the political capital of Lower Dover; Tutu Uitz Na, Floral Park and Barton Ramie, and include data from the commoner neighborhoods which surrounded each intermediate elite center. Understanding the wealth and quality of life of client commoners will show whether local elites favored more exploitative or communally beneficial strategies in their dealings with their subordinates, and how this changed when the rulers of Lower Dover established themselves. Comparison of possible variability between the three intermediate elite families will allow an understanding of the different factors which structured how much political power intermediate elites retained following the rise of Lower Dover. For instance, did local elites located geographically closer to Lower Dover see a more dramatic reduction in their power, or did more politically powerful local elites possess greater opportunities for negotiating their role in the new polity? Analysis of residential and ceremonial architecture and the changing proportions of utilitarian, high value and ritual items within these structures will show how inequality, patterns of production, consumption and ritual activity changed as the polity rose.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference presented an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career.  Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians.  Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research.  In many cases this is the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk.  In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students have the opportunity to learn about other research going on in the region, as well be exposed to areas of mathematics that they are less familiar.  NSF funding increased access to this conference, giving graduate students with fewer financial resources available to them an opportunity to take advantage of this conference.<br/> <br/>The ANYSRGMC is a one-day conference, the majority of which consists of 30 minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions.  There are two invited guest speakers, an opening address on Saturday morning and a Keynote address Saturday afternoon.  The two speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate students at Syracuse University and surrounding regions.  In addition to hearing interesting mathematics, students have the opportunity to meet and learn from successful mathematicians outside of their home universities.  Breaks between the talks gave graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to new collaborations.

While most sciences are founded on a regular set of laws or principles such that a particular input results in a predictable and consistent output, one of the key ideas of ecological systems is that this inherent predictability is frequently violated, mainly because of the complex interconnections they contain. Thus, while physics and astronomy, for example, rightly celebrate their ability to make precise predictions about what happens at extremely large (e.g., the universe) and extremely small (e.g., atoms) levels, ecological systems are known for their inherent unpredictability, one aspect of which is sudden, drastic, and at times unexpected change. Such events are frequently referred to as a ""critical transition.""  An evident example is the sudden outbreak of pests in agricultural systems. This project seeks to understand the structure of these unexpected changes in the pest systems that have generally plagued food production since times immemorial and that currently threaten one of society's favorite beverages.<br/><br/>This project uses the coffee agroecosystem as a model ecosystem, to ask how classical ideas of critical transitions (in this case, sudden pest outbreaks) reflect theoretical constructs that emerge from basic ecological theory. Pest outbreaks in managed systems are potentially driven by critical transition phenomena; rather than a slowly accumulating increase in pest problems in response to management decisions, frequently they seem to suddenly jump from one relatively stable system (low pest population) to another one (high pest population). In addition, managers seeking to reverse this process, may face the related problem of hysteresis: the sudden pest outbreak when a management threshold is reached does not reverse itself in the same way when that threshold reverts to its previous level. The three major pests on the coffee farms of southern Mexico are all connected in subsystems that have theoretical structures (modules), each of which suggests conditions under which critical transitions will occur. The research seeks to determine whether these three well-defined modules (subsystems) demonstrate critical transition behavior. Furthermore, the work aims to understand implications at a larger scale when these three subcomponents, each of which separately can be expected to show critical transition behavior, are coupled as they obviously are in reality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because serpentine has a number of unusual physical properties, it is hypothesized that serpentine-group minerals play an essential role in the dynamics of boundaries between tectonic plates. Furthermore, serpentine may control where earthquakes can or cannot occur.  However, serpentine is only stable through a narrow range of pressure and temperature conditions, which has hindered experimental efforts to unravel its behavior. This study will involve two sets of novel experiments to elucidate how serpentine changes shape or structure when Earth-like deformation conditions are applied. Broader Impacts include training of a graduate student, development of educational and outreach modules in a visualization laboratory, and cross-disciplinary science impact.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to clarify further the rheology and associated deformation microstructures of antigorite, the high pressure and temperature phase of serpentine. Two sets of experiments are proposed. The first set of experiments will investigate microstructural evolution of polycrystalline serpentine as a function of strain, using the Large Volume Torsion (LVT) apparatus at Washington University in St. Louis. The purpose of these experiments is to characterize the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) generated by deformation and determine the conditions at which steady-state microstructures are produced. The data that will be obtained on the transient evolution of antigorite CPO are needed to interpret seismic wave-speeds and seismic anisotropy in regions where serpentine is inferred to be present. The second set of experiments will use micromechanical methods, including nanoindentation and micropillar compression testing, to measure precisely the plastic rheology of antigorite up to 600 degrees C. These data will be used to constrain flow-laws for antigorite at conditions relevant to subduction zones, and may be used in future efforts to model deformation at the slab interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the Eocene, a shift to cooler temperatures at high latitudes resulted in the inception of polar glaciation. This in turn affected the environment for living organisms. This project looks to uncover the interaction between biological, oceanographic, and climate systems for the Eocene in Antarctica using chemical analysis of fossil shark teeth collected during past expeditions. The combination of paleontological and geochemical analyses will provide insight to the past ecology and ocean conditions; climate models will be applied to test the role of tectonics, greenhouse gas concentration and ocean circulation on environmental change during this time period. The study contributes to understanding the interaction of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and ocean circulation. This project also seeks to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion within the geosciences workforce with efforts targeted to undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and early career faculty.<br/><br/>The research goal is to elucidate the processes leading from the Eocene greenhouse to Oligocene icehouse conditions. Previous explanations for this climate shift centers on Antarctica, where tectonic configurations influenced oceanic gateways, ocean circulation reduced heat transport, and/or greenhouse gas declines prompted glaciation. The team will reconstruct watermass, current, and climate fluctuations proximal to the Antarctic Peninsula using geochemical indicators (oxygen and neodymium isotope composition) from fossil shark teeth collected from Seymour Island. The approach builds on previous shark paleontological studies, incorporates geochemical analyses for environmental reconstruction (i.e., temperature gradients and ocean circulation), and tests hypotheses on Earth System dynamics using novel global climate model simulations with geochemical tracers. This project will advance global climate modeling capabilities with experiments that consider Eocene tectonic configuration within isotope-enabled climate model simulations. A comparison of geochemical results from Eocene climate simulations and empirical records of shark teeth will reveal processes and mechanisms central to the Eocene Antarctic climatic shift.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This leads to economic benefits by improving fuel efficiency and reducing the maintenance cost of ships and other marine structures. Environmentally, current marine coating products function by leaching toxic chemicals (biocides) into the water which are harmful to marine ecosystems and subject to increasing global regulatory restrictions. This product addresses this issue by providing an eco-friendly solution with equivalent antifouling performance.

This coating innovation involves novel material composition and fabrication methods enabling a strong and durable immobilization of hydrophilic coating materials on most hydrophobic substrates that are commonly used as anti-corrosion bottom paints used on ship hulls. Hydrophilic materials are known for their high capacity in resisting biofouling, but they tend to dissolve in water, instead of staying on the substrate, leading to gradual exposure of the unprotected substrate over time. The key innovative feature of this technology is that it improves the poor stability and durability challenge of super-hydrophilic polymer coatings when applied in the water environment. This coating technology is effective against biofouling while achieving durability and robustness required in aqueous environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Earth, it is generated by the outer core, made of liquid iron with some nickel and light elements. Earth's magnetic field is important, as life may not exist without its shielding of the solar wind. Moreover, the heat rising from the core fuels mantle thermal convection, at the origin of plate tectonics and associated hazards. Understanding Earth's magnetic field and core heat flow requires detailed knowledge of iron-rich material properties at the extreme pressures and temperatures of the core. Yet, existing experimental data and theoretical calculations are inconsistent. Here, the multidisciplinary team investigates  the thermal and electrical conductivities of iron alloys at extreme conditions. They use a combination of state-of-the-art experiments, theory, and modeling at both the atomic scale and the scale of the core. Expected results should reconcile experiments and modeling of the core's heat transport and magnetic field evolution. This project supports one graduate student and two postdoctoral associates in the field of Mineral Physics. It has strong implications for Geomagnetism, Geodynamics and Seismology, and broad impacts in Materials Science.<br/><br/>High-pressure and temperature experiments are carried out in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell.  Extreme pressures and temperatures are generated at the tips of two opposing diamonds, where the iron sample is placed. The team will measure and compute electrical and thermal conductivities at conditions relevant to the core. This allows them to test the applicability of the Wiedemann-Franz law at these conditions. This empirical law relates thermal and electrical conductivities in metals. Here, the electrical conductivity is measured using a four-probe electrical connection brought outside from the cell. Thermal conductivity is measured by optical spectroradiometry in conjunction with pulsed-laser heating and modeling. Similar conditions are simulated using first-principles quantum mechanics to compute the electrical and thermal conductivity in liquid and solid iron, and compare them with experimental observations. These calculations are difficult because they involve the scattering of electrons off each other and off the moving atoms in the fluid or solid. Experimental and theoretical results are used in geophysical models of core cooling and magnetic field generation.  This will allow to better constrain the history of Earth's magnetic field and the heat flow at the core-mantle boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal specifically responds to a national and local shortage of qualified and certified mathematics and science teachers. The University of Lynchburg seeks to recruit 22 undergraduate STEM students (in four cohorts) who are majoring in biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, or mathematics and minoring in secondary education as they obtain teacher certification. The project focuses on increasing the effectiveness of future STEM teachers in teaching special education students with learning or developmental disabilities, an issue of national importance as these students can compose more than 10% of the student population. STEM educators need specialized preparation to work with special education students and students from a culture different than their own, as many are not prepared in educational techniques specific to these populations. This lack of teacher preparation leads to poor academic outcomes in many cases. This project also aims to recruit more diverse and qualified teacher candidates by developing educational pathways that enable community college STEM students to transfer to the University of Lynchburg, where they will complete a baccalaureate degree in a STEM major and obtain secondary teacher certification.  This pathway will be facilitated by working with a local nonprofit whose mission is to empower high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds in pursuing higher education. These strategies are intended to increase the diversity among the Noyce scholars.<br/> <br/>This project, led by the University of Lynchburg, is a partnership with Central Virginia Community College, the nonprofit Beacon of Hope, and the Lynchburg City, Amherst County, Bedford County, and Campbell County school districts.  It is designed to advance science and mathematics teacher preparation through experiential teaching opportunities, faculty advising, mentoring, and workshops to prepare preservice teachers to effectively teach students with disabilities and from diverse backgrounds. Faculty and in-service teacher mentors will be trained in the New Teacher Center model, which focuses on three domains that work synergistically to create an ""optimal learning environment"" by: (1) creating emotionally, intellectually, and physically safe environments; (2) implementing equitable, culturally responsive, and standards-aligned curriculum and instruction; and (3) meeting the diverse needs of every learner.  A series of eight workshops focusing on supporting students with disabilities who are from diverse backgrounds will be provided to the Noyce Scholars and their peer-mentor, in-service teachers.  Related to these workshops and field experiences on teaching STEM to students with disabilities, the project's research agenda will explore the following important questions:  (1) Does participation in the Noyce workshops significantly alter knowledge and beliefs of pre-service and in-service STEM teachers about teaching students with disabilities? (2) How does interaction with students with disabilities during field experiences alter pre-service STEM teachers' beliefs about these students? (3) How do the in-service Noyce scholars, in their first year of teaching, rate their level of preparation and job satisfaction, and how do their results compare to those of other teachers who did not participate in the Noyce program? What skills, beliefs, or knowledge do in-service STEM teachers consider most important for working effectively with students with disabilities? This investigation has the potential to add new knowledge about the preparation of STEM teachers for teaching differently abled students in the general classroom. The evidence generated may advance new teacher preparation. Educational materials used in the workshops, data on workshop participants' knowledge gains, and the perceived effectiveness of the workshops, especially for preparing teachers for working with differently abled students within the STEM classroom, will be disseminated to the broader STEM education community.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neutrinos are a natural byproduct of the nuclear fission that powers nuclear reactors.  Since neutrinos are only very weakly interacting, they stream out of the core, and through all the shielding, without being changed in anyway.  Therefore, these neutrinos carry information about the fission reaction in the core, such as the reactor power and the mix of isotopes that are participating in the fission reaction, which may be hard to determine using conventional techniques.  By detecting reactor neutrinos, it may be possible to image the spatial distribution of the fission reaction in the core.  This information could be used to improve the efficiency of the reactor fuel burn.  Plutonium production in the core could be tracked, and its removal from the core recorded, which could be used to ensure that no materials get diverted to other means, useful for monitoring in nuclear nonproliferation applications.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will further develop a new reactor neutrino detector technology.  This technology uses a highly-segmented detector, made of cube of plastic scintillator, arrayed in planes, which are separated by sheets of a second scintillator which is used to tag neutrons.  Combined these two elements are used to cleanly identify the two-part signature of a reactor neutrino interaction in a detector.  Previous reactor neutrino detectors required meters of shielding to range out cosmic-rays which are the largest source of background.  In this detector the segmentation is used to identify the specific pattern of the reactor neutrino interaction and reject backgrounds that would otherwise overwhelm the rare neutrino events.  A recent deployment of a prototype detector to a commercial reactor resulted in a positive observation of neutrinos, demonstrating the feasibility of this unique approach to background reduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This wireless technology can unlock the true potential of higher frequency bands by establishing more efficient and robust connections that operate in the millimeter Wave (mmWave) spectrum above 28 GHz. The resulting increased wireless capacity and reduced latency will enable the key use cases that have been defined in the context of 5G, such as interactive Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), autonomous driving, and unmanned robotics. Rapidly exchanging large amount of information wirelessly will be of paramount importance for AR/VR, as it will permit getting rid of the cables connected to the headsets, and for autonomous automotive and robotic systems, as it will enable beyond line-of-sight vision by broadcasting with minimal latency massive amount of data generated by sensors such as lidars, radars, and cameras.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on the design of an all-digital transceiver radio for mmWave communications. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5G use cases a reality. However, challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the wireless ecosystem demands. Existing state-of-the-art mmWave analog transceiver radios trade-off robustness against power: they allow the radio to transmit or receive in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time. Conversely, this all-digital beamforming technology allows to look in all directions simultaneously, resulting in more spectral-efficient and robust communications.  The defining technical feature in this design is that the signals from each antenna chain are digitized independently, as opposed to existing techniques where the signals from each antenna are first combined in analog and then digitized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2015 there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer. The surgical procedure cost ~$6000 with an average $60 per minute cost and 25% re-operation rate. Owing to its competitive advantages, the AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical delay and potentially minimize the re-excision rate. Therefore, AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical cost for the hospital, the reimbursement cost for the insurance company, and physical pain and emotional distress for the patients. The company's innovation addresses a considerable market opportunity. According to a market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. With the value the company may potentially provide, the total addressable market is estimated to be ~$200 million in 2020. This innovation will not only be applicable for breast cancer surgery navigation, it may also be used as an internal tracking device for multiple other applications, such as implantable device tracking, endoscope tracking, navigation for partial kidney removal etc.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to solve the problems of surgical navigation in lumpectomy. Breast conserving therapy, or lumpectomy, with radiation therapy has become a preferable choice over mastectomy for its better cosmetic outcome and patient health care. However, it is challenging for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially when the tumor is non-palpable. Current technologies cannot provide quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of that location. Vibronix, Inc proposes to address these unmet needs by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized, omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this device, named the AcouStar system, has the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays, and reduce the re-excision rate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cities are often built on top of sedimentary basins which trap, focus and amplify earthquake seismic energy. Prediction of strong ground motions is critical in these areas to prevent the loss of life and property in future large events. Here, the principal investigators pioneered a new empirical approach which uses seismic ambient noise, for example generated by ocean waves, to predict large earthquake ground motions. They are also expert in 3D numerical simulations of ground-notion dynamics. The team join effort to cross-validate these approaches in the greater Los Angeles. They use ambient noise and small past-earthquake data to create a suite of large scenario earthquakes (magnitude 6.5 to 7.8) on the southern San Andreas fault. The simulations allow evaluating whether the underlying geological structure may channel earthquake waves and thereby strongly amplify the ground motions. This 2-year project will help mitigating seismic hazards in southern California. The developped methodology can be applied to other urban areas located in similar geological context. The project also supports an early career female scientist and provides training to three graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the coupling effect between the amplification due to seismic waveguides and that due to source directivity. This effect may enhance shaking intensity in sedimentary basins. The project uses southern California as a natural laboratory. Other large metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo, Mexico City, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Jakarta, are subjected to similar hazards. Here, the team innovates in using cross-validation between two state-of-the-art ground-motion prediction approaches: the ambient-noise Virtual Earthquake Approach and 3D dynamic simulations. This cross-validation allows i) establishing bounds of confidence in the two methods, ii) examining the coupling between path and source effects in enhancing ground motion, and iii) evaluating the extent of nonlinear effects on future ground motions. The novelty of the project is the unique combination of theoretical and observational seismology.

Discipline-based education researchers (DBERs) contribute to this understanding by applying their STEM expertise to the study of teaching and learning. DBER is a relatively young field and we need to train more scholars to do this important research. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at North Dakota State University (NDSU) will address this need by hosting a summer program that will engage 30 undergraduate students in conducting discipline-based education research in science and mathematics.<br/><br/>Through this REU Site, the student participants will select from a wide variety of research projects that pose important questions about the nature of teaching and learning in STEM. The interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors provides a diverse set of projects across the disciplines of biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics and psychology. This diversity in research exposes REU participants to nearly a dozen other projects to enrich their experience with and understanding of the breadth of investigations conducted in DBER. Students will jump-start their research experience through online interactions with their mentors, including reading and discussing relevant research papers. The benefits of this early, virtual mentoring will be two-fold: students receive essential training in education research and begin to develop relationships with their research mentors prior to arriving on campus. Once they arrive at NDSU, the REU fellows will participate in a learning community that includes cohort-building activities, as well as both faculty and peer mentoring to support their research activities. REU students will also participate in a well-structured professional development series in which they will learn about ethical practices; research methods; scientific communication and presentation skills; pathways to graduate school; and careers in STEM. Students will present their research and results through informal chalk talks in the first half of the program and then more formally at a capstone poster symposium at the end of the summer. In addition to summative evaluation, the project team will implement continuous formative evaluation to provide feedback that helps them refine and improve the REU Site each year. Student entrance and exit surveys, student interviews, faculty surveys, and alumni follow-up surveys will provide essential data for continuous program improvement. Overall, this REU Site will build the discipline-based education research talent pool and contribute to improvements in undergraduate STEM education.<br/><br/>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in areas of research funded by NSF.

Thus, the magnetic field is thought to be an essential factor ensuring long-term planetary habitability. Today, this geomagnetic field is powered by growth of the solid inner core. But thermal models suggest Earth has not always had a solid inner core; the time of the onset of inner core growth has ranged from 500 million to more than 2.5 billion years ago. This represents a fundamental unknown about the planet. Arguably the best way to investigate this question is to use ""paleomagnetism"", the record of the ancient magnetic field trapped in rocks and crystals as they form. Such data have motivated the hypothesis that the geomagnetic field, and the magnetic shielding of the atmosphere from solar particles, almost collapsed 565 million years ago, but then the field slowly recovered. This event may record the birth of the solid inner core. This hypothesis will be tested through studies of rocks ranging in age from 800 to 500 million years old found in Australia, Canada and the United States. The collaborative work will involve a team of 5 scientists at 3 institutions (including an underrepresented minority and woman scientist), and will be integrated into education and outreach efforts at each university, including efforts to expand opportunities for first-generation and historically underrepresented individuals. <br/><br/><br/>The time of Earth's inner core nucleation (ICN) is unknown and thus represents a first-order problem in our understanding of the planet. For decades the inner core was assumed to be billions of years old. However, viable core thermal conductivity values now span a factor of 3, with the highest values compatible with ICN onset between approximately 800 and 500 million years ago. These onset ages are predicted by many recent thermal evolution models, but a paucity of paleofield strength data has thwarted efforts seeking to determine if there is a sign of a young inner core. Recent paleomagnetic data record an unprecedented low in time-averaged geomagnetic field strength 565 million years ago that is greater than 10 times lower than the strength of the present geomagnetic field. The ultra-low field intensity is accompanied by an ultra-high reversal frequency and other indicators of unusual field behavior in 15 other Latest Precambrian-Cambrian igneous and sedimentary units. These observations and recent modeling results are the basis for the hypothesis that the geomagnetic field approached collapse in late Precambrian/early Cambrian times (i.e., the ratio of the magnetic energy to kinetic energy is less than 1) coincident with the onset of ICN. Hence, the inner core may be young. This hypothesis will be tested through the study of 4 igneous provinces emplaced between about 500 and 800 million years ago, in Australia, the US and the Northwest Territories (Canada). State-of-the-art paleomagnetic directional and paleointensity data, including single silicate crystal analyses, and U-Pb radiometric age data will allow a synoptic view of the geodynamo during the youngest predicted ages of ICN. The work will involve a team (5 PIs/co-PIs at 3 institutions) including an underrepresented minority and woman scientist. The work will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate education and outreach efforts at each university, including efforts to expand opportunities for first-generation and historically underrepresented individuals. Student teams will visit and conduct analyses in each of the laboratories, comparing and contrasting techniques.

As a result, infrastructure resilience has received renewed emphasis, especially on the development of the means to cope with unforeseen or unanticipated problems or circumstances. This research investigates the ways commercially navigable inland waterway systems temporarily reconfigure  after a disruptive incident. Specifically, how does the system balance prioritization of recovery objectives and development and implementation of appropriate solutions? This balancing is a function of the system?s ability to self re-organize with respect to the relationships among asset owners, operators, and stakeholders. The effectiveness of this reorganization is largely dependent upon the cultural and physical characteristics present in the system. Therefore, this research provides insights that will enhance the response processes involved, and potentially lead to quicker and more effective recovery efforts. <br/> <br/>To investigate and elucidate these patterns of self reorganization, the graduate student completes case studies of the ports of Baltimore, New Orleans, and Rotterdam. He collects three types of data: semi-structured interviews of private and public stakeholders, documents such as published procedures or laws, and publicly available data such as corporate/agency communications and media outlets. All qualitative data are coded and analyzed with the intent of developing visual models of collaborate process with accompanying descriptions.

Currently, ASD is the fastest growing developmental disability in the US, with 1 in 59 children being affected. It is well established that children with ASD struggle with their social skills, which negatively affects the child's ability to make friends and integrate into the community and create their best life. Current interventions are expensive, time consuming, and parents, teachers, and therapists are seeking better solutions. This project will address these issues through the development of an affordable, time efficient application. The application will greatly improve social skills while also addressing sensory integration, anxiety, and self-esteem. As research continues and the product is refined, it will be broadened to all ages, targeting the ~5 million individuals with ASD in the US, and the ~74 million worldwide. Additionally, this project can be adapted to help non-ASD children who struggle with social skills or have developmental disabilities. Using the program in both homes and schools, creates a strong commercial impact, leading to a self-sustaining business. <br/><br/><br/>The technical innovation of this project is an educational application developed for smart mobile devices, improving social skills for children diagnosed on the autism spectrum. This novel technology incorporates and combines proprietary source code, customizable features, integration of original music, video, facial recognition technology, and tracking tools to create a powerful modeling, learning, and practicing environment. The technology is the only social curriculum designed to allow students to learn and practice the social skill independently, or with other human interaction; including the ability to have multiple devices sync together, allowing practice to take place between participants in real time. The research goal is to develop and test an application, which teaches children with autism spectrum disorder to improve and generalize social skills to familiar and unfamiliar people. This will be accomplished through software development, which will include integration of video and music, testing for program glitches, compatibility with various devices, and technology that can be implemented in a one-to-one or group setting. A pilot study will include an intervention vs. control design to assess the effectiveness and user ability of the program with students in grades K-6 with varying degrees of autism, thus validating the need and effectiveness of the program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oxygen distributions in the ocean thermocline are an effective way to infer changes in ventilation because physical processes (ventilation and circulation) that supply oxygen are primarily responsible for changes in interior oxygen concentrations. Reduced ventilation, as expected under global warming conditions, is signified by a reduction in oxygen inventories. However, natural variability such as decadal oscillations can obscure climatic trends; long-term data records are needed to fully distinguish between trends and cycles. This study will use available data, including Argo profiling floats, ship-based surveys, and satellite-derived surface densities, collected in the North Pacific over the past decades. This study is unique in that it examines physical mechanisms of ocean interior oxygen variability using a data-only approach, overcoming biases and misrepresentations possible with ocean models and reanalysis products. The team combines the expertise of two researchers in satellite oceanography and ocean hydrography respectively. Undergraduate summer interns will be incorporated into the project and trained in these fields with the goal of fostering geoscience education. Both PIs are also active in graduate student advising and outreach activities in public schools and at the Pacific Science Center. Results from this research will be included into such outreach, raising public awareness about the changing ocean environment. Monitoring ocean ventilation is important because a reduction in ventilation reduces the ocean ability to take up anthropogenic CO2 with important feedbacks to the global climate system. Declining North Pacific O2 concentrations may become stressors for marine organisms if threshold values are reached. The data methods used are transferrable to other ocean basins as well.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the North Pacific thermocline, where some of the world ocean's largest oxygen variations have been observed. These variations, described as bidecadal cycles on top of a small declining trend, are strongest on subsurface isopycnals that outcrop into the mixed layer the northwestern North Pacific. It has been hypothesized that changes in the isopycnal outcrop positions and area, including complete cessation of outcrop, are the cause for the subsurface oxygen changes observed downstream. Argo data will be combined with satellite sea surface data and ocean interior data from continued repeat hydrography sections, time series stations, and also emerging bio-Argo profiling floats (with O2 sensors) to examine records of North Pacific surface density over the past ~40 years, in combination with water transfer into the thermocline and ocean interior O2 variability. The study will focus on seasonal to decadal variability and long-term trends. Specific objectives are (1) computing sea surface density and isopycnal outcrop area variability in the northwestern North Pacific, (2) estimating annual subduction rates and O2 fluxes from the outcrops into the thermocline, and (3) linking subduction in the northwestern North Pacific to downstream oxygen variability in the northeast. It is hypothesized that surface densities in the northwestern North Pacific exhibit decadal cycles similar to subsurface oxygen (as well as a declining trend) and that oxygen variations in the eastern North Pacific interior (thermocline) are correlated with surface density/subduction rate variations in the northwestern North Pacific with a few year lag.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, DART studies rely upon the subjective human-based manual evaluation of animal skeletons for defects, which has a low sensitivity for defects, significant inter and intra pathologist variability, and is laborious and costly. The technology under development is based on a novel imaging and automated analysis solution for this problem that will shift the paradigm of skeletal evaluation from a qualitative to quantitative approach. Through improving DART study accuracy, the objective is to better detect teratogenic effects of compounds, reduce the overall number of animals required for these studies, and reduce the cost to develop therapeutics by improving throughput and reducing study cost. The market opportunity for this technology is expected to be significant. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to focus on the development and optimization of an optical CT imaging device and analysis software for use with mouse, rat and rabbit fetal samples for skeletal evaluation.

To accomplish this goal, the project will develop and implement a 12-session curriculum unit that will engage students in use of Geographic Information System (GIS) applications and modeling based on data collection within local watersheds, use UDL technologies to broaden inclusivity among learners, and engage nine experienced pilot teachers in co-designing and iteratively improving the curriculum over the three-year development period. A quasi-experimental, experimental/comparison group research design will be used to to answer the following research questions: 1. How does engagement in an inquiry project-based middle school watershed curriculum relate to students' confidence and efficacy in STEM subjects, 21st century learning skills, and interest in STEM careers? And 2. How does UDL support all learners (students who are intellectually gifted, students learning the English language, students who are economically disadvantaged, or students with disabilities) of an inquiry project-based middle school watershed curriculum? Middle school science teachers and their students will be recruited from California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia to participate in the project. Three teachers from each state will be recruited to pilot the curriculum in Year 1 and provide feedback to the curriculum team to inform curriculum and research revisions. The learning objectives and activities will be the same for both the experimental and comparison groups, but the comparison group curriculum will not include the UDL technologies<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Hilinski is working with graduate and undergraduate students to develop new chemical reactions that allow for reductions in the cost, time, and waste associated with preparing chemical compounds.  The targeted compounds have structural features that are found in the majority of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, as well as in other types of chemicals such as natural products, agricultural chemicals, and dyes. In addition to improving the ability to make known structures, the Hilinski laboratory is making structures that were previously unable to be made.  This allows other scientists to explore potentially, societally-beneficial applications of these new compounds. The scientific approach being employed focuses on ways in which petroleum by-products react with other inexpensive chemicals to form ring structures containing at least one nitrogen atom. The use of catalysts to promote these reactions allows for predictable control of the products and for the synthesis of different ring sizes.  The educational activities prepare students to communicate with non-scientists about their research and broader scientific implications. Professor Hilinski is creating and implementing a new science communication workshop for graduate and undergraduate students.  He is also establishing a yearly Chemistry department open house event, and he is developing a new outreach activity for an audience of school-age children. <br/><br/>Owing to the frequency with which nitrogen-containing heterocycles are found in pharmaceuticals, natural products, agrochemicals, and other bioactive or otherwise useful compounds, overcoming challenges in their synthesis is considered a key goal with broad potential impact. Professor Hilinski is developing new methods for saturated or partially saturated nitrogen-heterocycle synthesis that employ nitrenes as one-atom components in cycloaddition reactions. Several catalytic approaches are being pursued to achieve this underexploited strategy, including two-component formal cycloadditions initiated by nitrene transfer to olefins followed by spontaneous ring expansion or rearrangement, and multi-component formal cycloadditions between olefins, nitrenoid precursors, and a third component. Multiple classes of heterocycles of different ring sizes are being accessed using this strategy. The broader scientific impacts of this synthetic methodology research include the wide potential applicability to the synthesis of a variety of different compound classes. Other broader impacts include an enhancement students' skills in the area of science communication via establishment of a training workshop, and, through the education plan, the exposure of people in the local community to scientific research in a way that is accessible to a non-expert.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This remarkable skill has led to the hypothesis that children come to this task with an innate ability to learn certain types of grammatical patterns, namely those manifested in the languages of the world. Through exposure, they learn which patterns are relevant to their language. For example, children learning English initially produce a type of complex questions not grammatical in English, but resembling grammatical German questions. Over time, they learn this pattern is not English and no longer use it. An alternative explanation for these errors is that limited general cognitive capacities, specifically memory, attention, and sentence planning result in productions which only superficially resemble German questions. The goal of the project is to tease apart these possible explanations through controlled experimentation comparing elicited questions and answers by English speaking children and by German speaking children. The two hypotheses predict different error types. If the errors are the result of an innate predisposition, German speaking children should produce some questions resembling English. If the errors are the result of limited cognitive abilities, children learning each language should produce questions which are not consistent with such a predisposition. This research holds the potential to be used as a clinical diagnostic for investigating children's linguistic and cognitive development. <br/><br/>The research comprises novel experiments designed to test production and comprehension of multiclausal questions. Children between the ages of four and six will be given tests designed to assess their attention, working memory, and sentence planning abilities. By comparing performance of English and German speaking children, this project will further illuminate the role of input in language learning and provide a baseline for comparison for English-speaking children. Novel contributions include furthering the use and integration of psycholinguistic methodologies into linguistic work as well as investigating German children's as yet unstudied acquisition of this complex syntactic phenomenon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This new method will allow engineers to reconstruct the spatial and temporal distribution of the seismic input motion, without the need to resort to the reconstruction of the seismic event at the hypocenter, as is typically the case. Then, by using the reconstructed seismic motion, it will be possible to study the effect of an earthquake on the built environment, including subsurface systems (soil, foundations, and underground structures). Therefore, the method will serve as a tool to assess holistically the impact of earthquakes on the built environment during seismic events. The proposed research will present the mathematical and computational modeling of the new seismic-input identification method, as well as numerical results showing the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the method. The computer code, input data, and tutorials, necessary for using the new seismic-input identification method, will be disseminated through the DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure. These materials will help informed users to easily follow the research and extend it. Participating graduate students will gain broad knowledge and experience on wave propagation analyses and inverse problems. Moreover, hands-on projects will be used to motivate high school students, from underrepresented groups, to pursue STEM careers during the planned outreach program ``How do waves work?: watch, feel, and analyze waves??.<br/><br/>To date, there has been no robust numerical method that can identify complex, incoherent seismic input motions in a solid, truncated by a wave-absorbing boundary. Existing methods are limited to either simplified deconvolution techniques or large-scale seismic-source inversion approaches that can identify the seismic source parameters (however simple or complicated the adopted seismic source model may be) at the hypocenter. However, there are many complexities, inaccuracies, and uncertainties associated with the large-scale inversion approach that render it impractical for near-surface simulations. It is the aim of this research to bypass the complexities associated with the large-scale seismic source inversion by targeting the seismic-motion reconstruction near the surface. Specifically, this research will focus on the reconstruction of effective seismic input motion at the Domain Reduction Method (DRM) boundary, using a partial differential equation-constrained optimization method. The semi-infinite extent of the computational domain will be truncated by using Perfectly-Matched-Layers, and state and adjoint wave equations will be solved using the finite element method. The new seismic-input identification method will be the most accurate and efficient method for inferring seismic input motions in soil-structure systems. This method can accommodate arbitrary soil heterogeneity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cities are often built on top of sedimentary basins which trap, focus and amplify earthquake seismic energy. Prediction of strong ground motions is critical in these areas to prevent the loss of life and property in future large events. PI Denolle pioneered a new empirical approach which uses seismic ambient noise, for example generated by ocean waves, to predict large earthquake ground motions. PI Olsen is an expert in 3D numerical simulations of ground-notion dynamics. Here, the PIs join effort to cross-validate these approaches in the greater Los Angeles. They use ambient noise and small past-earthquake data to create a suite of large scenario earthquakes (magnitude 6.5 to 7.8) on the southern San Andreas fault. The simulations allow evaluating whether the underlying geological structure may channel earthquake waves and thereby strongly amplify the ground motions. This 2-year project will help mitigating seismic hazards in southern California. The PIs' methodology can be applied to other urban areas located in similar geological context. The project also supports an early career female scientist and provides training to three graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the coupling effect between the amplification due to seismic waveguides and that due to source directivity. This effect may enhance shaking intensity in sedimentary basins. The project uses southern California as a natural laboratory. Other large metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo, Mexico City, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Jakarta, are subjected to similar hazards. Here, the team innovates in using cross-validation between two state-of-the-art ground-motion prediction approaches: the ambient-noise Virtual Earthquake Approach and 3D dynamic simulations. This cross-validation allows i) establishing bounds of confidence in the two methods, ii) examining the coupling between path and source effects in enhancing ground motion, and iii) evaluating the extent of nonlinear effects on future ground motions. The novelty of the project is the unique combination of theoretical and observational seismology. In this effort, newly collected data from dense arrays including both broadband and nodal-seismic instruments will be exploited.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Earth, it is generated by the outer core, made of liquid iron with some nickel and light elements. Earth's magnetic field is important, as life may not exist without its shielding of the solar wind. Moreover, the heat rising from the core fuels mantle thermal convection, at the origin of plate tectonics and associated hazards. Understanding Earth's magnetic field and core heat flow requires detailed knowledge of iron-rich material properties at the extreme pressures and temperatures of the core. Yet, existing experimental data and theoretical calculations are inconsistent. Here, the multidisciplinary team investigates  the thermal and electrical conductivities of iron alloys at extreme conditions. They use a combination of state-of-the-art experiments, theory, and modeling at both the atomic scale and the scale of the core. Expected results should reconcile experiments and modeling of the core's heat transport and magnetic field evolution. This project supports one graduate student and two postdoctoral associates in the field of Mineral Physics. It has strong implications for Geomagnetism, Geodynamics and Seismology, and broad impacts in Materials Science.<br/><br/>High-pressure and temperature experiments are carried out in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell.  Extreme pressures and temperatures are generated at the tips of two opposing diamonds, where the iron sample is placed. The team will measure and compute electrical and thermal conductivities at conditions relevant to the core. This allows them to test the applicability of the Wiedemann-Franz law at these conditions. This empirical law relates thermal and electrical conductivities in metals. Here, the electrical conductivity is measured using a four-probe electrical connection brought outside from the cell. Thermal conductivity is measured by optical spectroradiometry in conjunction with pulsed-laser heating and modeling. Similar conditions are simulated using first-principles quantum mechanics to compute the electrical and thermal conductivity in liquid and solid iron, and compare them with experimental observations. These calculations are difficult because they involve the scattering of electrons off each other and off the moving atoms in the fluid or solid. Experimental and theoretical results are used in geophysical models of core cooling and magnetic field generation.  This will allow to better constrain the history of Earth's magnetic field and the heat flow at the core-mantle boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atmospheric CO2 is, however, only growing at about half the rate expected given human emissions. This difference is largely due to the removal of carbon from the atmosphere by terrestrial ecosystems and the oceans. This carbon-climate feedback is limited by how much CO2 the land and oceans can absorb from the atmosphere. This amount is, in turn, influenced by changes in the Earth's climate and its variability, raising questions about how the long-term potential for carbon removal may change. Large uncertainties remain in the direction and magnitude of future carbon-climate feedbacks and in projections of future atmospheric CO2 concentration. This project takes a step towards filling this gap in knowledge by bringing together scientists from many disciplines to integrate knowledge that has traditionally been developed independently. In particular, this project will target early career scientists from underrepresented groups to participate and bring new perspectives to bear on this problem.  The products of this conference will also be essential for policy makers and the development of climate adaptation plans.<br/><br/>The AGU Chapman conference in San Diego titled Understanding Carbon-Climate Feedbacks, will be instrumental in advancing the field by addressing the following key questions: <br/>1.	How can carbon-climate feedback processes be detected in the face of natural interannual, decadal, and centennial ecosystem variability?<br/>2.	What are the critical ecosystem processes, scales, and regions that control the total impact of carbon-climate feedbacks on the atmospheric CO2 inventory?<br/>3.	To what degree are global carbon-climate feedbacks dominated by sensitive ecoregions?<br/>4.	How can the contemporary knowledge of ecosystem process controls on carbon-climate feedbacks be used to improve predictions of climate systems?<br/>The participants in the meeting will discuss and establish the top priorities for ecosystem science development to reduce the uncertainties of climate predictions and support an improved response to a rapidly changing planet. This conference will provide key input and guidance for new research directions within ecosystem studies that will yield direct benefits to climate science, as well as broader benefits to global society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device.

The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source.

Currently, most wearable heart monitors detect the electrical activity of the heart, namely the electrocardiogram signal. However, the mechanical activities of the heart can also reveal valuable information about the health status of an individual. Commercial motion sensors, i.e. accelerometers and gyroscopes, can detect these activities by recording the vibrations induced by the heartbeat on the chest wall. However, the recorded vibrations often become contaminated by motion noise arising from sources other than the heart, such as the movement of the subjects. This research proposes a novel combination of hardware design and algorithm development to solve this problem as well as to provide more advanced heart health status metrics compared to current state-of-the-art wearable sensors. An array of motion sensors will be embedded in a wearable strap and placed around the chest wall. The algorithm takes advantage of the extra information provided by the sensor array to eliminate the motion noise in the recordings. Other types of sensors (such as electrical and optical sensors) will also be embedded in the system to augment the evaluation of heart wellness and provide detection of heart failure. Such a system will be invaluable for the home-based detection and management of cardiac diseases. The proposed research will be combined with various educational and outreach efforts. Specifically, the PI will engage high school students through the Liberty Science Center's ""Partners in Science"" program and continue to recruit undergraduate students, especially from female and minority groups, through the Summer Scholars Research Program at Stevens. The PI will also participate in providing data to Physiobank, which is the largest biophysical database online, available for the free use of the biomedical research community. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a wearable, multi-modal cardiovascular monitoring system with high robustness. There has been significant effort recently on the development of non-invasive wearable systems, in particular devices that monitor cardiac electrophysiology. However, in addition to the electrical aspects, a perspective on the mechanical activities of the heart and blood vessels also needs to be gained for a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular health. Progress in the area of wearable cardio-mechanical sensing is currently hindered by the challenge of overcoming motion artifacts. This research proposes a holistic hardware/software solution to this problem by implementing an array of inertial measurement units which are placed around the chest wall and record both the linear and rotational components of heart-induced chest vibrations. A model-based signal processing algorithm which takes advantage of the redundant information provided by the sensor array will then be applied to remove motion noise components from cardio-mechanical recordings in an embedded platform. The second thrust of this research is to augment the proposed cardio-mechanical sensing system with the more standard modalities of ECG and photoplethysmography (PPG). Sensor fusion algorithms will be used on the multi-modal signals to extract further cardiovascular features as well as increase the accuracy of the monitoring process. Finally, abnormality detection and classification algorithms will analyze the derived features to evaluate the wellness of the cardiovascular system and to detect heart failure. This research advances the state of cardio-mechanical sensing in terms of robustness and motion tolerance. Additionally, the proposed combined analysis of linear and rotational heartbeat-induced chest wall movements will provide a deeper insight into the theorem of cardio-mechanical sensing. Finally, the proposed noise cancellation approach provides an embedded framework for the extraction of weak biophysical signals from strong background noises and can be applied to other biophysical sensing modalities in similar application scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their importance, ecological processes in drylands are poorly understood relative to wetter systems. This lack of knowledge limits available information for informed dryland management. The project aims to address this knowledge gap by training US undergraduate and graduate students to carry out international research in dryland ecosystems. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb Research Opportunity will provide intensive training for eighteen US students over a three year period. The student activities will last for eight weeks each summer, during which students will conduct research at the Gobabeb Research and Training Centre, located in the heart of the oldest desert in the world, the Namib Desert of Namibia. US students will work collaboratively with Namibian interns, Namibian mentors, and US PIs to design and carry out novel research projects that will use a unique precipitation gradient to explore how climate and soil composition affect ecological processes in drylands. Students will prepare for the research experience through an online seminar in the semester before travel and will participate in follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following their research experience. These research projects will train a cohort of US students in research techniques, positioning them for careers that will advance our understanding of dryland ecosystems. The use of research teams composed of US students, Namibian interns, and Namibian faculty mentors will provide valuable training in collaborative research and communication skills. This program will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged dryland scientists, thus enhancing capacities and contributing to the ecological knowledge base, paramount for sustainable use and management of drylands. <br/><br/>Scientific understanding of ecological processes in dryland systems is limited relative to wetter systems. This knowledge gap reflects both historical research biases and the transmission of these biases to successive generations of student scientists. Little scientific study of drylands is amplified by the fact that vast areas of global drylands are located in developing nations with limited scientific resources. A step toward enhancing our basic and applied knowledge in drylands is providing training opportunities for students in international dryland research and developing a next generation of scientific leaders who can effectively collaborate in international arenas. Increased leadership by US scientists in international dryland research will enhance understanding of our own drylands and improve basic science and land management in developing nations. The Namib Desert of Namibia offers a unique natural experiment for quantifying mechanistic controls over biogeochemical, ecological, and physiological processes in drylands because of a steep precipitation gradient coincides with contrasting soil surfaces. The close geographic proximity of sites with contrasting rainfall and soil types, access to a well-equipped research station, and existing relationships with Namibian scientists make this an excellent site for a research training program that will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged dryland scientists. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb Research Opportunity (GDC-GRO) will facilitate research projects which will be carried out by teams of US students (undergraduate and graduate) and Namibian interns who will work closely with Namibian mentors and US PIs. A total of eighteen US students will participate (four undergraduates and two graduate students in each of the three years). Intensive IRES activities will last eight weeks each year, with preparation activities in the semester beforehand through an online seminar and follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following the IRES experience. Key players in this proposal are Namibian mentors (from University of Namibia, Namibia University of Science and Technology and Gobabeb Research and Training Centre) who are eager to work with student teams and US PIs to develop substantive research projects across the Namib precipitation gradient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research has a goal to develop a user-friendly open library of biodiversity and ecosystem service models for pollinators that stakeholders can use to deliver local and global predictive maps, based on different environmental scenarios, in particular, those associated with climate change. Motivation for the project comes from the fact that the loss of biodiversity, in particular with regard to pollinators, negatively impacts food security, agricultural and economically important plant productivity, and human well-being. Work will include the co-development of modelling software with key stakeholder communities and the comparison of results from different modelling approaches presently used to generate scenarios and impacts of evolving conditions on pollinator abundance and diversity. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between US scientists and those from Argentina, Spain, and The Netherlands. They also involve a strong potential for improving food security and crop productivity, world-wide, through a better understanding of the impacts of ecosystem changes on pollinators and how these might be impacted by climate change. Other impacts include the provision of science-based findings that can be used by decision and policy makers as well as non-governmental organizations and public administrators faced with declining pollinator abundance and biodiversity. The work also builds infrastructure for science by generating new co-developed predictive models with key stakeholder groups to provide increased utility and provides public outreach via social media and generation of short videos showcasing the project and its work. This project includes workforce training of a graduate student and broadens participation of underrepresented groups in sciences by supporting an investigator whose gender is underrepresented in the sciences. <br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project addresses the issue of pollinator biodiversity and abundance and its socio-enviro-economic impacts related to crop pollination. This research examines various scenarios of pollinator population response and impact on ecosystems services using modelling and data collection/aggregation, the development of scenarios tied to drivers related to land-use changes, changes caused by human intervention, and changes in climate and the environment. Scenarios predicting the future of biodiversity and its associated services are a powerful tool to inform conservation and agricultural resource planning. The research compares three families of models. These are based on (1) data mining, (2) statistical relationships and (3) mechanistic models. All will be parameterized using newly collected and formerly collected data available from four different countries located on three continents. The output of the independently developed models will be used to identify gaps in knowledge and provide insights about the residual uncertainties in the predictive capacity of the various models. The research employs the open source environment, k.LAB, which is a platform designed to give access to an integrated network of web-accessible models, to co-develop a user-friendly open library of modelled pollinator scenarios in collaboration with key stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the US alone, there are 600,000 new stroke patients each year who rely on conventional one-on-one therapies for recovery. Due to cost and labor limitations they do not receive consistent, frequent, and intensive training needed for full recovery and optimal quality of life. As a result, stroke care guidelines recommend robotic rehabilitation in all care settings. Providing robotic rehabilitation using the proposed exoskeleton robots is a compelling solution for hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and senior living communities. In addition to providing frequent and intensive therapy, the devices can accurately measure patient progress and performance for personalized care. The exoskeletons are also a powerful research tool into effective rehabilitation methods and have the potential to transform the manufacturing sector by providing a solution for industrial processes that are too complex for full automation and too physically demanding for humans. The proposed exoskeleton devices reduce the risk of injury from accidents and overexertion for individuals performing repetitive, high-stress tasks.

The proposed project addresses these deficits and will result in exoskeleton robots capable of essential advanced rehabilitation behaviors. During the Phase I project, a high-performance, force-controlled actuator was developed and will be the core component enabling the desired behavior.

The program also supports research in broadening participation in STEM.<br/><br/>The University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, lead institution for the Arkansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ARK-LSAMP), will implement a new STEM Pathways and Research Alliance (SPRA) project over a five-year duration (2019-2023).  Eight two-and four-year institutions comprise the ARK-LSAMP alliance and will implement the interventions.  In addition to UAPB, the participating institutions are:  Arkansas State University (ASU), Philander Smith College (PSU), the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville (UAF) and the University of Arkansas-Little Rock (UALR), Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas (PCCUA), Southeast Arkansas College (SEARK) and Pulaski Technical College (PTC).  The alliance is led by a minority-serving institution and includes both minority (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and non-minority-serving institutions. The project will be implemented in an Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction to enhance STEM research and educational capability and capacity. <br/><br/>The ARK-LSAMP SPRA project proposes to increase the number of community college transfer students to STEM four-year programs and to increase the number of STEM B. S. degrees to the targeted populations.  The main emphasis of the project is to study eight variables related to persistence at the undergraduate level and entry into STEM graduate studies.  As a means of testing the impact of college readiness and co-curricular interventions on the recruitment, retention, graduation and graduate school entry of ARK-LSAMP, the research study is guided by the following research questions:<br/>1. Which pre-college readiness experiences best predict the enrollment of URM in STEM academic disciplines?<br/>2. Which co-curricular interventions best predict persistence and graduation for URM students in STEM majors?<br/>3. Which co-curricular interventions best predict entry into graduate STEM education programs?<br/>4. Which academic co-curricular interventions best predict entry into post-baccalaureate<br/>employment in a STEM field?<br/><br/>Recruitment and retention strategies to be employed by ARK-LSAMP include continuing its Pre-First Year Summer Institute, undergraduate research experiences, mentoring and advising, and STEM professional development activities that include student conference attendance and research presentation nationally and abroad.  The alliance has placed an emphasis on increasing male and Hispanic participation in STEM in the region during this project period. <br/><br/>A mixed-methods process and impact evaluation will be conducted during the project period.  Broad sharing of project findings from implementation, research and evaluation will be conducted through institutional websites, social media, brochures, newsletters.  Dissemination to non-academic sectors, such the Arkansas Economic Development community, is also planned.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To enable the development of new therapies, there is a need for better functional control of long-term, physiologically relevant in vitro models that are translatable to the clinic and ultimately increase treatment efficacy and mitigate patient risk. While many components are necessary for a physiologically relevant model, one key area of concern is the substrate upon which neural cells are grown. In vitro cell culture platforms using substrates such as matrigel and recombinant human laminin can result in aggregation and delamination of cultured neurons within a week. The synthetic polymer substrate we are developing is designed to promote neural cell attachment and reduce delamination, enabling long-term culture and functional analysis of the cells. Furthermore, a defined substrate formulation is desirable for maintaining cell culture consistency that is expected to yield more homogenous neural cell populations, which is an advantage over animal-derived substrates.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will focus on the commercial potential of novel synthetic polymers upon which neural progenitor cells (NPCs) can grow, expand, and differentiate into neural cell lineages. The proposed product is expected to enable enhanced neural cell attachment, while maintaining viability and functionality for long-term cell culture applications. The synthetic substrate is a poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG)-based polymer that can be mechanically modulated to alter its physical properties. Additionally, bioactive modifications that mimic the native cellular microenvironment can be incorporated to enhance functionality. A key feature of this polymer is that chemical and mechanical properties are preserved across different synthesis protocols, significantly reducing the risk of batch-to-batch variability, which is a major concern with commercially available natural substrates such as matrigel. The synthetic polymer system has previously been used to enhance the attachment of other stem cell-derived cultures such as endothelial cells and preliminary data suggest that it will support stem cell-derived NPC culture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will revolutionize how we track and manage water usage, improve conservation, eliminate water waste, and lower overall operating and maintenance costs. At the same time, the new monitoring system enables large reductions in water consumption, electricity utilization and carbon generation relative to water production, transmission, distribution and recycling. This will improve the water system just as electrical usage and monitoring dramatically improved energy consumption for buildings, i.e. in lighting systems. The data analytics solution is scalable within all water fixtures Most importantly, it can be cost-effectively produced in the U.S. and create sustainable, green jobs. We envision this project will eliminate the need for replacing water fixture parts on a schedule because we don?t know when or how things fail, and it will enable Smart Buildings and Smart Cities to protect an increasingly scarce and expensive resource. <br/><br/>The proposed project will build upon the successful technical and customer discoveries from Phase I to develop the ability for a building owner to know when a leak occurs in a water fixture before it does damage, wastes a precious resource, or creates a potential health risk. In Phase I, we demonstrated a Minimum Viable Product that is essentially a ?smoke alarm for water fixtures? that provides a building owner alerts when a water fixture presents signs of a leak, before it does damage. The device is inside an affordable platform can be economically produced in the U.S. Current estimates are that ~23% of water produced is wasted and does damage in the process. Building owners seek a solution that will conserve water, reduce costs and improve their environmental impact. In Phase II, we will measure water from drips to flowing water, develop an IoT device that is simple to install and use, develop powerful analytics for predictive rather than reactive maintenance, and generate data valued by insurance companies and property owners. Data analytics can make the water delivery and consumption process considerably more reliable, and reduce loss and damage significantly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tiny constructs are also easily modified to incorporate biomolecules or nanoparticles, making them highly promising as tools to perform mechanical testing at a molecular scale or to create shape transforming materials. However, realizing the functional potential of such DNA-based devices or materials requires a robust approach for the rapid and precise control of their motion. To address these challenges, dynamic DNA-based devices and materials will be integrated with magnetic actuation platforms to enable robust and cost-effective approaches to test mechanical properties of biomolecules and DNA-based nanomaterials whose shape and properties can be magnetically controlled in real-time. These devices and materials can have broad applications in fields including biophysics, nanomanufacturing, biosensing, and nanorobotics. In addition, the research project will provide inter-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in fields including magnetism, biophysics, DNA nanotechnology, and nanomaterials. The work will be translated into broader science and engineering workforce training through outreach activities for high- and middle-school students and teachers in topics of physics, engineering and biology (e.g. magnetism, mechanics, DNA) with hands-on classroom and laboratory projects that demonstrate DNA self-assembly and magnetic actuation of DNA devices.<br/><br/>DNA-based self-assembly is a powerful method to create nano-constructs of molecular systems. To achieve the full potential of these systems rapid temporal (sub-second) and high spatial (10-50 nm) control has remained a challenge. This work will integrate design and hierarchical assembly of DNA devices and materials with a domain-wall based magnetic tweezers platform to enable advanced controlled actuation of DNA constructs. These magnetic tweezers allow for simultaneous control of multiple magnetic particles with force and motion inputs in multiple directions and at multiple locations. The study will thus leverage magnetically driven DNA constructs to develop force spectroscopy platforms with a focus on testing effects of applied forces on molecular interactions, in particular protein-DNA interactions. The devices will enable application of forces in multiple directions (e.g. tension and compression), which is highly challenging with other methods, while the DNA structures provide precise control over relative positioning and orientation of molecular samples. Furthermore, materials will be developed based on hierarchical assembly of DNA nanostructures where domain-wall magnetic tweezers will drive expansion, collapse, or rotation of materials and/or underlying components. Geometrical parameters and actuation forces will be guided by finite element simulations to render novel tailored DNA structural metamaterials with tunable properties such as negative Poisson's ratio or drastic shape changes that can be controlled via user-defined or computer controlled magnetic fields. Outreach and education efforts will engage students and high school teachers through the Ohio State University Translating Engineering to K through 8 program.

This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production.<br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach has the potential to reveal how critical regions of the deep ocean changed in nutrient and carbon content, as well as temperature, over the last glacial cycle, in ways that have not been possible previously. The project will be carried out in collaboration with Spanish colleagues in Barcelona, who are experts in the maintenance of deep-sea corals in aquarium culture. The research team will grow living cultures of the solitary coral species Desmophyllum dianthus over a period of months to years, while carefully controlling the chemical composition and temperature of the seawater in which they grow. By calibrating the composition of the calcium carbonate skeletons of these organisms relative to tightly controlled seawater properties in the laboratory and in the modern ocean, the researchers will develop quantitative relationships that enable analysis of well-dated fossil corals and inference of the properties of the seawater in which the ancient corals grew. Such fossils can be collected from the sea bottom and dated. Large collections have been archived from the waters around New Zealand, a critical region for ocean-atmosphere interactions. Knowing the seawater properties from archived and new seawater measurements in this region will allow the principal investigators to test the conclusions found in the lab against relationships seen in corals growing in the natural ocean.

The slow progress on addressing these challenges has led to increasing emphasis on the need to go beyond the study and encouragement of incremental change. Conventional knowledge and capacity building to tackle the challenges associated with sustainability have had limited positive impacts; consequently, there is growing need for more fundamental knowledge on how transformations in the way societies interact both with each other and with the natural environment.  Societal transformations refer to profound and enduring systemic changes that typically involve social, cultural, technological, political, economic and environmental processes. A comprehensive and concerted research initiative is needed that can boost research on transformations to sustainability and catalyze new kinds of solutions to environmental and social challenges. <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 19-country initiative through the Belmont Forum- NORFACE-ISSC.  Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that will contribute to re-structuring the broad field of sustainability research.  Co-production of knowledge and research problem formulation is considered to be critical to the process of societal transformation and each project engages stakeholders or community-based partners.  The initiative seeks to develop the fundamental knowledge societies require to help develop transformations to sustainability which are of significant social concern throughout the world and of great relevance to both academics and stakeholders.  The T2S program aims to build capacity, overcome fragmentation and have a lasting impact on both society and the research landscape by cultivating durable research collaboration across multiple borders, disciplinary boundaries, and with practitioners and societal partners. This includes facilitating the development of new research collaborations with parts of the world which are not often involved in large-scale international research efforts, notably low- and middle-income countries.  The funds provided in this award will be used to support U.S. participants to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., civil society, NGOs, and industry).  Participants from other countries are funded through their national funding organizations. <br/><br/>As an invisible resource, groundwater requires visualization; as an underground supply, it calls for technologies of extraction; as a finite good, groundwater needs to be shared, protected and cared for; and as a practical everyday resource, it is needed to sustain irrigation, sanitation, and human consumption. This project seeks to comparatively study promising community driven initiatives around water resource sustainability practices and governance models in places where pressures on the resource are particularly acute (India, Algeria, Morocco, USA, Chile, Peru, Tanzania).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This creates an untapped opportunity to develop the technology further to support low volume industrial manufacturing for price sensitive and emerging markets. The ability to source locally available raw material and feed it directly as pellets or shavings into a printer rather than extruded filament is extremely advantageous for both manufacturer and end user in regards to reducing cost and increasing capabilities in prototyping. The benefits of this innovation is amplified when 3D printing large-scale industrial objects (defined as > 18 inches cubed). First, the production of large-scale products represent a larger investment of time and material costs (pellets are ~ 1/10th the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet extrusion is it addresses the need to print faster. Finally, a dependence on extruded thermoform plastics limits the available library for printing and the ability to mix materials to engineer new formulations. With domain expertise in large-scale 3D FFF printing, re:3D proposes to evolve a prototype pellet 3D printer developed under Phase I to be able to address all of these needs by coupling direct drive pellet extrusion technology with a grinder, dryer and feeding system optimized for reclaimed plastics. <br/><br/><br/>re:3D intends to leverage Phase I research conducted on material requirements for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), two of the most available reclaimed plastics worldwide, to further optimize the pellet printer to be able to accept reclaimed flake as well as non uniform pellets. This effort will include developing the ability to consistently dry the input materials and to easily clean and switch between materials. A novel mechanism for feeding larger volumes of pellets and/or flake into the platform will also be developed with the requisite controls. Once complete, the company will pilot the solution in Texas through IC2 as well as in Puerto Rico, an island territory with a complicated supply chain, in conjunction with waste streams/partners identified by the Puerto Rico Science & Research Trust. The new hardware integration solutions developed in Phase 2 will be incorporated into the Phase I prototype platform which leveraged Michigan Technological University's (MTU) prior work conducting validation and materials testing in Phase I, prior work modifying direct drive recyclebots for FFF 3D printers, and open source firmware and software research. To ensure excellence, prototypes will be extensively tested using MTU's facilities with reclaimed PP and PET in prints to be used for casting, mold production and load bearing applications. Once the prototype design for commercial scalability has been validated at MTU and field-tested, all progress will be openly documented and shared in an effort to scale the solution suite to multiple platforms as quickly as possible. The hardware will be sold commercially after completing the project as both an integrated 3D printing solution and also as independent hardware due to the potential to be applied beyond Cartesian 3D printing systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, heightened frequency of landslides and rockfalls commonly occur in the months - and even years - following an earthquake. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project seeks to capture perishable data from several rock slopes highly susceptible to rockfall that were affected by the recent earthquake in Anchorage. By doing this, we may compare the rate and frequency of rockfall occurrence to pre-earthquake levels in order to better understand how much rockfall activity increases following shaking, and how long it takes to return to pre-earthquake levels.  This has implications for post-earthquake recovery and seismic resilience throughout much of the US and abroad.  <br/><br/>Earthquakes often trigger significant rockfall activity in steep cliffs. The recent 2018 November 30th Alaska earthquake caused significant shaking (up to 0.4g) across the Anchorage region, resulting in numerous rockfalls, landslides, and lateral spreads. The combination of potentially large volumes, high velocities, long travel distances, and impact forces make the rockfall hazard significant. Based on observations from past events in New Zealand, it is believed that rockfall activity over at least the next several months will exceed ""normal"" baseline levels before decreasing. Nevertheless, as is often the case, the previous research does not have detailed baseline information prior to the event. This prior research begs three primary scientific questions: what is ""baseline"" rockfall activity? How does shaking translate to increased rockfall activity, magnitude, and frequency particularly in the heterogenous geologic conditions encountered in the rock slopes surrounding Anchorage? And lastly, how quickly does rockfall activity and magnitude return to baseline conditions?  This project seeks to collect rockfall activity rates through repeat terrestrial laser scanning at well-characterized rockfall sites near Anchorage. Change detection will be performed and the rate of rockfall activity characterized in comparison to previous epochs and the serial data collected as part of this project. With existing baseline data not influenced by recent seismic activity, we will characterize and compare the activity rate following shaking. This investigation will provide fundamental knowledge about the process that dictates both the increase and decay in rockfall activity after seismic disturbance. The resulting knowledge will provide data needed to support and advance modern performance- and risk-based extreme event design methodologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broad goal of the Santa Fe Conference series is to bring together present and future leaders in the field for in-depth discussion of fundamental aspects of rock and mineral magnetism, and applications in global geophysics, tectonics, extraterrestrial magnetism, and surficial environmental studies; these discussions are intended to be more intensive, interactive and sustained than is possible under the format of large society meetings.  Broader impacts of this activity include: (1) transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary communication to foster new approaches to geoscience problems involving iron minerals and their use as paleomagnetic field recorders and as indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions and Earth processes; and (2) the development of young scientists by providing the opportunity to meet and interact with leading international researchers, gain a deeper understanding and broader perspective, and form the basis for future cross-disciplinary collaborations.<br/><br/>One explicit aim of the 2019 conference is to explore short-term (decadal to millennial) variations in the geomagnetic field, their records in natural and archeological materials, and their effects on the production of radionuclides such as 10Be and 14C in the Earth?s atmosphere. Plenary speakers include a leading expert in cosmogenic nuclides . Another key objective is to examine the new understanding of stable remanence in nonuniformly magnetized grains that is being achieved through novel approaches to magnetic microscopy and numerical micromagnetic modeling. The meeting includes a full-day workshop on modeling of magnetic microstructures using the MERRILL software, including a keynote presentation, discussion of the state-of-the-art by leading experts, and hands-on exercises that will teach workshop participants how to apply advanced modeling in their own research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will also conduct an additional 25 interviews with state actors assisting in these transitions.  Participant observation over a period of several months will allow inferences regarding the variety of contexts relevant to the transition to adulthood for youths subject to precarity.  Re-interviews with a subset of youths at a second time point will allow inferences regarding how the relevant processes evolve over time, as well as analysis of key outcomes that have occurred during the interval.  Qualitative analyses using Atlas.ti will permit iterative coding of the interview and observational data, allowing both deductive and inductive approaches.  Findings will inform key literatures on the sociology of law, the role of state supports of youth, and the transition to adulthood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in the wetness of Arctic land surfaces can have consequences for vegetative stress, susceptibility to wildfires, and terrestrial release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Land surface wetness may also affect wildlife, as well as human activities such as subsistence hunting and fishing, overland travel, access to resources, and water availability. Global climate models are unanimous in projecting increases in Arctic precipitation and nearly so in projecting increases of runoff. Projections of net moisture flux, or the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration, vary widely among models, especially during the warm season. Observational data point to recent decreases in soil moisture for at least some parts of the Arctic, consistent with increasing evapotranspiration in a warming climate, but increases in surface water in other areas. This study will synthesize different types of existing data to optimize model projections of anticipated changes to Arctic surface wetness. In addition to improved understanding of how a key Arctic process is represented in global models, the broader impacts of this project include training for a graduate student and dissemination of results to policy and stakeholder communities through the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning and Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy programs. <br/>  <br/>The investigators will synthesize three types of existing data on Arctic evapotranspiration (ET): in situ measurements from observing sites, remote-sensing-derived estimates of ET, and global climate model output. They will use these diverse data sources to: 1) clarify the drivers of ET variations over time in different vegetative types and 2) evaluate climate model simulations of terrestrial ET and its variability in the Arctic. The field sites will include various tundra and boreal vegetation types, both with and without permafrost, and observations will include incident radiation, humidity, and wind speed to assess the drivers of ET in the data and in climate models. Global climate model output will come primarily from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Satellite remote-sensing-derived estimates will come from MODIS archives and will bridge the scale discrepancy between models and in situ measurements. Validation of model output against in situ and remote-sensing derived estimates will focus on variation in ET over timescales of days to years. Synthesis of the three types of information will assess key processes that climate models must capture to produce credible projections of Arctic terrestrial hydrology.  Based on their ability to capture seasonal cycles and ET over various vegetation types, the investigators will identify the most realistic global models, along with their formulational and structural characteristics. Results will help set priorities for model improvement and model selection to enable more robust conclusions about the trajectory of Arctic terrestrial surface wetness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research develops new catalysts based on the modification of enzymes, i.e. biocatalysts, for the synthesis of heterocycles. Aromatic heterocycles are and important component of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Strategies to prepare and modify aromatic heterocycles using environmentally-friendly biocatalysts are underdeveloped. Professor Hyster's laboratory uses light and enzymes to develop new biocatalytic reactions that produce heterocycles.  Consequently, the students who undertake the research acquire work skills that are essential for a variety of science and engineering careers. In concert with this research, the Hyster lab engages in a series of outreach activities to expand the public's awareness of the role of biocatalysis in daily lives. <br/><br/>Enzymes are attractive catalysts for chemical synthesis because they can be tuned to provide unparalleled levels of efficiency and selectivity for even the most challenging organic reactions. However, the use of biocatalysts has been relegated to reactions found in nature. The goal of this project is to develop novel biocatalysts for the selective synthesis of novel, nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This is achieved by developing enzymatic strategies that affect the redox properties of the heterocycle to facilitate single electron transfer reactions. Fundamental studies are conducted to elucidate how the enzymes activate the heterocycle for electron transfer and control the stereochemical outcome of subsequent transformations.

Coastal cities in the United States are home to millions of people and are vulnerable to extreme rainfall and flooding caused by tropical storms. It is known that urban areas increase flooding because of their vast paved surfaces, but less is known about how urban areas impact the rainfall during these storms. This study examines if urban areas result in an increase in rainfall during tropical cyclone storms. Changes in flooding associated with urban development are of broad interest for flood management. Understanding and quantifying how urban areas impact rainfall and flooding can lead to improved local flood forecasts. This could help to inform governmental policy on managing the impacts of floods. This project contributes to the education of one graduate student, provides internship opportunities for several undergraduate students to nurture their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields, and offers professional development workshops for high school teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on land-falling tropical cyclones impacting major U.S. cities over a nearly 40-year period to examine the role played by urbanization in controlling the rainfall and flooding associated with these storms. The specific goals of the proposed research are to: 1) improve our understanding of the role of urban areas in modifying rainfall associated with U.S. land-falling tropical cyclones; 2) quantify the impacts of the cities in exacerbating flood response; and 3) characterize the urban signature in terms of the alteration of precipitation and runoff during the passage of tropical cyclones. The proposed work is built on both observations and modeling results, providing a comprehensive examination of the interactions between tropical cyclones and urban areas. The knowledge, tools, and datasets developed in this project enhance the methodological tools used for characterizing tropical cyclone rainfall in urban areas and advance interdisciplinary studies of hydrologic and atmospheric science, regional climate modeling, climatology, and applied statistics.

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and five European nations, seeks to quantify the magnitude, spatial extent and timing of aerial migrations (birds and insects), and their functional relations to environmental and socio-economic variables. Migratory bird and insect populations involve thousands of tons of animal biomass that move through the air within and across continents at various times of the year. Migratory flying animals play significant roles in shaping ecosystems through a variety of transport and trophic effects that also represent services and disservices to human infrastructure, agriculture, and welfare. This project reveals the role these organisms have in shaping the diversity of ecological communities, as well as providing information to allow the better utilization of their related ecosystems services and reducing their negative impacts. This requires the tracking and quantification of these species and their movements across continents, i.e. over large spatial and temporal scales. This study investigates past changes in important drivers of change such as climate; the expansion of urban areas; deployment of energy infrastructure, like wind farms; and changes in land use/agriculture. Data and results will be modeled to develop projections for future changes under environmental and human-induces scenarios. Current and archived radar data of biomasses of aerial migrants will be used. Drivers resulting in changes in patterns of migrations and local ecosystem function will be used to develop behavior-based models for generating predictions under future changes. The broader impacts of this work include international collaboration with scientists from five other countries (UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland), the generation of data to improve policy and resource management decisions, and information to help reduce airplane damage from bird strikes. Other impacts include training a postdoctoral scholar in interdisciplinary, international, team-oriented, collaborative research and the creation of new software that allows others to process data on aerial migrations in terms of variables such as weather, climate, land use, wind, and light.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this major international effort between the US and five European countries will addresses challenging and pressing biodiversity issues related to aerial migratory species (birds and insects) across scales from local to continental. For the project, each country will fund its own scientists and their part of the overall project. The interdisciplinary team consists of ecologists, meteorologists, and computer scientists who will use the existing infrastructure of continental weather (and other) radars to generate a standardized large-scale, long-term monitoring of migratory aerial biomass flows, as well as develop sustainable data and analytical infrastructure and workflows that that can be used by other present and future stakeholders. Motivation for this study comes from the fact that aerial migratory animals are an integral component of biodiversity and have been declining at an alarming rate. Identifying their response to climatic and land-use changes, light pollution and wind energy development is fundamental for efficient conservation and mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts. Thus, this research links various stakeholders from scientists to meteorologists to conservation practitioners and policy makers and to the wind energy sector and aviation safety. Goas are to develop (a) standard long-term and large-scale monitoring of aerial migrations; (b) information to feed policies associated with the proliferation of artificial light; (c) establish aerial migratory species death-mitigation procedures for wind energy installations and aircraft; and (d) policies for conservation of crucial (aerial) habitat, migratory locations, and major migration time-periods that are essential for sustaining migratory populations. Research will entail quantifying the magnitude, spatial extent, and timing of aerial migrations; understanding their (functional) relations with environmental and socio-economic variables; and projecting the consequences of future changes in these variables on migratory populations. This will be achieved by retrieving biological information from weather radar networks using methods that rely on machine learning and statistical analyses to quantify biomass flows of aerial migrants in Europe and North America. It will also estimate the role of migrants in ecosystem functioning and how aerial migratory biomass flows is impacted by external human induced variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The best known example of our Earth's vulnerability to its surrounding neighborhood in space is the meteorite impact 65 million years ago that led to extinction of the dinosaurs. The recent discovery of a radioactive isotope that decays over time (iron-60) in samples from marine sediments on Earth has led to the idea that one or more nearby supernova explosions showered the Earth with particles (atomic nuclei) in the last few million years. In fact, there is the possibility that this event triggered a major environmental change about 3 million years ago. In this project, the researchers will perform an independent test of the idea that one or more supernova explosions influenced the Earth during the last 5 million years. The focus is on Helium-3 in marine sediments which is dominated by the presence of interplanetary dust particles and is not supplied in any significant amount from supernova explosions. Thus, the new results will provide further support for the supernova hypothesis if there is no correlation between helium-3 and iron-60. Astronomical models predict that supernova events should be recorded in marine sediments over a duration of 100,000 to 400,000 years. However, work to date has not been able to resolve the duration of such events and thus the new (helium-3) measurements will provide a significantly improved sense of the duration of such events, and help to answer the question of whether a single event, or multiple supernova events, occurred during the last 5 million years. <br/><br/>The timing of the most recent supernova event recorded by iron-60 in the sediment cores lies between 1.7 and 3.2 million years ago (based on dating with cosmogenic beryllium-10). This supernova event may be responsible for major environmental changes that occurred during the Pliocene-to-Pleistocene transition. The objective of this project is to further evaluate the record and timing of this supernova event during the last 5 million years by addressing the following hypotheses:<br/>Hypothesis 1. Terrestrial iron-60 is derived from supernova input while helium-3 is derived from interstellar dust particles. Following this hypothesis, we expect to see no covariation in the measured levels of helium-3 and iron-60. The absence of such a covariation would firmly establish a supernova source for the iron-60 origin. <br/>Hypothesis 2. Mass accumulation rates determined from the new helium-3 analyses reveal that more than a single SN event is discernible. These events should have a timescale of 100-400 kyr, as predicted from transport time modeling from a supernova within a distance of 100 parsecs from the solar system. <br/>Hypothesis 3. The extraterrestrial helium-3 flux from interstellar dust particles determined in the sediment cores increases from Pliocene to Quaternary time. This would be consistent with earlier studies of Pacific sediments, but the increase has not been verified at sites in other ocean basins.<br/>The investigative approach provides a critical test of the idea that a nearby supernova significantly affected Earth's surface processes and its biota in the recent geologic past.<br/><br/>The project uses sediment core samples recovered by the R/V Eltanin from the South Australian Bight that are housed in the Antarctic core collection at Oregon State University. The project supports a post-doctoral investigator to carry out work at the OSU Marine and Geology Repository and in the Noble Gas Geochemistry Lab. Results from the project will be incorporated into graduate level earth science classes taught at OSU.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without this assistance these scientists could not normally participate. This Congress, which has a special programming thread for early career scientists, will give U.S. participants the unique opportunity to discuss their original research among their cohort of awardees and with U.S. and international scientists at all career stages.  These interactions will likely result in improvements of the analysis of existing data, and the generation of ideas for the gathering of additional data and the construction of new hypotheses through disciplinary and interdisciplinary work. The broader impact of this fellowship program is in the exposure of the awardees to excellent international research and in giving them the opportunity to show their research at the international level. Such participation will likely foster international collaboration, keep them engaged, give them the opportunity to interact with preeminent scientists across the many Quaternary science subdisciplines, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. These awardees can establish long-lasting scientific relationships as has happened in previous editions of the program. A mentoring component is also planned in which senior U.S. scientists help the awardees navigate the Congress and network effectively.<br/><br/>The Board on International Scientific Organizations, part of the International Networks and Cooperation theme within the NAS Policy and Global Affairs Division, is home to the U.S. National Committee for the International Union for Quaternary Research (USNC/INQUA).

The slow progress on addressing these challenges has led to increasing emphasis on the need to go beyond the study and encouragement of incremental change. Conventional knowledge and capacity building to tackle the challenges associated with sustainability have had limited positive impacts; consequently, there is growing need for more fundamental knowledge on how transformations in the way societies interact both with each other and with the natural environment.  Societal transformations refer to profound and enduring systemic changes that typically involve social, cultural, technological, political, economic and environmental processes. A comprehensive and concerted research initiative is needed that can boost research on transformations to sustainability and catalyze new kinds of solutions to environmental and social challenges. <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 19-country initiative through the Belmont Forum- NORFACE-ISSC.  Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that will contribute to re-structuring the broad field of sustainability research.  Co-production of knowledge and research problem formulation is considered to be critical to the process of societal transformation and each project engages stakeholders or community-based partners.  The initiative seeks to develop the fundamental knowledge societies require to help develop transformations to sustainability which are of significant social concern throughout the world and of great relevance to both academics and stakeholders.  The T2S program aims to build capacity, overcome fragmentation and have a lasting impact on both society and the research landscape by cultivating durable research collaboration across multiple borders, disciplinary boundaries, and with practitioners and societal partners. This includes facilitating the development of new research collaborations with parts of the world which are not often involved in large-scale international research efforts, notably low- and middle-income countries.  The funds provided in this award will be used to support U.S. participants to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., civil society, NGOs, and industry).  Participants from other countries are funded through their national funding organizations. <br/><br/>This project seeks to assess land use practices that reconcile forest conservation and food production, and how these practices are connected across scales through sustainable landscape governance.

Commercialization of the proposed dual-function detergent molecule eliminates the need for chemicals commonly used to maintain the function in hard water conditions. Reduction of the amount and number of chemicals needed in a detergent formulation will enable production of 25% more concentrated detergent products, reducing packaging costs and enabling easier formulation of single-dose tablets. The technology offsets the carbon footprint of detergent chemical production by using plant-based starting materials instead of the current petroleum-based products, which currently dominate the industry. Additionally, reduction in the amount of chemicals used in detergents reduces environmental impact to water resources and wildlife. <br/>	<br/>This SBIR Phase II proposes to further develop a bi-functional surfactant chemical for laundry detergent applications, including (1) identification of a best performing surfactant for commercialization, (2) development of a scaled synthesis process using a high-throughput automated reactor system, and (3) demonstration of the performance of the material in laundry detergent formulations and measure the cleaning performance of generated formulations. The technology will reduce the cost of laundry detergent formulations by eliminating the need for chelating agents, which are used to mitigate the negative effects of hard water common in cleaning applications. The bi-functional surfactant molecules take the role of both a surfactant and a chelating agent, thereby enabling more concentrated detergents, especially for formulators of plant-based, environmentally-friendly detergents. The technical objectives direct development of the new detergent molecules through iterative design and testing of detergent structures, resulting in identification of a first to market product, as well as reaction engineering and optimization to direct efficient design of the process technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Evidence extracted from ice has fundamentally recalibrated scientific conceptions of earth's deep history: the theory of the Ice Ages revealed the planet's radical changeability, and evidence from ice cores showed a globe that rapidly flickers between different meteorological states. Data for the project will come from documents gathered at national archives in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, and these will be complimented by analyses of published scientific papers and visual materials. Overall, this project traces our changing scientific conceptions of ice over the past two hundred years to highlight its importance for advancing scientific understanding of the planet as an interconnected system with a deep past and a deep future.<br/><br/>This is an investigation into the cryosphere - those portions of the Earth's surface that are covered in solid ice - and into the ways in which scientists have studied and conceptualized it over the past two hundred years. Analyses of ice have provided critical ecological data that has enabled scientists to appreciate the true depth of the Earth's history and to understand patterns of environmental change and systematic meteorological variability over time. Data for this multi-method project come from collections at several national archives and from historically relevant scientific papers and visual models. Systematic qualitative documentary analysis will be used to analyze these data and enhance our understanding of how research on the cryosphere has shaped our collective understanding of the environmental history and future of Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As it occurred during a time of dramatic climate change, it also represents an unparalleled laboratory to study the impact of environmental change on human groups, as well as the ecological role of people on species extinctions and ecosystem sustainability. In addition to its value for scientists, the peopling of North America figures prominently in the worldview of Native Americans and holds important implications for issues related to identity, cultural heritage, and territory rights. The project will take place in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in north-central Montana, at the southern end of the ice-free corridor between glaciers, from where the first Americans may have spread out from Alaska to the rest of the continent. Well-preserved archaeological sites of this period are extremely rare due to deglaciation processes that either destroyed or deeply buried evidence of early colonization. Because of this knowledge gap, it is difficult to ascertain the dispersal and land use dynamics of early settlers. This project will focus on the excavation of the Billy Big Spring Site that presents a unique, well-preserved stratigraphy containing archaeological occupations dated to the Late Glacial period ~13,000 years ago to shed light on some of these questions.<br/><br/>This project integrates archaeological research with Native American genetic data and oral history to explore the settlement of North America during the end of the last Ice Age. The Billy Big Spring Site constitutes a strong analytical case for addressing the timing and modes of inland colonization of the continent through the exploration of connections between early northern occupations from Alaska to Montana, and early human occupations in the region and beyond. Large-scale archaeological investigations at Billy Big Springs will provide a detailed view of landscape preferences of early North American peoples that likely informed land and resource use through time. The project will (1) survey and excavate an early archaeological located just south of the ice-free corridor to develop a predictive model of early colonization of the region; (2) integrate Native American oral history into archaeological research related to the peopling of North America; (3) train tribal members in the study and management of their cultural heritage; (4) translate scientific findings for Native American groups; and (5) develop school curricula for the benefit of Blackfoot, Alaskan, and other Native communities. The project is a collaboration between a public university and a Native American tribe, which will contribute to standards for ethical and community-based archaeology related to the early peopling of North America, providing an excellent opportunity to broaden participation from underrepresented groups in archaeology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout its five years, this project will fund 14 scholarships for two groups of seven students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or marine biology.   Small colleges often have excellent and thriving science programs that regularly graduate well-qualified students to enter graduate school or careers in a variety of STEM fields.  Private colleges with intimate class sizes and high-quality faculty and facilities require greater fees to maintain these features, putting them out of reach of many low-income students.  In addition, rigorous introductory STEM courses prepare students well for more specialized upper level courses and future careers but have relatively high attrition rates.  The WLC S-STEM Scholars (WSSS) Program will address these issues by providing scholarship aid and early research opportunities to help students navigate through introductory STEM courses.  Partnerships with local high schools, homeschool associations, and college-prep programs will provide excellent candidates from diverse backgrounds.  The WSSS Program hopes to adapt STEM education research performed at large research universities to a small liberal arts college.  The program will introduce students to STEM laboratory research early in their education and maintain this exposure throughout their undergraduate careers.  This will put concepts and practices from STEM courses into perspective, will increase one-on-one interactions with faculty and upperclassmen to establish better mentoring relationships, and will provide valuable experience for internship and career goals.  Increased mentorship will ensure that program scholars are aware of and take advantage of resources such as tutoring, workshops, and career preparation opportunities.  Finally, a STEM advisory council consisting of professionals from the burgeoning local STEM industry and graduate schools will help to prepare students for careers and opportunities after college.  The WSSS Program will give superior STEM students that may not be able to otherwise afford or succeed in college the opportunity to get a first-class education to prepare them to enter a well-paying career.<br/><br/>The WSSS Program will implement outreach and recruitment to low-income students including underrepresented populations in Milwaukee schools as well as homeschooled students.  The program will implement a summer STEM orientation to provide research experiences to incoming scholars, a first-year Introduction to STEM Research course, continuing research opportunities, enhanced mentoring, and career networking opportunities.  These activities build on and advance evidence in support of early research experience as a positive factor in STEM student success.  They also show how associated peer mentoring, research peer groups, strong student-faculty interactions, and research skill-building workshops work together to integrate diverse students into a college research and academic culture and promote retention through increased confidence in abilities and self-efficacy.  WLC will investigate these activities to examine their impact on enrollment and retention, graduation, and postgraduate placement rates.  The WSSS program will strengthen the science departments' relationship with the Office of Admissions, high schools, and homeschool networks through recruitment activities.  The program will also develop ties with industry through the creation of an industry-based STEM Advisory Council.  This will contribute to a stronger pipeline of diverse and underrepresented students from secondary education through undergraduate programming and into the regional STEM workforce.  The project team will also disseminate the results to other programs at WLC outside of the natural sciences and will generate evidence to assist other institutions in replicating program activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bringing a new drug to market typically involves screening 100's of thousands of compounds for efficacy and toxicity utilizing cell, tissue and animal models to ultimately select a lead compound that will be tested in clinical trials. This process can take years, billions of dollars, and in the worse case leads to compounds that fail during clinical trials due to safety concerns. Advances in microfluidics and 3D-printing have enabled the construction of tissue culture devices with nearly unlimited numbers of tissue chambers and flow channel complexity. Combined with optical sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, instrumentation can be built that maintain large numbers of biopsied tissue samples, while assessing the effects of exposure of the tissue to libraries of drugs. This technological platform provides resolution of drug effects on human tissue with high sensitivity thereby reducing the cost of animal testing and the risk of bringing toxic drugs to clinical trials and the market. In addition, the technology will impact the fields of personalized medicine, where drugs could be tested on an individual's own tumor or tissue, and environmental health.<br/><br/>Measuring in vitro cellular responses to pharmaceutical compounds is critical for identifying toxic effects of candidate drugs prior to costly in vivo animal and clinical testing. To address this need, instrumentation to maintain and assess biopsied tissue in real time is being developed. The technology utilizes microfluidics for optimal maintenance of tissue viability and function, and optoelectronics to measure oxygen uptake with unprecedented sensitivity. The fluidics are driven by gas pressure, circumventing the need for unwieldy pumps, and the channels are fabricated by 3D printing, allowing for nearly unlimited numbers of chambers and flow channel complexity. The technological platform will aid in the selection of lead compounds for clinical trials, estimation of doses for first-in-human tests, and support applications to the FDA. In this Phase 2 STTR proposal, the company will build two 96-channel turnkey instruments for a contract research program and for beta testing by pharmaceutical companies. The functionality of a low-capacity (16- channel) system has been previously demonstrated. The funding will support scaling up the throughput of the system as well as enabling additional modes of operation. The instrumentation will be used for contract research and for direct sales to the large market of drug discovery within the pharmaceutical industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the magnetic field is thought to be an essential factor ensuring long-term planetary habitability. Today, this geomagnetic field is powered by growth of the solid inner core. But thermal models suggest Earth has not always had a solid inner core; the time of the onset of inner core growth has ranged from 500 million to more than 2.5 billion years ago. This represents a fundamental unknown about the planet. Arguably the best way to investigate this question is to use ""paleomagnetism"", the record of the ancient magnetic field trapped in rocks and crystals as they form. Such data have motivated the hypothesis that the geomagnetic field, and the magnetic shielding of the atmosphere from solar particles, almost collapsed 565 million years ago, but then the field slowly recovered. This event may record the birth of the solid inner core. This hypothesis will be tested through studies of rocks ranging in age from 800 to 500 million years old found in Australia, Canada and the United States. The collaborative work will involve a team of 5 scientists at 3 institutions (including an underrepresented minority and woman scientist), and will be integrated into education and outreach efforts at each university, including efforts to expand opportunities for first-generation and historically underrepresented individuals. <br/><br/><br/>The time of Earth's inner core nucleation (ICN) is unknown and thus represents a first-order problem in our understanding of the planet. For decades the inner core was assumed to be billions of years old. However, viable core thermal conductivity values now span a factor of 3, with the highest values compatible with ICN onset between approximately 800 and 500 million years ago. These onset ages are predicted by many recent thermal evolution models, but a paucity of paleofield strength data has thwarted efforts seeking to determine if there is a sign of a young inner core. Recent paleomagnetic data record an unprecedented low in time-averaged geomagnetic field strength 565 million years ago that is greater than 10 times lower than the strength of the present geomagnetic field. The ultra-low field intensity is accompanied by an ultra-high reversal frequency and other indicators of unusual field behavior in 15 other Latest Precambrian-Cambrian igneous and sedimentary units. These observations and recent modeling results are the basis for the hypothesis that the geomagnetic field approached collapse in late Precambrian/early Cambrian times (i.e., the ratio of the magnetic energy to kinetic energy is less than 1) coincident with the onset of ICN. Hence, the inner core may be young. This hypothesis will be tested through the study of 4 igneous provinces emplaced between about 500 and 800 million years ago, in Australia, the US and the Northwest Territories (Canada). State-of-the-art paleomagnetic directional and paleointensity data, including single silicate crystal analyses, and U-Pb radiometric age data will allow a synoptic view of the geodynamo during the youngest predicted ages of ICN.

A reduction in cost of transporting people and goods would increase the profitability of nearly all products and services, since nearly all activities require transportation in some form. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are simpler implementations of semi-autonomous controls systems but are already saving lives by providing intelligent cruise control, lane departure warnings, steering assistance, and preemptive emergency braking. As ADAS improves through advanced sensor and scanning hardware and becomes more widely deployed, more accidents will be avoided, and lives saved. There are currently no LiDAR imaging sensors that can sense greater than 200 meters and are automotive qualified due to limitations on the scanning systems. The proposed innovation would be the first to enhance a scientific and technical understanding of the reliability issues limiting wide-scale sensor deployment and result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensors.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in an automotive-grade laser scanning system that enables next generation LiDAR, a three- dimensional imaging sensor crucial for the widespread adoption of autonomous delivery robots, drones, advanced driver safety systems in vehicles, and autonomous vehicles. Survey-grade LiDAR is a mature technology, but efforts to make it road worthy have failed due to the harsher shock and vibration requirements and deployed systems fail within two years and display image distortion under high-shock conditions. The proposed innovation will result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensor by developing fluid stabilized opto-mechanical scanners that utilize buoyant forces to counteract external accelerations. The novel scanner technology will be simulated, fabricated, and tested against ISO specifications for automotive qualification to demonstrate both accurate real time scanner stability and long-term reliable operation. It is expected that the results will be scanners able to pass ISO testing in a form compatible with high-volume, low-cost production methods. Through collaboration with customers, this work will result in a new class of vision systems that will bring a new level of efficiency and safety in transportation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The optimal convergence rates for estimation of discrete-continuous distributions will be derived in these settings.  Preliminary results suggest that smoothing is beneficial only for a subset of discrete variables with a quickly growing number of support points or sufficiently high level of smoothness.  The proposed estimation procedures are based on Bayesian mixtures of multivariate normal distributions with covariate dependent mixing weights.  The proposed methods will deliver practical and optimal adaptive nonparametric alternatives to standard econometric models such as ordered probit and Poisson regression, and first stage estimators in two stage estimation procedures for structural discrete choice models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the rapid development of optogenetics tools over the past decade, tethered optical devices pose significant limitations in experimental animals and even more so in potential clinical applications. This proposed research will address fundamental challenges in tethered optogenetics systems, by developing a distributed, wireless (untethered and battery-less), implantable optical stimulator architecture that is more power efficient, significantly safer, and more practical for translation to clinical applications. The successful completion of the project will yield a new neural interface tool to significantly expand the utility of the rapidly growing field of optogenetics, which has become the frontier in brain science research, gene therapy, and new drug discovery for a variety of neural diseases. In addition, the project will train graduate students in multidisciplinary research and broaden K-12 education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) through integrated outreach activities, including the NSF sponsored Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Program at Michigan State University.<br/><br/>The proposed wireless optogenetics stimulator will integrate a mm-sized, Parylene-coated system-on-a-chip (SoC) with an embedded receiver coil, surface-mount storage capacitors, and microscale light-emitting diodes (microLEDs) to selectively stimulate the target neural tissue. Researchers will tackle inefficiencies in wireless power delivery to the neural tissue using: 1) a four-coil telemetry link including an implantable high quality factor resonator to enhance wireless power coupling efficiency; 2) a built-in mirror to reflect backside illumination of microLED for improving light throughput; and 3) a switched-capacitor stimulation (SCS) structure of the SoC to directly charge an array of storage capacitors from the inductive link and periodically discharge them into a microLED without loading the inductive link. A single wireless stimulator enables localized optical stimulation of targeted neurons with high spatiotemporal resolution, while a cluster of such implants enables easy access to large-scale neuronal circuits with minimal invasiveness and movement restriction. The proposed device also enables a significantly safer and more practical solution for potential translation of optogenetics into behaving animal research and clinical applications. Removing the chronic physical trauma of tethering can effectively minimize tissue damage and enable efficient and stable chronic wireless optical stimulation. Moreover, the distributed, epidural implantation strategy permits selective stimulation of any desired area in the cortex. This new paradigm will offer neuroscience community an unprecedented level of flexibility with unlimited experiment duration in an enriched, untethered environment, without requiring small animal subjects to carry bulky batteries around.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from four other nations with Arctic territories, seeks to evaluate freshwater biodiversity and food web dynamics in the circumpolar Arctic region and their value for people, communities, and the region. For this project, each country provides funds to support their own investigators and their part of the research. This project characterizes the current state of biodiversity along latitudinal gradients (north to south) in the Arctic and uses experiments and computer models to develop change scenarios in response to climate warming because Arctic warming can cause various physical environmental changes, such as permafrost thaw, which can result in changes in water quality, water temperature, food webs, and fish distributions. Shifts in food resources that might result could have large impacts on far north human populations (e.g., subsistence activities, commercial and recreational fisheries, etc.).  Through field studies, experiments, modeling, and forecasting, this project develops linkages between climate change, freshwater biodiversity, and consequences for ecosystem services in Arctic freshwaters, all of which have potential socio-economic impacts. Although a large body of literature exists on Arctic freshwater fishery economics, interactions between habitat conditions and the socio-economic consequences of human- and climate-induced changes in the productivity of Arctic lakes and rivers are poorly known. This study fills that gap. Broader impacts of the research include international collaboration between scientists in the US and Denmark/Greenland, Norway, Sweden, and Canada. They also include identifying shifts in biodiversity to assist countries in recognizing early warning signs of climate change-related ecological impacts in the Arctic; assessing economic implications for changes in Arctic biodiversity, something critical to managing regional resources and/or developing science-based policies and regulations; enabling circumpolar harmonization of sampling methods, data storage, and large-scale analysis to promote future circumpolar assessments of biodiversity change; and improving our knowledge and understanding of Arctic food security for native peoples and others in the region who depend on freshwater fisheries. The project also supports a PI from a gender underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska), thereby broadening participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project will address knowledge gaps on the links between biodiversity and ecosystem services in Arctic lakes and rivers. The approach undertaken includes using physical/chemical climate change models to develop biodiversity change scenarios which incorporate multiple trophic levels and predict consequences of biodiversity scenarios to ecosystem services. Specific research objectives include: (1) evaluation of biodiversity and functional trait patterns in relation to environmental drivers and identify biodiversity hotspots in freshwater ecosystems (lakes and rivers) across latitudinal gradients in the Arctic; (2) insight into how direct and indirect drivers related to climate change impact the biodiversity and trait composition of Arctic aquatic food webs, and ultimately fish production; (3) quantifying uncertainty in biodiversity scenarios for Arctic freshwaters through empirical observations and experimental simulations; and (4) assessing the effects of nutrient enrichment and terrestrial land change on community structural and functional measures across latitudinal gradients in North America and Europe. Other approaches include use of bio-economic models to evaluate socio-economic trade-offs and potential shifts in ecosystem services in Arctic lakes and rivers associated with climate change, nutrient enrichment, and resource exploitation; developing assessment criteria that better quantify the ecological change in Arctic lakes and streams and provide strategies for the early detection of new and/or invasive species and that can feed into the development of biodiversity scenarios; and providing information and research results that better inform resource managers, regulators, and policy makers, as well as people who live in the Arctic and the global community concerned about the ongoing change in Arctic freshwater ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One phenomenon that likely drove or at least stabilized the transition to a more oxidizing state was collapse of methanogens, a dominant form of life throughout much of the Archean Eon that sustained global anoxia through production of abundant methane. The objective of this project is to test the recent hypothesis of Konhauser et al. (2009; Nature 458, 750), who attributed the decline of methanogens to a shortage of nickel, an essential trace nutrient for these organisms. These authors argued that biogenic methane production might have waned well before the rise of oxygen, because oceanic Ni concentrations decreased substantially between 2.7 and 2.5 Ga. <br/><br/>The recent discovery that modern methanogens strongly fractionate stable isotopes of Ni suggests that Ni limitation of methanogens may have left an isotopic fingerprint in the sedimentary record. The aim of this study is to analyze Ni isotope compositions of the same samples in which Konhauser et al. documented the Ni concentration decline, to see if an isotopic shift reflecting the onset of Ni limitation of methanogens is evident. Samples will be extracted from the hematite-rich layers of banded iron formations by microdrill, and isotopic compositions will be measured by MC-ICP-MS. Investigator will focus in particular on relationships between Ni concentrations and Ni isotopes for samples with ages between 2.8 and 2.3 billion years, the interval over which methanogens may or may not have assimilated increasingly large proportions of available dissolved Ni in seawater."

The slow progress on addressing these challenges has led to increasing emphasis on the need to go beyond the study and encouragement of incremental change. Conventional knowledge and capacity building to tackle the challenges associated with sustainability have had limited positive impacts; consequently, there is growing need for more fundamental knowledge on how transformations in the way societies interact both with each other and with the natural environment.  Societal transformations refer to profound and enduring systemic changes that typically involve social, cultural, technological, political, economic and environmental processes. A comprehensive and concerted research initiative is needed that can boost research on transformations to sustainability and catalyze new kinds of solutions to environmental and social challenges. <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 19-country initiative through the Belmont Forum- NORFACE-ISSC.  Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that will contribute to re-structuring the broad field of sustainability research.  Co-production of knowledge and research problem formulation is considered to be critical to the process of societal transformation and each project engages stakeholders or community-based partners.  The initiative seeks to develop the fundamental knowledge societies require to help develop transformations to sustainability which are of significant social concern throughout the world and of great relevance to both academics and stakeholders.  The T2S program aims to build capacity, overcome fragmentation and have a lasting impact on both society and the research landscape by cultivating durable research collaboration across multiple borders, disciplinary boundaries, and with practitioners and societal partners. This includes facilitating the development of new research collaborations with parts of the world which are not often involved in large-scale international research efforts, notably low- and middle-income countries.  The funds provided in this award will be used to support U.S. participants to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., civil society, NGOs, and industry).  Participants from other countries are funded through their national funding organizations. <br/><br/>This project seeks to assess land use practices that reconcile forest conservation and food production, and how these practices are connected across scales through sustainable landscape governance.  The Amazon basin is a global keystone region: locally, continentally and globally it hosts a wide array of environmental services, socio-cultural diversity, and economic activities.  Governing these multiple dimensions amid pressing social-environmental, and global environmental change is one of the most pressing challenges for sustainability.

In Southern California these include the well-known, and well-studied, Santa Ana winds.  In Central and Northern California there is another kind of downslope windstorm which has been termed the ""Diablo"" winds.  The Diablo winds have aided numerous wildfires including the recent 2017 Wine Country fires that resulted in 44 deaths and billions of dollars of damage.  Despite the grave impact of Diablo winds, there has been a relative lack of detailed research on the causes and climatology of these events.  This award will allow for a detailed characterization of Diablo wind events, an assessment of weather model skill in predicting the events, and an assessment of the projected trend of Diablo wind events in future years.  The main societal impact of the work will be to give operational weather forecasters more confidence in their ability to forecast these events, which may allow more preventative fire measures to take place.  The lead researcher is very experienced with outreach and will continue activities to better inform the public of the relevance of scientific research.  In addition, the project will help to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This study will investigate the structure, evolution, and underlying physical mechanisms of Diablo winds, which are strong, dry offshore-directed winds occurring over central and northern California.  The project will involve both analysis and modeling approaches.  The range of deliverables to be expected include: 1) a comprehensive description of the Diablo wind phenomenon, including its structure, evolution, dynamics and control by the synoptic scale flow, 2) a detailed climatology of Diablo winds, including their frequency, duration, annual modulation, and long-term trends over the past 70 years, 3) an evaluation of future trends in Diablo wind frequency, structure, and amplitude based on dynamically downscaled high-resolution models, driven by GCMs, and GCMs driving statistical models of Diablo wind occurrence, and 4) an evaluation of the forecast skill of operational weather forecast model guidance now currently available, and the appraisal of deficiencies in current modeling systems with respect to the Diablo wind phenomenon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Precise electrical stimulation that generates targeted smooth<br/>muscle structure contractions make them immediately visible to the surgeon without needing<br/>to perform complex and risky dissections, and eliminates the need for costly (and invasive)<br/>products such as ureteral stents to keep patients safe. Smooth muscle stimulation during<br/>surgery will change how we operate both today, and in the future.

The research was motivated because coral reefs are the most diverse hotspots of marine life on Earth upon which whose health and resilience the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people, worldwide, depend. Because reefs are impacted directly and indirectly by the activity of humans (climate change, erosion, invasive species transport, over harvesting) a holistic model of these interconnected systems are needed to secure long-term human development and well-being, as well as preserve marine biodiversity and critical natural capital. This research focuses on coral reef fish because they are a main link between reef ecosystems and human societies due to the role they play in securing food for humans, recreation, etc. This research employs a focused, transdisciplinary modelling approach that involves the development and application of scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services for coral reefs around the globe and across spatial scales that are relevant to multiple types of ecosystem/conservation management decisions. The work will couple socio-economic dynamics with biodiversity considerations to examine the impacts of various drivers and impacts of environmental change on reef systems, specifically the impact on fish. Projections of the impacts and expected changes in ecosystem services due to different environmental drivers and combinations of drivers will be made out to the year 2100. Broader impacts of the work include the collaboration of US scientists with world leaders in coral reef ecology from eight other countries (The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, UK, Australia, Canada, France, and Switzerland), with each country funding its own scientists and parts of the project. There will also be significant outreach to stakeholder groups, including conservationists and policy makers, and the public via a range of print and multimedia outlets (newsletter, films, the Internet, and public access to research data and modeling software). To reach a broad audience, some of the materials will be generated in multiple languages. To disseminate results to other scientists and key stakeholders and to generate additional discussion on the topic, a series of summer schools will be developed and a final symposium with an international participant list will be held. Additional impacts include the support of a researcher from a group underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (Hawaii) which helps to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences and the training of a postdoctoral scholar in transdisciplinary, international, team-based research. <br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"".

Data analysis will include biomass estimates tied to human livelihoods, nutrient cycling that affects fish stock productivity, regulation of the carbon cycle that affects CO2 concentrations, fish nutritional value and food security, and the cultural value of coral reef systems that sustains human wellbeing and tourism activities. It will also determine the governance, social, economic, and environmental conditions under which coral reef ecosystem services are currently maintained or threatened by. This will include multivariate and non-linear model analysis of a global database of fish surveys from over 5,000 coral reefs encompassing gradients of environments, habitats, and impact of fishing. Research goals will be to predict the potential futures of shallow coral reef ecosystems and their services under various global change scenarios and their ability to deliver services up to the year 2100.

Most of the water will return to the surface of Earth through volcanism when the minerals hosting the water break down (dehydration) because of the high pressure and temperature encountered as they descend deeper. Trace amounts of water stored in so called anhydrous minerals may be preserved in the descending plate (subducting slab) to greater depths and get involved in whole mantle convection. This process is called Earth's deep-water cycle, which controls the water flux in Earth's interior. After decades of seismic observations, numerical simulations, and petrological/mineralogical experiments, it is generally agreed that slab dehydration takes place at a few hundred kilometers depth below the seafloor. However, a fundamental question remains unsolved: How deep can major hydrous minerals be subducted? Hydrous minerals presumably can be preserved to greater depths in a colder slab because dehydration reactions are controlled by temperature and pressure. The Tonga slab, which is the Pacific Plate that descends along the Tonga Trench, is believed to the fastest moving and coldest slab on Earth. Therefore, imaging hydrous minerals and determining their maximum depths in the Tonga slab, as an extreme case study, are critical to understanding the water flux in subduction zones and estimating Earth's water budget. This project will provide research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this study, the Tonga slab crust and uppermost mantle will be imaged by analyzing converted and guided seismic waves from local earthquakes because these waves are most sensitive to slab interface and internal structure. The data were collected from a local broadband seismic array deployed in 2009-2010 in the Tonga-Lau-Fiji region, and provide unprecedented constraints on local seismicity and mantle structure of this subduction zone. The Tonga slab surface (upper interface) position and relative locations of intermediate-depth earthquakes at depths of 50-200 km will be refined. The high-resolution seismic structure of the Tonga slab interior at depths of 50-300 km will be constrained by PS and guided P waves, providing insights into the distribution of the subducted hydrous minerals in this coldest slab. The results will help to test the hypothesis that the Tonga slab, along with other similarly cold slabs in the history of Earth, can carry hydrous minerals to depths greater than 250 km, or even to the mantle transition zone. Verifying this hypothesis will have important impacts on our understanding of the Earth's deep-water cycle because direct evidence of a significant amount of water being subducted into the mantle transition zone is still lacking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrothermal venting releases metals into the water column. These metals are of some economic interest as a natural resource, and they can impact the biosphere, including affecting faunal composition and microbial processes that dominate in the region. Additionally, hydrothermal metals settle onto the seafloor along with other sediments.  Marine sediments provide a window into the past as they accumulate, with each layer containing information about oceanographic condition at the time of their deposition. However, the amount and composition of trace metals in the sediment can change as hydrothermal fluids circulate through the sediment and oceanic crust, thereby impacting this geologic record. The goal of this project is to collect samples during a sea-going expedition on the research vessel R/V Polarstern and identify the impact of hydrothermal fluids on the sedimentary environment. The results will advance our knowledge on how hydrothermal vents impact the geochemical signals in sediment deposit and with that their application to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions. The project supports the training of a graduate student.<br/><br/>During the last few years several expeditions in the Southern Ocean have focused on reconstructing paleoceanographic conditions in this climate-sensitive region of the planet. In this previous work, variations in redox-sensitive element distributions in the sediment were proposed as a valuable tool for unravelling changes in productivity and redox conditions in the water column over time. However, the potential effect of metal-rich sediment on this paleoceanographic record has remained unstudied. The goal of this project is to decipher the potential impact of hydrothermal systems in the Antarctic region onto the sedimentary trace metal signatures frequently applied for paleo redox reconstructions. For this purpose we will join an international expedition on the R/V Polarstern (P119). Hydrothermal deposits and sediments will be recovered using ROV-guided push cores and piston cores. The sedimentary signal will be compared with the trace metal signal in the hydrothermal fluids from two vent sites and background pelagic opal-rich sediment typical for this area. For this purpose, sulfur, iron and manganese phases and selected trace metals will be analyzed in the solid phase and pore waters. Samples will be analyzed for selected constituents onboard the ship. All other analyses will be carried out at home institutes and samples will be prepared and stored accordingly. The data will enhance our understanding of the alteration of primary proxy-signals and the potential impact of hydrothermal fluids on these proxies and could thus be crucial for its application as redox proxy for sites in vicinity to hydrothermal input. Additionally, the results will complement parallel planned research at this location aimed at understanding the role of hydrothermal vents on faunal composition and microbial processes in these extreme environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magmas that feed the volcanos are produced by partial melting in the interior of the Earth. Oceanic basalts, which are sampled at oceanic islands and along mid-ocean ridges on the seafloor, provide important clues to understanding the composition of the inaccessible Earth and the processes and time scales of magma generation and transport in the mantle.  A fundamental observation in geochemistry is that the source regions of oceanic basalts in the mantle are heterogeneous and consist of chemically and lithologically distinct domains of variable size and distribution.  Partial melting of such heterogeneous mantle sources gives rise to a diverse range of basaltic magmas erupted on the surface. The size and distribution of mantle heterogeneities are unknown, but may have played an important role in controlling chemical variations observed in basalts.  One of the long-standing problems of geochemistry is the mapping of heterogeneities observed in basalts into the chemical and lithological heterogeneities in the mantle source.  Such a mapping is nonlinear and its mathematical expression is unknown.  The thesis of this project is to investigate how the size and distribution of mantle heterogeneities affect the isotope ratios and trace element abundances in oceanic basalts.  Results from this project will enable geochemists to establish the nonlinear mapping between basalts and their mantle sources. The project would advance STEM education by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students and by developing of a competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate students and postdoc scholar.  <br/><br/>The primary objectives of this proposed study are (1) to find the functional forms for the nonlinear mapping between basalts and their mantle sources; (2) to develop a framework for understanding and interpreting variations in isotope ratios and trace element abundances in spatially and temporally associated oceanic basalts; and (3) to test the new models through selected case studies where temporal or spatial geochemical data are available.  To establish the nonlinear mapping, one needs to know the nature of heterogeneity (chemical vs. lithological, size and distribution), the style of melting (batch vs. fractional), the process of melt migration (channelized vs. grain-scale porous flow), and the extent of chemical disequilibrium between residual minerals and the percolating melt.  Time and spatial variables will be added to the widely used melting models in the geochemical literature.  These time-dependent melting models will enable geochemists to systematically study the roles of the size and distribution of heterogeneities in the mantle source in controlling the variations of isotope ratios and incompatible trace element abundances in extracted melts.  Two-dimensional models will be constructed using the one-dimensional time-dependent melting models.  These physically more realistic models will be used to examine variations of Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotope and selected incompatible trace element ratios in mid-ocean ridge basalts and ocean island basalts.  An important outcome of the proposed work is a set of new interpretation tools to petrologists and geochemists in their studies of spatially and temporally correlated mantle and mantle-derived samples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how much and how fast they will melt in the future is a pressing question for public health, coastal infrastructure, and economic stability. This research project will investigate how susceptible major ice sheets are to modest amounts of warming. This project will address this question by reconstructing sea level during the most recent time in Earth's history when global mean temperatures were slightly warmer (+1-2 degrees C) than pre-industrial values due to natural and periodic variations in the Earth's orbit. This time period, the last interglacial, occurred approximately 125,000 years ago. Controversy exists around how much higher global sea level was and whether abrupt sea level rise (ice sheet collapse) occurred at the end of this prolonged warm period. Both the magnitude and rate of sea level change during this time are important for improving predictions of sea level rise over the next century. Sea level will be reconstructed over the last interglacial from the geologic record of the Bahamas. Measurements of the current elevations of last interglacial marine sediments and fossil corals will be combined with models of ancient ice sheets and sea level change to infer the response and evolution of sea level during this critical past warm period. The work will improve the fidelity of predictions for future sea-level change and will support a new investigator in the field of sea-level studies<br/> <br/>To improve our understanding of future sea level rise we can turn to periods in the geologic past that recorded the response of polar ice sheets to prolonged warming. The Last Interglacial (LIG, ~ 128 - 116 ka) is a prime target for this approach as temperatures were slightly elevated relative to today. Reconstructions of global mean sea level and ice loss during this period indicate that global mean sea level was higher during this time period, however, the exact magnitude and timing of ice melt is still debated. A major obstacle in improving these reconstructions is currently a limited understanding of how much the solid Earth has moved up or down since the LIG, hence how much local reconstructed sea level deviates from the past global mean. This component is generally corrected for using model predictions, however, models are uncertain due to an incomplete knowledge of Earth's internal structure and past ice sheet evolution. This project aims to advance the debate about the magnitude and timing of ice melt during the LIG by combining sea level observations from the Bahamas with models of solid Earth deformation. The sediments deposited across the Bahamian archipelago are excellent archives of past sea level and are ideal to improve models of solid Earth deformation due to their spatial extent and unique location close to the former ice sheet, which allows them to experience and capture gradients in solid Earth deformation. The project will produce high-precision 3D reconstructions of outcrops over three field seasons in the Bahamas to obtain unprecedented elevation constraints and ages on LIG stratigraphic data. We will generate model predictions of solid Earth deformation - glacial isostatic adjustment and dynamic topography, and constrain them with existing observations from the Holocene and Neogene, respectively. Combining the field observations with predictive models will allow us to produce uncertainty ranges for excess polar ice melt and ice evolution over the LIG as well as constrain Earth properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New theoretical paths will provide the foundation for training future generations of ecologists and our workforce, ensuring they have the requisite skills to tackle emerging problems. Theory directly and indirectly resulting from the workshop will accelerate the advancement of a discipline that lies at the heart of global problems such as food security, public health, environmental change, and resource limitation. <br/><br/>Workshop activities and discussions will identify key areas in ecology that need reinvigorated theory; establish the approaches needed to advance these theories; identify emergent areas in need of new theory; and develop an agenda for advancing ecological theory. Initial workshop discussions tackle topics including theory that spans levels of ecological organization; theory of uncertainty, ecological variation, and the limits of prediction; and the role of transients and non-stationarity. Discussions in large and small groups will debate and determine the theoretical approaches needed to advance these and other critical contemporary ecological questions. Groups will determine when entirely new theory is needed and when hybridization of existing approaches may address a challenge.

Conventional respiratory monitoring systems in a clinical setting require patients to wear devices, such as elastic bands around the chest or use invasive masks or tubes connected to the face, which cause patient discomfort and are ill-suited for long-term monitoring. Existing remote sensing techniques are not accurate enough due to the indirect nature of inferring breathing behaviors through chest movements or utilizing correlation functions. This project's system aims for both patient comfort and accurate and comprehensive analysis of patient breathing behaviors. It employs a specifically designed IR imaging camera and a novel software system to directly capture and visualize the human exhale carbon dioxide (CO2) activities in front of the face. This remote sensing helps promote patient comfort for a long-term measurement and it extracts clinically valuable information in a non-invasive way. Since it measures the breathing activities directly from the turbulent exhale behavior, it is accurate and comprehensive enough to obtain breathing rate, speed, strength, tidal volume, and nose/mouth distribution which could be crucial for the diagnosis of obstructive breathing, sleep apnea, and various pulmonary diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader significance of eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors and consumers.

The concept is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging.

This challenge is further exacerbated by periods of economic prosperity due to an increase in energy consumption. With the power generation sector being the biggest consumer of primary energy and one of the largest contributors to greenhouse and air pollutant emissions worldwide, an accelerated deployment of renewable energy is needed. However, due to renewables' intermittency as an energy source, there is a need for solutions that provide a flexible and reliable supply at a competitive efficiency while also aligning with global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Today, this challenge is partially met with addition of distributed natural gas fired capacity, motivating natural gas usage to nearly double in the last two decades. This project will focus on a solution to provide flexible and benchmark efficient power while generating zero atmospheric emissions. This not only supports environmental efforts, but also aligns with basic economics, making it an appealing case for carbon capture where both the consumer and producer benefit. <br/><br/>This I-Corp project will explore the commercial potential of a novel power solution based on the increasingly common reciprocating engine, by which its efficiency is radically increased and both air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated. Current solutions with traditional gas turbines and reciprocating engines fail to address air quality concerns by emitting high volumes of particulate matter and nitrous oxides. Efficiency benchmark technologies such as combined cycle gas turbines are unable to follow power demand fluctuations, nor are they able to cost effectively reduce their carbon footprint through carbon capture measures. This project will potentially address the unmet need for simultaneously flexible, efficient and clean power by proposing a retrofit technology that provides a transition into a utility scale hydrogen energy storage solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There will be a summer school June 3-7 with several lecture series to provide background material for early career participants in the conference. The overall goal of the conference is to study interactions between the two areas of mathematics in the title. <br/><br/>""Topology"" is the study of shapes that are allowed to stretch and bend. For example, a triangle and circle are considered to be topologically equivalent because one can be stretched into the other, and similarly a cube and sphere are considered topologically equivalent. ""Low dimensional topology"" studies shapes or objects in dimensions 2, 3, and 4, such as surfaces, or knotted loops in 3-dimensional space. This can be useful in other sciences; for example, DNA can be knotted, or the shape of the universe could have a nontrivial topology. ""Representation theory"" is the study of symmetries in mathematics, and at a concrete level, these symmetries often manifest themselves as solutions to systems of equations where the variables represent matrices instead of numbers. This mathematical area has also had applications in other sciences, such as symmetries of elementary particles in physics, or symmetries of molecules in<br/>chemistry. There are sophisticated mathematical techniques for taking certain spaces of solutions to polynomial equations and producing solutions to matrix equations, and recently low dimensional topology has been used to find solutions to the same equations, using completely different mathematical constructions. One of the goals of the conference is to understand this new phenomenon using ideas coming from mathematical physics. This award will fund participation of early career US scientists in this summer school and conference so they can learn about these exciting new ideas.More details about the conference are available at https://www.icms.org.uk/geometricrepresentation.php.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several recent high-profile traffic incidents involving semi-autonomous vehicles have raised questions about whether current artificial intelligence (AI)-centered methods can ever lead us to Level 4 or 5 autonomy, i.e., to the realization of fully-autonomous vehicles with performance equivalent to a human driver in all driving scenarios. On the other hand, approaches rooted in formal methods for verification and synthesis can provide safety guarantees but have difficulty in efficiently reasoning about uncertainty and the correctness of data-driven models. This project will combine these two, seemingly incompatible, paradigms for designing autonomous systems. It will use model-free reinforcement learning algorithms to learn from semi-autonomous vehicle driving data. It will adopt model-based methods for system design, verification, and synthesis to offer provably safe operation in highly uncertain scenarios. An AutoDrive testbed will be set up where human driving data from scaled vehicular models will be leveraged to infer safe control policies using imitation and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms. The research is relevant to the science of intelligent autonomous transportation systems with significant societal implications. The experimental testbed will be used to provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate students and for K-12 outreach efforts.<br/><br/>In particular, the project will develop a framework for optimal control synthesis for safety and performance specification expressed in signal temporal logic. It will then incorporate vehicular and pedestrian kinematics in non-deterministic/probabilistic  transition models specified via probabilistic computation tree logic. Finally, it will develop formal reinforcement learning methods for partially observed dynamic models subject to safety specifications and complex temporal goals by learning from traces of safe human drivers. One key technical contribution of the project will be development of new formal reinforcement learning methods that may be useful in a broad array of applications wherein we must synthesize optimal controllers that satisfy certain safety specifications by learning from data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed product is a new continuous authentication system by noncontact sensing cardiac waveform based on a smart radar technology. Compared with existing authentication systems, this technology improves the convenience and safeguard of many systems and facilities. This project could benefit many institutions or personnel that seek for a higher-level protection to prevent cyber attacks. Besides the benefits to a more secure world, the radar-based motion sensing technology to be investigated in this project could benefit other disciplines such as health/elderly care (examples include sleep monitoring and fall detection), disaster search and rescue (examples include finding victims buried under earthquake debris and tracking rescuers), and smart living applications (one example is remote gesture control of appliances). <br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to bring authentication solutions to a more secure and convenient level. Cardiac password, based on the human heart cardiac motion waveform, will work as a new noncontact biometric to authenticate users into computers and facilities.

For example, a significant percentage of pre-term babies are unable to produce lung surfactant. This biological material, which contains lipid and specialized proteins, significantly increases the ability of the lung to expand and contract.  It also enhances the transfer of oxygen to blood.  Insufficient levels of lung surfactant results in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), a condition that is fatal in a significant number of cases.  The current standard of care is a purified extract obtained from pig lung.  The purification process used to obtain this product is demanding, resulting in a final product that varies significantly in protein and lipid content.  For this reason, there is significant interest in the development of novel synthetic lung surfactants.  However, chemically-designed lung surfactants that have been developed to date are no longer used because of low biological potency.  In addition to its therapeutic utility, a potent, concentrated lung surfactant may also be useful in treating babies with less severe forms of this disease and may be useful in the treatment of adult diseases such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is to commercialize a scalable, fully active synthetic lung surfactant for use in the treatment of neonatal and adult respiratory disorders.  The approach is unique since computational models of lung surfactants are being used to identify key structural features that are required for biological activity and manufacturability.  The project's hypothesis is that this synthetic lung surfactant can be successfully commercialized at reasonable cost.  In addition, we hypothesize that the knowledge gained can be leveraged to develop other biotherapeutics requring interaction between bioactive proteins and lipid.  We will use the lean startup method to perform customer interviews that assess the commercial viability of a novel synthetic lung surfactant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to these significant environmental and human physiological factors, environmental sustainability research has been actively conducted for several decades in many academic fields, including engineering, computer science, medicine, and the physical sciences, using buildings as a major research framework. However, despite the role of architecture and architectural design in a building's sustainability profile, most building performance-related research has relied heavily on system and computational process-centered approaches that do not integrate qualitative human and design research parameters. In addition, many Architectural programs in the U.S., where minorities (i.e., females) account for over 40% of the faculty and student populations, have had a cultural preconception of ""no-research-needed"" in professional schools and develop their curricula with little consideration of the merits of fundamental or applied research. Such a skewed intellectual atmosphere may isolate architectural scholars from ""major"" research initiatives, and limits the advancement of architectural research and the development of essential research infrastructure in architecture schools across the U.S. This lack of research advancement delays an architectural faculty's research career pathway and forecloses educational opportunities in architectural research among their students. To address these challenges, a national workshop will be held to engage Architectural researchers who are pursuing (or are interested in) Architecture/building-related environmental sustainability research. <br/><br/>This workshop will 1) provide a networking opportunity that helps Architectural faculty have in-depth discussions on how to promote an architectural research framework, with specific research parameters, across the disciplines in Architecture; 2) identify the challenges and drawbacks that affect a faculty's research career success in Architecture and that also create a limited involvement of Architectural students in an art/design-integrated STEM research activity; and 3) explore potential cutting-edge Architectural research paradigms and topics in the environmental sustainability research field. The technical discussion and program of the workshop are designed to impact numerous Architectural research fields associated with environmental sustainability by 1) providing mentorship- based networking opportunities for Architecture faculty, who represent a diversity of underrepresented groups, compared to STEM domains, especially for early career individuals and PhD-ready students; 2) discussing how to develop a research platform where affiliated students have an opportunity to become involved in emerging research; 3) establishing emerging research key parameters to be integrated with other disciplines, as an innovative environmental sustainability research paradigm; and 4) enhance the research opportunity of Architectural schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is important due to the estimated 2.4 million unfilled jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) in the United States, to provide higher-paying STEM jobs to citizens, and promote a scientifically literate citizenry. Recent research supports new approaches for how to improve this scientific literacy, and states across the country are adopting new science standards to support this effort. The outcome of this project will support development of students' scientific literacy with a novel approach which utilizes cooperative, interdisciplinary, problem-based learning within a video game. Commercialization of this product will transform the process of inquiry-based learning by putting the tools in the hands of student scientists as they test their own solutions. The project supports the NSF's mission by empowering students to develop strong science and engineering skills, as well as supporting development of 21st century skills such as collaboration and problem solving that are desired by employers. <br/><br/><br/>The technology developed by this Phase II project will produce a group problem-solving experience for up to five students to analyze a problem and implement an engineering solution within a live simulated environment, providing educators with a powerful curricula tool to engage their students in the real problem-solving cycles a scientist would engage in, within a feasible setting using the video game. The research goals include creating a flexible content authoring tool that designers and educators can use to generate their own unique scenarios and creating an easy-to-use educator dashboard to accompany it. The content authoring and customization options empower educators to reflect local context, student interest, and student background knowledge, strategies which are essential for educators of diverse populations currently underrepresented within STEM. The technology and its dashboard will also serve as a powerful formative assessment tool, enabling group assessment that is able to parse group and individual participation, and is designed to promote balanced group problem solving. The result of this research will create a uniquely flexible tool that will enable educators to engage learners in deeper, contextual learning, encourage transfer of information, cooperative learning, development of science and engineering skills such as data literacy, and be utilized for assessment of these skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process undergoes important development during early childhood, and is shaped by family socioeconomic status (SES). WM, in turn, shapes children's progress in school, and has been shown to mediate the association between SES and academic achievement. Traditional laboratory assessments may fail to capture the complexity of WM behavior and conditions under which WM operates most optimally; thereby, limiting opportunity for evidence-based recommendations for education. In order to address this gap in the literature, the research team will measure the impact of SES on WM development in children 3.5 to 6 years old using parallel computerized and naturalistic play-based settings. <br/><br/>The researchers will use a rule-based WM task, where children are instructed to match a door to a house (or a beak to a bird) based on either one (e.g, color) or two (e.g. shape and color) visual feature dimensions. In daily life, WM does not function in isolation, but is paired with motivation to succeed.  Thus, in order to increase the ecological and construct validity of WM assessment in both computerized and play-based testing settings, researchers included three conditions designed to assess how engaging motivational mechanisms impacts WM performance. The Choice condition is identical to the Standard condition, but children choose the houses that they want to play with; the Reward condition is identical to the Standard except the children earn a sticker after correct trials. The Reward+Choice condition combines the Reward and Choice manipulations. A central component of the study involves determining whether the impact of SES on WM is constant across computerized and play-based settings, or whether the impact diminishes as WM tasks increase in ecological and construct validity.  To address this issue, the researchers will collect data on experiences in children's lives that may mirror the computerized and play-based testing environments. SES impact on WM performance in computerized and standard assessments may be mediated by formal instruction opportunities in and outside the home (art or music classes) as well as digital device use and skill. The researchers will also collect data on experiences in children's lives that may support WM development but be independent of SES. For example, individual differences in pretend play engagement may be related to WM performance in play-based settings, independent of SES. These predictions will be tested using structural equation modeling. Findings will provide novel insights regarding optimal WM performance in young children across various levels of SES. Findings will also have implications for shaping early childhood curricula in ways that will benefit children across various levels of SES.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The occurrence of extreme weather fluctuations and natural disasters have the potential to permanently disrupt modern society and agricultural practices by increasing soil erosion and decreasing usable land, soil fertility, and resistance to pests and disease. Growing populations will place more demand on agricultural production despite constrained amounts of available land. Technologies that assist with better nutrient management, planting, and harvesting techniques will aid in sustainable food production. Additionally, the need for better soil characterization and monitoring techniques are required in light of prominent failures of mine tailings dams. The safety of mining and large earth construction operations may be improved with the adoption of real-time, remote measurements of geomaterials. Lastly, more frequent and intense wildfires have led to more post-wildfire debris flows.  Dangers associated with the debris flow potential must be identified and characterized.  The optical, non-contact remote measurement technology that will be explored in this project has the potential to impact society as well as several markets and industries, ranging from precision agriculture to mining, hazard mitigation, and construction.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the applications of optical infrared technology.  The specific technology that will be explored was developed at the bench and field scale to remotely measure soil properties. The proposed innovation will advance agricultural and geotechnical engineering practices by enabling remote measurements of soil/crop condition and fertility, as well as static and dynamic soil parameters. Prior to the development of this technology, no method existed to remotely measure soil suction in the field. Because the measurements do not require contact with the soil, nor the collection of soil or water samples, the measurements are non-destructive. Furthermore, the rapidly collected measurements obtained will include many data points over a large area, improving spatial and temporal resolution over conventional point-wise data collection methods. The need to install labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive in situ instrumentation is then eliminated. The proposed technology also has the potential to save time and costs associated with conventional laboratory classification of soil properties and may also improve upon the poor reproducibility of some conventional testing methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Structure preserving discretizations are computational paradigms to solve physical models arising in several scientific and engineering fields such as computational fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and cosmology.  This class of methods produce faithful approximations with several desirable properties including long-time stability and accuracy, the exact enforcement of conservation laws (e.g., mass, energy, momentum), enhanced stability properties with respect to model parameters, absence of numerical artifacts, and reduced computational errors.  Altogether, these algorithms produce high-fidelity computational simulations that remain true to the physics of the underlying models.  The goal of the conference is to bring together mathematicians and engineers with diverse research backgrounds to interact, communicate, collaborate, and discuss recent developments in the field of structure preserving discretizations.  This will allow cross-fertilization of various viewpoints in this field, lead to better understandings of these methods, and the development of novel algorithms and theoretical results.<br/><br/>One focus of the conference is the finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) framework, a powerful class of structure preserving discretizations that formulates finite element methods in the calculus of differential forms. A key feature of this approach is to combine tools from homological algebra and functional analysis to develop finite dimensional subcomplexes of the canonical de Rham complex.  While the FEEC framework has been successfully applied to the de Rham complex with minimal smoothness, recent progress has extended this methodology to higher order Sobolev spaces, i.e., spaces with greater smoothness.  The extension of conforming finite element spaces of high-order Sobolev spaces in the FEEC framework necessitates the use of piecewise polynomial spaces with high regularity, i.e., smooth multivariate splines. This is an extensively studied and active research area, but the theory and construction, and even the language of smooth polynomial splines is relatively unknown to researchers in finite element analysis.  The conference will bring together researchers working in finite element analysis, multi-variate splines, isogeometric analysis, and algebraic geometry to collaborate and communicate current trends and to share diverse viewpoints on common problems. The conference will also define and discuss critical open problems in these different sub-fields, and expose graduate students and early career researchers to the intersection of finite element analysis, the theory of multivariate splines, isogeometric analysis, and applied algebraic geometry.

The goal of this research is to use these unique boron cluster-based scaffolds to create stable and efficient deep blue emitters for use in organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices, potentially resulting in the next generation of television screens, mobile phone displays, and solid-state lighting sources. The project lies at the interface of synthetic inorganic, organometallic and materials chemistry, and is well suited for the education and training of scientists at all levels. Three key target audiences were chosen for outreach, which include middle and high school students through experimental summer science camps, and inmate members of the California Institute for Women (CIW) as part of the UCLA Prison Education project. These educational and outreach activities create excitement towards the potential positive changes scientific careers can hold for younger students. <br/><br/>This project centers on the development of new photophysically-innocent ligand scaffolds based on polyhedral boron clusters. Currently utilized classical polyaromatic ligands attached to metal centers within the flat square planar geometry can lead to undesirable color dilution and non-radiative decay pathways due to intermolecular stacking interactions. Boron clusters are used to counteract these issues providing the three-dimensional steric bulk capable of minimizing intermolecular interactions in the solid-state. Furthermore, boron cluster ligands are synthetically appealing, given that they place functional groups at specific vertices, thus allowing for a large degree of tunability. In this project, new substitution chemistry is used to tune the emitter color through the ligand coordinated to the platinum(II)center. Furthermore, boron cluster species may provide extraordinarily large frontier orbital gaps in their unfunctionalized form, making them photophysically innocent in the context of designing metal-based phosphorescent emitters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies have drastically changed the perception of how multifunctional composites and structures are designed and fabricated. The emergence of multimaterial 3D printing--precise placement of dissimilar materials in space--has opened unprecedented opportunities up for creating new types of composites. While tremendous research possibilities exist, center to these opportunities is mechanics, which is not only critical in understanding fundamental engineering issues, such as interface properties and reliability, but also drives innovative design through mechanical behavior, such as mismatch of strains and nonlinear thermomechanics. The objective of this workshop is to review the recent progress in the mechanics-based design of intelligent material systems by multimaterial additive manufacturing and to identify new directions and opportunities. Funding from this grant will support travel costs for 13 invited speakers to attend the workshop and present their work, and two graduate students for organizing the workshop as well as the production of a report.<br/><br/>In this one-day workshop, 13 invited leading experts in mechanics of multifunctional materials as well as additive manufacturing from across academia, government, and industry will discuss present and future challenges and opportunities related to the mechanics-based design of intelligent material systems by multimaterial additive manufacturing.

Heat flow data provide fundamental information on the physical, chemical and biological processes that are occurring near and below the seafloor and ultimately, information on the thermal and chemical evolution of Earth. The goal of this study is to advance the development of two prototype heat probes beyond the testing/development stage so that they can be used by the broad scientific community. The new heat-flow probes will be lighter and provide near-real-time temperature data; both of which will streamline how heat flow data currently are collected.  The project incorporates new technology into the prototypes compared to conventional heat flow probes. The project includes international collaboration and provides training for an undergraduate student.<br/><br/><br/>This project aims to provide either real-time or near-real time temperature data at higher sample rates and with longer endurance time than standard heat flow probes. The prototypes have the potential to transform our understanding of complex submarine fluid flow near faults, seeps, vent sites, or caldera lakes. The two prototype probes are designed to operate in water depths of 500 m (Prototype-1) and 2000 m (Prototype-2); individual components for each probe have been pressure tested. Currently, however, the fully constructed probes are untested at pressures greater than 1 MPa (100 m water depth). Prototype-1 is designed to include real-time heat flow data and sea-bottom imaging for site characterization and selection; Prototype-2 is designed with Bluetooth data transmission. Both prototypes will increase heat flow data collection by a factor of two compared to conventional methods. Until pressure tests and geothermal gradient field tests are completed, however, the probes cannot be scheduled for scientific use without high risk of failure. This study has the potential to transform how marine heat flow and fluid fluxes are collected and analyzed, especially in high heat flow environments. Work involves full pressure testing and potential thermal gradient testing for prototype-2. Specifically, the pressure tests will go to 20 MPa (up to 2000 m water depth), and the thermistors will be tested offshore Montserrat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drawing upon NSF-funded research in digital libraries which apply information retrieval and artificial intelligence techniques (such as natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning), this project will evaluate whether such technologies (with a particular focus on summarization) can lead to new business opportunities within both the insurance and legal industry. One connection between these industries is the sharing of long, often complex, documents. Integrating summarization methods with information retrieval, and further leveraging text analysis and mining technologies, could aid these businesses in more quickly and efficiently managing such documents. More broadly, the problem of creating a useful summary for a long document is applicable to many businesses, including the publishing industry, where the proposed technology could assist both authors and readers, as well as those involved in discovering, searching, and managing published document collections.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will address how advanced digital library methods can be improved and applied in commercial settings. An important service to aid with managing and understanding information is summarization. While there has been recent automation of extractive (e.g., selecting a set of the most important sentences from a document) and abstractive (e.g., automatically preparing an abstract as would be done by a human abstracter) summarization methods, as applied to news articles or other short but popular works, only extractive methods have yielded much real success when applied to longer documents. Devising and validating effective techniques for constructing abstractive summaries for long documents is a very difficult problem, which is a key focus of this project's efforts. Further, making those techniques work with complex documents in a variety of domains is a special challenge. Connecting such efforts with big data collections, online cloud systems, explainable artificial intelligence methods, and functional user interfaces, are additional challenges that must be addressed in new settings that are of commercial interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research, which involves an international collaboration of scientists, develops a community-based, co-development approach to altering farming practices in sub -Saharan Africa that are often linked to high rates of soil erosion, decreasing soil quality, and increasing use of agrochemicals, all of which have negative impacts on humans and the environment through increased pollution and decreased biodiversity and water quality, using farming in Malawi as a test case. Previous research has shown that, when combined with participatory education, agroecological farming methods result in improved food security, nutrition, soil, and human health.  Such practices include legume intercropping, composting, and mulching. However, little is known how these practices influence biodiversity and ecosystem services in Africa and if the practices simultaneously enhance agroecosystem and community resilience. This research addresses knowledge gaps in this topic area and engages decision-makers in participatory research that has the potential to shape agricultural policies at various scales. In this project, teams of farmer-researchers and research scientists explore how agroecological and different land use practices impact biodiversity (bees, birds, and natural enemies), ecosystem services, and farmer livelihoods. Resulting empirical data are used to parameterize scenarios of potential land use and gauge whether agroecological practices buffer loss of biodiversity.  Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between US scientists and those in 5 other countries, two of which are in sub-Saharan Africa (Malawi, Kenya, Germany, Norway, and Canada). For this project, each country funds the scientific component carried out by its own scientists. Impacts also include significant public outreach on the results of this research to stakeholders from sectors such as government, industry, and farmer cooperatives. In addition, there is student and postdoc training in international transdisciplinary research and support of an investigator whose gender is underrepresented in the sciences. Other impacts include societal impacts such as increasing and improving food security and ecosystems services in countries with large and growing, low-income, agrarian, populations experiencing serious environmental changes due to global warming and problematic agricultural and cultural land-use practices, each of which can result in political instability. The work also promotes a more sustainable environment via improved agricultural practices and awareness.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the research addresses biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and improvements in food security under scenarios of land-use change in the Global South, using farming in Malawi as a case study. Research questions include: (1) can agroecological practices at multiple spatial scales buffer the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services under current and future land use scenarios in Malawi; (2) are there breakpoints of landscape-level agroecological adoption above which biodiversity and ecosystem services are maximally retained; (3) do social roles (e.g., class, gender, health status) and/or key macro social forces (e.g., agricultural policies, extension services, international agreements) influence agroecological use and related measures of household and community resilience under low-income smallholder farmer conditions; (4) can participatory scenario planning approaches enhance long-term community resilience and biodiversity under different land use scenarios and anticipated climate change impacts; and (5) do new institutional and policy frameworks enable the use of agroecological practices to reduce biodiversity loss, sustain ecosystem services and improve climate change adaptation. These issues are addressed by coupling socio-economic and biodiversity dynamics via engaging farmer-researchers who directly measure biodiversity and ecosystem services. Work is done in close collaboration with an interdisciplinary team of research scientists including ecologists, sociologists, public health professionals, geographers, entomologists, and economists. Resulting empirical findings are used to craft and model multiple scenarios of future land use and land use changes to determine impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, food security and farmer livelihoods.  These finding are then used to determine how impacts vary, based on the degree of agroecological practices used, across the region.

In addition, the technology makes it easier to mine massive amounts of data from each chemical authentication. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the spread of counterfeit products in affected regions, thereby protecting whole communities from potentially harmful substances while enabling regulatory and government agencies to take effective measures against counterfeiters. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project includes a patented chemical test card and a companion mobile app that have gone through extensive preliminary trials. The Paper Analytical Device (PAD) is an inexpensive chemical test card which enables fast in-field screening of pharmaceuticals using colorimetric analysis. The device currently detects up to 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) commonly found in a variety of medicines such as antimalarials, antibiotics, and analgesics, along with excipients that are commonly found in counterfeit products such as binders, fillers, and tablet coatings. The Veripad mobile application enables instantaneous analysis of each PAD using a machine learning algorithm. The app gives a probability of a reacted PAD card matching the API using deep convolutional neural network models. Moreover, the app is able to perform chemical composition analysis from the 'hand crafted' features of chemical color changes generated using various image feature extraction and clustering algorithms, such as ICA, PCA, and K-means. With ongoing research, the PAD and mobile app has the potential to aid in the quality testing of a variety of pharmaceuticals to ultimately combat the spread of counterfeits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its five-year duration, the project will provide 15 students with four-year scholarships to support their attainment of bachelor's degrees in Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, or Computer Science. A key component of the project's intellectual merit is the application of high-impact academic and social support activities and emphasis on helping students develop skills in connecting mathematics and science.  It is expected that the set of supports will address common barriers to success in gateway courses and lead to increased retention and academic achievement of STEM students. This project has the potential to serve as a model for preparing bilingual STEM professionals for the nation's STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The project seeks to address the national shortage of qualified STEM workers and provide a critical match between STEM careers and students in an economically depressed region.  Consequently, the project will develop relationships with industry partners to expand internship and job opportunities for the Scholars. The project objectives include achieving an increase in students' academic achievement as well as an increase in the retention and graduation rates of STEM majors. Faculty and peer tutoring, a first-year course, and STEM workshops will be designed to help the Scholars make connections between mathematical and scientific skills and to understand the close relationships between mathematics and science. The project will also provide supports to prepare the Scholars for placement in STEM careers or for entry into graduate school.

The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United State has grown significantly in recent years, and while there have been some successful efforts to address this issue by exploiting VR-based therapies, most of them merely use VR as an alternative way to simulate existing approaches. An important feature of VR technology - the ability to generate ""impossible experiences"" (i.e., experiences that cannot be created in the real world, such as a chair disappearing upon the user's gaze) - seems to be missing in these systems, because this feature was not available when most traditional ASD therapies were developed. The envisaged system will employ specifically designed ""impossible experiences"" to deliver an individualized therapy that addresses the attention deficits of children with ASD. The research will improve the learning ability for children with ASD and provide novel design guidelines for future VR systems used in ASD therapy. <br/><br/>The PI will study research questions and develop the system incrementally. The overall logic of the system is: 1) Expose the user to a virtual environment to finish a task (e.g., listen to a virtual teacher talking); 2) Detect the user's attention with eye-tracking data and physiological signals, then remove all the detected distractions (e.g., a red mug) from the virtual environment; 3) Gradually restore all distractions into the virtual environment, expose the user to one more distraction object at a time and reinforce the correct attention. To implement this strategy, the PI will first explore attention capture in VR and strategies for reinforcement in VR through short user studies. Then, the effectiveness of the entire system will be evaluated through a six-month long, multiple-baseline design across participants study. All the studies will be conducted with K-12 students with medium to high levels of ASD.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It asks two main questions: (1) How are US federal regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug administration categorizing, analyzing, and regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing; and (2) What influence do other groups such as professional organizations, advocacy groups, and research institutes have on the regulation of direct-to-consumer genetics? While scholars have critically examined how genetic tests perpetuate certain identities and social categories, we know little about the processes by which genetic testing is being regulated. The present study advances our understanding of this issue in relation to three major trends occurring in biomedicine. These include a shift from genetic diagnosis to genetic risk, the redefinition of the patient as a consumer, and the de-medicalization of genetics. This project thus increases our scholarly understanding of direct-to-consumer genetic testing as it is unfolding within broader social and cultural transformations occurring in medicine and health. <br/><br/>This is a multi-method social science investigation of factors shaping federal regulations regarding direct-to-consumer genetic testing. Primary data for the project come from archival documents, interviews, and participant observations. The main goal of the project is to understand how federal agencies conceptualize and regulate direct-to-consumer advertising of genetic tests, and the relative power of outside stakeholder groups to shape federal regulations surrounding commercial genetic testing. Undertaking this research enables an enhanced understanding of ethical issues surrounding direct-to-consumer genetic testing and of how the concepts of risk, diagnoses, and genetics are used in these contexts and in the context of current transformations in medicine and health. Results will be shared with the broader community to educate citizens about the regulation of direct-to-consumer genetic testing and about the influence of stakeholders in the federal regulatory process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deposition of high-quality thin films on a large scale with precise energy control can allow, for one example, diamond-like carbon (DLC) on glass.  DLC coatings on glass can prevent soapy film build-up on shower doors, can improve the scratch resistance of mobile phone displays, and can reduce the cost of energy-conserving windows. The control of energy during fabrication processes won't just broaden what films can be made; it will allow the use of a greater variety of substrates. In recent years, a number of applications have utilized traditional inorganic coatings like silicon oxide on top of new materials like organic solar cells and organic LEDs. These organic materials show greater sensitivity to degradation during the coating processes. This ion beam source can give industry, as it begins to bring these innovations to market, a tool with the level of energy control that will allow lab results to translate to high yield, low cost manufacturing. <br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the challenge of depositing advanced thin films on insulating and/or delicate substrates. Control of the deposition's energy flux has been shown in laboratory demonstrations to be required for many thin films including diamond-like carbon, transparent conductive oxides on silicon and organic solar cells, and ultra-thin silver. A scalable linear ion beam sputter source will establish a high-volume manufacturing tool for thin films limited today to much smaller scale. In Phase 1, the source's functionality was demonstrated. Phase 2 has two major components: hardware development for scale and usability; process development for specific commercial applications. The company will deliver a fully integrated control system and a source, scaled by 2x and designed for manufacture. Process development will consider beam energetics and geometry of beam/target/substrate relative to film and substrate properties. For DLC, this will focus on tribological and optical properties. For silver, they will test for continuity of ultra-thin films.

Making sure that all of these laboratories are making accurate DOC measurements requires that each can access a standardized sample of seawater for which the DOC concentration is set by international agreement. This award funds the University of Miami to continue a consensus reference material (CRM) program that was first developed in 1998 in support of consistent, high quality measurements of dissolved organic carbon by the international ocean chemistry community. With continuation of this work, the US and international communities can make consistent measurements of a major marine carbon reservoir and advance society's ability to assess changes in the marine carbon cycle and the role of the ocean in climate change.<br/><br/>With continued strong international efforts to investigate the marine carbon cycle, the existing CRM program provides the necessary benchmark for globally comparable marine DOC measurements. Water from the deep Florida Strait (approximately 42 umol/kg DOC) will be collected, placed in ampoules, and distributed to the US and international community. Over the time period of this program, approximately 228,000 vials of reference waters have been distributed to approximately 240 US and international laboratories in 43 nations, currently at a rate of about 23,000 vials/year.  With continuation of the reference material program for a seventh 3-year period of support, distribution of deep ocean water containing biologically refractory dissolved organic carbon and low carbon reference water will continue to aid the analytical work of the community studying dissolved organic matter in the ocean.

Reactions in crystals differ from processes in liquids and in gases because molecules in the crystalline state are held rigidly and orderly, such that they all have the same fate when a reaction occurs. With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at The University of California, Los Angeles, uses crystals to explore two types of unusual but promising chemical reactions.  One reaction examines the effect of magnetic fields.  Magnetic fields play a role in the navigation systems of migrating birds and have the potential to control some types of chemical systems.  The second reaction, known as a quantum chain reaction, is process where a single light particle, or photon, leads to many chemical events (an amplification process). Quantum chain reactions in crystals are enabled by strong interactions between neighboring molecules. This interaction transforms photons into moveable ""excitons"",  facilitated by chemical reactions that retain and unleash large amounts of energy.  A third objective of this grant is to demonstrate the advantages of reactions in crystals for the conversion of simple chemicals into high value substances. This multifaceted project provides an excellent multi-disciplinary training ground for students in quantum information systems (QIS).  It helps develop the intellectual and human infrastructure needed to support our country's academic and industrial enterprises related to quantum computing, quantum biology, and sensing. The connection between biological systems and molecules in crystals provides Professor Garcia-Garibay with an opportunity to develop a freshman-level course on the role of light in the origins of life. This course develops multimedia teaching and demonstration aids that are shared with the general public.<br/><br/>Over the last few years the Garcia-Garibay group has established the structural requirements needed to engineer reactions in crystalline solids.  This project addresses three aspects of chemical dynamics that have not been accessible by studying reactions in liquid solutions or in the gas phase.  First, by taking advantage of crystalline ketones which have radical stabilizing substituents at the two alpha-carbons, the researchers are able to generate triplet radical pairs under conditions not available previously.  With strongly interacting spins, these radical pairs have a relatively large Singlet-Triplet energy gap.  When combined with the use of nanocrystalline suspensions as a medium to carry out laser flash photolysis (pump-probe) experiments, this project provides a unique opportunity to measure the dynamics of intersystem crossing in the solid state.  Structural modifications of the starting ketone measured by single crystal X-ray diffraction and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance provide opportunities to analyze the kinetics of the triplet excited states and sequential radical pair intermediates. The interplay of spin dynamics and chemical dynamics is probed by measuring the kinetics of intersystem crossing as a function of external magnetic fields and magnetic isotope effects.  Other aspects of solid state photochemical reactivity that are encompassed by this project include the total synthesis of the natural product Chimonanthin using solid state photodecarbonylation as the key step.  The triplet exciton-enabled quantum chain reaction of crystalline Dewar benzenes is also explored. This chain process is expected to give a large number of product molecules per photon absorbed. Altogether, the research activities in this project improve the fundamental understanding of reaction mechanisms and chemical reactivity in rigid materials and provide students with an opportunity to receive a highly interdisciplinary training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A proprietary system then recommends Hats (careers) to explore and Ladders (activities) to complete that provide real-world learning supported by a range of motivators (level design, self-reflections, achievement badges, social sharing, and mentor communication). Data generated during Ladder activity and self-reflections strengthens the user's profile and, thus, the accuracy of the recommendation engine. The project employs design-based methods as the overarching research approach. A final evaluation of the completed program will be conducted in both high school and after-school settings. Career readiness, persistence, and perceptions of ability and of the H&L program will be assessed using quantitative methodologies. The anticipated result is a highly effective career development program that engages 21st-century learners with foundational career-building experiences. Students will be able to identify career aspirations, based on interests and occupational data, and gain greater confidence in their ability to navigate and adapt to changing career pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include blood flow in the human circulatory system, flow of oil and water in porous media associated with enhanced oil recovery, and boiling and condensation associated with heat transfer operations.  Despite its importance, advanced graduate instruction in computational methods in multiphase transport is available at very few universities.   This award, to support the 2019 Summer Research School on Fluid Dynamics, will address that need.  The 2019 summer program will focus on modeling and simulation of multiphase flow and thermal transport.  The program will help train roughly 50 graduate students from across the country through a series of lectures and interactive tutorials by invited experts.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to build a network and community of researchers through informal interactions and poster sessions throughout this week-long course.  <br/><br/>The 2019 Summer Research School will focus on the physical and mathematical aspects of modeling and simulating the behavior of multiphase flow and thermal transport directly at the scale of the fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces.  Modeling and simulation of these processes is critical to a broad range of industrial and natural applications.  However, despite a long history of activity, a number of challenges remain associated with accuracy, efficiency, capabilities, and robustness of simulation techniques.  Recent progress has led to numerous methods that are now available to address various aspects of these challenges.   The summer school will provide lectures on multiphase flow theory, numerical methods for multiphase flow, and multiphase flow applications.  Lectures will cover phase change heat transfer, interface physics, simulation of boiling, immersed boundary methods, interfacial transport, phase field methods, and particulate flows.  Interactive tutorials will complement the lectures and introduce students to some of the difficulties related to post-processing data.  Professional development of the students will include opportunities to present their research through a poster session and extensive opportunities to meet and network with the summer school instructors, who are a mix of distinguished experts and active, early career faculty members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many alternatives, like spark-ignition and electric vehicles, sacrifice some of the performance or range benefits of Diesel-style operation. This creates a market need for technologies that can maintain Diesel engine performance while remaining decoupled from the dirty emissions of Diesel fuel. This proposal centers on the development of the ?ClearFlame Combustion System? (CFCS): a novel combustion process that enables Diesel-style engines to combust low-carbon alternative fuels like ethanol and methanol without sacrificing the power possible with traditional Diesel combustion. Further, the sootless nature of alternative fuels such as methanol and ethanol obviates the need for a Diesel particulate filter, and enables stoichiometric air-fuel ratios to eliminate the need for selective catalytic reduction of NOx (smog). The engine technology has the potential to alter the dynamics of any market dominated by Diesel engines (including heavy-duty transportation, agriculture, rail, and power generation) and can be licensed to, or jointly developed with, OEMs for simple integration into their existing product lines. Phase I results have shown a 30% increase in engine torque at increased efficiency, while engine-out soot emissions are more than 100x lower than that of Diesel engines, falling under the 2010 EPA regulation limit without aftertreatment. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the CFCS. The Phase I results showed that three critical CFCS subsystems?engine insulation, alcohol direct injection, and a combustion chamber optimized for stoichiometric combustion with exhaust gas load control?could be developed and integrated to achieve a previously unattainable combination of strong performance and low emissions. This Phase II effort will further advance these key components and demonstrate the benefits of the CFCS on a commercial engine platform, using CFD modeling and engine experiments to show the advantages of the CFCS compared to the Diesel baseline. The goal is to show how the CFCS enables a multi-cylinder heavy-duty engine to simultaneously improve power density by 30% at no loss of efficiency, while also achieving sootless stoichiometric exhaust conditions that are compatible with low-cost and highly-effective three-way catalysis (the same system that enables gasoline and natural gas engines to be much cleaner than Diesel). A Phase II prototype demonstration would realize a longtime industry goal of integrating three-way catalysis with a Diesel-style engine, allowing Diesel-style engines to achieve the emissions profile of the cleanest alternatives (like natural gas).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technology resulting from the proposed activity will solve several pain points in the chemical analysis industry, including non-linearity, small dynamic range and variable, sometimes negligible, detector response. As a result, the technology will have broad use and lead to improved detection in pharmaceuticals, drug development, fuels, chemicals, renewables, foods, flavors, and academic and industrial research. Uniform response to carbon from flame ionization detection (FID) would be completely disruptive to the painstaking methods of calibration of known compounds and the guesswork associated with the quantification of unknowns. The benefits of this technology are expected to result in immense improvements in the speed and accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, thereby leading to better and safer products, with faster development times. Applied to the pharmaceutical and new drug development industry, this technology will have lasting impacts on the health and safety of society due to better and faster analyses available.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project aims to deliver a carbon selective detector (CSD) to the global scientific market.  The CSD is a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  detector that produces a linear response to all organic compounds using a flame ionization detection (FID)  and a catalytic reactor. The key innovation is the novel development and use of a catalytic reactor to transform organic molecules and remove solvent in liquid chromatograph effluent streams. The FID, similar to those ubiquitous in gas chromatography (GC) systems, yields a universal response to organic compounds converted to methane with unparalleled linear range and robustness. The device will overcome limitations of the FID that have prevented previous use in HPLC by selectively removing solvents, oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide, reducing carbon dioxide to methane, and detecting the resulting methane with the FID.  The resulting product features, most notably a universal response to carbon, will provide pre-clinical pharmaceutical researchers with a tool that can quantify drugs and their by-products during screening, long before the process has been scaled up for the production of calibration standards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses time-dependent evolution of contacts between silica sand grains, with its consequences on strength, stiffness, and arching formation in sand. This study seeks to discover microscopic processes which govern the behavior of soils.  A link between evolution of inter-grain contacts and arching in granular geomaterials is sought, with a goal of a more informed use of arching in engineering analyses. The twofold purpose of the study is in promoting progress in science, and in benefits to society stemming from application of the research results in the development of national infrastructure. <br/><br/>Behavior of soils is typically described by phenomenological models that predict their response to loads and load duration on the engineering scale. These models, however, do not explain the physical cause of the behavior they describe. In order to exercise any influence over the material behavior, the origin of the behavior needs to be discovered. This research addresses the fundamental question of why silica sand contacts exhibit time-dependent behavior that leads to time-dependent evolution of contact shear resistance and stiffness. A new generation of grain-scale testing apparatus will be constructed to test grain contacts subjected to complex loads. Testing of contacts will give rise to a mathematical description of contact behavior, which, subsequently, will be upscaled to the networks of grain contacts, and to the engineering scale behavior. The influence of the evolution process of material properties that originates at inter-grain contacts on formation of internal arches in soil masses will be studied. Both the distinct element approach and finite element analysis will be carried out to gain insight into the elusive phenomenon of arching in granular materials.

Yet, Native Americans have been and continue to be dramatically underrepresented in the field of archaeology. The Society for American Archaeology recognizes the benefits of Native American and Indigenous participation in archaeology and has, for the past two decades, developed a Native American Scholarship Fund that supports training Native American and Indigenous archaeologists. These scholarships help ensure that indigenous knowledge and voices continue to become a more vibrant part of the fabric of understanding American culture and past human experience. <br/><br/>The lasting impact of these scholarships has already impacted archaeology and the larger historic preservation community. For example, many of the past recipients of the SAA's Native American Scholarships indicate that their award enabled them to pursue careers in archaeology and in several cases inspired them to create similar opportunities for future generations of indigenous archaeologists to follow in their footsteps. Scholarships awarded through this grant support both graduate and undergraduate education and training in archaeology for Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian students and community members and recipients are selected through a competitive, criteria-based process. The funding provided by the National Science Foundation will enable the SAA to continue their legacy of supporting underrepresented communities within the field of archaeology as part of their commitment to the ""Statement on Diversity,"" which makes inclusiveness an institutional and disciplinary goal.

By acting as a musical change agent, the proposed technology takes ""personalized music"" beyond playlists and song suggestions. For the first time, music listeners can bring their own creativity to the songs they care about. This project introduces a new paradigm for music where songs evolve and undergo transformation alone or with other songs, at the click of a button. The choice of music as an application for the technology is deliberate. Music is a highly context-dependent application where each note or musical event is determined by the preceding notes and events, and each note or event foreshadows those yet to come. That this advanced technique produces musical variations that can be analyzed as well as used for musical means suggest that the methodology could be applied to other sequences of context-dependent symbols, such as those that define image, text, film, and video. Furthermore, it can serve as an idea generator for media practitioners in general, as well as stimulate interest in engineering for students K-12 and beyond by linking science with the musical arts. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project harnesses chaotic system variability to generate variations of a sequence of context-dependent symbols, such those that constitute a musical work. Most engineers seek ways to eliminate chaotic behavior. Yet in its ""chaotic regime"", a dissipative chaotic system possesses a natural mechanism for variability due to the sensitivity of its solutions to initial conditions. This built-in variability can be exploited by a chaotic mapping technique that transforms an ordered input into a variant ordered output. The variant output can be close to the original work, it can mutate beyond recognition, as well as achieve degrees of variability in between these two extremes. The method includes parsing the input into an ordered sequence of original elements {Ni}, the original elements sequentially indexed by successive integer values i=1,....,imax. For each ""i"", a selection algorithm determines whether Ni is a candidate for modification or replacement, thus becoming a ""receptor element"". A substitution or modifying algorithm then operates on at least one of the receptor elements by varying or replacing it with a substitution element. The resulting ordered set of original and substituted or modified elements comprises the variant output. A virtually infinite set of variations is possible, each unique.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It expands on the recipient's already unique product offerings to create a transformative mathematics platform. The platform is an innovative new way of doing math that allows users to enter any equation on almost any device, and solve it using simple drag-and-drop gestures. Its freeform approach to computer algebra retains the exploratory aspects of pen-and-paper calculations, while benefiting from the computational prowess of the underlying math engine. With a unique user interface and networked multiplayer support, it is also a powerful real-time communication and collaboration tool. This project drastically enlarges the breadth of the technology by focusing on critical tasks in three core areas of development: expanding its core mathematics features, maturing its peer-to-peer math communication system, and structuring its overall system architecture. The project prepares the platform for a precise product-market fit to target school districts for direct licensing, and online education companies for partnership.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solid tumors exhibit the highest rates of incidence and mortality in the United States for the past few decades. Many of the newest advancements in immunotherapy, including bi-specific antibodies and CAR-T cell therapy have shown minimal effect on solid tumors. The vaccine invented by this group fills the gap by providing a personalized immunotherapy vaccine that can stop or reduce the progression of the cancer and prevent its recurrence. It will save millions of lives by treating those incurable cancers with this newly developed vaccine. The plan is to investigate its customer segments, to discover its market, and to understand its regulatory approval processes. The initial customer discovery will be the focus of the NSF I-Corps Short Course, followed by a market discovery and a strategy to raise funds for bringing the vaccine to the market.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is to commercialize an immunotherapy vaccine that was developed based on a discovery made by this group, where genome edited tumor cells were found to elicit a strong immunogenicity against solid tumors, thereby functioning like a vaccine. The initial animal studies supported the feasibility of this approach. Building upon tremendous advances in cancer immunotherapy and genome editing, this vaccine synergistically combines CRISPR genome editing, vaccinations, and personalized medicine to fully activate a patient's immune system against cancer recurrence. This is the first engineered tumor vaccine that prevents cancer cells from evading the immune system. Unlike conventional cancer therapy, it does not have severe off-target side effects. While cancer vaccines have been explored extensively, their clinical development has seen a long lag phase due to hurdles in regulatory approvals and their adoption into existing therapy regimes. The vaccine developed by this group will overcome these hurdles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Direct and indirect economic losses resulting from liquefaction are substantial costs to society.  To deal with this hazard, engineers can compact all the liquefiable sand in place or use deep foundations that penetrate through the liquefiable sand, but these methods are very expensive, especially for residential areas.  A more economical strategy, being intensively studied around the world, is to compact a surface layer 12- to 20-ft thick that can safely support a building even if liquefaction still occurs in the deeper layers below it.  To investigate this approach, without waiting for an earthquake, we will compact a surface layer 20-ft thick and use an array of small explosive charges to liquefy the sand below.  The field test site will be in Christchurch, New Zealand, where liquefaction damage caused over 10,000 homes to be condemned.  Settlement from liquefaction will be compared with an identical test at an adjacent untreated area. The results from these tests will allow engineers to determine if this economical solution is actually safe to employ in practice. The soil compaction will be peformed using an innovative approach in which expanding polyurethane is injected into the ground. Unlike most soil improvement techniques, this method can be safely used under existing structures.  The New Zealand government is paying the cost of the soil improvement while the US National Science Foundation will pay the costs of the liquefaction test.  Leveraging funding from both countries expands the scope of work beyond what either country would accomplish independently and increases the impact of the research internationally. These benchmark case histories will help engineers to design safe, yet cost effective foundation solutions to minimize earthquake damage.  In addition, U.S. graduate student will gain significant international experience by participating in this study. <br/><br/>Liquefaction of loose saturated sands results in significant damage to civil infrastructure in nearly every earthquake event. Direct and indirect economic losses resulting from liquefaction are substantial costs to society as was recently demonstrated in New Zealand.  Over 10,000 homes were damaged as a result of liquefaction and the economy is struggling to recover. Engineers in New Zealand are experimenting with ground improvement methods that thicken and stiffen a non-liquefiable surface crust to minimize differential settlement from liquefaction below the crust. An innovative, new liquefaction mitigation method known as resin-injection was recently developed and tested in New Zealand at three sites where 18 other ground improvement methods were previously tested using blast induced liquefaction in 2013 as part of a $5 million study.  Polyurethane resin is injected from the bottom-up through vertical pipes installed in a triangular grid pattern.  The low-viscosity resin penetrates the surrounding soil through planes of weakness or by hydrofracturing.  Expansion of the resin densifies the surrounding soil and increases the lateral earth pressure.  This method can be used to treat soils below existing structures and is effective in silty sands that are difficult to densify with vibratory methods. An extensive set of post-treatment in-situ tests demonstrate that this new technique is very effective relative to previous methods; however, none of the resin injection test sites has been subjected to blast testing to evaluate the performance of the improved ground overlying the liquefiable sand at depth.  This makes it impossible to compare the overall system performance of this treatment method with the other systems previously evaluated in the 2013 trials.  To remedy this deficiency, we will conduct blast liquefaction tests at one of the resin injection sites and an adjacent untreated area.  Prior to blasting, instrumentation will be installed to measure pore pressure generation and dissipation, soil settlement vs. time and vs. depth, shear wave velocity vs. pore pressure ratio, lateral earth pressure vs. pore pressure ratio, and blast-induced shear strain.  This project will: (1)  provide a direct comparison of excess pore pressure and soil settlement in the resin-treated layers with an untreated site, (2) add to the database defining the effect of surface crust thickness and stiffness on the settlement and distortion of buildings on the crust, and (3) provide fundamental in-situ measurements of lateral earth pressure and shear modulus variation with the generation and dissipation of pore pressure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tensegrity is the characteristic property of a stable three-dimensional structure consisting of members under tension that are contiguous and members under compression that are not. <br/><br/>The conference will bring together researchers and practitioners in informal learning and researchers in the various disciplines that embrace tensegrity (mathematics, engineering, biology, architecture, and art) to explore the potential that tensegrity has to engage the public in informal settings, especially through direct engagement in creating such structures. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>To date there have been no sustained informal educational projects and research around the topic of tensegrity. However, there is considerable related work on learning through ""making and tinkering"" upon which the participants will adapt and expand.  The intended conference outcomes are to produce prototypes of activities, a research agenda, and lines of development with the potential to engage the wider public. A key priority of the gathering is the development of new partnerships between researchers and creators of tensegrity systems and the informal learning professionals.

Records from ice cores show that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) correlates with global temperatures -- high pCO2 implies a warm Earth.  However, ice core records are limited to the age of Earth's oldest ice, which is only  ~1 million years (Ma).  All estimates of pCO2 from older than 1 Ma rely on other indirect measurements that track CO2. These indirect measurements are called proxies.  This project will test a new pCO2 proxy called the Archaea (EpsilonAr) proxy, which is based on lipids (a class of biochemicals) recovered from microbes living in marine systems. The basis for the EpsilonAr proxy originated from some limited field observations and from a theoretical model. The primary objective of the current research is to test the theory behind the EpsilonAr proxy, both using controlled laboratory experiments and by studying marine sediments that record a recent glacial-interglacial cycle. The project crosses disciplinary lines, requiring geobiological methods along with isotopic analyses and applications to the sedimentary record.  The project will train a post-doctoral investigator and two summer undergraduate and/or high school interns.<br/><br/>A combination of laboratory experiments and natural samples will be used to test the hypothesis that the carbon isotope fractionation recorded in lipids of marine Thaumarchaeota reflects the extracellular CO2 concentrations during growth. Thaumarchaeota use the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3HP/4HB) pathway of carbon fixation in which the primary enzyme, acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase, is specific for the substrate HCO3-. The current hypothesis is that Thaumarchaeota are dependent on CO2 diffusion, followed by intracellular catalysis to HCO3 .  The initial focus of the project will be to conduct controlled experiments on the model taxon Nitrosopumilis maritimus to test a quantitative model of the carbon isotope effect and its dependence on CO2 (by varying pH, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and growth rate).  The results will be compared to control experiments with the thermophile Metallosphaera sedula, a 3HP/4HB taxon predicted to be CO2-insensitive.  The second stage of the project will be to examine whether the predicted isotopic sensitivity of EpsilonAr is observed in a glacial-interglacial sedimentary record from the subtropical Atlantic Ocean.  Outcomes will be evaluated by comparing the observed EpsilonAr response to CO2 and growth rate with the existing theoretical framework, updating and refining the theory as needed to reflect the experiments and observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS.

Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons.

When public programs and private financial resources both recede, what kinds of social resources do chronically ill people, who need stable access to pharmaceuticals, mobilize in order to survive? Social scientific accounts of unmet healthcare needs associated with economic crises have largely focused on the developing world. Less is known about the relationship between austerity and healthcare resources in contexts such as the U.S. or Europe. This research addresses pharmaceutical access under austerity in a context with a previously robust universal healthcare system. Deepening financial and healthcare inequalities associated with economic crisis have given way to newly disenfranchised people that must seek pharmaceuticals in a therapeutic economy characterized by frequent crisis-driven reformulations. This research, which is centered on training a graduate student in rigorous methods of scientific data collection and analysis, seeks to understand the kinds of social resources people mobilize in order to address unmet pharmaceutical needs, when public healthcare is no longer dependable and financial resources and pharmaceuticals are unevenly distributed. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student, the project would improve scientific understanding through broadly disseminating its findings to governmental and non-governmental organizations charged with improving public health access, as they mediate the differential impacts of austerity on healthcare outcomes.<br/>  <br/>Taylor Bell, under the supervision of Dr. Cristiana Giordano of the University of California at Davis, will explore what forms of social networks replace public infrastructures under conditions of austerity in healthcare access. This research takes place in Athens, Greece, which has instituted the most stringent austerity measures targeting public healthcare across Europe. Athens has the highest concentration of state-sponsored healthcare resources in Greece, and so, will best highlight how people adjust pharmaceutical-seeking practices when public resources disappear. In order to learn how pharmaceuticals are exchanged and the relationships that facilitate these exchanges, the co-PI will conduct participant observation in emergent grassroots solidarity clinics and pharmacies, which many people turned to after austerity measures eroded the universal healthcare system, cutting its budget by more than 50%. The co-PI will also track, map, and analyze pharmaceutical networks and therapeutic economies through a range of observational and archival methods on extended social networks, as well as interviews (through both the McGill Illness Narrative Interview, and well as targeted semi-structured follow-ups) with a representative sample of pharmaceutical seekers. The findings will contribute to debates in medical, political, and economic anthropology about inequality, specifically in the differential distribution of healthcare burdens under conditions of economic austerity. This research offers insight to policymakers concerned with the kinds of social resources that disenfranchised, chronically ill people build in order to establish access to needed pharmaceuticals, as state-funded healthcare retracts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project focuses on addressing land-use changes due to abrupt climate change and their impact on species extinctions, range shifts, and phenological changes. Better knowledge in this area is critical because species loss destabilizes food webs which can negatively impact human well-being and have unexpected consequences for multiple ecosystem functions and associated services. Predicting the response of biodiversity to global change has thus become an important area of research. Present models intended to anticipate future biodiversity and ecosystem services have been criticized for ignoring inputs such as biotic interactions and links between trophic levels (e.g., predator-prey relationships). This research will use a recently created, sophisticated, biodiversity modeling code that integrates predictive biogeography, geography, biostatistics, and trophic web ecology to derive scenarios of the impact of global change on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services. As a test case, the program will be combined with information from stakeholders and statistics on vertebrates to generate a suite of likely models of pan-European vertebrate biodiversity as they might be influenced by climate change. Stakeholders information will be used to inform the project so methodological choices, scenarios, and indicators can be made/set in such a way that results are useful for conservation planning and decision-making support. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between US investigators and six European (Finnish, United Kingdom, Dutch, German, Swiss, French, and Italian) scientists and the generation of scenarios for improving policy, decision-making, and conservation planning of ecosystem services involving vertebrate species across the European continent. In this coalition of investigators, each country funds it own scientists and their part of the project. Additional broader impacts of the work include workshops and summer schools to inform stakeholder groups and train/education students and postdocs, respectively; the generation of reports for the European Commission; and public outreach through a project website linked to social media and online discussion groups and forums. For the US component of the work, there will be the training of a postdoctoral scholar in transdisciplinary, international science and teamwork.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this research builds on the newly developed Generalized Joint Attribute Model, a generative model that solves two big challenges for predicting community change: (1) the ability to model responses of interdependent species across distantly related taxonomic groups and (2) the ability to link species on scales from plot-based plant abundance to individual- and plot-level herbivore damage.  These advances allow modeling of the distribution of individual species and species groups across entire communities, while considering shared responses to the environment and co-variation between species. The modeling code used in the project employs a flexible hierarchical framework to model species communities responding to multiple environmental changes. In addition to the modeling, the project will work to expand the capabilities of the present modeling platform so it can address predator-prey and competition-for-prey interactions. It will also allow incorporation of prior information on expected relationships between species based on relationships within the ""who eats whom"" network via hierarchical implementation.

Such rechargeable batteries will allow cell phones to be charged to their full capacity within 20 min (rather than 2 hours offered by the current battery technology available in the market) while extending the usage time to 3 days (rather than 2 days of current technology) before recharge is needed. These ultrafast charging and high energy batteries can also find a market for other consumer products, such as cameras, laptops, drones, power tools, electric forklifts in warehouses, and military devices, to improve work productivity and life quality for consumers. Furthermore, Si-based high energy batteries can be utilized to reduce the cost and weight of electric vehicle battery packs by 60%. These advancements will pave the way for broad market penetration of electric vehicles and support a more environmentally sustainable mode of transportation. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project employs a novel, simple and low-cost manufacturing method that can synthesize a new type of Si-based anode powder which exhibits unusual properties with ultrafast charging capability, high specific capacity and long-lasting cycle life. This new Si-based anode is termed as Si@void@C because it contains three distinct features simultaneously: (i) nanostructured Si building blocks, (ii) a conductive carbon shell outside the nanostructured Si core, and (iii) engineered void space inside the Si core. Together these three features offer the much-needed properties for Li-ion batteries: ultrafast charging capability, high specific energy and long-lasting cycle life. Based on these unique properties, the Si-based rechargeable batteries are designed in two general categories, one being ""ultrafast charging batteries"" that can shorten the charging time to 20 min while still allowing cell phones to be used for 3 days before re-charge and the other being ""high energy batteries"" which require 2 hours charging time, but allow users to recharge batteries every 6 days. Furthermore, ""high energy batteries"" can enable a reduction in the cost of the battery packs by 60% for electric vehicles, removing a critical barrier to consumer acceptance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many studies of existing industries, but few regarding how industries for new products evolve.  In addition, these new industries are often subject to varying regulations across the contexts in which they are located, including conflict between federal and state regulations governing production, marketing and sales.  This conflict creates uncertainty for entrepreneurs and for the general public. This project will analyze how different political, cultural, and economic processes are shaping the ways that new industries are structured, and analyze the effects of these forces and uncertainties on entrepreneurs. More specifically, this study will address two questions.  First, when new industries evolve, who develops the capacity to change institutions? Second, how does the resulting structure from these institutional changes affect the experiences, frameworks, and practices of entrepreneurs more broadly? The project moves beyond questions about which social contexts are more and less likely to be associated with changes in institutions such as laws and customs of business because it also explores who is developing the capacity to influence these processes in real time. This research will provide insights into evolving industries that may be useful to state and national policymakers tasked with developing regulations to control industry operations. It will also provide insights to support entrepreneurship, thus contributing to higher levels of business creation and employment. <br/><br/>This project will use a mixed-methods research design that includes analysis of three different states, each of which takes a different approach to regulating new agricultural products.  The project will include 70 semi-structured in-depth interviews with participants across the states, which will be analyzed using MAXQDA 2018 Analytics Pro software in order to identify patterns in the data that will be used in developing theoretical propositions.  These propositions will be tested with a subsequent cross-sectional survey of selected entrepreneurs across many states with a target response rate of 408 participants. These two approaches are combined to determine which institutions will persist over time and which ones will fail to persist.  Findings from this project will inform organizational theories of institutions focusing on the supply-side, sociology of culture theories of practice, and theories of social control in an effort to develop an integrated framework to explain how micro-level industry activities can produce macro-level social change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of such systems include smart grid, connected and autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, and mixed human-automata systems. Recent advances in technology have made these systems increasingly pervasive in a broad range of applications. Effective design of these systems requires interactions among experts from engineering, economics, and social sciences as well as industry. This forms the basis for organizing the 8th Midwest Workshop on Controls and Game Theory on April 27 - 28, 2019 in St. Louis, Missouri, where leading experts on controls, optimization, game theory, economics and computation from the Midwestern states are brought together to facilitate interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary research interactions and collaborations. <br/><br/>The purpose of the workshop is to facilitate and enhance research discussions and collaborations among experts in a broad range of disciplines, including biology, economics, and engineering. The invited speakers are leading experts in the areas of controls, game theory, applied probability, computation, dynamical systems, economics, and optimization. The four themes of this workshop are: (i) complex networks and large-scale control systems, (ii) game theory for economic and societal systems, (iii) optimization, learning, and computational methods, and (iv) emerging applications and technologies. These themes will ensure the workshop focuses on both the theory and application of cyber-physical-human systems. The workshop also includes a poster session in which students and postdoctoral researchers will present their current research. The feedback and mentoring of their research from leading experts in the field will tremendously benefit these young researchers.

There is a great deal of variation in the strength of the social infrastructure used by engineering education researchers to collaborate and build research projects of sufficient depth and diversity for true systemic change. In this project, relative social infrastructure strength is grouped as follows: those researchers who are connected to a department of engineering education; those who are connected to a center or other non-department, formalized group on their campus; and those who have neither connection. Any combination of access types may be present on a single campus. The purpose of this project is to discover and implement evidence-based social infrastructure elements that meet the needs of the third group while maintaining the integrity of the department- and center-based infrastructure. These researchers are often located in their universities in capacities that are highly intertwined with the practice of engineering education; finding better ways to network and support them creates stronger ties between research and practice, facilitating systemic and lasting change. <br/><br/>Using the social movement organizing methodology of relational meetings, the investigators will conduct a series of interviews with engineering education researchers who are connected with centers or departments those who are not, and their practitioner colleagues to identify areas of common concern, resources each can contribute to change agent networks, and opportunities for strategic intervention around which the engineering education change movement can build power. Through two phases of the research root cause analysis will be applied to the problems of faculty reward structures and diversity in engineering; working at the level of structural economic forces in higher education in the first case, and racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of structural inequality in the second case, will guide strategies and interventions to produce lasting, significant change and address problems at their source. This approach will further the research on change in engineering education by understanding faculty behavior as grounded not only in personal motivation and institutional reward structures but also in current economic and policy frameworks for higher education. The results of this project will identify mechanisms to strengthen engineering education networks. Of particular importance are those researchers currently working in the field who are not strongly connected to those networks. Broad-based and widespread change will occur through modifications to communities' infrastructure and leadership development that support both the engineering education researchers and practitioners."

The Marine Operations Department of the School of Oceanography of the University of Washington takes great pride in providing essential marine science research and educational facilities to NSF-funded investigators. The University of Washington remains committed to managing these facilities in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner.  The ship is the newest ship to join the U.S. Academic Research Fleet.  The R/V Rachel Carson will operate under the UNOLS RVSS safety standards as a UNOLS Operating institution. <br/><br/>Oceanographic vessels, operated by the UNOLS academic institutions and funded by NSF, and other agencies, have been the traditional multi-use facilities required to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. These ships working from the ocean's surface complemented by human-occupied, robotic and - more recently -- autonomous undersea vehicles and sensors, along with aircraft and satellites, continue to provide vital tools in our understanding of the role of the oceans in determining our climate and in studying and accessing the living and non-living resources of the world's seas and sea-beds.<br/>Proper stewardship over ocean resources and their wise use, and decision making for future ocean- and coastal- related issues are inconceivable without an interested and engaged citizenry.<br/>In addition to technology, our national ocean endeavor requires technical support in the form of expert human resources, with sound science, mathematics and technical education: a critical mass of individuals who will collect and analyze tomorrow's data, and design the tools, models and applications we will require. Provision of these sea-going research and educational facilities enables marine scientists and students from the University of Washington and other institutions nationwide to study natural phenomena - and to instruct the future scientists and stewards of our marine ecosystems - on board state-of-the-art oceanographic research vessels complete with laboratories, sensors, analytical equipment, communications to shore-side investigators and educators, and full life support for extended missions. Essential to UW's mission is the provision of educational opportunities-both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach programs such as REVEL, ""Teacher at Sea,"" to K through 12th grade students, nationwide. Periodically, The University holds open houses and outreach events to provide a learning experience for local students including tours through the ship facilities and hands-on demonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ships' crewmembers. In 2011, the School of Oceanography hosted the International Research Ship Operators conference at UW. The School of Oceanography hosted the UNOLS Research Vessel Operators Committee annual meeting at UW. During the conference, participants enjoyed the opportunity to tour and ride onboard for a ""lunch"" cruise from the Seattle waterfront, through the Ballard Locks, to the Oceanography Dock. The University of Washington, with the support of the National Science Foundation and with coordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, remains dedicated to, and focused upon, furthering mankind's understanding of the world ocean, the living and non-living resources therein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty percent of our citizens who live within fifty miles of the shoreline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transformation of the sheet into a useful component typically occurs in multiple steps, with the part transferred from one forming die to the next, progressively obtaining a more complex shape. While these multi-step processes enable the creation of complex components, they also increase the cost due to the number of dies and presses needed. Also, from a scientific point of view, the multiple steps cause repeated loading and unloading of the materials, which is very challenging to model in a computationally-efficient way. This research aims to create a material model suitable for repeated loading and unloading, to enable science-based process and die design, minimize the number of necessary steps, reduce waste and thus enhance the competitiveness of American manufacturing. Since the automotive industry is one of the major users of multi-step sheet forming, this research will also enable the use of modern, difficult-to-form steels and aluminum alloys in auto-bodies, yielding safer and environmentally friendlier cars. The work will be performed in collaboration with 2 Korean universities (whose work is funded by the Korean National Research Foundation), and this collaboration will allow access to equipment and expertise not otherwise available in the US. Graduate and undergraduate students and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) participants and their students will benefit from the industrial focus of this project, as well as its international dimension.<br/><br/>To provide industry with a robust and computationally-efficient material model suitable for severe strain-path changes, including repeated loading and unloading, this research will: 1) create a unique machine for biaxial tension/compression of sheets and perform multiaxial plasticity experiments, 2) use this dataset to evolve the recent (2011) Homogeneous Anisotropic Hardening (HAH) plasticity model and create the extended-HAH one, to capture the experiments, and 3) conduct multi-step forming experiments and simulate them with the extended-HAH model, to further inform its evolution and validate its performance. Two families of materials, advanced high strength steels and aluminum alloys, will be investigated in this research, both of which are of interest to various weight-sensitive applications, but have widely varying responses to severe strain-path changes. Beyond the specific forming processes studied here, the creation of a robust and computationally-efficient material model to describe severe strain-path changes is expected to benefit the modeling of all multi-step plastic deformation processes in industry, as well as low-cycle fatigue and cyclic plasticity."

The research objective of the project is to test the hypothesis that introducing bio-binder to asphalt binder can change the phase structure within asphalt binder to produce bio-modified binder (BMB) with desired rheological and surface characteristics.  Desired characteristics are an increase in BMB's adhesion strength and stress release rate, and a reduction of its viscosity at corresponding temperatures.  This in turn can improve pavement sustainability in several ways: 1) an increase in adhesion strength between binder and aggregate can reduce moisture damage in pavement, 2) an increase in binder's stress release rate can reduce low temperature cracking in pavement, and 3) a reduction in binder viscosity can facilitate use of reclaimed asphalt pavement and recycled asphalt shingles in paving mixtures.  It is hypothesized that when bio-binder is added to the asphalt binder, bio-binder molecules penetrate into the asphalt binder's matrix changing its chain conformation and molecular packing.  The interchain interactions between the long alkyl chains of the bio-binder and those of the asphalt molecules' side chains hinder the stacking of the aromatic cores of the asphalt molecules improving asphalt's properties.  Molecular dynamics simulations will be implemented to study how the two materials interact and how their interactions impact rheology, aging and adhesion characteristics of the bio-modified binder.  <br/>This project opens a new paradigm in asphalt material characterization and modeling, enabling an integration of chemistry and mechanics while enhancing pavement sustainability and revolutionizing waste management practices for better environmental protection. It will offer a simultaneous approach to sequester carbon and address problems associated with manure management while improving pavement sustainability and enhancing U.S. economic competiveness by reducing dependence on petroleum resources.  The broader impact of the project will be further expanded by reaching audiences ranging from university educators to industry practitioners, farmers and K-12 deaf students to achieve educational goal of the project including 1) enhancing students' knowledge in the area of sustainable pavement and 2) providing professionals and decision makers with the scientific rationale underlying the use of bio-binder."

The PI has conjectured the existence of new structures that govern their shape (mathematically speaking their topology), which he will investigate in more detail. The second topic relates to lattices of high dimension. These are a topic of interest in modern cryptography; on the other hand, a satisfactory mathematical theory of them is not yet available, and this project aims to develop such a theory.<br/> <br/>More specifically, the PI has formulated a conjecture that specifies the values of ""periods"" of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces -- i.e., the numbers obtained by pairing homology classes with normalized differential forms. This conjecture is interesting because it suggests a relationship between these homology groups, and certain motivic cohomology groups. The PI will study this conjecture and attempt to give evidence for it. Concerning lattices, the PI will study in particular the following questions: What is the diameter of the space of n-dimensional lattices, how do the short vectors in a typical n-dimensional lattice behave, and why does the LLL lattice reduction algorithm behave so well? A basic tool will be the analysis of automorphic forms on GL(n) for large n, and the PI will also study related questions about automorphic forms in the high-dimensional limit."

In animals, the circadian clock is composed of a network of neurons within the brain, each of which expresses a highly conserved molecular clock.  The proper function of this network and communication to downstream brain regions is critical for human health and psychological well-being.  The research program supported by this award seeks to understand how the clock network of the brain produces an endogenous sense of time and how it communicates with downstream brain regions to orchestrate daily behavioral and physiological rhythms. The objective of this project is to determine the neurophysiological basis of circadian clock output in the brain of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, an organism that has consistently enriched our understanding of biological timekeeping in animals.  The studies will address a fundamental mystery in the neuroscience of circadian timekeeping and could help guide efforts to alleviate the negative metabolic and psychological consequences of human circadian dysfunction created by our modern around-the-clock society. <br/><br/>The broad goal of this investigation is to understand the neurophysiological basis of circadian clock output in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. The work will take advantage of both well-established neurogenetic techniques and newly emerging live imaging methods for the experimental investigation of clock neuron output in Drosophila. These latter methods make possible the measurement of Ca2+ and cAMP dynamics in central brain networks during the acute excitation of genetically defined classes of CCNN neurons. The specific objectives of this project are to identify the neuronal targets of the CCNN, to determine the roles that specific neuronal oscillators within the CCNN play in the control of feeding and metabolic rhythms, and to develop new genetic tools for the examination of neuronal class specific contributions to clock controlled outputs. These experiments will significantly advance our understanding of how the CCNN modulates the brain centers controlling behavior and metabolism and represent a shift in the experimental approach to clock output in the animal brain. The specific aims of this project are: To determine the functional connectivity between the CCNN and established endocrine, sleep and locomotor centers of the brain; To determine the neural basis the circadian modulation of feeding and metabolism by the CCNN; To conduct a undergraduate-led screen for enhancer-trap flippase elements yielding CCNN sub-class specific GAL4/UAS expression for the focused visualization and manipulation of specific clock neuron subsets.  Furthermore, the principle investigator will develop educational and outreach activities to introduce students of various ages to molecular and behavioral neuroscience that incorporate modern genetic tools and teach the fundamentals of experimental design and interpretation."

A critical component for machine learning is mathematical optimization, where one uses historical data to train tools for making future predictions and decisions.  Traditionally, optimization techniques for machine learning have focused on simplified models and algorithms.  However, recent revolutionary leaps in the successes of machine learning tools---e.g., for image and speech recognition---have in many cases been made possible by a shift toward using more complicated techniques, often involving deep neural networks.  Continued advances in the use of such techniques require combined efforts between statisticians, computer scientists, and applied mathematicians to develop more sophisticated models and algorithms along with more comprehensive theoretical guarantees that support their use. In addition to its research goals, the institute trains Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows in statistics, computer science, and applied mathematics,  and hosts interdisciplinary workshops and Winter/Summer schools.  <br/><br/>The research efforts in Phase I are on the analysis of nonconvex machine learning models, the design of optimization algorithms for training them, and on the development of nonparametric models and associated algorithms.  The focus is on deep neural networks (DNNs), mostly in general, but also with respect to specific architectures of interest.  The institute's research efforts emphasize the need to develop connections between state-of-the-art approaches for training DNNs and statistical performance guarantees (e.g., on generalization errors), which are currently not well understood. Optimization algorithms development centers on second-order-derivative-type techniques, including (Hessian-free) Newton, quasi-Newton, Gauss-Newton, and their limited memory variants.  Recent advances have been made in the design of such methods; the PIs' work builds upon these efforts with their broad expertise in the design and implementation (including in parallel and distributed computing environments) of such methods.  The development of nonparametric models promises to free machine learning approaches from restrictions imposed by large numbers of user-defined parameters (e.g., defining a network structure or learning rate of an optimization algorithm).  Such models could lead to great advances in machine learning, and the institute's work in this area also draws on the PIs expertise in derivative-free optimization methods, which are needed for training in nonparametric settings.<br/><br/>In this TRIPODS institute, the PIs approach all of these research directions with a unified perspective in the three disciplines of statistics, computer science, and applied mathematics.  Indeed, as machine learning draws so heavily from these areas, future progress requires close collaborations between optimization experts, learning theorists, and statisticians---communities of researchers that, as yet, have tended to operate separately with differing terminology and publication venues.  With an emphasis on deep learning, this institute aims to foster intercollegiate and interdisciplinary collaborations that overcome these hindrances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, seismologists have recognized that subduction megathrust faults undergo slip in episodic ""slow slip events"". Prior to the discovery of slow slip events in the last decade, our paradigms of fault slip were focused on seismic slip in major earthquakes. Since the discovery of slow slip, most studies have focused on deep (>20-40 km depth) slow slip events, but we now realize that shallow slow slip events (<5-15 km depth) exist that are much more accessible to near-source investigations. These shallow slow fault slip events are centered beneath the ocean so onshore instruments have not been able to measure how much surface deformation occurs. This study takes advantage of planned International Ocean Discovery Program drilling to install sensors in two boreholes that will measure properties indicative of change in the shallow crust that the episodic fault activity causes.  Senior researchers in borehole instrumentation will mentor mid-early career scientists, passing along extensive knowledge of such complex implementation and research. Japanese, New Zealand, and German collaborators will participate with the US investigators in this international study, and local communities will benefit from scientist outreach associated with cruises off New Zealand. This study is being undertaken as a ?community proposal?, whereby all data will be immediately publicly available.<br/> <br/>The shallowest, well-documented slow slip events on Earth occur at the northern Hikurangi margin, offshore Gisborne, New Zealand, at <5-15 km depth. They recur approximately every 1-2 years, with slip on the plate boundary interface of up to 15-20 cm. The unusually close proximity of the Gisborne slow slip events to the seafloor, the large slow slip event magnitudes (equivalent to an earthquake magnitude Mw ~6.3-6.8), and short recurrence intervals makes this the ideal setting for evaluating the near-source hydrological, geochemical, and thermal response of the offshore subduction margin to large, frequent, well-documented deformation transients. The borehole observatory data will clarify the role that fluid pressures, fluid flow, and temperature play in the occurrence of slow slip events, as well as the influence of slow slip event deformation on fluid and geochemical cycling within the forearc. This project will establish the borehole facility and set-up open data access. Analysis of the first two years of data, recovered by ROV, will evaluate the deformation, hydrological, and geochemical responses near the source of slow slip, as well as document the thermal regime of shallow slow slip. One of the borehole installations will target the region surrounding the shallow portion of the megathrust fault , while sensors in a second borehole will target the over-riding plate ~5 km above the slow slip event source."

The amount of information that should be kept secure is increasing with the proliferation of high-tech electronics such as smart-phones, tablets, and wearable devices. Accordingly, the number of attacks from malicious parties to obtain the secret information that is stored in a secure (i.e., encrypted) device increases. Side-channel attacks are widely used to extract information from an integrated circuit (IC) or a smart card by observing different leakage sources such as power consumption, timing information, temperature, electromagnetic (EM) emanations, and acoustic waves while loading/executing/storing information. Due to the low cost and potentially non-invasive nature, side-channel attacks pose a serious threat to the security of personal, commercial, and military information. By providing design guidelines against side-channel attacks, our project benefits companies, governments, and individuals in securing the digital information.<br/><br/>This project investigates the power and feasibility of combined side-channel attacks including both physical side-channel attacks (i.e., power, timing, and electromagnetic) and fault injection attacks. Since each attack vector leverages a different leakage mechanism, the countermeasures against different attack vectors may differ significantly. Accordingly, mathematical foundations of combined countermeasures against multiple attack vectors are developed. In this project, the existing resources are utilized as a countermeasure against combined attacks together with dedicated countermeasures to minimize the energy and performance overheads of security. This project provides several opportunities to underrepresented groups and undergraduate students to engage in hardware security research.<br/>"

Changes in tropical forest productivity in response to drought are an important feedback in the carbon cycle; yet, we currently have a very incomplete understanding of how biomass, productivity, and species composition of these forests respond to changes in temperature and water availability.  This project will take a new approach to understanding tropical forest drought responses by focusing on the relationships between plant functional traits, metabolic scaling theory, and climate drivers.  Functional traits are easily measureable metrics that allow us to better predict plant growth, reproduction, and forest change.  Metabolic scaling theory describes the relationships between the size of an organism, its growth rate, and temperature.  This project will attempt to significantly advance our understanding of how tropical ecosystems respond to changes in temperature and precipitation. Researchers will use scaling theory to provide a predictive framework that links forest responses to drought with well understood plant traits measured using novel ground and remote sensing technology.  <br/><br/>This project will assess changes in productivity in response to drought, as well as tree mortality and forest dieback.  This will be accomplished using both field measurements as well as pre-existing LIDAR and hyperspectral remote sensing data from forests across an elevation gradient in the Peruvian Amazon.  Specifically, researchers will use a suite of plant functional traits to provide detailed, 3D maps of forest canopy structure and the spatial distribution of traits.  The novel scaling theory developed with these data (Trait Driver Theory, TDT) will then be used to predict ecosystem function from changes in trait distributions over time in response to drought.  The project will also involve a field experiment to simulate drought with throughfall collectors to help parameterize TDT model functions.  The TDT results will also be compared to predictions from the ecosystem demography model ED2.  Model code, images, and algorithms will be made available in public repositories, and any new plant functional trait data will be added to global databases.

Instead of limiting cavity losses the usual way by reducing the size and number of passages through which light can escape, the cavity's design produces destructive interferences that, when light is allowed to escape, the multiple waves that do so through different passages end up canceling each other. Discovering new principles that enable novel optical properties is crucial for the progress of photonics, the science of light. Applications of these systems include novel light sources for communication, sensing and imaging. This fundamental and experimental work will study the creation of those sources using engineered and nanostructured materials. The novel sources satisfy many requirements of photonics devices including small footprint, low power consumption and enhanced light-matter interaction.

BIC devices, especially sources, can be designed and implemented by engineering the decay channels of light in photonics systems using symmetry considerations.  BIC offer a new paradigm in building unprecedented photonic cavities, sources and systems with unique optical responses.  Applications of these systems include novel light sources with intriguing polarization singularities, surface lasers, sensing, and chip scale communications.

These constraints are often imposed by real-world data, but it is frequently the case that the relevant data is not completely known to the agent performing the optimization; it is natural to model such settings using probability distributions associated with the data. In such analyses, the constraints associated with the optimization problem are now themselves ""stochastic,"" and a standard goal is to maximize the likelihood of satisfying all the constraints while incurring minimum cost. (As a motivating example, an airline may wish to operate as few flights as possible while ensuring that with 99% probability, no passenger is bumped.)  Apart from modeling uncertainty, optimization with stochastic constraints also provides a way to succinctly model constraints whose standard description is very large; design problems in voting theory, where there are very many voters, are examples of this kind.  This project studies both of these kinds of problems, called stochastic design problems, from a unified new perspective based on techniques from computational complexity theory. The project also trains graduate students who will achieve fluency both in complexity theory and in optimization, and will promote cross-disciplinary activities between operations research and theoretical computer science. <br/> <br/>The motivating insight which underlies this project is that Boolean function analysis -- a topic at the intersection of harmonic analysis, probability theory, and complexity theory -- provides a useful suite of techniques for stochastic design problems. The investigators will study two broad topics. The first one is on chance-constrained optimization:  In problems of this sort, one is given a set of stochastic constraints and the aim is to satisfy all the constraints with at least a certain fixed threshold probability. While previous work on such problems has typically achieved computationally efficient algorithms by relaxing the actual set of constraints, the investigators will focus on algorithms which exactly satisfy the original given set of stochastic constraints. This line of work will address the chance-constrained versions of fundamental optimization problems such as bin packing, knapsack, and linear programming. The second broad topic is that of inverse problems in social choice theory:  Game theorists use so-called ""power indices"" to measure the influence of voters in voting schemes. A basic algorithmic problem is to design efficient algorithms for the inverse problem, in which, given a set of prescribed power indices, the goal is to construct a voting game with these indices. The investigators will study questions such as (a) to what extent is a given voting scheme specified by its power indices? (b) what is the complexity of exactly reconstructing an unknown target voting game given its power indices? (c) when and to what extent is reconstruction possible in a partial information setting?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Small hibernators, such as ground squirrels, survive the winter by falling into deep bouts of torpor, in which vital physiological rates and metabolism are reduced dramatically and body temperature drops significantly. Torpor is punctuated throughout hibernation by periodic arousals, in which animals re-warm to normal summer body temperatures, and restore body functions. As part of this dramatic cycling, hibernators naturally experience reduced blood flow and depleted oxygen supply (hypoxia) to tissues. Such disruptions in blood supply and resulting hypoxia can be lethal to non-hibernators, including humans. By examining how hibernating ground squirrels survive low oxygen levels in critical tissues such as the brain, this project expands our understanding of strategies for cellular energy production in all mammals, and may highlight new avenues for therapies associated with low oxygen conditions in the brain, such as stroke. Specifically, the investigators examine a signaling pathway hypothesized to sense low oxygen conditions and initiate a response that suppresses cellular energy production. To evaluate the function of this signaling pathway in a natural hibernator, the investigators examine metabolism and hypoxia tolerance in 13-lined ground squirrels, and compare the sequences of key genes among mammals. The project also furthers the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and making scientific discoveries available to the general public:  the project includes training of undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and public outreach via a center for community health improvement and a public zoo.<br/> <br/>One of the many physiological mysteries of small-bodied hibernators is their marked tolerance to severe hypoxia, which occurs during rewarming arousal from deep torpor bouts. The goal of this project is to identify mechanisms that support hypoxia tolerance of hibernating ground squirrels in normally hypoxia-sensitive tissues such as the brain. In non-hypoxia tolerant species like mice, damaging or lethal hypoxia is mediated in the brain by an acute increase in the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which inhibits the electron transport chain. This project uses in vivo, in vitro and in silico approaches to examine the hypothesis that the brain cells of deep hibernators are able to metabolize H2S, and that this innate ability underlies their survival of severe hypoxic events. This study addresses three specific objectives in the brain of 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). The first aims serves to determine the seasonal responsiveness of ground squirrels to inhaled H2S, in comparison to rats. The second aim serves to track H2S production and metabolism during hypoxia exposure in isolated mitochondria and neurons. The third and last aim serves to evaluate selective pressures on the key genes of H2S production and metabolism within the rodent lineage. It is expected that the proposed studies will advance our knowledge of the biochemical and physiological adaptations that allow hibernators to tolerate cerebral hypoxia."

Each student will attend workshops and training programs developed by the project leads. SURGE investigators will conduct project evaluation and assessment of their workshops, training, and mentorship projects. Results from evaluations and assessments will be presented at STEM and disaster-related conferences and published in peer-reviewed academic journals."

The world is rapidly losing biodiversity, and understanding how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem services is important for human well-being. Most attempts to do this have used experiments in the field and laboratory. Natural communities, in which ecosystem services are provided, rarely look like experiments. Scientists acknowledge this, but it has been hard to study the effect of biodiversity loss on ecosystem services in the real world, in large part because of limitations in the analysis of complex natural communities. In this project, the researchers will use a new method that overcomes previous limitations to analyze some of the world's largest data sets, with the goal of understanding what aspects of natural communities are needed for ecosystem services. For example, is it enough to have many individuals of a few species, or do we need many different species to provide ecosystem services? This research will provide society benefits through a better understanding of how biodiversity influences ecosystem function, which could have relevance for science policy. Additionally, data and coding from the project will be made available to the public. <br/><br/>Knowledge of what drives ecosystem services at large scales is rudimentary, and the widespread belief that species richness is necessary for ecosystem services in natural systems is more of an assumption than an established fact. This project will use a novel and powerful analytical approach, based on the Price equation from evolutionary biology, to determine the importance of biodiversity to multiple ecosystem services. Specifically, the Price equation partitions differences in ecosystem services into three additive terms: richness, composition, and context dependence (which includes abundance variation as well as environmental factors). The PIs will compile the largest and most complete publicly-available data sets, and use them to conduct a synthetic analysis. The research will determine: (1) the relative importance of richness, composition, and context dependence in producing the mean levels and temporal variance of ecosystem services, (2) the role of spatial and temporal scale in ecosystem functions, and (3) the extent to which data from the worlds' largest biodiversity-function experiments align with results from ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These unusual properties stem from the synergistic effect of metallic bonding and the glassy structure. Despite the impressive suite of properties, barriers exist to the adoption of metallic glasses into application, including failure in tension and high material cost. Adoption of metallic glasses into wide application could be made possible if brittle fracture could be understood and controlled. This Early Career Faculty Development (CAREER) Program research project will contribute to these efforts by uncovering the mechanism of ductility observed in nanoscale samples and harnessing the advantages of size reduction (lower cost, enhanced plasticity, and ease in fabrication) in novel applications. The research efforts will be integrated with comprehensive education and outreach activities. A new summer-enrichment program, for the first time in the region, will provide exposure and tools to the underserved population of students with special needs, to promote a successful career in engineering disciplines. The results and materials from this project will be disseminated through web-based services, public exhibits, conferences, and journal publications.<br/><br/>Size-dependent transitions from shear-localized (brittle) to homogeneous (ductile) deformation can eradicate the fundamental weakness of metallic glasses. However, the existence and the mechanism of such size effects themselves have been difficult to discern due to processing artifacts (irradiation damage, variation in thermal history, and noncompliant sample geometry) and low yield of existing nanomechanical tests. This award supports fundamental research to decouple the effects of sample size and processing on deformation of metallic glasses. This will be achieved by devising high-throughput fabrication and mechanical testing methodologies for irradiation-free nanoscale specimens (compression and tensile). Statistically significant and unambiguous data obtained from these experiments will allow verification and refinement of existing models for plasticity in nanoscale metallic glasses. The benefits of size-effects will be utilized in unique applications such as electrodes for sensing, micro-needles for drug delivery, and conductive tips for scanning probe microscopy. The overall research plan is designed to stimulate a paradigm shift in metallic glass research from bulk to small-scale by demonstrating its impact on the fundamental and applied science."

The pace of data production and its complexity mean that a large amount of data is often not adequately analyzed by the data producers, and thanks to its rapid dissemination, the broad community is participating in its analysis. This model, however, carries a risk of neglecting the input of the original data creators, as attention shifts to data integrators and analyzers. The current paradigm of information dissemination and assigning credit in science, based on peer-reviewed publications and formal acknowledgment of third-party contributions in the form of citations, is biased toward high-profile, well-known scientists and research centers who participate in the latter stages of knowledge creation and dissemination. We propose to use unbiased internet searches to identify uncredited use of datasets and resources in research literature, allowing data creators and researchers participating in early stages of data creation to claim credit for their work. Using machine-learning and text-mining techniques, the PI seeks to extract relevant information from noisy results of general-purpose search engines and develop easy-to-use interfaces for public use of such resources to supplement official bibliometric resources.<br/><br/>Acceptance and citation biases have a significant impact on careers of researchers outside the central foci of funding and publications, which are also typically places with more-diverse research forces. First, the probability of rejection in peer review is significantly biased against less-famous scientists and those at less-research-intensive institutions. These biases are less likely to affect data creation as databases typically accept data without peer review and the value of data can be measured by its use. The same biases affect number of citations, where people tend to cite more-famous, established scientists, or cite reviews that are often invited and only leading scientists would have been invited to write the review. As a result, both publications and citations are heavily biased toward already-recognized scientists that represent less-diverse populations, both in personal terms and in terms of the institutions where they work, as compared to the general population of scientists. Such biases affect careers and ability to obtaining grant funding for young scientist operating outside of the tight collaboration networks at best research institutions and creates a classical rich getting richer and poor getting poorer loop. The new internet-based information exchange paradigm has already had a profound effect on researchers? ability to getting their results in prominent, public view. This proposal aims at approaches that would further alleviate publication and citation bias, not by addressing it directly, but by developing more openways of evaluating contributions to science."

This award supports research and education that uses data-centric methods to enable the prediction of metal oxide compounds with desired properties. Hydrothermal synthesis is widely used to create new metal oxide materials with a wide range of functional properties and applications.  This project will advance the field by developing software infrastructure for associating the results of X-ray diffraction experiments with individual reactions, extracting structural outcome descriptors from this data, and then determining the extent to which these structural outcomes can be predicted from reaction description data.  This will be achieved by developing structural outcome descriptors for geometric properties, non-covalent interaction properties, and electron-density properties, then building machine learning models that correlate these outcomes to reaction conditions, and finally testing the quality of these predictions experimentally.  Active learning and auditable and interpretable models will be incorporated into the workflows to help synthetic chemists select better (more insightful/novel) reactions in an interactive fashion."

These autonomous systems will be tasked with missions such as search, rescue, surveillance, reconnaissance, mapping, farming, fire fighting, and transportation. Future autonomous systems will operate in unfamiliar areas with minimal or no human interaction for prolonged periods of time. The luxury of building prior detailed maps of these environments could be (1) prohibitive (e.g., disaster areas), (2) impractical (e.g., signal landscapes and congested downtowns), or (3) economically not viable (e.g., hospital buildings and national forests). With no human-in-the-loop before or during operation, one expects future autonomous systems to (1) possess full situational awareness and (2) gather sufficient information about their environment. These two tasks need to seamlessly integrate into the overall mission of the autonomous system. Current autonomous systems are far from possessing these capabilities, and the current analytical tools are insufficient to deal with this emerging class of problems.<br/><br/>This project will develop a coherent analytical foundation and a suite of algorithms and tools for autonomous systems deployed in unknown, dynamic stochastic environments to optimally gather sufficient information to successfully accomplish their mission. The research specifically considers autonomous systems with limited sensing, computation, actuation, and communication capabilities. This research will study a new class of information optimization measures, which possess desirable convexity properties (enabling real-time execution) and separability properties (enabling near-lossless distributed implementation among agents). This research aims to establish fundamental relationships between performance and computational complexity in the presence of varying degrees of environmental uncertainty. These relationships will enable principled navigation of these complex trade-offs, leading to autonomous identification and adoption of the optimal information gathering strategy. <br/><br/>This project has a vertically-integrated education plan spanning K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students.

Self-driving cars are predicted to annually prevent 5M accidents and 2M injuries, conserve 7B liters of fuel, and save 30K lives and $190B in healthcare costs associated with accidents in the U.S. Successful mission pursuit of such fully autonomous CPS hinges on possessing full situational awareness including precise knowledge of its own location. Current CPS are far from possessing this capability, particularly in dynamic, uncertain, poorly modeled environments where GPS coverage may be spotty, obscured, or otherwise impaired. This necessitates developing a coherent analytical foundation to deal with this emerging class of CPS, in which situational awareness and mission planning and execution are intertwined and must be considered simultaneously to address uncertainty, model mismatch, and compensate for potential GPS coverage gaps.<br/><br/>This project is has four main objectives: (1) Analyze the observability of unknown dynamic, stochastic environments comprising multiple agents. This analysis will establish the minimum a priori knowledge needed about the environment and/or agents for stochastic observability. (2) Develop adaptation strategies to refine the agents models of the environment, on-the-fly, as the agents build spatiotemporal maps. Adaptation is crucial, since it is impractical to assume that agents have high-fidelity models describing the environment. (3) Design optimal, computationally efficient information fusion algorithms with performance guarantees. These algorithms will consider physically realistic nonlinear dynamics and observations with colored, non-Gaussian noise, commonly encountered in CPS. (4) Synthesize optimal, real-time decision making strategies to balance the potentially conflicting objectives of information gathering and mission fulfillment. This investigation will enable autonomous CPS to navigate complex tradeoffs, leading to autonomous identification and adoption of the optimal strategy. <br/><br/>This research has far-reaching impact- it will evolve autonomous CPS from merely sensing the environment to making sense of the environment, bringing new capabilities in environments where direct human control is not physically or economically possible.

While researchers have published numerous studies on underrepresented groups over the past four decades, trends have not significantly improved, suggesting a disconnection between research and practice and a greater need to investigate the issue of broadening participation at every major segment throughout the education-to-workforce pathway. As a result, the investigators propose to conduct a research project that critically examines the Innovation Cycle of Educational Practice and Research as it relates to broadening participation in engineering and computer science. This study will advance our understanding of the disconnect between research and practice, identify barriers to progress, and set a national agenda for broadening the participation of African Americans in engineering and computer science. The agenda will unify the current literature on this topic, frame key issues, and pose significant questions around the development of a diverse engineering workforce. Aligned with current NSF broaden participation interests and priorities, this agenda will provide: (1) researchers with a backdrop for identifying problems that can be investigated empirically; and (2) practitioners with practical strategies for addressing barriers present in their local context. <br/><br/>The research design, guiding this study, will enable us to synthesize the plethora of existing recommendations, while obtaining feedback from researchers, practitioners and other stakeholders alike. The research design will also serve as a model for subsequent studies on broadening the participation of other underrepresented groups in STEM. Further, to readjust current practices for addressing this persistent problem and figure out what is pushing students away, this project involves systematically reviewing the theoretical and scientific literature on barriers to participating and proposing new solutions for each juncture of the education-to-workforce pathway; interviewing subject-matter experts (n=60) to discuss their professional experiences regarding broadening the participation of African Americans and what can be done to gain momentum in African Americans participation in engineering; and conducting a Delphi study (n=20) to reach consensus on the key issues and gaps in our understanding, significant questions, and breakdowns in the Innovation Cycle of Educational Practice and Research.

For example, wave- or dispersive-type equations display this kind of behavior. These evolution equations provide the possibility of constructing solutions from prescribed initial conditions. In some evolution processes, a prescribed restriction (or boundedness) over time is given and the question is then whether the boundedness property persists forever or whether some sort of ""unboundedness"" can arise (e.g., a freak wave suddenly appearing in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics). These evolution processes are fundamental in nature, yet we are still in the infancy of their full analytical description. This project seeks to shed new light on the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE), in particular, of dispersive PDE for which the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with linear evolution. A special emphasis will be placed on the study of singularity formation, such as collapse and blow-up. The principal investigator's research program starts from advancing the theory of collapse for the simplest models in nonlinear wave equations, proceeds by expanding this theory to more generalized models and equations, and then goes on to explore the dynamics of solutions for simple dispersive systems, which have hitherto been studied little but which describe important models in the physical world. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop singularity theory for dispersive systems like the Davey-Stewartson system. These equations arise in physical contexts such as the description of water waves or acoustic waves, and in various fields such as laser optics and fluid and air dynamics.<br/><br/>This project will advance the frontiers in the theory of nonlinear evolution equations, in particular, improving our understanding of collapse phenomena. It will produce a rigorous analytical description of concentration and aggregation for physical applications in real life. This work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen interinstitutional ties, for example, between the George Washington University (GWU) and Howard University. In addition, the project will provide mathematical training and educational experiences at all mentoring levels, reinforcing future US competitiveness.

These activities will occur at the middle school level through the DC Math Circle program; at the high school level through the GWU summer precollege program (which annually recruits over two hundred students nationally); at the undergraduate level by engaging the principal investigator in the supervision of senior research theses and her serving as a mentor and  guest lecturer at the GWU ""Summer Program for Women in Math"" ; and, finally, at the graduate level by organizing the DC Grad Camp, with the emphasis on attracting female and underrepresented minority students."

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Moreover, complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. The primary aim of the efforts of the PI is to further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. <br/><br/>The PI will advance the understanding of the behavior of holomorphic maps between bounded domains in higher dimensional complex Euclidean space. In the field of several complex variables, there have been many deep investigations into when holomorphic maps extend continuously to the boundary, the behavior of iterations of holomorphic maps, and the properties of the biholomorphism group of a bounded domain. The standard approach to studying these problems uses methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This part of the activity will enhance knowledge about the biholomorphism group of complex manifolds, connections between the boundary of a domain and its complex geometry, the iterations of holomorphic maps, continuous extensions of holomorphic maps, realizations of Hermitian symmetric spaces, and the complex geometry of certain smooth quasi-projective algebraic varieties."

The original focus was on simulations of cultural arts and helping students discover ""heritage algorithms"" for new virtual designs. Now, the investigators wish to expand CSDTs to include computational activities into Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and other social motivations such as civic engagement and environmental concepts. CSDTs has now been simplified which allows students use of a programming platform to explore culturally-based STEM topics and share their code through an online user community. The students will learn how to program and apply their ideas to computational aspects of culturally relevant science tasks.<br/><br/>The primary activities will be carried out at Albany high school in New York with 2,214 students, 70% of whom are Black and Latino. Twenty undergraduates from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Engineering and Science Ambassadors program will be paired with 10 teachers who teach two sections of the same STEM+C course each day. This creates a comparison research study wherein the experimental and control groups are reasonably well-matched and can be evaluated with confidence. Thus, a total of about 500 students will be engaged annually. Secondary activities will use after school and summer learning programs for broader dissemination through the 4th Family that is a nonprofit organization reaching students at Schenectady High, Troy High, and Green Tech Charter High. Further, it engages these high school students in peer to peer outreach to middle and elementary schools as well as community accessible events such as the New York State Black and Latino Youth Summit. In the last 3 years, this group has reached a total of about 2,000 students. If the culturally sensitive hypothesis is supported by this research study, learning modules that are ""networked"" across other disciplines to enhance social relevance will show higher rates of propagation, more sophisticated computational thinking, and better correlation with independent measures of STEM engagement and performance among underrepresented students than learning modules that lack relevant attributes."

In the physical, biomedical, and environmental sciences, metal nanomaterials are well-known to absorb and concentrate light through plasmonic effects. The energy from surface plasmons has been shown to power a variety of novel chemical, thermal, electrical and mechanical phenomena. This project addresses recent observations of plasmonic interactions in liquid-dispersed metal nanoparticles onto which weak magnetic fields are applied. Results from this study explain how the energy of plasmons is transferred to their surrounding environment, and thus relate to profound environmental, biological, and physiological effects. Interdisciplinary and data-intensive research activities provide versatile technical training for future science professionals. The principal investigator is also actively engaged in teaching in New York City public high school College Now! programs, mentoring high school students who have successfully advanced to the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, and organizing a new discussion-centered Research Conference in Hong Kong, with the aim of accelerating and disseminating knowledge of plasmon energy transfer.<br/><br/>Technical description: The project is centered on understanding the longer-lived light-induced changes in plasmonically-absorbing nanofluids, particularly those that result from the simultaneous illumination of low-intensity light and static magnetic fields. The formation of vapor around nanoparticles is studied, and the dynamics of the vapor-encased nanoparticles are imaged, enabling transformative analytical models of the multi-phase hydrodynamics. The dovetailed study of the near-field and far-field behaviors is essential for designing future optical probes and interpreting the optical response of nanofluids.  The principal investigator also characterizes the novel thermophoretic, thermoelectric, and electrokinetic behavior of bulk nanofluids by analyzing the near-field behavior of plasmonic 2D substrates surrounded by liquids. The wide analysis and approach may pinpoint elusive and anomalous behaviors associated with plasmons to explain the observed critical nucleation of dissolved gasses in liquids on plasmonic surfaces, which is currently not understood."

The success of nanotechnology for a wide range of applications relies on the existence of suitable nanolithography and nanopatterning approaches. The limitations of conventional fabrication methods in terms of resolution, 3D patterning, and lack of flexibility for soft and novel materials have motivated the development of new methods. This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a NanoFrazor --a unique tool for rapid-fabrication of nanostructures and nanodevices with extreme resolution and high versatility. Fundamental research using this technology for 3D patterning with sub-10 nm resolution and high writing speeds has the potential to bring transformative applications in nanoelectronics, nanomagnetism, nanophotonics, catalysis and biomedicine. The NanoFrazor will be broadly accessible to researchers at City University of New York (CUNY) and Columbia and will serve to catalyze new interdisciplinary research collaborations.  Housed in CUNY's Advanced Science Research Center, it will provide research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are from underrepresented or low-income families, and hands-on activities for the general public. <br/><br/><br/>The NanoFrazor is a unique tool developed for researchers who need access to topographical and chemical patterning of arbitrary nanoscale geometries of non-conventional materials including polymers, 1D materials such as nanotubes, 2D materials, and biomolecules such as proteins. Even 3D nanopatterns can be fabricated in a single step, with the unmatched precision of 1 nm. Further features include mask-less patterning and marker-free overlay/stitching, in-situ simultaneous writing and imaging for closed loop lithography, high speed (mm/s), and large areas (104 cm2). The NanoFrazor is primarily designed for topographical patterning of resists that evaporate when they are heated by the hot nanotip. However, this MRI project will implement in the NanoFrazor other types of thermal lithographic methods extending its capabilities. For example, this award will enable the recent thermochemical nanolithography (TCNL) method, which utilizes local heat to change the chemistry of surfaces, to be implemented in the NanoFrazor to advance potentially transformative fundamental research on (i) nanopatterning polymers to create complex patterns and gradients of proteins for stem cells differentiation and neuroscience studies, (ii) controlled nanoscale doping of 2D materials for electronics and optics applications, (iii) magnetic domains patterning for spintronics studies, and (iv) nanopatterning nanotubes for single molecule sensing applications."

While it was described as a new renal hormone secreted into blood by the kidney to consume adrenaline and thereby lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate, no convincing demonstration of this activity was ever made. Based on a recent discovery by the principal investigator, it appears that the true function has nothing to do with blood pressure.  Renalase instead appears to be a salvage enzyme that prevents the loss of a molecule at the heart of metabolism in all living organisms.  This molecule has a tendency to alter its structure in a way that makes it useless in metabolism.  Renalase prevents the accumualtion of the inactive molecules, saving or salvaging them, by turning them back into the correct, active structure.  This function for renalase involves unprecedented enzyme chemistry that is likely to be found to be pervasive, utilized by many if not all forms of life. The intent of this award is to establish a foundational understanding of this curious new chemical activity.  As new enzyme chemistry, the investigation of renalase will be an excellent platform to teach graduate students about enzymology.

The methods employed will use a combination of rapid-mixing pre-steady state spectrophotometric kinetic techniques, structural elucidation of substrate analog and product enzyme complexes, numerous biophysical approaches that take advantage of the spectrophotometric reporting power of the enzyme's cofactor and site directed mutagenesis of conserved active site amino acids. In addition, Dr. Moran intends to develop an undergradaute laboratory course in which students discover new examples of this chemistry in a broad range of organisms such that the course will provide new avenues of investigation by which the full importance of and context for this activity can be established."

This project proposes an energy-efficient cognitive radio system that addresses its many practical challenges including a low-power wideband radio that operates in multiple frequency bands and a means to seamlessly and efficiently coordinate the operating bands between communicating unlicensed users. The proposed work presents a complete integrated solution, ranging from radio implementation, signal processing algorithm development, and network connectivity. These different layers of abstraction have been jointly optimized to enable a low-power and robust cognitive radio system.<br/><br/>The proposed energy-efficient cognitive radio (CR) system, which is jointly optimized at the circuit, signal processing, and network layers, operates as follows: 1) A secondary user (SU) employs a novel compressed sampling receiver based on polyphase sequences implemented via mixer harmonics to sense concurrently the entire frequency span of interest. 2) Since the communicating band between SUs is unknown, data is transmitted by sending the same signal at low power levels across the entire frequency span of interest while nulling energy in the primary user (PU) bands. A novel sub-Nyquist transmitter, which can be viewed as a dual of the compressed sensing receiver, is proposed for this purpose. 3) The receiving SU uses the same compressed sampling receiver for sensing PUs to receive the SU signals. This is achieved by projecting the received signals to PU's null space, whose frequency locations were estimated during sensing. By appropriately selecting the basis functions set in the analog front-end, most of the received energy can be added coherently. 4) As SU energy is spread across the entire frequency span of interest, the resulting channel impulse response (CIR) is richly scattered. The CIR itself, therefore, can be used as users' signatures for achieving multiple-access communications. Furthermore, by leveraging on techniques from multiuser detection theory, high spectral efficiency can be achieved."

Reproducibility in software engineering research is an important topic, as is evident from the recent establishment of artifact evaluation committees and from publication of papers with conflicting results. Prior efforts to establish reusable artifacts for specific software engineering domains are based on artificial data, are too small, are not uniformly organized, and/or lack extensible infrastructure. This holds the software engineering research community back, hampers reproducibility and comparability, and reduces confidence in empirical results.<br/><br/>This project promotes reproducibility and comparability in software engineering research, through a large-scale database of real software defects and a standardized infrastructure that enables controlled experiments. It enhances an existing prototype (Defects4J) by adding new artifacts, adding infrastructure for labeling and experimenting with the artifacts, and improving usability. Specifically, this project provides (1) the world's largest database of isolated and annotated real software defects, (2) an extensible mining infrastructure that supports automated defect mining and isolation, (3) an extensible experimental infrastructure that also includes a statistics and replication package component, and (4) tutorials and training materials for researchers and educators.<br/><br/>This project advances software engineering research in three ways. (1) It enables researchers to perform more realistic experiments, using real instead of artificial defects. (2) It frees researchers from the burden of (re-)developing an experimental infrastructure, allowing them to focus on research ideas. (3) It fosters reproducibility and comparability by providing reusable artifacts and data sets.  Furthermore, this project advances software engineering education at the undergraduate and graduate level: students can experiment with existing techniques, reproduce published results, or quickly evaluate new ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With these programs, it becomes increasingly possible to use the data generated, such as correct and incorrect problem-solving responses, to develop ways to test for student knowledge and to personalize instruction to student needs. The logs of student responses can capture answers, but they fail to capture critical information about what is happening during pauses between student interactions with the software. This project, led by a team of researchers at Arizona State University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, will explore the use of measurements of brain activity from lightweight brain sensors alongside student log data to understand important mental activities during learning. The study will examine developmental math learning in college and community college students using the ASSISTments intelligent tutoring system. Using brain imaging, the project team will examine whether students are thinking deeply about the problem or mind-wandering during pauses in the learning tasks and use the combined log and brain data to make predictions about learning outcomes. This work will build a foundation for new methods of combining neuroimaging, machine learning, and personalized learning environments. With a better understanding of when and how learning occurs during pauses in tutoring system use, learning technology researchers and developers will be able to create adaptive interventions within tutoring systems that are better personalized to the needs of the individual. This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This project has of three goals: 1) Integrating multiple data streams for the creation of an interdisciplinary corpus; 2) Detecting real-time changes in cognitive states during pauses in log data; and 3) Predicting learning outcomes from brain-based and log-based inferences of cognitive states. In addressing these goals, the team will collect brain data, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging, and behavioral data from controlled, well-understood tasks related to rule learning and mind wandering and from authentic learning tasks. Cognitive neuroscience research involving recordings of brain activity traditionally requires paradigms with highly constrained stimuli, timing, and task requirements, whereas research in complex real-world environments such as tutoring systems rarely align with these paradigms. Features of the brain activity during the cognitive tasks will be used to make inferences about student cognition during authentic learning tasks. In addition, brain features will be combined with log data features to create machine learning models that make accurate predictions of student robust learning outcomes, to be assessed using a posttest given after students use the interactive learning environment. Contributions of this project to STEM learning will include improved understanding of how students build knowledge in response to instructional events within digital learning environments, the construction of better predictive models of when students learn from the use of personalized learning environments, and a mapping between learning processes and the length and context of pauses.

Inspired by recent advances in wireless networking and energy harvesting techniques, the proposed research aims to develop joint sensing task computation and communication framework to achieve green MCS for various sensing tasks. The research project and activities have significant potential to better support newly emerging MCS applications such as healthcare, environment monitoring, traffic monitoring, social behavior monitoring, etc. The research results are expected to inspire other theoretical and systematic studies to contribute to the networking design and energy management aspects of developing energy-efficient MCS.

Observing that the energy consumed in task processing and its distribution correlates to each other, a unified framework to jointly model the energy consumption in computation and communication is proposed to strike a balance between the two to achieve energy efficiency. As renewable energy has emerged as a feasible alternative to the traditional energy sources, it is incorporated in the sensing crowd so as to decrease the on-grid energy demand from sensing devices. Dynamic energy optimization problems are then investigated to minimize energy expenditure in supporting performance-guaranteed sensing tasks, by comprehensively considering time-varying computing resource allocation, renewable energy supply, and wireless channel conditions. Moreover, some sensing devices are envisioned to be capable of transferring extra harvested renewable energy to others nearby, so as to fully explore the vacant energy and computation resources in MCS.

Agris at the University at Albany to develop new methods for the study of RNA molecules, specifically those termed non-coding. RNA is one of several major classes of biopolymers present in living systems where it plays important functions.  One of the best known functions is of information transfer from DNA to proteins in the translation step of gene expression. The RNAs used in this process are called coding (of proteins).  Recently many non-coding RNAs have been discovered although the function of these RNAs has not been identified yet.    The proposal of Rozners and Agris describes a method for the identification of non-coding RNAs that have a double helix structure using peptide nucleic acids (PNAs).  The proposal builds on the recent discovery made by the PIs that single stranded (ss) PNAs can form triplexes with double stranded (ds) RNA that are more stable than triplexes formed by PNA with DNA.  These structures can help reveal more details about RNA and its specific roles in metabolism and cell function and can have a broader impact in the development of new tools for biology and medicine. The project is having a further broad impact by providing balanced hands-on training to several graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary research area, thus preparing these students for technology-oriented future work.<br/><br/>The focus of the research is to develop PNAs, synthetic analogues of DNA, that bind double-stranded non-coding RNA with high sequence selectivity. Most non-coding RNAs fold in double-stranded conformations and molecular recognition of such structures is a difficult problem. Designing small molecules that selectively recognize RNA using hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions has been a challenging process. On the other hand, hydrogen bond mediated base pairing, which is a key feature of nucleic acids, has been underutilized in molecular recognition of RNA. Since the nucleobases of RNA are already base paired in the double helix, the most selective and straightforward sequence readout for ds RNA would be the major groove triple helix formation. Peptide nucleic acid, PNA, forms highly stable and sequence selective triple helices with double-stranded RNA at physiologically relevant conditions. The specific goals of this project are to: (1) study the triple helical recognition of mixed pyrimidine-purine tracts of RNA using nucleobase-modified PNA; (2) study the RNA binding and cellular uptake of PNA conjugated to cationic peptides; and (3) explore the molecular recognition of PNA-RNA triplexes with the goal of using the structural information for future rational design of new and better RNA binders."

The investigation of the fundamental properties and integration of two new defect-tolerant device concepts is proposed, enabled by novel 2D and 3D topological insulators (TIs), that exhibit unprecedented low-power, room temperature performance and functionalities only achievable using these unique materials. This tolerance to defects will enable nanoelectronics beyond the currently known limits and will specifically impact the national grand challenge of enabling ultra-low-power, post-silicon electronics and represent significant progress in an area of national technological strength, semiconductor electronics.  A team of researchers with complementary expertise, including junior investigators complemented by accomplished senior professors, will address the challenges of the proposed work.  This research will also broaden scientific and educational participation by creating a pipeline of pre-college and undergraduate students motivated to study science and engineering at universities through, for example, NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs and collaborations with national laboratories and industry partners.  The researchers will also engage the public through science cafe programs where faculty members present their research in local pubs and restaurants.<br/><br/>This collaborative research team will elucidate the fundamental science and technological implications of new topological insulator (TI)-based nanoelectronic device concepts that can operate at low-power, well above room temperature.

TI growth by molecular beam epitaxy (Hinkle) will focus on 2D Bi and 3D Bi2Se3, which have predicted room-temperature device applications.  Surface and edge state detection and chemical/structural properties will be investigated using in-situ techniques (Wallace).  Theoretical studies including density functional theory (DFT), scattering, and mobility calculations (Vandenberghe) will be employed.  Advanced 2- and 3-terminal devices will be fabricated (Banerjee) and these device characteristics will be evaluated in NAND gates. This research will provide materials and device concepts for advanced low-power, high-performance logic, memory, and even oscillatory neuromorphic applications using TIs, a class of devices which are extremely robust against defects/impurities.   A TI and 2D materials property and benchmarking database through collaboration with NIST will also be established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aims of the research are: 1) deciphering the roles of the non-redundant diglyceride acetyltransferase 1 and diglyceride acetyltransferase 2 triacylglycerol synthesizing enzymes in partitioning of de novo diacylglycerol between direct oil production and membrane lipid synthesis; 2) characterize the role of phosphatidylcholine synthesis enzymes in partitioning of de novo diacylglycerol into different branches of the lipid biosynthetic network; 3) develop quantitative kinetic models for the control of glycerolipid fluxes in Arabidopsis; and 4) explore protein:protein interactions to characterize the molecular components that make up the lipid metabolic complexes that control diacylglycerol fluxes. The above approaches will be combined with computer modeling to produce a quantitative description of the control of metabolite fluxes through the plant lipid metabolic network that can then guide the production of designer plant oils."

Since it is followed by the Cambrian Radiation, one of life's most significant increases in biodiversity and complexity, it has long been thought that these phenomena are linked. Geoscientists have proposed that the GU was caused by large-scale erosion of Earth's crust. As rocks weathered and dissolved, an element critical to life, phosphorous, was released and carried to the ocean by rivers. The increase in phosphorous is proposed to have spurred photosynthesis among cyanobacteria, which then increased the oxygen content of the ocean and atmosphere. This oxygenation was perhaps the fuse that led to the Cambrian Radiation since complex life requires oxygen. Despite the GU's potential role in one of life's most important transformations, very little is known about when and where it occurred. Determining when the GU developed and the size of the last erosion event that lead to its formation are critical for identifying viable mechanisms for life and environmental change during this pivotal interval of Earth history. This research project is making use of advances in zircon and titanite (U-Th)/He methods to decipher GU development. Results are directly testing hypotheses that relate continental erosion to oxygenation and the explosion of life. The project is also advancing scientific and technological understanding through the training of undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 teachers. <br/><br/>It has been proposed that the erosion below the Great Unconformity occurred as the result of supercontinental breakup, Snowball Earth glaciation, or global eustasy, and may have delivered bio-limiting nutrients to the ocean that fueled the Cambrian Radiation. However, the timing, proposed global synchroneity, and magnitude of the Great Unconformity have not been previously tested or constrained. Recent advances in (U-Th)/He thermochronology allow access to the thermal histories required to unravel the history of this iconic feature. This project will acquire zircon and titanite (U-Th)/He data for samples along two transects across two different cratonic margins. Study sites will be targeted to fully exploit Neoproterozoic and Cambrian geologic constraints, which will be vital for narrowing the range of viable thermal histories to enable discrimination between GU formation models. The results will dramatically improve constraints on the Neoproterozoic cooling history of each margin, which will be used to test competing models for GU development and significance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach is based on the use of low cost additive manufacturing or 3D printing processes, and will require advances in areas such as minimum feature size, reconfigurable electronic and mechanical structures, and millimeter-wave frequency circuit design.  The proposed approach of integrating the functionality needed to dynamically reconfigure a mm-wave system directly into the 3D-printed packaging is a new concept, since current packaging technologies predominantly serve only to provide environmental protection with no electronic purpose.  The new structural electronic packaging concept could therefore significantly disrupt the microelectronics packaging industry, as the functional packaging would provide the ability to perform actions such as changing operating frequencies and steering antenna beams in real-time.  The technology could impact important emerging applications such as 5G wireless, the internet of things and autonomous and connected vehicles.  It could also expand into fields such as wearable electronics, bio-electronic devices, and artificial organs. <br/><br/>In addition to training graduate students the project will impact K-12 education by offering training opportunities to high school teachers and students.  Undergraduate students will also be involved through Research Experience for Undergraduates projects and multi-disciplinary Senior Capstone Design projects that are outlined by the industry partner. The principal investigators will continue to emphasize the participation of students from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups in engineering, and include a focus on the attainment of global perspectives and leadership skills as part of their training.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The technical goal of the project is to advance the state of the art in millimeter wave packaging technology by demonstrating new approaches for direct integration of low temperature on-package and on-chip structural electronics. The aim is to study concepts for reconfigurable packaging using dynamic structures that are fabricated using additive manufacturing. Specifically, the research will involve a hybrid, direct print additive manufacturing strategy that combines fused filament fabrication and micro-dispensing to form the package foundation in a conformal manner directly onto the microelectronic device or component. The critical electronic and mechanical features will be defined using pulsed picosecond laser machining with a targeted minimum feature size of 3-5 microns.  Performance goals include variable reactance devices with greater than 5:1 tuning in the upper Ka-band and interconnects with less than 0.7 dB/cm loss in the V-band.  <br/><br/>The proposed work has potential to make significant contributions in the area of functional electronic packaging, which may prove to be one of the most economically and technically important applications of direct print additive manufacturing. To date, no additive manufactured tunable devices have been demonstrated at millimeter wave frequencies. Furthermore, there are no existing packaging technologies that can combine the advantages of low temperature processing, conformal integration and dynamic real-time reconfigurability.  Finally, since the proposed approach is generic in nature it will be broadly applicable to a wide range of microwave/mm-wave communications and sensing systems. The project's industry partner brings expertise in microwave packaging and manufacturing and will play a critical role in steering the investigations to maximize future commercial impact."

Although research from other fields has demonstrated the value of examining the artifacts generated during research and design, there are as yet no ethnographic studies of the day-to-day practices of interdisciplinary teams in engineering education settings and the objects they create and use in those practices. Therefore, this study is significant because it fundamentally advances knowledge of interdisciplinary teamwork by developing a typology of boundary negotiating artifacts (BNAs) in interdisciplinary engineering teams. BNAs are artifacts and practices surrounding them that coordinate perspectives, create alignment between team members from different disciplines, facilitate transmission of information, and allow team members to learn from other disciplines during research and design. The project addresses a significant gap in knowledge about the actual practices and artifacts generated during the course of interdisciplinary design projects. By focusing on the daily, micro-level practices of engineers, a fuller, more accurate description of communication processes emerges than those based on interviews and normative descriptions of engineering work. Characterizing the artifacts that facilitate or hinder collaboration ultimately contributes to engineers' abilities to work with stakeholders from other backgrounds as successful boundary-spanners. This study's contribution is significant because it provides the first research-based educational materials that are designed to improve interdisciplinary design teamwork and communication through the use of an artifacts typology. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are: 1) to characterize the ways in which use and non-use of artifacts facilitates and hinders interdisciplinary teamwork and communication, 2) to develop a typology of models of artifacts created and utilized in interdisciplinary teams, and 3) to design, implement, and assess explicit incorporation of BNAs into interdisciplinary engineering courses at Washington State University and Oregon State University. Understanding the roles and uses of artifacts in interdisciplinary communication requires collecting data through long term, ethnographically-informed methods. Participant observers are collecting ethnographic data from several interdisciplinary design projects. Ethnographic data include observations and interviews with students and faculty members. Based on results from the ethnographic data, a typology of BNAs and their uses is being developed. Organizing the data in this manner allows other researchers and instructors access into the project's findings. Utilizing results of the research, BNAs are being strategically incorporated into engineering curricula to optimize their use and effectiveness. Together, these outcomes build a vital and solid foundation for future research on interdisciplinary communication processes and associated improvement of interdisciplinary design courses."

Peer review is a key site of social construction of knowledge and micropolitics of knowledge production. It serves as a gateway for new knowledge to become part of a field. As an emerging and interdisciplinary field, engineering education research presents a valuable, and timely, opportunity to learn about processes of disciplinary development, and to better understand the micropolitics of peer review in an emerging and interdisciplinary field. Moreover, in engineering education research, the boundaries of the field can have implications for insights that ultimately influence engineering education practices. As a relatively new field, it has been noted that engineering education research remains underdeveloped in some regards, including inclusion of theoretical and methodological approaches from social science fields. However, little research has been done to identify how the boundaries of the field are established and maintained. This study is the first investigation of a large group of engineering education researchers' peer review experiences and editors' perspectives. <br/> 	<br/>The research objective of this project is to identify research normativities and values shaping the emerging field of engineering education research through the peer review processes. The intervention objective of this project is to develop and implement materials targeted to engineering education researchers so that they better understand their field and how it can be advanced in new directions. In-depth qualitative interviews are being conducted with 40 authors and at least 5 editors of the Journal of Engineering Education. Authors include those who have had articles published and those who have had articles rejected, as well as those who fall into both categories. The interviews explore participants' peer review experiences and beliefs about the field's boundaries. Emergent patterns in experiences and beliefs will be used to identify theoretical, methodological, epistemological, and topical normativities that shape the field. These patterns provide new insights into engineering education research, specifically, its dominant values, boundaries, and levels of interdisciplinarity, thus also providing new insights into the social construction of knowledge in an emerging, interdisciplinary field. Based on findings from the interviews, stakeholder-specific workshops are being conducted for different groups: current and future engineering education researchers. These workshops and associated materials are designed to help the engineering education research community critically reflect on and advance the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accordingly, this project examines gendered organizational socialization of newcomer engineers. It begins the long-term work of developing processes of acculturation to the engineering profession that are compatible with intersecting non-normative identities, by creating an empirically-supported and engineering-specific model of gendered socialization. The integrated education and research plan is likely to yield a dramatic impact on the field of engineering education by prioritizing the importance of underutilized gender theories, enrolling men in gender research and systems change, and addressing the gap in research on engineering workplaces. Ultimately, this project facilitates greater equality in the socialization of newcomer engineers to decrease attrition from engineering careers and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. <br/> <br/>The objectives of this project are to develop a theoretical model of gendered socialization in civil engineering workplaces and to create research-based interventions for more inclusive socialization. Mixed-methods data will be collected longitudinally over four years, through twice-monthly Individual Socialization Logs (a new instrument developed during the course of this project) and twice-yearly in-depth interviews with thirty diverse newcomer engineers from around the country. Expected project outcomes include identification and characterization of facets of organizational socialization (e.g., practices, processes, relationships and social networks) that are gendered, including how they are gendered intersectionally (i.e., varying across other types of identity, such as race). The research findings and the model created from them are being utilized to create professional formation materials for graduating civil engineering students and civil engineering professionals. Materials are also being implemented nationally and locally in capstone design courses and workshops for engineering companies. Further, this project contributes, simultaneously, to the fields of engineering education, engineering studies, organizational studies, and gender studies."

According to the proposers, the issues most often cited in reviews of declined federal proposals include the lack of readiness to conceive, justify, and execute complicated projects. The KickStarter technical assistance model will address these issues by developing a ""Readiness Framework"" in collaboration with the HSCCs. The framework will be based on institutional self-evaluation of student support services, industry engagement, and technology and curricular alignment. This framework will guide the development of STEM proposals that demonstrate capacity for project implementation and align with the institutional mission and STEM education goals of the HSCC. The KickStarter team has expertise in building community college partnerships with industry and community organizations, and deep knowledge of and experience with federal grant programs and grant management.

Great successes about graph minors were obtained during recent decades and led to numerous applications to disciplines other than combinatorics, such as theoretical computer science, electrical engineering and biology. However, several problems about graph minors and their strengthening or variations with respect to topological minors and immersions remain unsolved. This project addresses major conjectures in this area. Positive solutions will lead to immediate applications in theoretical computer science and optimization. More potential applications are expected based on fruitful applications of earlier work about graph minors. This project includes plenty of research problems that are suitable for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Topics addressed in this project including graph coloring, Erdos-Posa property, well-quasi-ordering and general structural properties.

Another objective is to prove a relationship between the maximum size of half-integral packing of topological minors and the minimum size of hitting sets, which is a strengthening of Thomas' conjecture on half-integral packing minors. Furthermore, Nash-Williams' conjecture on well-quasi-ordering graphs by the strong immersion relation will be considered. The strategies for attacking these conjectures are proving new structure theorems for excluding a fixed graph with respect to these three containment relations and exploiting tools that were developed in the PI's earlier work and in the literature for solving problems about graph minors."

In this context, quantum symmetries appear, which are best described by group-like objects called tensor categories. Moreover, tensor categories are the language of quantum computation and topological phases of matter. Researchers would like to classify modular categories (a distinguished class of tensor categories) because of their applications in condensed matter physics and quantum computing. In particular, unitary modular categories are algebraic models of anyons, which have applications in topological quantum computing.

Another goal of this project is to understand how the cohomology behaves under standard constructions and use these results to get new examples of Hopf algebras and categories satisfying certain properties, such as the finite generation of cohomology for Hopf algebras and tensor categories, proposed by Etingof and Ostrik. The investigator will explore generalizations of the support variety theory. These are geometrical objects that measure projectivity, in the context of finite tensor categories.

If the agents make their decisions dynamically, in an uncertain environment, the outcome of such interactions can be conveniently described by a continuum-player stochastic dynamic game.  The investigator pursues several research directions, unified by the idea of establishing the game-theoretic models, which on the one hand capture the real-world phenomena with sufficient precision, and on the other hand allow for tractable representations of the equilibria.  Such models can be used to establish quantitative results, i.e., to make predictions about the future evolution of a system, or to optimize the rules of interaction in the system.  The study of such classes of games is motivated by various applications.  As particular cases, the investigator considers models arising in market microstructure and systemic risk.  The results of the project can be used for predicting the potential instabilities in financial markets and for designing effective regulatory policies for financial exchanges and banking systems.  In addition, the class of systems analyzed in this project includes other relevant models in economics, neuroscience, and sociology, resulting in a large array of potential applications that may benefit society.  The educational component of the project includes designing teaching materials, for both undergraduate and graduate students, with stronger emphasis on the novel applications of mathematics to problems of finance and economics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     While there are many abstract mathematical results for constructing equilibria in dynamic stochastic games, these results rely on assumptions that often are incompatible with realistic models.  The investigator considers several classes of large-population games that naturally fail to satisfy the standard assumptions, either due to the presence of stopping times in the agents' strategies, or because of the singular type of interactions between the agents.  In both cases, the standard fixed-point results cannot be applied directly to construct an equilibrium, due to the lack of required continuity or monotonicity properties.  The investigator studies several methods to overcome these difficulties, which lead to mathematical problems interesting in their own right.  This study contributes to the theory of continuum-player games (including, but not limited to, mean field games), optimal stochastic control, and the propagation of chaos.  In particular, this project addresses specific problems in the theory of backward stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection, as well as the questions of limiting behavior of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times.  The results of this analysis provide new tools for equilibrium-based modeling.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project."

In order to do this, children must be able to do two things. First, they must be able to reason about how the world works so that they can understand the causal systems they encounter, such as what causes earthquakes. Second, children must be able to think about their own knowledge and the process of learning so that they will know whether and how to change their beliefs about causal systems. This project seeks to (1) discover how the capacity for belief revision develops in the early elementary-school years, (2) explore how this capacity relates to children's awareness of their own learning, and (3) describe how both of these processes relate to children's interactions with museum exhibits. The research team involves developmental laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania and Brown University and informal STEM learning partners at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and the Providence Children's Museum. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program which funds fundamental research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.<br/><br/>The project involves two lines of research, which study children's responses to different kinds of science puzzles. The first series of experiments are lab-based and vary the information that children observe and the types of exploratory actions that they can take. Children are also interviewed to find out how they think about science and learning. This design is intended to determine how different sets of evidence and different exploratory actions affect children's learning. It also addresses how children's abilities for belief revision may differ between abstract and contextualized causal systems. This line of work additionally investigates when children gain the capacity to revise their beliefs explicitly in the face of counterevidence, linking their scientific thinking capacities to their developing metacognitive abilities. The second series of experiments observes and records children's explorations of and interactions in museum exhibits. Parents and children are interviewed and asked to comment on video clips of their museum explorations. This allows the researchers to examine how naturally occurring behavior in informal learning settings affects children's learning and views about learning. Findings can illuminate how children learn to integrate evidence with their beliefs, which can inform educational policies and practices around the teaching of science. These studies can also advance researchers and museum practitioners' understanding of how museum environments foster children's growth into healthy, independent thinkers and how to support caregivers' efforts to assist children's learning."

Research is conducted at El Verde Field Station, located at El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. The program focuses on Tropical Ecology and Evolution -- the study of plant population biology, stream ecology and aquatic insect dynamics, forest ecology, arthropod biology, and coevolution in tropical rainforest.  El Verde is the base of operations of the program and of many tropical researchers and the Luquillo LTER program.  Students develop independent projects under the advice of faculty mentors, spending most of their time conducting research and attending seminars and workshops on scientific data analysis and techniques to study tropical systems. The program also provides workshops on relevant topics, such as graduate school application process.  A responsible conduct in science component is also provided to discuss issues commonly encountered by students during their careers. Student selection is based on their research interest, academic record, and potential for outstanding research in biological sciences. The project PI makes a short list and mentors make the final selection.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 40 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. This program focuses on students with interest in ecological research and in pursuing graduate studies. Students will learn how research is conducted, many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences, and some will publish their work in peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. Applications are accepted starting in December every year. More information is available by visiting http://reu.ites.upr.edu/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Ramirez at reu@ites.upr.edu)."

On the one hand, the PI will investigate the behavior of waves in space, as they interact nonlinearly with themselves and matter over large space-time scales. The ultimate goal is to explain how the  energy, which is stored in a wave undergoing a nonlinear dynamical evolution, ultimately  splits  into  quantized pieces and a wave ""at the horizon"". The latter refers to energy, possibly of large size, which  is infinitely spread out and does not interact with anything in a noticeable fashion. In contrast with this macroscopic behavior, the project also aims at understanding the behavior of waves on the microscopic scale, such as in crystals or quasi-crystals. The goal is to explain  transitions from an insulating state to that of a conductor, which these materials may exhibit as they undergo changes on the molecular level. Such changes may occur  through the insertion of impurities, or changes in the environment. Both the macroscopic as well as the microscopic behavior of waves is of crucial importance to science and engineering, and profoundly affects our daily modern lives. Modern communication relies on waves transmitted over large distances both in space but also along glass fiber cables. For the latter the properties of the material are crucial and both nonlinear effects as well as aforementioned microscopic phenomena decide the suitability  of the underlying medium. <br/><br/>More technically speaking, the PI intends to further investigate the rigorous mathematical theory of focusing dispersive semilinear evolution equations. A major open problem is to analyze  the resolution of any solution into moving solitons and radiation. Some success has been achieved in recent years on this important problem, but for nonintegrable equations we are far from a satisfactory understanding. The PI is currently involved in the study of this problem in the dissipative setting in which some damping is added to the equation. The Hamiltonian setting appears to be very difficult at the moment, especially in the subcritical regime. The methods involved derive from dynamical systems, invariant manifold theory, and dispersive PDEs. The quantum mechanical problems alluded in the previous paragraph belong to the area of Anderson localization. Together with his long-standing collaborator Michael Goldstein at Toronto, but also with young collaborators which are joining the field, the PI intends to bring the body of techniques which were developed over the past 20 years  based on large deviation estimates, the avalanche principle, semi-algebraic sets, and harmonic analysis such as (pluri)subharmonic functions and the Cartan estimate, to bear on both linear and nonlinear problems in dynamical systems and spectral theory.  Ultimately, the goal here is also to better describe the behavior of wave propagation in disordered media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During and immediately after any kind of disaster affecting the greater public, schools provide communities with access to shelter, food, medical resources, and psychological resources. However, despite the important role that schools play, very little research has been conducted to understand how and why disaster-affected schools differ in their post-disaster recovery patterns. This work will identify factors that may hinder or support school academic recovery after disasters. Findings from this research will position us to advise stakeholders (e.g., school administrators, teachers, policy makers) on the potential trajectory of schools, particularly in areas vulnerable to extreme events. Pre-disaster preparedness and response planning initiatives can in turn be customized to minimize the effects of natural disasters on school academic functioning. The project's interdisciplinary team will disseminate study findings through multiple outlets (e.g., webinars targeted to superintendents in the study area, lectures to pre-service teachers, scholarly papers and presentations). To increase the educational impact of this work, the research team will actively involve and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in research and integrate study findings into multiple courses. <br/><br/>This project has two specific aims: (1) to identify patterns of school recovery after Hurricane Ike and (2) to examine potential risk factors associated with school recovery patterns. To address Aim 1, we will examine patterns of academic recovery among approximately 400 Texas public schools in the path of Hurricane Ike (2008) by examining the pre-/post-Ike periods from 2003-2011. Growth mixture modeling techniques will be used to examine a rich dataset of public school performance outcomes in Texas in order to obtain empirical insights into the landscape of school recovery after disasters. To address Aim 2, we will examine potential risk factors and their associations with school recovery patterns, utilizing a vulnerability perspective. Specifically, we will test the relationship between school institutional infrastructure and socioeconomic and demographic factors and school recovery patterns. We will then examine the role of physical vulnerability in school recovery by mapping spatial clusters of school recovery patterns in relation to location (e.g., school district and county location, coastal location, evacuation zone, urbanized/non-urbanized area) and exposure (e.g., storm surge and flood-zone areas). The methodological approach developed here may be generalized for use after other disasters in other locations. The outcomes of the research are expected to transform future studies of disaster impacts on school functioning and improve cross-study and cross-model examinations of disaster impacts."

Extracting these hidden components is an interesting but challenging problem. This project will address these challenges and include applications to many scientific areas including social networks, text mining, genomics, and genetics. The project will include (a) collection of large social networks data, (b) development of new models, methods, and theory for extracting hidden components in network analysis, text mining, and genome-wide association studies, and (c) a study of knowledge discovery using academic research data such as co-authorship and citation relationships.

The goals of the project include: (1) Development of simple and fast methods for network mixed membership estimation and topic model estimation. These methods, based on nontrivial modifications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are easy to implement and can handle very large data. (2) New methods and theory for detecting and estimating rare and weak effects in GWAS.   Problems related to optimal ranking of genes in the presence of complex correlation structures and detection of weak spikes in large covariance matrices will be considered. (3) A study of social network structures of scientific researchers.  The PI and her collaborators will collect meta-information from published articles in representative statistics journals to understand social network structures and other features of the statistics community.

The investigator will create computer programs to model the observations of the atmospheric structure and composition of those planets near to Earth in size, or super-Earths. These programs will be used to study the characteristics of atmospheres, focusing on their temperatures and pressures, of many different types of super-Earths. The investigator will make these programs broadly available to other scientists to use for their research. This project serves the national interest as it helps our scientific understanding of the properties of planets around other stars that are similar to the Earth, and which could harbor life. The investigator will also teach special courses for students with a low level of STEM preparation, and create a peer mentoring program for STEM students coming from backgrounds that traditionally are not represented in these fields, to fight lower success rates in STEM classes at her home institution.<br/><br/><br/>The investigator will build a set of computational tools that will be broadly applicable to modeling the radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry for low-mass exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. The research will first complete the development of Exo-RT, a robust radiative transfer (RT) suite of codes that will calculate atmospheric structure (temperature-pressure profiles), emission spectra, and transmission spectra for transiting exoplanets. The key improvement of this RT suite over existing codes is its inherent ability to model atmospheres of arbitrary atmospheric composition, making it ideally suited toward modeling a diverse set of super-Earths. The fully developed code will then be applied to a number of studies of super-Earth atmospheres, determining the extent to which the attributes of a super-Earth can be inferred from observations of its atmosphere and measurements of its bulk density. Atmospheric studies of super Earths are a key science motivation for future exoplanet investigations with the James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based 30-meter class telescopes. At her home institution, Grinnell College, the investigator will also implement a spatial reasoning course for students with a low level of STEM preparation, and a peer mentoring program for STEM students from traditionally underrepresented groups, to combat lower success rates in STEM classes."

By doing so this project will increase the impact of NSF's prior and future investments in engineering education research. Researchers and educators will work together to develop a shared understanding and language around how engineering education research can influence educational practice. This will enable them to effectively articulate the impact of their work to diverse audiences and more carefully plan broad impacts for their future work. The results will provide a basis for future studies on better indicators and measures for assessing impact at the project level and across funding programs as well as directly impact current engineering programs.<br/><br/>This project is engaging the global engineering education community in creating a valid research impact framework for the field of engineering education that is inclusive of researchers and practitioners' perspectives on impact; and describing practitioners' insights on the role of research in engineering education practice. In an environment of increased accountability, engineering education researchers are being asked to identify the tangible impacts of their work on a regular basis. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of scholarship within and beyond engineering education on how to characterize the impact of research. A shared understanding among engineering education researchers and practitioners of what research impact looks like for this field lends itself to conversations on how engineering education research can influence practice. The engineering education research impact framework resulting from this study will draw broadly upon the perspectives of practitioners and researchers as well as existing research impact frameworks developed by other disciplines, including health sciences and science in general. As such, it will be robustly relevant across a wide range of engineering education research and practice activities. Workshops, interviews and recruitment procedures ensure representation of perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders and experts. The methodological approach to achieving the project goal adapts an instrument development procedure for framework development and validation, and will serve as the basis for a follow up study of an impact assessment. Because this project seeks to broadly and comprehensively define impact in the context of engineering education research, the resulting definition will extend beyond esoteric scientific impacts such as journals and academic communities to focus on the social impacts of engineering education and related research. Workshops engage a large number of community members in development, which positively impacts awareness, quality, robustness of usability/applicability, dissemination, buy in, and helps develop consensus in the community around impact. Additional efforts and interviews will ensure representation of practitioner perspectives in the resulting framework, even if these groups do not attend the engineering education conferences. This work may also inform initiatives around broader impacts in other engineering disciplines and across NSF."

However, the complex relationships between the states (that is, the patterns,<br/>pathways, and mechanisms underlying how policies actually diffuse from one state to another)<br/>are not well understood. In this research, the PIs develop innovative tools and<br/>data to facilitate the large-scale computational and data-intensive study of policy diffusion. They<br/>seek to develop and utilize the largest database on states' decisions to adopt policies to better<br/>understand which states are policy leaders, which are policy followers, and why. This will<br/>provide a novel, expansive, and systematic view of the policy diffusion process that covers the<br/>American states.

It will also<br/>leverage these new data to map and analyze the network pathways according to which policies<br/>diffuse (i.e., establish states that are leaders and followers in the diffusion of policies). As<br/>recently published research by the principal investigators shows, cutting-edge computational<br/>methods can be applied to large databases containing information on when policies were adopted<br/>by which governments in order to identify underlying networks along which policies persistently<br/>diffuse. Another key contribution from this research is to improve upon the existing method for<br/>inferring network ties in ways that are most suitable for policy diffusion research (as well as<br/>social science more generally) and implement it in a user-friendly package in the R statistical<br/>environment. A final contribution, which is intended to maximize the potential user-base of these<br/>data and methods, will be to build an interactive online portal to the data, complete with<br/>visualizations and automated analytics."

With the abundance of available observations, traditional statistical methods under the parametric assumption that a model can be characterized by a pre-specified number of parameters become inadequate and less attractive. Bayesian nonparametric models are attractive in this context which allow the resolution level of the analysis to be determined in a data-driven manner, and provide automatic characterization of uncertainty. The goal of this project is to develop new theory, methodology and computational tools for Bayesian nonparametric inference via Gaussian process priors. <br/><br/>Given the availability of massive data, nonparametric inference offers an attractive framework for flexibly modeling the underlying structure and extracting useful information. For instance, such challenges occur in chemical physics, computational biology, computer vision, engineering, and meteorology. This project aims to lay down a solid methodological, algorithmic, and theoretical foundation for nonparametric inference based on Gaussian processes. In particular, Gaussian process-based approaches tend to be vulnerable to data contamination and have heavy computational costs. To alleviate the high-computational cost of Gaussian process inference procedures, the investigator puts forward two novel computational frameworks which differ at their respective approximating targets as being either the prior or the posterior. To enhance the robustness of Gaussian process inference against data contamination, the investigator proposes a novel class of Bayesian hierarchical models for incorporating this extra measurement error structure, leading to a class of robust Gaussian process inference procedures. The new theoretical development offers valuable insight to experiment-design practitioners into the impact of measurement errors upon prediction and estimation, and provides evidence on the deep connection between computational complexity and statistical learnability. These computational and theoretical frameworks also benefit other disciplines such as applied mathematics, computer science and finance where stochastic processes such as Gaussian processes are routinely used.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
