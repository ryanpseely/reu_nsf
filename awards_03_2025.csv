Wireless communications are simple and easily deployable; however, the range of frequencies available for existing techniques is currently limited to below 300 GHz, thereby not accommodating future growth as devices using the same frequency may be talking over each other. The terahertz (THz) frequency region (from 300 GHz to beyond 1 THz) is located beyond where typical radio equipment typically operates and such high frequencies are particularly suited for these challenges as it not only offers more bandwidth but a larger usable frequency range. Because the wavelength of THz waves is shorter than that of lower frequency radio waves, highly directive beams that are less sensitive to obstacles can be obtained. The aim of this project is therefore to develop new technologies utilizing the terahertz frequency region to obtain high speed and highly directive data transmission between a transmitter and a receiver, using dynamic obstacle avoidance. In addition, water vapor from the atmosphere absorbs light at certain THz frequencies; the use of a widely tunable source of THz will enable the choice of a specific propagation range. The low divergence of THz beams, combined with this tunable propagation range, can drastically limit the eavesdropping and detection probability therefore creating very private communications links. In addition, these techniques would also enable high-speed wireless connections across challenging terrains and into remote areas.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop two key devices that allow efficient and reconfigurable THz communication links: an amplitude modulator and a spatial light modulator. An amplitude modulator operating at THz frequency is critical to obtaining any sort of data transmission; however, the use of a spatial light modulator is only necessary if one wants to achieve reconfigurable beams (i.e., dynamic beam steering for tracking the detector, or obstacle avoidance). By combining these two devices with state-of-the-art THz sources and detectors, communication links at high data-rate with an intrinsically limited range will be demonstrated. To achieve high speed modulation of a THz field, the free carrier concentration in a low doped (and highly transparent in the THz) semi-conductor such as high-resistivity silicon, will be electrically modulated. The fabrication of such a modulator will require the use of conductive and THz-transparent electrodes using materials such as graphene. The spatial light modulator will be designed using micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS), where wavelength scale movable mirrors will allow for a full phase front control of the THz beam, thereby allowing the dynamic shaping of the transmitted THz light to avoid obstacles (e.g., using bottle beams). Finally, the two devices will be combined to demonstrate two communication datalinks: an indoor link with obstacle avoidance (<10m) and an outdoor link with high directivity (>100m). These two demonstrations will show the relevance of THz technologies for the future of wireless communications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mobile technologies such as smartphones promise broad treatment access, but it is unclear how treatment effectiveness may vary across populations, neighborhoods, and environments.

Alkynes are a class of compounds containing a carbon-carbon triple bond. They have inherently high potential energy, which means they can undergo chemical reactions that are more energetically (thermodynamically) favorable than for the functional groups present in many other types of organic chemicals. This reactivity is perhaps most familiar in the form of an acetylene (ethyne, the simplest alkyne) torch, which gives off considerably more heat than, say, methane (natural gas) when combusted with oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water. This energetic driving force can be used to design reactions using more complex alkynes to fuel the formation of reactive organic intermediates that undergo further reactions to give structurally interesting new molecules. These scientific advances have the possibility of opening new avenues for synthesis of compounds of value to other researchers engaged in the discovery of new compounds that have beneficial societal impact (e.g., pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or electronic/photonic device components). The student researchers who will engage in these studies will gain valuable skills from which they will launch their own careers. <br/><br/>Dr. Hoye and his research group at University of Minnesota will capitalize on the potential energy housed by the alkyne functional group in designed organic reactants to serve as the thermodynamic driver to allow access to transient reactive intermediates. In addition to several ongoing investigations of aspects of triyne to benzyne conversion (the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder or HDDA reaction), they will exploit a recently discovered, two-alkyne-to-carbene reaction. Furthermore, unknown transformations of alkynes to produce, for example, nitrenes, highly strained ring systems, and cyclic 1,2-dienes or 1,2,3-trienes will be explored. The discovery of new reactions will continue to be the most important 'products' to emerge from this program. New and fundamentally important mechanistic knowledge will be produced in parallel with the synthetic advances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The set of points with complex coordinates which satisfies a fixed system of equations gives a geometric object is called an algebraic variety. The classification of algebraic varieties is the main motivation of the PI's field of birational geometry. On the other hand, arithmetic geometry is the study of polynomial equations whose coefficients are integers. This allows more tools from number theory to be used to study the corresponding varieties. The field of arithmetic geometry has recently seen an explosion of new techniques leading to spectacular progress. The PI's research on this project will apply these new techniques to problems in birational geometry which were previously out of reach. The educational component of the project involves several initiatives designed to increase access to a career in mathematics. This includes creating a summer school introducing high school students to mathematical proofs using the Lean proof assistant. <br/><br/>The project centers on interactions between birational and arithmetic geometry. New techniques from arithmetic geometry involving perfectoids and prisms have made it possible to overcome significant difficulties in mixed characteristic birational geometry, mainly related to the failure of cohomology vanishing theorems. These vanishing theorems are the primary method used in inductive arguments throughout birational geometry over the complex numbers, and their replacement in mixed characteristic promises significant advances. The main overarching objective of the projects will be to develop more powerful ways to replace vanishing theorems in mixed characteristic.

This CAREER project is driven by three fundamental research questions: (1) How to balance interpretability and accuracy in high-dimensional time series modeling and inference? (2) How to adaptively select time series models in real time for nonstationary data, while managing uncertainty? and (3) How to efficiently combine information from time series data with varying quality? This project aims to advance the field of time series analysis by developing novel statistical models, theories, and inference methods to address these issues. The results of this research will enhance dynamic network inference, facilitate real-time decision-making, and promote the integration of diverse time series data sources. This project will achieve educational impacts by integrating our research with mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, developing courses, and high-school outreach. Additionally, an interdisciplinary time series seminar series will be organized to promote cross-disciplinary interactions and provide students and junior researchers with exposure to diverse research in time series analysis.<br/><br/>This project will advance time series analysis on three main fronts: (1) develop Granger causality interpretable, recurrent neural network-based high-dimensional time series models to balance interpretability and accuracy; (2) develop an online, distribution-free procedure for adaptive time series model selection in nonstationary settings, addressing uncertainty via conformal miscoverage rate calibration; and (3) introduce new methods to efficiently combine time series data with different granularities and to impute data under general missing patterns. Underlying this research agenda is our overarching goal to tackle challenges due to the high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, nonstationarity, different granularity, and mixed quality and completeness of modern time series data. With an emphasis on statistical inference, we seek novel solutions by integrating existing statistical frameworks (Granger causality, model confidence sets, and factor models) with contemporary ML approaches (RNNs, model predictive control, and transfer learning). The results developed through our project will advance innovation in time series analysis, bridge the gaps between interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and black-box algorithms, and promote the use of time series data collected from diverse sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups may be understood as collections of symmetries, whose study was motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role. Group theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences. In recent years, research in group theory has had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents by providing a way to view an abstract group as a group of matrices, whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems which seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure and representations of certain so-called local subgroups, which reflect numerical information encoded by the group. The award will also support educational activities centering graduate student mentorship and undergraduate research. These activities include local workshops for Colorado-area graduate students and postdocs and a Directed Reading Program. The latter provides a ""research-like"" experience for undergraduates, in which undergraduate mentees and graduate mentors work under the guidance of the PI to study a topic outside of the students? normal coursework. The activities in the grant also include supervising undergraduate researchers, Ph.D. students, and postdocs, who will work with the PI on problems within the scope of the project.<br/><br/>The problems of primary interest in this project are related to variations and consequences of the McKay?Navarro (MN) and Brauer?s Height Zero (BHZ) Conjectures. The PI and collaborators have recently proved the case of the prime 2 of the MN Conjecture, and many of the goals in this proposal are also aimed at establishing strategies for attacking the case of odd primes. In the case of BHZ, which was one of the longest-standing local-global conjectures, the PI and coauthors completed the proof of the conjecture in its entirety, and have been working toward stronger forms of the conjecture. The problems will involve the study of blocks of groups of Lie type, the action of Galois automorphisms on characters of groups of Lie type, and the interaction between the two. Since the effect of various group actions on parameterizations of characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other main problems regarding the representations of groups of Lie type, this is of interest to many other problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such maps have immense statistical power to shed light on dark energy and dark matter, perhaps the most compelling mysteries in modern physics. To reach the full potential of LSST and other upcoming projects, a better understanding of astrophysical processes and observational uncertainties is required. This program focuses on two of the most important astrophysical effects, determining where galaxies form and what shapes they have. Prof. Blazek?s team will pursue several linked themes leading to robust, sophisticated cosmological analyses of LSST data.

Intrinsic alignment (IA) and galaxy bias represent two of the most critical challenges to these measurements. This program combines Blazek?s leading expertise in IA with novel simulation and artificial intelligence / machine learning techniques. Applying a semi-analytic approach to IA and bias on gravity-only simulations will enable production of mock galaxy catalogs in large cosmological volumes with a wide range of IA properties. By developing sophisticated emulation with neural networks, the research will accelerate the process of creating and analyzing simulated galaxy data, providing direct simulation-based modeling. These innovations will enable Rubin-LSST data analyses not possible with existing methods and will broaden the discovery potential of future data through measurements of IA as a cosmic probe.

This leads to interesting and unique transport properties and potential to unlocking a new generation of efficient solid-state energy conversion devices. Results of this project will help gain fundamental understanding of the properties of topological materials, allowing their synthesis with most useful properties and usable forms while preserving their unique attributes. This approach is likely to ultimately enable a new class of efficient energy conversion devices based on strategically designed topological materials. This project also humanizes the fundamental concepts of charge carrier transport through extensive set of outreach and education activities. The research team uses a physical embodiment of charge carrier motion to explain it to a broad general audience and uses creative ways of conveying these concepts and inspiring interest in science.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>While transport properties of topological materials have strong potential for use in efficient solid-state devices, little progress has been made moving towards their use due to challenges in designing and synthesizing topological material in useful forms. Crucial to this progress is understanding the critical length scales over which topological transport dominates, eliminating stray magnetic fields and reducing externally applied magnetic fields, and understanding transport across magnetic phase transitions. This project addresses these gaps using magneto-thermoelectric transport as a probe to gain deep insight into the motion of charge carriers. Magneto-thermoelectric transport measurements uniquely interrogate the interplay between heat, charge, and spin with the electronic structure of the material. The principal investigator uses magneto-thermoelectric transport to tease apart the intertwined transport signatures due to the topological band structure itself from the transport signatures stemming from physical length scales of samples, parabolic bands, and magnetic textures. Results of this work determine the fundamental mechanisms underlying and controlling charge carrier transport in topological materials, informing targeted materials design for enhanced device applications using topological materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional microelectronics face increasing energy demands and shrinking size limits. Spin-based devices, on the other hand, can potentially run with lower power and higher performance. However, managing the direction of electron spins becomes essential at very small scales. To address this, the research team will design oxide crystals with carefully tuned symmetries, enabling spin currents to be generated in the exact orientation needed for switching tiny magnetic bits. By enlarging the pool of materials that can perform this function, the project aims to spark development of more compact, faster, and energy-conscious computing technologies. In addition, an integrated educational component will strengthen undergraduate instruction in materials science and offer lab-based experiences for students, cultivating broader skillsets in next-generation hardware design.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/><br/>This project will systematically investigate the generation of out-of-plane spin-polarized currents in anisotropic oxide thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. The principal investigator will fabricate epitaxial bilayer heterostructures in which a crystalline oxide with strong spin-orbit coupling is interfaced with a magnetic layer capable of detecting and switching in response to spin signals. By controlling substrate orientation and strain conditions, the team will establish precise crystal symmetries that break conventional spin-current constraints, allowing a charge flow to produce a spin polarization component oriented perpendicular to the film plane. The research team will quantify spin-torque efficiency by combining spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall measurements under varied temperatures, film thicknesses, and anisotropic strain states. These data will clarify the role of crystal symmetry in determining the magnitude and direction of spin polarization. In addition, the research will integrate correlated electron states, such as polar or superconducting phases, to uncover new functionalities that arise when out-of-plane spin currents coexist with these effects.

Since most concurrent and distributed programs are designed as a set of communicating components, incorrect communication protocols can lead to difficult-to-debug errors. Choreographic programming is a recent programming paradigm which helps developers codesign computations, thereby eliminating the possibility of errors within communication protocols. Unfortunately, choreographic programs require that all components are programmed at the same time, preventing the use of off-the-shelf software. This project develops open choreographies: choreographies that allow codesigned components to communicate with independently designed programs. This project's novelties are the invention of open choreographies and the development of a method for expressing the protocols they expect of the non-codesigned programs. This project?s impacts are allowing the development of correct distributed and concurrent systems that can integrate into standard software development workflows. This project?s educational impacts include the training of PhD researchers as well as experiential learning and research opportunities through the University at Buffalo?s experiential learning and research program for undergraduates.<br/><br/>In particular, this project develops a new session typing discipline called scheduled session types which describe the protocols of concurrent software. This session typing discipline is then used to describe how the codesigned components of a choreography interact with other components. By proving that every concurrent program that has a session type cannot have any protocol errors, we can then know that any open choreography can interact with independently designed programs without protocol errors. By synthesizing session types from a choreography, we can make this guarantee without the programmer having to understand session types. Thus, programmers can use choreographies to develop concurrent and distributed programs without fear, and without needing to understand arcane new type-theoretic techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

I-CPS is characterized by multiple CPS services functioning concurrently within the same environment, high involvement of domain experts and everyday users in decision-making processes, real-time interactions with other systems, and operation within uncertain and constantly changing physical environments. Examples of such systems include smart cities, smart agriculture, and intelligent transportation, among others. However, stakeholders often hesitate to trust these systems due to a lack of explainability, which raises concerns about reliability, especially in safety-critical areas. Additionally, while advancements in deep learning have enabled powerful CPS capabilities, understanding of these systems is declining. Despite the significance and urgency of enabling explainability for i-CPS, research in explainable CPS with AI-driven components is still in its infancy. This research aims to develop explainable and trustworthy i-CPS capable of justifying their decisions and incorporating field operators? queries and domain knowledge to adapt to evolving environments.<br/><br/>The technical contributions to CPS research and education encompass four thrusts. Thrust I develops a new explainable architecture with formal explainers that interpret individual components of i-CPS and their interactions. Innovations include the first explainable CPS architecture, novel formal methods-based approaches addressing five layers of i-CPS, and explainable online decision support for ?what if? scenarios. Thrust II formalizes and incorporates user domain knowledge, specifications, and feedback to enhance the learning-enabled components of CPS. Key advances include developing new formal knowledge distillation and unlearning approaches with uncertainty quantification that quickly adapt the system to shifting distributions in a lifelong evolving deployment. Thrust III evaluates the proposed methods through a real-world emergency response deployment in Nashville, TN, involving multiple CPS-based city services and stakeholders from different departments. Innovations include a logic-based LLM-enabled system that connects our proposed explainers to field operators, real-world deployment principles, and qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess explainability and impact. Thrust IV develops an interdisciplinary education plan. The key innovation is to bring rigorousness and explainability to CPS classes in Computer Science and create a new course, CPS in the field, for multi-disciplinary students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In natural soils, the breakdown of bedrock controls the amount of phosphorus available. Similar processes are also important for accumulating soil organic matter, which is a major reservoir of nutrients, supporting soil health and capturing atmospheric carbon. As humans expand efforts to accumulate more soil organic matter, they also capture phosphorus, but how phosphorus is involved in soil organic matter stabilization remains a significant knowledge gap. The goal of this project is to understand the role of phosphorus in the stabilization and persistence of soil organic matter. This project will use laboratory and field experiments, spectroscopic, and microscopic tools, to assess the ability of phosphorus on mineral surfaces to bind soil organic matter. The outcomes of this research will provide benefits that support agricultural productivity by providing the basis for future strategies such as targeted plant breeding and soil microbe manipulation that can access the phosphorus within soil organic matter. This research integrates the education goals of improving public understanding of soils and improving soil science education. These education activities will provide continuing adult education through citizen science projects as well as open pathways to careers in science and natural resources for undergraduate students by infusing statistics and data literacy into soil science curricula.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses this central question: what role does phosphorus play in stabilizing soil carbon? To address this question, the specific aims are: 1) Describe the mechanisms by which organic and inorganic phosphorus control mineral associated organic matter adsorption and stabilization by loading common soil minerals with various phosphorus molecules and comparing adsorption of organic matter under laboratory conditions, 2) Determine the phosphorus forms that exist in and relate to soil organic matter in phosphorus-rich and phosphorus-limited ecosystems by performing a series of physical and chemical phosphorus and soil organic matter fractionations in natural soils, and 3) Quantify organic and inorganic phosphorus control of mineral associated organic matter dynamics within phosphorus-rich and phosphorus-limited ecosystems by deploying minerals loaded with common phosphorus molecules in the field. This project will demonstrate how phosphorus acts as an anchor for soil organic matter to stabilize on mineral surfaces, fundamentally controlling soil organic matter persistence, and linking the carbon and phosphorus cycles.<br/><br/>This proposal is supported by the Life & Environments through Time (LET) program, the Ecosystem Science (ES) program and The Water, Landscape, and Critical Zone Processes (WaLCZ) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the advent of high-resolution imaging technologies and biochemistry techniques over the last 30 years has shown this is not the case. In fact, paleontologists have recently made numerous remarkable discoveries of fossilized cells and soft tissues in fossil bones of dinosaurs and many other extinct animals. These discoveries are forcing paleontologists to revise models of fossilization to account for the preservation of biologic molecules in the fossil record. However, it remains unclear how such remarkable preservation occurs, which materials are most resilient to decay, and why. This project will identify which portions of bone material are most resilient to decay both before and after burial. These answers will help paleontologists and archeologists revise models of fossilization and discover new instances of molecular preservation in fossils, and they could also see future applications more broadly in the fields of forensics, historical art conservation, and tissue engineering (such as for wound healing and bone regeneration). In addition, this CAREER award will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of North Dakota in the application of new and cutting-edge analytical techniques. The researchers will also create and run a novel hands-on activity about fossilization with regional K-8 classes and youth STEM camps, and develop a high school biology curriculum module for regional schools which explores the structure of protein molecules. Integration of this research with education activities during this CAREER award will annually serve ~500 K-12 students from rural communities of eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. Altogether, these efforts will bring scientific attention to rural communities of this region, create exciting new research infrastructure and opportunities for undergraduates at the state?s namesake university, and foster broad participation and public engagement with exceptional fossils recovered from the state, such as the mummified dinosaur ?Dakota.? <br/><br/>Through integrating modern trace element geochemistry and proteomics approaches, this research will illuminate how several environmental variables influence initial decay of collagen I, a bone structural protein, after death. Two complementary forms of high-resolution mass spectrometry will be completed on naturally-weathered bones from Texas and Alaska to determine the influences of ambient temperature on the sequence-level decay of collagen. To further explore the importance of entombing sediments on protein decay, the same analyses will also be performed on bones subjected to decay after simulated ?burial? and exposure to flowing, simulated ?groundwaters? in a year-long laboratory experiment. Results from these three complementary projects will clarify relationships between chemical alteration and the sequence-level decay of collagen, which will in turn be used to elucidate preservation mechanisms which can promote the long-term stability of proteins over geologic timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More precisely, the shapes are complex projective manifolds and the linear invariants are Hodge structures. The famous ?Hodge conjecture?, first presented in 1950 at the International Congress of Mathematicians, states that the essential geometry of a complex projective manifold is recovered by its Hodge structure. As one of the Millennium Prize Problems, this conjecture has attached to it a one million dollar prize for a solution. While complex projective manifolds involve a bit of abstraction to define, they are fundamental objects in mathematics and physics; for example, the ?Calabi-Yau varieties? are a certain class of complex projective manifolds which can appear as the small dimensions of the universe in string theory. The main research goal of this project is to study the Hodge structures of Calabi-Yau varieties?to both gain insight into Hodge theory more generally for all complex projective manifolds, and to increase the depth of our understanding of Calabi-Yau varieties. Beyond pure research goals, the educational impact will be to develop an active community of young researchers and PhD students focusing on this circle of ideas.<br/><br/>The project will continue lines of research of the PI on toroidal compactifications of Calabi-Yau moduli. Recent joint work of the PI with V. Alexeev constructs a modular toroidal compactification of the moduli space of degree 2d polarized K3 surfaces. One research goal is to extend this work to hyperkahler and Calabi-Yau varieties, with an eye towards understanding the combinatorial structure of degenerations. Additionally, the project aims to study and prove general results concerning variations of Hodge structure (VHS). Joint work of the PI with S. Tayou is advancing our understanding of finiteness properties of Z-polarized VHS, and it now seems within reach that conjectures of Deligne and Simpson on the algebraicity of the non-abelian Hodge locus can be resolved. The approach is novel, incorporating ideas from hyperbolic geometry. The PI will also pursue results about period mappings for Calabi-Yau variations of Hodge structure, such as questions of boundedness of moduli of Calabi-Yau varieties of various classes, and under what circumstances Torelli theorems hold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Capsules are used in a broad range of technologies including those for medicine, food science, energy discovery, textiles and the like. The fundamental issue that the proposed research will address is how to localize precursors to the polymer shell (monomers and initiators) such that the shell is grown around the liquid droplet, essentially shrink wrapping it. To this end, emulsions will be used as a platform for capsule formation, with droplets of one liquid in a continuous phase of the other (the droplet will become the core liquid). The ability to produce such capsules is important for creating new materials that meet societal needs; for example, capsules with a protective polymer shell and core of a salt hydrate solid-liquid phase change material can be used to passively manage heat, so that air conditioning does not have to be used as often. An important component to consider is that for these capsules to be used multiple times, the shell must be strong enough to prevent leakage but also impermeable so that the composition does not change. Notably, this research can be applied to different core liquids and polymer shells relevant to other applications, such as for carbon capture, pesticide delivery, or additive manufacturing, to name a few. Through this research, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in how to design and implement research; how to collect, organize, and report data; and how to collaborate across disciplines. <br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This proposal addresses the critical need to understand how confinement of initiators and monomers in emulsions impacts the production of capsules and their properties. Limitations to an interfacial polymerization approach are that the liquid core is contaminated and that only a few polymer chemistries can be used, thus restricting composition and performance-related properties such as permeability. To overcome this, the proposed research will (i) use modified particles as both surfactant and initiator for radical polymerization of monomers located in the emulsion continuous phase; and (ii) leverage double emulsions in which the interphase contains monomers to polymerize around the inner droplet. For this purpose, the interface is defined as the zone where two domains touch and the interphase as a self-contained region between two domains (thus flanked by two interfaces).These two distinct approaches are supported by initial results from the PI?s lab and will provide unprecedented control of capsule composition (both shell and core) such that structure-property-application relationships can be defined.  The PI has access to all resources and infrastructure required to complete this work, and the research component is complemented by the training and professional development of undergraduate and graduate student researchers, as well as development of a hands-on module to be incorporated into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Controlling the crystalline and amorphous structures that make up all semicrystalline polymers remains a fundamental issue for developing and optimizing their properties and applications. It is therefore important to understand the crystalline and amorphous structures of semicrystalline polymers. Most previous work focused on analysis of the crystalline structures. In this project, the PI aims at understanding the amorphous structure and the crystalline-amorphous interface of semicrystalline polymers. Using advanced spectroscopic techniques to understand interfacial and amorphous structures together with their crystalline counterparts, and studying dynamical processes, the project is focused on elucidating the crystallization and molecular re-organization pathways of semicrystalline polymers. A successful project will contribute to controlling the structures and properties of semicrystalline polymers and developing novel energy-efficient processing approaches.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The crystallization pathways of semicrystalline polymers have been debated for many decades, partly as a result of lack of understanding of the  amorphous structure in the initial state as well as during the crystallization process. In this project, the PI and his team aim at elucidating the amorphous structure of semicrystalline polymers, making use of structural information obtainable through advanced techniques. 13CH3-labeled poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and 13CH-labeled poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) racemate, which form stereocomplex crystals, are chosen as a model system. The PI will analyze intermolecular distances between PLLA and PDLA and fractions of closely paired racemate in both amorphous and crystalline regions by applying state-of-the-art solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Direct comparisons of the amorphous and crystalline structures will be used to elucidate the crystallization pathway of PLA racemate. In a second thrust, molecular-level information about the reorganization process upon heating of solution- and melt-grown PLLA crystals will be obtained by quantitative analysis for chain-folded structures at the crystal-amorphous interface in addition to crystalline chain dynamics. In both topics, molecular weight effects will be investigated. Ultimately, fundamental understanding of amorphous and interfacial structures will contribute to revealing the crystallization and re-organization pathways of semicrystalline polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that studies the geometric shape of objects defined by polynomial equations. Often, the shape of these objects, called algebraic varieties, reflects the complexity of the defining equations and vice-versa. For instance, from the defining equations, we can understand if the algebraic variety has singularities, i.e., whether the geometric object has sharp points at which the curvature changes abruptly. These points are known as algebraic singularities. This project aims to develop new tools to understand algebraic singularities and apply these techniques to understand algebraic varieties of positive curvature.  As part of the broader impacts of this project, the PI will run online research seminars for graduate students related to the proposed research. The PI will initiate a summer reading program in algebraic geometry for undergraduates. The educational component of this project includes training in algebraic geometry for graduate students. Two summer research schools will be hosted at UCLA by the PI and experts in the field to train the new generation of mathematicians in birational geometry.<br/><br/>Fano varieties are considered one of the three building blocks of projective varieties. There has been a lot of progress towards understanding the geometry of Fano varieties in the last few decades. Nevertheless, the understanding of log terminal singularities (the local analog of Fano varieties) is far from being satisfactory. Complexity is an invariant that allows us to understand how far a Fano variety or a log terminal singularity is from being toric, i.e., defined by binomial equations. In this project, the PI will develop techniques to understand Fano varieties and log terminal singularities of small complexity, for instance, complexity zero, one, and two. There are two guiding principles: understanding the connection between the complexity and minimal log discrepancies (in the local setting) and understanding the connection between the complexity and anti-pluricanonical systems of Fano varieties (in the global setting). The PI aims to apply the former to study the termination of flips and the latter to understand the classification of cluster type Fano varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has six stable isotopes whose ratios allow it to track oxygen content and biochemical reactions in seawater. So far, Selenium isotopes have proven difficult to measure accurately due to their low concentration. This project will develop new methods to measure Selenium isotopes. Water samples taken along a profile across the Eastern Pacific Ocean and from sediments in the Black Sea will be used. These samples have very low oxygen seawater. This low oxygen seawater provides ideal conditions to calibrate the isotopes of Selenium to oxygenation. The project includes education and training in stable isotope techniques in geosciences. Two graduate-level workshops on state-of-the art elemental isotope analysis will be held. Workshops will introduce advanced hands-on techniques and theory for trace element analysis. Also, middle- and high-school students will visit the research laboratory and learn about Selenium contamination in the local environment.<br/><br/>Selenium is a trace element that is both an essential micronutrient and a toxin at relatively low concentrations. It inhabits four oxidation states in surface environments and is comprised of six stable isotopes, the relative abundances of which are fractionated during biogeochemical reactions. Selenium isotope systematics therefore hold great promise for tracking its cycling in nature, including in reconstructions of paleo-environmental conditions using ancient sediments. However, the understanding of Selenium isotope mass balance in the modern ocean remains poor due to a lack of data. This project seeks to develop and refine methods for measuring Selenium isotopes in seawater and marine sediments. The research team will make the first phase-specific Se isotopes along transect through the East Pacific and through recent marine sediment cores with the goal of calibrating modern Selenium isotope mass balance in the oceans for use in reconstructions of paleo-oceanographic oxidation and nutrient dynamics. As part of the project, the team will host workshops for graduate students focused on state-of-the-art mass spectrometry for trace element isotope analysis. The team will also host lab visits for Durham high school students to engage with environmental chemistry research and see how isotopes are used to study coal-ash contamination of North Carolina lakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People think of evolution occurring in geological time, with eras like the Dinosaur Age populated with different organisms from what we have on Earth today. Most studies of evolution, however, look at changes that occur in days or years in organisms that are all around us today. Scientists are realizing that rapid evolution is common and affects all organisms. For example, many agricultural pests in the USA are controlled by predators that attack and kill them, making insecticides unnecessary. Pea aphids represent a great example of this, because they are kept in check by predators. However, pea aphids can evolve resistance to predators. This rapid evolution raises the risk of greater crop damage. Despite their ability to evolve resistance, all the pea aphids do not become resistance to predators. There are also some that remain susceptible, creating a balance between resistance and susceptibility. This project aims to uncover how this balance is maintained, and how agricultural management practices can reduce the risks of agricultural pests becoming resistant. Understanding this balance will help to develop strategies to make US agriculture more resilient and increase the security and sustainability of our bioeconomy. The project will also provide hands-on research experiences to students with no prior experience. Public outreach events will engage farmers to share the results of the research broadly.<br/><br/>The research investigates the ecological-evolutionary dynamics of pea aphids and their parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi. Aphidius ervi was deliberately introduced to North America as a biocontrol agent of pea aphids, particularly to control pea aphids as pests of alfalfa crops. Pea aphids are a leading model for investigating the evolutionary and ecological consequences of symbiosis because all populations harbor heritable symbionts that provide well-documented benefits. The most common and best studied facultative symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, confers resistance against A. ervi. Although evolutionary theory predicts that resistance traits will often be bimodal (either susceptible or highly resistant), pea aphids exhibit a full spectrum of resistance through different symbiont variants. Although the prevalences of different symbiont variants fluctuate (reflecting the intensity of parasitism and selection), the collective of symbionts across the spectrum of resistance appears to be stable. Furthermore, the ecological interactions between pea aphids and A. ervi are stable, in the sense that A. ervi is always present but abundances never get high enough to extirpate pea aphids. This ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions may itself be the product of the evolutionary stability of the symbionts that confer pea aphid resistance to A. ervi. The research will use field experiments, lab experiments and mathematical modeling to examine both the evolutionary and ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions, and whether this stability is generated by the interconnections between evolutionary and ecological dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ability to make sense of our acoustic surroundings relies on the brain being able to recognize patterns and predict what might come next. However, in real-world environments, sounds are rarely perfectly predictable, raising the question: how does the brain track information when patterns are uncertain or incomplete? This research seeks to understand how the brain extracts and organizes auditory information from complex, dynamic soundscapes. The work has broad implications for real-world applications, from improved audio technologies and assistive listening devices to shedding light on auditory processing challenges in specific clinical populations. <br/><br/>The project explores how the brain infers statistical structure from sound sequences, focusing on the way it builds an internal model of the world to interpret and predict auditory experiences. While past research has shown that the brain can recognize predictable patterns in sound, real-world listening often involves incomplete or stochastic sounds, making it unclear how this predictive process functions in natural environments. The investigator uses a combination of computational modeling, behavioral testing, and neurophysiological (EEG) experiments to study how the brain tracks complex statistical relationships and deeper temporal and multi-feature dependencies in sound sequences to guide perception. Individual differences, such as working memory capacity and perceptual sensitivity, are also evaluated for their effect on statistical tracking abilities. The project is structured around two key aims: (1) developing a theoretical framework for statistical inference in auditory processing, supported by behavioral and EEG experiments on structured sound sequences, and (2) examining how the brain integrates statistical information across multiple perceptual features. By building a comprehensive model of predictive coding in the auditory system, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how the brain processes real-world acoustic scenes and inform studies on auditory object perception, sensory integration, and cognitive differences in auditory inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without predictability, even occasional delays or unforeseen behaviors can compromise system performance and safety, which may be unaffordable or catastrophic in many time-critical applications. However, artificial intelligence (AI) tasks and high-performance computing (HPC) hardware architectures often introduce unpredictability in program execution due to their inherent complexity and nondeterministic dynamics. Consequently, managing and mitigating unpredictability becomes a key challenge when integrating and leveraging AI or HPC advancements in real-time systems. This project will address this challenge by developing methods and techniques to preserve time predictability in systems, even when traditionally predictable aspects become unpredictable. This project will produce new system models, scheduling algorithms, analysis frameworks, prototypes, and tools. These outcomes will establish a solid foundation for designing and implementing real-time systems that are highly functional, resource-efficient, and predictably reliable.<br/><br/>This project will serve as a cornerstone for the design, implementation, and certification of next-generation real-time systems, overcoming the limitations of traditional predictability assumptions.

People think of evolution occurring in geological time, with eras like the Dinosaur Age populated with different organisms from what we have on Earth today. Most studies of evolution, however, look at changes that occur in days or years in organisms that are all around us today. Scientists are realizing that rapid evolution is common and affects all organisms. For example, many agricultural pests in the USA are controlled by predators that attack and kill them, making insecticides unnecessary. Pea aphids represent a great example of this, because they are kept in check by predators. However, pea aphids can evolve resistance to predators. This rapid evolution raises the risk of greater crop damage. Despite their ability to evolve resistance, all the pea aphids do not become resistance to predators. There are also some that remain susceptible, creating a balance between resistance and susceptibility. This project aims to uncover how this balance is maintained, and how agricultural management practices can reduce the risks of agricultural pests becoming resistant. Understanding this balance will help to develop strategies to make US agriculture more resilient and increase the security and sustainability of our bioeconomy. The project will also provide hands-on research experiences to students with no prior experience. Public outreach events will engage farmers to share the results of the research broadly.<br/><br/>The research investigates the ecological-evolutionary dynamics of pea aphids and their parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi. Aphidius ervi was deliberately introduced to North America as a biocontrol agent of pea aphids, particularly to control pea aphids as pests of alfalfa crops. Pea aphids are a leading model for investigating the evolutionary and ecological consequences of symbiosis because all populations harbor heritable symbionts that provide well-documented benefits. The most common and best studied facultative symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, confers resistance against A. ervi. Although evolutionary theory predicts that resistance traits will often be bimodal (either susceptible or highly resistant), pea aphids exhibit a full spectrum of resistance through different symbiont variants. Although the prevalences of different symbiont variants fluctuate (reflecting the intensity of parasitism and selection), the collective of symbionts across the spectrum of resistance appears to be stable. Furthermore, the ecological interactions between pea aphids and A. ervi are stable, in the sense that A. ervi is always present but abundances never get high enough to extirpate pea aphids. This ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions may itself be the product of the evolutionary stability of the symbionts that confer pea aphid resistance to A. ervi. The research will use field experiments, lab experiments and mathematical modeling to examine both the evolutionary and ecological stability of A. ervi-pea aphid interactions, and whether this stability is generated by the interconnections between evolutionary and ecological dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Post-mortem execution analysis involves inspecting an execution's artifacts, a collection of states gathered during the execution (e.g., a software log, memory core dump, etc.). The work's key innovation lies in exploiting relationships across different types of execution artifacts to treat them as complements rather than alternatives. The work will pursue three synergistic thrusts: First, it will develop a technique that increases the efficiency of post-mortem execution analyses over ""high-fidelity"" artifacts (i.e., those containing all of an execution's states) by embedding them as ""low-fidelity"" artifacts (i.e., those containing a sparse subset of an execution's states). Second, the work will improve the effectiveness of analyses over low-fidelity artifacts by extrapolating a low-fidelity artifact into a set of high-fidelity artifacts that could have produced it. The work will support probabilistic analyses over the resulting set. Finally, the work will develop a technique for balancing efficiency and effectiveness by automatically navigating the space of execution artifacts that a given application could produce.<br/><br/>The project will enable developers to resolve challenging software issues more quickly, which is increasingly important as society relies upon software in our modern lives. For example, society embeds software into transportation, medicine, finance, and basic human interactions (e.g., dating). In turn, resolving software issues more quickly can save money, limit disruptions, help people find love, and, in some cases, save lives. In addition, the proposed systems and techniques will serve as useful pedagogical tools for teaching students about complex systems and the process of debugging them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rearrangement reactivity of these intermediates is being controlled to form more complex molecules with defined three-dimensional structure. Simple modular routes to generate N-alkenylnitrones and N,O-dialkenylhydroxylamines from readily available reagents are being used to facilitate these activities. This work is targeting improved synthetic efficiency to expand chemical space. Improvements in this area are necessary to support the discovery, accessibility, and study of biologically active molecules, as well as the development of new materials. These activities are also providing training for graduate and undergraduate students to become successful members of the chemical workforce and lowering barriers to students engaging in undergraduate research and considering chemistry career paths.<br/><br/>Improving efficiency to enable rapid access to new molecular targets and expanding chemical space to include new molecular architectures remain two critical needs in organic synthesis to support demands for new compounds with novel properties for medicinal and material applications. The unique reactivity of N-alkenylnitrones and N,O-dialkenylhydroxylamines is being developed to address these goals by providing alternative solutions to synthetic challenges and improving the fundamental understanding of these versatile and unusual synthons to expand the synthetic toolbox of pericyclic and cascade reactions. More specifically, stereocontrol of the new C?C bond forming reactions that these synthetic intermediates undergo is being investigated through the development of: (i) catalytic asymmetric 4pi- and 6pi-electrocyclizations of N-alkenylnitrones for the synthesis of enantioenriched azetidine nitrones and oxazines, (ii) catalytic asymmetric sigmatropic rearrangements of N-alkenylisoxazolines for the synthesis of enantioenriched 1-pyrrolines, and (iii) stereoselective nitrone-templated sigmatropic rearrangements and C?H bond insertion reactions for the synthesis of 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds.

Chemical reactions of accessible sites on a protein with specific labels followed by the use of MS to identify the areas that were labeled helps illuminate protein conformation. Dr. Lindert will perform molecular dynamics simulations to understand how labeling reagents interact with proteins and whether they might induce unwanted conformational changes. Additionally, a web server will be developed to identify the optimal covalent labeling reagents for a given protein sequence. These studies are designed to improve MS covalent labeling measurements, and in this way lead to a better understanding of protein conformation, with potentially broad long term scientific impact in protein conformational/folding studies. If successful, these studies will support work with minimally invasive covalent labeling reagents and support the design of new labeling reagents that do not distort the probed structure.  <br/><br/>The performance and utility of MS covalent labeling measurements would be greatly improved by a better understanding of how covalent labeling reagents interact with proteins and through a systematic understanding of which labels are most suited for a particular protein under investigation. To address these needs, continued computational work that advances covalent labeling measurement science is required. Dr. Lindert?s research is expected to further improve covalent labeling measurements by addressing these current limitations. MD simulations will be used to develop better models of how different covalent labels interact with proteins. The interaction of several commonly used covalent labels with proteins in solution will be simulated before and after covalent attachment, and the Lindert group will explore if and potentially how certain labels distort protein structure or dynamics. Knowledge gained from these simulations has the potential to elevate understanding of covalent labeling measurements. The protein sequence defines possible structural conformations, illuminating which residues may be optimal for labeling in structure determination studies.

In addition, broad outreach activities will be conducted benefiting young scientists.<br/><br/>The first objective is to acquire the first comprehensive data set of ligand-specific efficacies, potencies, and signaling preferences for multiple responses of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to its ligands. This will entail acquisition of dose response curves for a variety of biological responses, yielding information about the potencies, efficacies and preferences of the ligands when inducing these responses. The second objective is to perform the first comprehensive physical-chemical characterization of the self-association of EGFR in the plasma membrane in response to its ligands. EGFR ligand-specific oligomer sizes (orders) and stabilities, and ligand binding coefficients, will be measured. The third objective is to uncover currently unknown correlations between measurable physical parameters and measurable signaling outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this, many important details about where these rays come from, how they gain energy, and how they travel through space are still not fully understood. Unlike neutral particles, such as gamma rays or neutrinos, cosmic rays are affected by magnetic fields in galaxies. This interaction complicates our ability to trace them back to their original sources. This project leverages the IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at the South Pole to examine extensive air showers that occur when cosmic rays collide with the Earth?s atmosphere. The project includes a strong educational component designed to engage high school and undergraduate students in practical physics research. This will be achieved through outreach programs, and with the development of new curriculum modules that focuses on data science in physics. By introducing students to the latest machine learning techniques applicable to particle astrophysics, we aim to cultivate essential computational skills that will benefit them in both academic and professional settings.<br/><br/>This research combines data from IceTop, IceAct, and the IceCube in-ice detector to achieve the first enhanced measurement of cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern hemisphere. Using data from various detection methods the project aims to better understand the mass composition, energy, and arrival directions of cosmic rays. The aim is to seek to deepen our understanding of cosmic-ray physics but it also holds the potential to advance the field of multi-messenger astrophysics and the study of interactions involving high-energy particles using a novel reconstruction framework that employs machine learning techniques to classify cosmic rays based on their mass composition. This award will investigate also high-energy gamma rays in the PeV range, which can travel without being deflected, offering direct insights into the regions where cosmic rays originate. By cross-calibrating among the different detector components, systematic uncertainties can be minimized, while the implementation of new analysis techniques will lead to more accurate measurements of cosmic-ray properties. These advancements will improve our understanding of the transition between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays, providing significant insights into high-energy astrophysical processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A high temperature pressure sensor will be developed. The sensor?s material layers will be designed to optimize sensitivity, refine the device and manufacturing process to enhance performance, and develop a durable package capable of withstanding high temperatures. Once fabricated, the sensors will undergo rigorous testing under varying pressure and temperature conditions to ensure reliability and effectiveness.  This design can directly replace current silicon-based sensors. These new sensors will be packaged and tested at industrial partner?s high-temperature facility.  The project activities will create extensive training opportunities for PhD students and internship opportunities for students visiting from the university partner and other nearby colleges/ universities. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the unmet market need for reliable pressure sensors operating at high temperatures, where traditional silicon (Si) piezoresistive pressure sensors are unsuitable. To meet this market need, a circular membrane-based pressure sensor made of wide bandgap semiconductors, will be developed, which can operate at high temperature due to their wide bandgap suppressing thermal carrier generation.  This will enable the realization of a highly sensitive deflection transducer that can be integrated at the periphery of the pressure sensor element. The intellectual merit of the proposed project is in the development of novel wide bandgap based high temperature pressure sensors with much improved device performance compared to the state-of-the-art Si based piezoresistive sensors, due to several unique design aspects that include: (i) usage of wide bandgap and inert semiconductors that are capable of operating at high temperature and harsh environment, (ii) usage of a novel sensor element with depleted carrier density to maximize deflection sensitivity, (iii) usage of optimized surface passivation layer to reduce charge instability and (iv) usage of bridge network of sensors to reduce instability due to temperature changes or vibrational noise in the sensor output.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plastics are ubiquitous in all aspects of modern life, including food packaging, clothing, health care, and household products.  Plastics production has increased substantially over past decades, and serious attention is now paid to managing plastic wastes, especially recycling and reuse. It has not been feasible, either technically or economically, to achieve a fully circular system. Plastic materials that are not processed for reuse end up in landfills or in other waste processing systems (e.g., incineration) or advanced recycling facilities (e.g., pyrolysis) or are directly disposed of in the environment. In the environment, Micro-Nano-Plastics (MNP) may be generated through incomplete decomposition of the materials. These MNP enter the air, soil, and water environments where plants, animals, and humans may be exposed. The widespread, global use of plastics, including in ocean environments, concerns the public and the research community. There have been reports of MNP being found in drinking water supplies of major cities, as well as in human blood and tissue, raising concerns over potential public health risks. This award will help support scientists and engineers to participate in a conference on ""Micro-Nano Plastics in Water: Characterization, Cure and Prevention,"" which will be held in Davos, Switzerland on July 5-11, 2025. The conference will engage in a multi-faceted exploration of the MNP issue, with an emphasis on finding reasonable solutions.<br/><br/>Conference topics will include history and evolution of the MNP problem, governmental and legislative initiatives, characterization of environmental and human health related MNP, analytical methods of MNP detection, scientific and technological advancements to cure the problem (e.g. source reduction, water/wastewater treatment, recycle), prevention (e.g., packaging changes, material substitutions), circular economy, life cycle analysis of MNP, and global modeling. The full scope of the MNP issue will be addressed, that is: characterization of MNP, cures to mitigate human health and environmental impacts, and preventive strategies going forward. Achieving a circular economy for plastics is being analyzed and debated on the global stage, but it is evident that MNP are widespread in the environment and mitigation of potential risks is a public health priority. The conference will bring together attendees from academia, government research institutes, startups, multinationals, regulatory agencies, financial institutions, and representatives from the plastics industry, highlighting the extensive and interdisciplinary nature of the topic. Collaborations between researchers in academia and relevant partners will be facilitated, as well as how the outcomes can be shared with the broader public. Funding from NSF will be used to support conference attendance of up to 25 U.S.-based graduate students, post-docs, and early career faculty members to ensure that the newest entrants in the field are welcomed into the community.

The synthesis of small molecules is one of the rate-limiting steps across disciplines from materials science to medicinal chemistry. To overcome this bottleneck in the discovery process, we need methodological advancements and improvements to the synthesis design process. The long-term goal of this proposal is to apply computational strategies to synthetic planning to access structurally complex natural products, and in this proposal these efforts are focused on synthesis of diterpenoids. The approach to model development described in this proposal can be applied to any synthetic transformation and would be enabling and thus broadly impactful whenever that transformation?s short-term experimental evaluation is not possible. Moreover, strategic partnerships within and around the Yale community will bring science to K-12 audiences.<br/><br/>The design of a synthetic pathway to a desired molecule is generally conducted by human analysis although computational approaches are beginning to emerge. This proposal outlines the development of several artificial intelligence-based tools to predict the yield of common carbon-carbon bond forming cyclization reactions. Additionally, generative modelling is proposed to design ligands, substrates, and routes to natural products. These computational methods will enable the planning and synthesis of natural products and analogs. High-risk yet high-reward plans are de-risked through the use of machine learning models, thereby allowing efficient and expedient laboratory access to synthetically challenging molecular scaffolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To improve software security, software development best practices recommend that developers begin development with security in mind by following a structured process called ""threat modeling"". Threat modeling is a structured brainstorming process where developers review a system's parts, asking what could go wrong and how they could fix it, identifying threats and mitigations, respectively. There are many recommended threat modeling processes, but it is not clear which are best. Developing guidelines and support for this essential process requires understanding relevant human decision-making and collaborative problem solving. There have been some efforts to study threat modeling practice, but these have either been very expensive or the authors have had to make design decisions that reduce study costs but potentially limit result reliability. This project includes experiments comparing experimental design approaches to assess their effects. This approach will help future researchers design reliable threat modeling experiments while minimizing study cost. The resulting best practices will be shared with threat modeling researchers and incorporated into professional education as well as integrated into courses in security and software systems engineering. <br/><br/>This project will increase threat modeling research reliability by empirically evaluating best practices and tradeoffs for experiment design. Researchers are undertaking qualitative studies and controlled experiments in four areas: (1) investigations of current threat modeling practices in real-world settings, (2) experiments assessing the impact of task design, such as, the level of system specification detail, (3) experiments assessing the study environment's effect, including participants' security expertise, and (4) comparisons of measures used to assess threat modeling performance. The results are being combined into research guidelines for human-centric threat modeling, which can be used as a reference for future researchers to help them develop more reliable results to improve threat modeling practice and software security generally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The framework enables researchers across the social and behavioral sciences to quickly develop, fit, criticize, and adapt complex mechanistic models, overcoming the constraints imposed by traditional statistical methods. Furthermore, the project makes important contributions to open science and reproducibility by providing a freely accessible and transparent interface for researchers to benchmark Bayesian methods systematically and communicate results.

Typically, engineers rely on their knowledge to make assumptions under which the system can guarantee a certain level of performance and safety. However, with black-box learning and increasingly large high-dimensional data, human engineers struggle to understand and formalize these assumptions, which severely limits the effectiveness of validation and monitoring. As a result, CPS systems end up susceptible to rare events, distribution shifts, and other unexpected circumstances ? and are not equipped to respond to these intelligently and safely. This project aims to transform the management of assumptions in learning-enabled CPS by making novel fundamental connections between formal methods, machine learning, and decision-making. Improving our society?s ability to construct higher-performing and safer CPS for unforeseen situations, this project will deliver techniques, tools, and a catalog of typical assumptions that are expected to generalize across many CPS application domains. It will also train the workforce for future CPS in rigorous methods.<br/><br/>This project represents a major step towards building assumption-aware CPS ? ones that behave with an understanding of their own assumptions and limitations. To make these assumptions explicit and actionable, this project will build the mathematical and algorithmic foundation for assumption awareness via specifying, validating, and responding to assumptions behind the closed-loop CPS guarantees. To this end, this project will create an engineering methodology in three sequential thrusts: (1) discovering and representing relevant assumptions of learning-enabled CPS, (2) performing end-to-end validation of these assumptions across offline and online settings, and (3) enhancing decision-making and control to recover from online violations of these assumptions.

For example, genomicists may need to assess thousands of genes using data from only a few subjects, while survey statisticians might analyze average incomes in many towns based on limited surveys. To address these challenges, researchers often borrow information from related questions, a process that requires sophisticated statistical reasoning due to varying underlying characteristics. Empirical Bayes offers a method to enhance individual question inference by sharing information, potentially improving statistical accuracy. However, it relies on strong modeling assumptions, limiting its applicability. This research aims to make empirical Bayes more powerful and accessible by integrating it with modern machine learning and causal inference, demonstrating its effectiveness under fewer assumptions, and developing methods to assess uncertainty more effectively. These advancements will help practitioners utilize empirical Bayes in various scientific and industry contexts without extensive statistical modeling. Additionally, the project will produce a monograph and provide training for students and preceptors on modern data science challenges using empirical Bayes.<br/> <br/> <br/>This research aims to advance empirical Bayes by developing new methodologies and statistical theories to address four key limitations: the assumption of known likelihoods, the treatment of nuisance parameter heterogeneity, the development of nonparametric inference methods, and the integration with machine learning.

Conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen into bioavailable ammonia by microorganisms, a process known as nitrogen fixation, is essential for the sustenance of plant life on this planet. This reaction is mediated by the ?iron-molybdenum cofactor?, or ?FeMoco?, which resides within these organisms, and enables breaking of the remarkably strong dinitrogen triple bond. A paradigm shift came this century with the realization that nitrogen fixation at FeMoco occurs via intermediates containing iron-hydrogen bonds; i.e. iron hydrides. Through the study of model chemical systems, the proposed research will shed light on this important and unusual class of molecules. This, in turn, will further scientific understanding of biological systems critical to human health and development. As ammonia is a potential alternative fuel, an improved knowledge of FeMoco is also expected to lead to further advancements in renewable energy technology. This research project will be integrated into an education/outreach program aiming to improve the participation of high school students in STEM.<br/><br/>A key distinction of hydride-bound FeMoco states is that the iron hydride sites are?in contrast to the vast majority of all other metal hydrides?projected to be locally high-spin. This spin state is expected to profoundly impact the bonding, spectroscopy and reactivity of such species. Nevertheless, high-spin hydride complexes, particularly those for which the hydride is terminally bound, remain rare, and their properties only poorly understood. This research project therefore aims to prepare and study new terminal hydride complexes of manganese and iron, particularly those with electron counts pertinent to FeMoco. Molecules with unusual oxidation states and/or unprecedented hydride binding modes with be particular targets. This proposal also seeks to explore the reaction chemistry of high-spin hydride complexes with unsaturated small molecule FeMoco substrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike animal cells, plant cells are surrounded by walls permanently locking cells to their sisters. The cell wall not only establishes boundaries between single cells but also dictates that organ development results from cell expansion that must be coordinated with neighboring cells in the organ.

With a more reduced set of peptides and receptors, the non-seed model plant species Physcomitrium patens provides a unique opportunity to take a genome-wide approach to investigate receptor function. Furthermore the P. patens genome is readily and rapidly edited using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, making it possible to perform genome-wide screens of peptide and receptor function.

The research addresses both fundamental and applied physics, with potential to bring innovations for quantum technologies. The analytical methods developed in this work will be applicable to a wide range of problems in the quantum physics of low-dimensional systems.<br/><br/>Modern technology relies on electronic devices that perform a variety of functions, such as transistors, diodes, and other key components. The central theme of this project is to investigate nonreciprocal transport phenomena. Nonreciprocity in quantum materials refers to the phenomenon where a system?s response to an external stimulus (such as electric current, magnetic field, or light) depends on the direction of the applied stimulus. In other words, the system?s transport or optical properties are asymmetric when the direction of the current or field is reversed, violating conventional reciprocity relations. One of the main goals of this project is to study the superconducting diode effect in materials and junctions, which could lead to new functionalities, since superconductors can support dissipationless currents. Another focus of the research is exploring nonreciprocal thermoelectric effects, where heat can be converted into electricity and vice versa. <br/><br/>The research program is closely integrated with education and outreach efforts. These initiatives include training undergraduate and graduate students and mentoring postdoctoral scholars in advanced topics in quantum physics. To inspire the next generation of physicists, the project will also engage students through science Olympiads and summer schools, providing valuable experience and exposure to modern developments in the field.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>This project focuses on theoretical research in electron quantum transport and nonreciprocity in correlated systems and devices. The research agenda addresses both the fundamental physics of electronic correlations in complex materials and the practical physics of mesoscopic devices, particularly in the context of quantum science and superconducting nanostructures. The proposed scientific program is partly motivated by recent and ongoing experiments and will be conducted in close collaboration with several research groups. These collaborations are a key pillar of the project?s success. The work is structured around three main thrusts, each comprising interconnected sub-projects:<br/><br/>[1] Transport Phenomena in Correlated Electron Systems. This thrust aims to develop a new kinetic theory that accurately accounts for correlations between electron scattering and long-range disorder potentials. These potentials may manifest as scalar or pseudo-vector fields, particularly relevant to multi-valley conductors with spatially varying strain. Applications include transport in topological moir systems and nonlinear phenomena such as magnetochiral anisotropy and second harmonic generation.<br/><br/>[2] Noncentrosymmetric Superconducting Systems. This line of research investigates the microscopic mechanisms underlying the superconducting diode effect, explores spin-galvanic effects, and studies interferometry in multiterminal Josephson junctions. It also aims to uncover transport anomalies at the interface between quantum Hall systems and superconductors.<br/><br/>[3] Correlated Electronic Multilayers. This thrust explores electronic crystal phases in two-dimensional materials and investigates anomalous and nonreciprocal Coulomb drag phenomena in 1D and 2D devices, as well as the behavior of odd electron liquids.<br/><br/>The project strongly emphasizes training graduate and undergraduate students by integrating them into research within a highly collaborative environment alongside postdoctoral scholars and colleagues from other groups. Additionally, the outreach and engagement component of the program targets a broad audience, including the general public, middle and high school students, and professional physics majors. Key components of this program include: Science Olympiad (preparing and mentoring students for science competitions); Podium Speaker Series (hosting talks to inspire and engage students in STEM fields); Quantum Summer Schools (organizing local summer schools to support students from Midwestern states and coordinating the advanced Boulder Summer School); Scientific Coordination of Events (organizing conferences and workshops to foster scientific collaboration).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mask writers are machines that are integral to the semiconductor industry, as these create the stencils (masks) that are sandwiched together to form advanced computer chips. The number and complexity of the masks required for these chips are increasing beyond the capacity of state-of-the-art machines. The company is developing a component device that has the potential to introduce disruptive change in the fundamental design of mask writers. The project will harness this technology to tackle manufacturing bottlenecks in mask production that are caused by the accelerating demand for advanced intensive AI applications. The work will lead to a more efficient solution for producing semiconductor chips faster and with high computational power. The project has the potential to effect a financial impact of greater than $20M annually after three years, and to kickstart entry of the fundamental technology into additional market segments.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to a wafer-scale process for creating controllable cold cathode electron sources that advance integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Semiconductor chip fabrication is achieved by performing photolithography through stencil masks that are themselves created using either laser- or electron-beam mask writers. The properties of these tools dictate spatial resolution, precision, and turnaround time. The multiple electron-beam (multi-beam) writer has achieved the smallest feature sizes, thus displacing the laser writer for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The goal of this project is to help eliminate two significant bottlenecks that hinder production and advancement in multi-beam technology: (1) Beam quality and parallelization (reliability and yield) are physically limited by the industry?s dependence on thermionic (hot) electron sources; and (2) escalating processing power for implementing design code for advanced mask sets is stressing computational resources. The proposed device will provide a means to accelerate chip production using controllable electron beams for faster and higher quality mask writing. The focus of this project on solving the first bottleneck should also help address the second bottleneck, expanding the degree of complexity of the chip sets that can be designed and manufactured for AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such structures occur naturally, and for example give butterfly wings their brilliant color. In the lab, synthetic fabrication of optical microstructures has had deep technological impact in fields such as information storage and display, and is based on exposing a photosensitive film to laser light or an electron beam.  While this technique is well-established, it is not suited for rapid prototyping.  Another limitation is that the fabricated structures are immobile on the film surface once the film processing is complete.  However, an emerging material class of organic molecule coupled with a flexible polymer have been found to be sensitive to the direction of illumination and not its brightness.  This sensitivity to light polarization can be exploited to make dynamic surface microstructures, enabling not only permanent optical microstructures, but also structures which can be reconfigured in response to light.  This mechanical response to light can be coupled with new technologies in programmable light modulators to create a new platform for the on-demand fabrication of both static and dynamic optical microstructures. Such a system will make rapid prototyping of light-diffracting surfaces accessible to a wide range of optical manufacturers, while also enabling new techniques in color engineering that rely on the use of microscale surfaces.  <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>Surface microstructures enable photonics applications in miniaturized planar optics and are likewise used in bioengineering and materials science applications where surfaces with tunable anisotropy are required. They are typically fabricated using laser light to expose a photosensitive film through a photomask.  The proposed research exploits a new fabrication process that combines the photomechanical response of azopolymer films with programmable spatial light modulators to enable one-step, maskless, and reversible writing of surface microstructures. The proposed research will advance this methodology towards the one-step laser printing of planar diffractive optics and the printing of light-reconfigurable microarchitectures using pre-patterned template films.  To accomplish these, the proof-of-concept system developed by the principal investigator will be significantly advanced towards not only optimal spatial resolution but also enabled with a new intensity-masking spatial light modulator component that will facilitate the programmable spatial addressing of optical intensity and polarization at the film surface.  These new capabilities will transform the proof-of-concept system developed previously towards one capable of printing planar diffractive optics, which in many applications can replace bulky refractive optics, an essential step towards novel optical integrated circuits.  Such flat optics are in high demand and the principal investigator will collaborate with a local photonics company on designs most appropriate for emerging applications. This next-generation laser printing system will also enable a new form of hybrid lithography in which high-spatial resolution nanostructures fabricated with specialized techniques such as electron beam lithography are first replicated in equivalent azopolymer film structures and subsequently optically reconfigured towards the final design structure.  This concept of using prepatterned template films will open up new optically-driven microarchitectures, not previously accessible using conventional lithography or laser-based lithography working independently<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When combined with tiny machine learning technologies, these devices are further enabled with in-situ data processing and real-time decision-making capabilities. However, integrating tiny machine learning algorithms into battery-less IoT devices presents significant challenges involving data acquisition, model training, and model deployment, all under stringent constraints of power, cost, memory, and computation. Operational intermittence due to frequent power failures, further complicates functionality. Once deployed, tiny machine learning models typically operate under fixed sensor sampling rates and are only able to make timely decisions when there is sufficient power. Moreover, the extended operational life of these systems introduces a novel challenge: the obsolescence of AI algorithms or programs as sensory inputs and/or environmental conditions evolve. There is a need for a holistic framework that offers energy efficient solutions capable of responding to sensory input, adapting to environmental changes, and maintaining code currency to ensure continued accuracy and responsiveness. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing innovative methods for adaptive tiny machine learning integration in battery-less IoT systems, ensuring long-term, reliable operation in dynamic, energy-variable environments.<br/><br/>This research will advance battery-less systems through three coherent advancements: 1) fundamental redesign and optimization of tiny machine learning models for self-powered IoT devices to enable timely data analysis and decision-making; 2) development of a holistic framework that supports adaptive data collection, decision-making, and communication strategies attuned to the dynamics of varying ambient environments; and 3) design of reliable and efficient code update mechanism to maintain program currency under frequent power interruptions.

This project plans to use viruses, the natural killers of bacteria, to control the bacteria growth. In nature, every type of bacteria can be infected by at least one type of virus known as a bacteriophage. This CAREER project will develop methods to discover the mixtures of naturally occurring bacteriophages (called bacteriophage cocktails) that are effective at killing bacteria.  The research will identify why some bacteriophage cocktails work better than others. The project will also build relationships between researchers and the water industry to teach practitioners how to use bacteriophages to control bacteria in water systems. The project will provide opportunities for high school students, undergraduates and graduate students to participate in the research.<br/><br/>New methods of microbial control are needed to protect public health from exposure to disinfection byproducts, opportunistic pathogens, and antibiotic resistance in drinking water, while reduce the economic costs of biofouling and biocorrosion control in water distribution system. One alternative to traditional microbial control processes is to specifically tune the bacterial community of water systems using mixtures of bacteriophages to kill the bacteria. Currently, the design of these mixtures (bacteriophage cocktails) is slow and laborious, relying on trial and error to identify the most effective combinations of bacteriophages. This CAREER project will develop a platform for the rational design of bacteriophage cocktails, based on the hypothesis that safe and effective bacteriophage cocktails will have specific gene and transcript (mRNA) profiles that are distinct from those that have antagonistic or off-target effects. The research will address the following objectives: (1) identify genetic and transcriptomic markers of synergistic versus antagonistic bacteriophage cocktail interactions and (2) assess off-target infection risks using experimental and computational approaches. The education objectives will (1) ensure that students have the skills for further developing bacteriophage biocontrol technologies by creating educational materials and hands-on bacteriophage discovery experiences for high school and college students and (2) encourage knowledge exchange between researchers and practitioners by convening a practitioner advisory board. This project will contribute to the development of a systematic understanding of the features of safe and effective bacteriophage cocktails.

With origins in the 19th century study of prime numbers by Riemann and Dirichlet, this rich family of functions often serve as a bridge connecting several areas of mathematics including Diophantine equations, geometry, representation theory, and analysis. Examples arise both in the study of solutions to polynomial equations and in the theory of highly symmetric functions known as automorphic forms. The paradigm of the Langlands program indicates that the rich symmetry properties of automorphic forms may be used to prove properties of arithmetic L-functions, which have a wide array of applications. In the modern relative Langlands program, we now have a conjectural framework to make this relationship precise in terms of a duality between L-functions and certain invariants of automorphic forms known as ""periods"". In this context, the relative trace formula (RTF) provides a powerful tool from harmonic analysis to decompose an automorphic period into its ""irreducible components or modes"" which are often directly related to special values of L-functions. While such a formula is often the only tool available to establish the relationship alluded to above, the theory of the relative trace formula is still incomplete. In this project, the PI will explore several problems in the relative Langlands program using recently developed tools. In addition to providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student projects in this rapidly developing field, this project also supports several educational goals including the organization of seminars and the founding of a graduate student workshop designed to foster interaction among the area's graduate students in automorphic forms and offer opportunities to develop skill in giving professional presentations.<br/><br/>This project will complete the PI's theory of endoscopy in the relative setting and establish the stabilization of a large family of RTFs by developing a theory of twisted relative endoscopy, transfer factors, and variants of Ngo's geometric stabilization in the context of symmetric varieties. Each step will be informed by the connection between relative endoscopy and the duality conjectures of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh, with a secondary goal of better understanding these conjectures in the arithmetic setting via the geometric aspects of the relative trace formula. The PI will apply these tools to applications in arithmetic geometry and the relative Langlands conjectures. This includes the case of generalized unitary Friedberg-Jacquet periods, with applications to the arithmetic geometry of certain Shimura varieties. A novel component of this project is to combine these two branches and develop a novel ""arithmetic"" theory of endoscopy, and to prove new endoscopic arithmetic fundamental lemmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines how communities vulnerable to flooding respond to compounding disasters of inundation and other ecological stressors. Specifically, the project explores whether the social, technical, and ecological drivers of land-use dynamics in contexts of inland riverine flooding are influenced by localized mutual aid networks. It is well documented that first responders and other officials encounter communication difficulties in the context of flooding events. The researchers ask whether mutual aid and other networks establish obligations and responsibilities that enable recovery and mitigation efforts. The research produces a community-based floodplain mapping tool to improve communication and collaboration across scales in disaster response, recovery, and mitigation. The tool is shared with local communities. The project expands participation in STEM learning for community science youth fellows, undergraduate, and graduate students. Dissemination plans improve engagement with community science and improve the public?s understanding of science and the scientific method. This project is jointly funded by Cultural Anthropology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). <br/><br/>This project studies how rural communities respond to overlapping disasters of flood water inundation, and a range of other ecological stressors. In preliminary research, investigators have seen that community members, local responders, disaster response agents, and others do not have easy ways to communicate before, during, and after flooding. This is in part due to lack of shared language, and lack of adequate tools for collaboration across these different groups. This project studies processes of response, recovery, and mitigation work in these river valleys. The team conducts on-the-ground in these rural areas on land-use regulation and practice during and after floods; and how social forces, economic realities, and technical infrastructure shape the impacts of land use. This project focuses on how communication, responsibility, and collective community assistance works after disaster. The researcher will conduct behavioral observation at community meetings; interviews with river corridor and floodplain managers, other rural extension and food security stakeholders, and regional planning commission officers; a survey (n=500) on perceptions of optimal land and river use and risks with residents in three floodplain communities; and archival analyses to gather longitudinal data on flood risk and resilience.

This GRC and GRS will be relatively small gatherings of research scientists, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students who are scientifically focused on the interdisciplinary subfield of soft, squishy, deformable, and active materials. These are important materials in our everyday world, yet scientists and engineers still do not fully understand how they work or what technology can achieve with them. Such materials can be human-made or they can be biologically-derived, and the meeting will feature presentations from scientists working on both types of systems.  A major highlight of the meeting is that unpublished research will be shared among the group, which will foster rapid communication and collaboration, and allow new scientific breakthroughs to happen much faster. The second goal of the meeting is to train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists focused on soft matter. The meeting will have a significant number of training opportunities for students, including poster sessions for students to present their work, professional development sessions, and the opportunity to give short flash-talks. A variety of scientists from different backgrounds, and from both research-focused and teaching-focused institutions, will be present to offer advice and guidance to the students.<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of the GRC and GRS are several-fold.

The second goal is to educate and train the next generation of soft matter scientists and engineers through the presentations of new results, networking discussions, and leadership opportunities, educational panels, and mentoring. Soft Condensed Matter Physics is a highly interdisciplinary field of study undertaken by researchers in Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Polymer Science, and sometimes even Biology departments. One of the main objectives of this effort is to educate and mentor the next generation of soft matter scientists and engineers. As the field has grown, the number of trainees working on soft matter questions has also grown. To train these students, the GRS will provide an extra set of presentations and mentoring sessions which is organized by trainees, for trainees. The GRC will also add a new component aimed at highlighting and training the next generation: trainee talks.

U.S. law requires that upon taking a criminal suspect into custody, police must issue Miranda warnings about the suspect?s rights to silence and counsel. During questioning, police are prohibited from using coercion that ?overbears the suspect?s will? to extract a confession. Understanding perceptions of custody and coercion is essential because violations of these laws and principles can lead to inaccurate outcomes, such as false confessions and wrongful convictions. Moreover, when a confession is false, an innocent person is punished while the true perpetrator remains at large, which poses a significant threat to public safety. Judges and juries are tasked with evaluating custody and coercion in legal proceedings, and these decisions have serious and enduring consequences. Psychological science can deepen understanding of perceptions of custody and coercion and thereby help legal decision makers to assess custody and coercion in a transparent and consistent manner. <br/><br/>Police interviews of subjects in custody are difficult to study in a way that is simultaneously scientifically rigorous, ethically conscious, and ecologically valid.

Four VR conditions are designed to assess whether and how the type of interrogation strategy, which is a key factor that judges consider when evaluating the voluntariness of the interaction, affects perceptions of custody and coercion, as well as decision-making with respect to confessions. The investigators also compare outcomes across two non-VR conditions (standard 2D video and a transcript), which mimic real-world materials that judges evaluate in disputed confession cases.

Polymers are essential to daily life, from technologies such as plastics to biopolymers such as DNA. A diblock copolymer is created by bonding two chemically different polymers at their ends. In most cases, different polymers do not want to mix, so they phase separate similar to the way that oil and water separate in salad dressing. In contrast, block polymers cannot phase separate because the two blocks are bonded at their ends. Rather, block polymers spontaneously undergo a process known as ?self-assembly? to create an ordered structure with nanometer-sized domains that minimizes the frustration created by their inability to phase separate. These domains can have different physical properties, e.g., regularly spaced, rubbery spherical inclusions in an otherwise glassy material, creating multifunctional materials. Self-assembly occurs in a wide range of soft materials, from soaps to biomaterials, and block polymers serve as an important model system to understand the physics that drives self-assembly.<br/><br/>A long-standing goal in this area is predicting the ordered structure that will result from self-assembly based on the chemistry of the different blocks, the number of monomers in each block, and the temperature. Such a predictive ability would remove the need for tedious trial-and-error experimentation. The theory of block polymer self-assembly is remarkably powerful but suffers from a ?chicken or the egg? conundrum: To perform the required calculations, one needs to know the structure that will be formed in advance. While this need poses no problems for understanding what has already been observed in experiments, it makes it extremely difficult to discover new block polymer materials via theory. This project will overcome this challenge, using generative artificial intelligence methods, similar to those that create new pictures from a library of images, to generate new possible block polymer structures by learning from a library of known structures. Machine learning will then be used to identify block polymers with appropriate chemistries and processing temperatures that will spontaneously form these new structures. <br/><br/>This project will turn the theory of block polymer self-assembly from a tool primarily used for explanation to one that can be used for exploration and, ultimately, to design new materials with novel properties. The development of these computational techniques will provide graduate and undergraduate researchers with advanced training in polymer physics and high-performance computing, contributing to the US workforce, and the computer codes developed for this work will be released to the public so that others can use them for their research. High school students will be involved in the generative artificial intelligence part of the project, developing projects for the Minnesota Science Fair and sparking their interest in pursuing materials science as a future career path.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Block polymers are amphiphilic materials created by bonding two or more different polymers at their ends. Below the order-disorder temperature, a block polymer melt selects an ordered state that balances chain stretching and interfacial tension, subject to the constraint of filling space at constant density. Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has proven to be a remarkably successful approach for understanding the block polymer thermodynamics governing order state selection. However, the non-linear governing equations in SCFT require high quality initial guesses for convergence. These computational challenges pose an obstacle when using SCFT to discover new block polymer phases. To overcome this obstacle, this project will use a generative adversarial network that learns from existing SCFT solutions to propose starting points for subsequent SCFT calculations, which are expected to converge to novel solutions. Those solutions are anticipated to be metastable states. As a result, a hierarchical computational method will be developed to efficiently solve the inverse problem of identifying block polymer formulations that stabilize those new phases. This computational workflow will be used to identify novel phases in triblock terpolymers. In addition to exhibiting a wide variety of ordered states, triblock terpolymers are synthetically tractable with fast ordering kinetics, making experimental tests of the predictions from this project realistic.<br/><br/>Block polymers are the model system for understanding self-assembly in amphiphilic soft matter owing to their relatively simple thermodynamics, and SCFT?s ability to capture those thermodynamics is a major success in soft matter theory. However, SCFT has largely been relegated to an explanatory role in block polymer self-assembly; discovery typically results from serendipitous experimentation and then theory provides a physical rationale. This project turns the paradigm on its head by developing a powerful computational approach to discover new candidate phases and then identify block polymer formulations to produce those materials. The tools developed through this research will be made available to the community as open-source software. This project will provide both graduate and undergraduate students with advanced training in polymer physics, materials science, computer science, and numerical methods. K-12 education will be enhanced through an outreach effort with the Breck School to develop projects for the Minnesota Science Fair. <br/><br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This lack of transparency limits trust in AI, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where understanding the reasoning behind decisions is essential. At the same time, decades of research have produced mature, well-established, and theoretically proven algorithms. This project introduces Algorithm-Informed Neural Networks (AINNs), a new approach that integrates these proven algorithmic principles into the design of neural networks. By embedding logical steps into AI architectures, AINNs enhance explainability, reliability, and efficiency, making AI systems more interpretable and reducing their dependence on large datasets. This advance is particularly beneficial in fields where data is scarce or sensitive, such as medical diagnostics or regulatory decision-making. By addressing these challenges, the project contributes to the development of trustworthy, transparent, and efficient AI technologies that can drive scientific progress and benefit society.  <br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the project is structured around two key research tasks. First, it focuses on algorithm-mapped neural models, which construct neural networks by systematically integrating well-established algorithmic logic. Instead of relying solely on training data, these models leverage predefined logical rules ? ranging from pseudocode to flowcharts ? to ensure reliability and trustworthiness in AI decision-making. This approach reduces training data requirements while improving generalization and interpretability. Second, the research develops latent behavior analysis of neural blocks, a novel debugging tool that enables AI systems to be systematically inspected for correctness. By analyzing the execution patterns of neural subnetworks, this method detects input-specific anomalies and traces them back to logical inconsistencies, facilitating targeted debugging and improving model robustness. The project will evaluate AINNs across diverse tasks, from algorithmic reasoning to perception-based applications, using key metrics such as data efficiency, error localization accuracy, and generalization performance. Expected outcomes include AI systems with greater transparency, lower data dependency, and enhanced reliability, making them more effective in real-world applications. The project will publicly release datasets, models, and tools to promote broader adoption of algorithm-informed AI across multiple domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since their discovery in 1969, they have shown great promise for use in important technologies, including sensors, transducers, actuators, and energy harvesters. However, their adoption has been limited by their low performance when compared to piezoelectric ceramics, which are predominantly used today. This project addresses a key scientific question: how do piezoelectric polymers work at the molecular level? Specifically, which part of these semicrystalline polymers contributes primarily to the observed piezoelectricity - the crystalline regions, the amorphous regions, or the interphase between the two? To tackle this challenge, the project will employ computer simulation, advanced polymer processing, structural analysis, and property characterization to uncover the mechanisms behind polymer piezoelectricity. With the resolution of this fundamental question, researchers would be able to develop advanced piezoelectric polymers that can rival, or even exceed, the performance of piezoelectric ceramics. The products of this research could have far-reaching impacts. High-performance piezoelectric polymers could enable more efficient and lightweight medical devices for ultrasound imaging and therapy, enhance wearable electronics, and drive innovations in robotics. Beyond the scientific benefits, this project prioritizes education and outreach to inspire and train the next generation of scientists and engineers. It also includes hands-on research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Since the discovery of chain-folding in single lamellar crystals, a two-phase model (i.e., crystalline and amorphous phases) has been used to describe semicrystalline polymers. However, for melt- and solid state-processed semicrystalline polymers, studies using temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry have revealed a third component: the rigid amorphous fraction (RAF). It is suggested that chain-folding may not be the predominant packing scheme for these materials. Instead, a substantial portion of the polymer chains extends directly from the crystalline basal planes, forming an oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) that gradually transitions into the isotropic amorphous fraction (IAF). The tethering of OAF to rigid crystals results in reduced mobility, making it an RAF. By integrating computer simulation and experimental studies, this project aims to elucidate the OAF structure in semicrystalline ferroelectric polymers, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). It is hypothesized that the electrostrictive OAF is the major contributor to the piezoelectric property. Initially, computer simulation will be used to calculate the structural factor of OAF in PVDF and compare it with the experimental X-ray diffraction patterns to gain insights into the OAF structure. Subsequently, a revised nanocomposite model, consisting of crystals, OAF and IAF will be utilized to simulate the piezoelectric response. Additionally, nanocrystalline PVDF will be explored to increase the OAF content and enhance the piezoelectricity. Finally, multiblock copolymers, composed of ferroelectric copolymers and electrostrictive terpolymers of PVDF, will be synthesized to investigate new opportunities. The goal of this research is an improved fundamental understanding of the structure-piezoelectric property relationship in semicrystalline ferroelectric polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can be very costly, especially when materials have random or disordered features. While machine learning (ML) can speed up some parts of the design process, it does not always provide clear physical insights, such as why the connectivity of one material phase strongly affects overall conductivity or how certain patterns might enhance stiffness. This project addresses the challenge of making material design both efficient and explainable by focusing on the concept of N-point correlation functions (NPCFs). An NPCF is a statistical measure describing how different regions of a material relate to one another. By systematically learning which NPCFs matter most for a given property, the research will provide both accurate predictions and clear insights about the structure-property relationship. In addition to improving the design of smart composites for soft robotics, the methods developed will lay the foundation for broader applications in biological systems, climate modeling, and other areas where disordered structures play a critical role. The educational activities developed through this project will help K-12 students understand material structure-property relationships through hands-on experiments and contribute to training the next generation of researchers at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and computational science. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project investigates how to identify concise and complete microstructure representations for two-phase, disordered heterogeneous materials. Since these microstructures can be treated as random fields, the research focuses on N-point correlation functions (NPCFs) as the core representation. Although machine learning models can approximate structure-property mappings, they often do not reveal the underlying physical causes. To address this, the project leverages a strong contrast expansion formalism, which links material properties to microstructure morphology through physics-based governing equations, such as partial differential equations (PDEs). By interpreting linear and nonlinear effective properties as expansions in terms of Green?s functions and NPCFs, the research team will develop new computational algorithms to learn both the necessary Green?s functions and the relevant NPCFs directly from data. These algorithms will provide a physics-driven mechanism for down-selecting which NPCFs are most critical, leading to an explainable and more efficient representation for microstructure reconstruction and property prediction.<br/><br/>To demonstrate practical value, the project will apply these methods to the design of a bi-phase composite with specific mechanical and thermal transport properties relevant to soft robotics. By uncovering how different morphological features affect performance, the research aims to streamline the design process for materials that must satisfy coupled mechanical and thermal requirements. Beyond this specific application, the methods and principles developed will be broadly applicable to other random fields where PDE-driven properties dominate, such as multi-phase materials, biological systems, climate science, and cosmology.<br/><br/>In addition to advancing knowledge in materials science, the project has a broader impact on data science by prompting new ideas for efficiently representing and modeling random fields. Just as insights into sequence modeling led to transformational language models, and insights into graph structures enabled advanced drug discovery methods, this research explores whether NPCFs can serve as essential building blocks for future architectures that handle large-scale or high-dimensional random fields. The developed educational activities will also contribute to training the next generation of researchers at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and computational science. <br/><br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether negotiating a business deal, teaching a child, or simply having fun with friends, people need certain skills to interact successfully with others. One of the most important of these skills is the ability to understand other people?s mental states: their thoughts, feelings, beliefs, desires, and intentions. Understanding others? mental states is useful because it helps people to more effectively plan their own actions during interactions (e.g., knowing when to call someone?s bluff, or when a loved one needs cheering up). This project studies how, precisely, people understand each other?s mental states, and how their brains make this understanding possible. <br/><br/>This project investigates three key parts of mental state understanding: 1) how people detect which mental state(s) another person is currently experiencing, 2) how people predict what mental states others are likely to experience in the future, and 3) how people intervene to change or regulate other people?s mental states. Using tightly controlled experiments designed to capture real-world mental state dynamics, the project measures how people learn to detect, predict, and regulate mental states. In parallel, deep neural network models learn to complete the same tasks. By testing how well different models explain human behavior and corresponding brain activity, this research provides insight into the mechanisms that support mental state understanding. By characterizing the computational and neural mechanisms of mental state understanding, this research lays the foundation for developing ways to improve a wide variety of human social interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the drivers of exchange rates is a central objective of international macroeconomics and finance. Exchange rates are key prices affecting the relative cost of imports and exports, as well as the returns to investing in assets abroad. Yet exchange rates have long puzzled economists: they are inconsistent with benchmark models in economics and are very difficult to predict. This project makes progress on these puzzles by exploring the relationship between exchange rates and other international asset prices, such as bonds and stocks in different countries, as well as macroeconomic quantities, such as capital flows across borders. This research helps market participants use exchange rates to better understand macroeconomic conditions in the global economy. It also helps decision-makers better understand how monetary and fiscal policies affect exchange rates and thus the broader economy. The research findings could inspire innovative international policy frameworks, improve the well-being of households, businesses, and investors, and reinforce global market activity.<br/><br/>This award project explores exchange rates through the lens of general equilibrium models with international capital market frictions. These capital market frictions are reflected in a central role for global arbitrageurs to intermediate capital flows across borders. Such models thus allow the researchers to accommodate classic forces that have been thought to drive exchange rates, such as the supply or demand for goods, as well as drivers that have been proposed in more recent research, such as changes in the intermediation capacity of global arbitrageurs. The project includes research to decompose the drivers of the dollar exchange rate versus other advanced economies through the lens of such a model. The co-movements of exchange rates with bond yields, spreads in financial markets, and capital flows suggest a nuanced variance decomposition of exchange rates: at high frequencies, shocks to intermediation capacity play an important role in driving exchange rates, but at low frequencies and overall, demand shocks play the most important role. The project includes further research to understand the sources of demand shocks driving variation in these prices and capital flows. The researchers study the co-movements of exchange rates, bonds, and stocks to differentiate between potential sources of demand shocks. The project also includes research to understand how heterogeneous exposures to demand or intermediation shocks can explain differences in exchange rate behavior across countries. The researchers study how patterns in trade linkages and in net foreign assets give rise to heterogeneous effects of these shocks. The project finally includes research on the propagation of macroeconomic policies through exchange rates.  The researchers study whether state-dependence in the effects of foreign exchange rate intervention can account for mixed evidence on its effectiveness in the data. This research could help researchers and decision-makers gain deeper insights into exchange rates and their relationship with international asset prices, capital flows, and other macroeconomic factors, ultimately improving the well-being of the U.S. population and strengthening the country's leadership in international markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to understand the cognitive and brain mechanisms related to learning from experience, and how these change from childhood to adolescence and then to young adulthood.  The project tests a relatively novel characterization of adolescence as a time when learning from experience is heavily weighted both at behavioral and brain level.

Motivated learning is critical for behaving adaptively, but little is known about the neurocognitive development of motivated learning. The project uses behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging approaches to investigate age-related changes in learning and integration of different types of learning.  In particular, the project focuses on striatal and medial-temporal learning systems in the brain, and how these change across development.  Notably, the project also uses a novel brain imaging technique to make inferences about dopamine to better understand its role in learning over the course of development.

Historical observations have shown that oxygen concentrations are declining in many parts of the oceans, termed ?ocean deoxygenation?. The causes of the decline are linked to changes in surface water temperature and its impact on oxygen solubility, along with variations in the strength of the biological pump, ocean circulation, vertical mixing, ventilation, and biochemical processes. It is difficult to calculate exactly how much ocean oxygen has been lost to the atmosphere and how much has been redistributed within the ocean interior. This project will compare observation-based gridded oxygen datasets with the purpose of generating comparable four-dimensional (space and time) estimates of global oxygen distribution, assessing their similarities and differences and promoting scientific understanding of the drivers of ocean deoxygenation. The project will promote workforce development through support of an early career investigator, a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate interns.<br/><br/>The project has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the causes of disagreements between different gridded oxygen datasets by conducting an intercomparison of oxygen datasets from common in situ observational and model-based profiles. Many factors can affect estimates of a deoxygenation trend: existing observational studies use different sets of raw data, measurement platforms, data quality control metrics, land-ocean masks, vertical and horizontal grids and interpolation methods. Because variations in any of these factors can lead to different estimates, it is difficult to make direct comparisons and determine the causes of disagreements among datasets. Standardized protocols will be applied to isolate the interpolation method as the only source of discrepancy and to assess uncertainties in global oxygen inventory trends. The second goal is to test hypotheses for the underlying causes of ocean deoxygenation. The suite of new datasets will be used to evaluate the roles of oxygen solubility, the biological pump, and physical and biogeochemical processes driving global ocean deoxygenation. Further, the mechanisms driving the expansion of the tropical ocean oxygen minimum zones will be explored. The use of novel datasets with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution in these analyses will enable new insights into global and regional oxygen content changes. The suite of gridded oxygen datasets will be made available via public data repositories, and the results of the product intercomparisons and deoxygenation analyses will be disseminated via open-access papers. Collaboration with the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group 168 will enhance access and utility of gridded oxygen datasets through sharing and exchange of ideas, experimental protocols and data products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy (in its electromagnetic, mechanical, and heat incarnations) and charge transport is another long-studied subject, currently back in focus as molecules become important components of nano-devices. The interplay between chirality and transport properties has been repeatedly demonstrated but many aspects of its manifestations are not well understood. Nitzan and coworkers aim to develop a fundamental understanding of such phenomena by developing the underlying theory that connects molecular symmetry to molecular dynamics, as well as numerical methods for the quantitative evaluation of such effects. Successful completion of their work will provide a valuable tool for predicting, applying and controlling chiral induced transport processes in molecular systems and other nanostructures.<br/><br/>Nitzan and coworkers will start from the connection between structural chirality and the symmetry properties of nuclear and electronic motions and will look at consequences for energy and charge transport, diffusion, friction, localization, and interfacial behaviors of charge and energy carriers: (a) The connection between the chirality of the molecular equilibrium structure and its electronic and nuclear dynamics will be established and characterized. (b) Mathematical measures of chiral dynamics (e.g. the scalar product of linear and angular momenta that measure their ?locking?) will be developed and applied. (c) Chirality-induced asymmetries (e.g. rectification) in charge and energy transport will be characterized and quantified. (d) Classical and quantum aspects of Brownian motion, diffusion, friction, mobility, (thermal and electrical) conduction, and localization (e.g. polaron formation) in chiral environments will be studied and characterized (e) interfacial phenomena at the interface between chiral and non-chiral environments will be studied. Finally, the suitability of different methods of characterizing and quantifying molecular chirality for the analysis of the interplay between chirality and dynamics will be studied. At the same time, numerical codes to impose a ?controlled amount? of chiral character in a molecular structure will be developed to provide a numerical laboratory for these studies. Importantly, the processes that will be studied are ubiquitous in chiral chemical systems, hence it is expected that the results of this research will be relevant to the behavior of all chiral chemical systems, reaching far beyond the scope of the present studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Future Manufacturing Seed Grant (FMSG) project looks to address these challenges by developing self-learning robotic epitaxy, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach to manufacturing superconducting materials and quantum circuits with high precision and efficiency. By leveraging an innovative AI tool for decision making based on both the past and current actions of a system, robotic epitaxy looks to autonomously optimize fabrication parameters in real time, mimicking the operation of humans while eliminating human-induced errors. Additionally, the team will combine AI development with the equivalent of a 3D printer with the goal of manufacturing superconducting quantum circuits. This new technology looks to significantly reduce production costs and environmental impact. The knowledge gained from this research will help accelerate the development of quantum technologies, while also advancing workforce training at the intersection of quantum science, materials science, and AI-driven manufacturing.<br/><br/>Manufacturing quantum materials and devices is key to the development of the quantum economy. However, the high-dimensional parameter space for quantum device fabrication and a strong device-to-device variation using the same recipe make it particularly challenging to deploy traditional AI methods. The goal of this research project is to drive two key innovations to enable self-learning robotic fabrication of quantum materials and devices. First, the team intends to develop wafer-scale robotic epitaxy. This technology will integrate structured reinforcement learning, an AI tool for decision making based on the trajectory of a dynamical system, with real-time electron diffraction data to guide the growth of high-temperature superconducting thin films. Second, the team looks to develop robotic mini-epitaxy, which enables direct printing of superconducting quantum circuits without nanofabrication. This setup will use nanoscale nozzles to confine molecular beams to sub-micrometer scales. Real-time optical imaging feedback intends to allow the reinforcement learning model to adaptively control deposition conditions, ensuring high-fidelity fabrication of superconducting devices. A primary target of this research is monolayer iron selenide superconductors, which serve as an ideal testbed due to their extreme sensitivity to growth conditions and their potential for high-performance quantum computing applications. Working to establish the first AI-driven ?3D printer? for superconducting quantum circuitry will lay the foundation for scalable, automated quantum device manufacturing, seeding future growth of the research team and potentially having broad impacts on quantum computing, materials science, and AI-driven manufacturing.

Unlike pulsed beam experiments, this approach utilizes a ring-shaped RF trap to confine the ion beam, making it conceptually closer to static hybrid trap setups, where ion traps overlap with magneto-optical traps. In this configuration, the axial secular frequency of the trapping potential is significantly higher than the circular frequency of ion motion. This key feature distinguishes it from high-energy ion beams in storage rings. As a result, this method offers precise control over ion velocities, ranging from stationary to several thousand meters per second, enabling the study of collisions across a wide energy spectrum with high resolution. The system?s fine control over ion velocity makes it particularly well-suited for interfacing with supersonic or buffer gas-cooled molecular beams, allowing for precise manipulation of collision dynamics. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables extended interrogation periods lasting over a second. This prolonged interaction time is critical for studying slow ion-neutral reactions, allowing for the observation of detailed reaction dynamics that would otherwise be missed in shorter timescales. Enhanced duration not only provides greater control and precision but also significantly improves resolution in analyzing reaction mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on a childrearing practice, in which families use a specialized cradle that guides how babies move, sleep, and grow throughout the first two years of life. This practice, which involves carefully wrapping and positioning babies in the cradle, offers a window into how cultural practices influence child development. By studying how babies develop within families that use the cradle, this project aims to uncover important insights about human development pathways.<br/><br/>This project examines how the use of a specialized cradle impacts motor, social and communication development during the first two years of life. The study compares two groups of infants raised in nearby communities: those who experience high levels of movement restriction through high use of the cradle and those who experience less movement restriction through low use of the cradle. Following infants from 4 to 16 months of age, researchers measure motor skill development (sitting, crawling, and walking), cognitive abilities (attention, problem-solving, and learning), and social-emotional communication (vocalizations, gestures). Using a combination of common developmental tests, natural observations of daily family activities, and detailed time logs, researchers examine how different amounts of movement restriction affect these aspects of development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The more organic carbon is consumed in the twilight zone, the less sinks to the deep ocean and to sediments. Thus, the activity of bacteria in the twilight zone is an important control on the ocean carbon cycle. In this project, a team of researchers will test the idea that the metabolism of bacteria in the twilight zone may be partly controlled by iron, an essential nutrient. This work will have implications for understanding ocean biology and chemistry. The project will promote workforce development through support of an early career research scientist and a graduate student. The lead investigator will develop a related laboratory module for an undergraduate course based on this work.<br/><br/>Preliminary data demonstrate that iron availability impacts the total carbon consumption rate by heterotrophic bacteria in the mesopelagic ocean, and that heterotrophic bacteria in this region of the water column are co-limited by iron and carbon. The team will use a combination of laboratory culturing studies and field experiments to test three related hypotheses about why and how this co-limitation occurs. The experiments will span a range in iron and carbon conditions, will test steady state versus pulse conditions, and will examine varying degrees of carbon lability. The three hypotheses they will test are: H1) Heterotrophic bacteria maintain high iron quotas in steady state conditions in the mesopelagic due to changes in the availability of iron and carbon in the transition from the surface to the mesopelagic and the cellular allocation of iron varies depending on the iron to carbon ratio at steady-state conditions, H2) The high iron quotas maintained by copiotrophic bacteria in the mesopelagic allows them to respond efficiently to pulses of new carbon, and the response is proportional to the quotas established in the steady-state environment, the magnitude of the carbon pulse, and the lability of the carbon substrate, and H3) The composition of organic material and iron homeostasis of heterotrophic bacteria affects total carbon consumption in the mesopelagic. The expected outcomes of the work are an increased mechanistic understanding of how the iron status of heterotrophic bacteria in the mesopelagic ocean impacts their ability to consume organic carbon, and how and why there is widespread co-limitation throughout the upper mesopelagic ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, stronger cutting planes incur a higher computational cost and radiate effects through the optimization process. This research project intends to develop novel learning architectures to judiciously deploy cutting plane strategies intending to improve current data-agnostic techniques by exploiting the presence of shared structure in modern optimization settings. The improvements will enable faster solution times and more complex models for challenging operational problems, exhibited in the project by engineering applications in power systems, logistics, and healthcare.

Towards addressing these obstacles, this project will employ theoretical analysis and computational experiments to create efficient learning-based cut and disjunction selection strategies by: (1) classifying when cuts help; (2) adaptively identifying beneficial disjunctions and subsets of cuts; (3) tailoring models for unit commitment, vehicle routing, and organ exchange market problems; and (4) applying the new methods to optimize logistics at local nonprofits in combination with student capstone and research opportunities.

The interaction of light with a single quantum state in an atom, molecule, or solid is the most elementary step in all light-induced processes from photosynthesis to quantum sensing and information processing. However, optically prepared quantum states rapidly dissipate into the local chemical environment. Professor Raschke and his students will apply nano-cavity enhanced imaging and spectroscopy to study these relaxations in individual nanostructures. Their discoveries could have implications for understanding non-radiative relaxation and vibrational energy flow in molecules and materials used in future quantum-based technologies. The project will also provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and contribute to the development of a quantum-enabled STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Optical cavities can control light-matter interaction in the weak coupling limit and enable new hybrid states in the strong coupling regime. Despite low quality factors, the deep sub-diffraction mode volume of nano-cavities provides for enhanced spectroscopy and quantum state control of even small ensembles and single emitters. Combining scanning probe microscopy with tip-enhanced near-field spectroscopy creates a tunable nano-cavity which allows one to separate the competing dynamics of the cavity-coupled electronic and vibrational excitations. By spectrally and spatially tuning the tip-cavity interaction, radiative and non-radiative emission can be independently controlled. Through Purcell-enhanced nano-spectroscopy this research aims to increase the quantum yield and to control exciton emission of quantum dots, as well as to resolve intra-molecular vibrational energy redistribution in molecular nano-ensembles. Further, by combining the tip-enhanced nano-cavity with multi-resonant antenna coupling to achieve vibrational strong coupling, the project will address the nature of dark states and provide new pathways for vibrational quantum coherent control. The work will answer questions of the fundamental limit of quantum coherence and dissipation at the elementary scale of electronic wavefunctions and vibrations in chemical systems, and it has direct applications in quantum chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, and materials science, with industry collaborations, and student workforce training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also a physically demanding job with high injury rates. Delivery work relies on public roads and delivery workers are in direct contact with customers in their homes and businesses. As the so-called ?last mile? delivery industry grows, there are concerns about the traffic accidents, congestion, and pollution that impact all citizens, in addition to worries about wages, job quality, and working conditions for workers. This study of last mile delivery drivers seeks to accurately describe the nature of the parcel delivery work, to assess the differences across organizations that employ or engage delivery workers, and to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of new technologies such as electric vehicles, dashboard cameras, vehicle sensors and digital parcel tracking, and to evaluate the role of unionization.

This research merges biology with quantum physics to build devices that can manipulate individual particles of light with unprecedented precision, potentially transforming fields from fundamental physics to medical diagnostics to supercomputing. Because conventional semiconductor manufacturing of wafer-scale transistors for silicon-based computing is limited in its ability to pattern quantum materials, radically new manufacturing approaches are needed. While DNA, the genetic molecule of life, is classically known for its role in storing and propagating genetic information, an alternative use involves its structural, self-assembling properties that enable scalable, low-cost and environmentally friendly manufacturing at the nanometer-scale. This project establishes a sustainable, energy-efficient manufacturing framework that uses DNA to position quantum materials on silicon chips with extraordinary accuracy and versatility. This innovative approach bridges molecular biology and semiconductor fabrication, creating pathways to quantum technologies that may enable computers capable of solving problems in minutes that would require conventional computers thousands of years to complete. Beyond these scientific and technical advances, this work provides rich educational opportunities for students across multiple disciplines. The project actively engages students through partnerships with community colleges and workshops, while developing hands-on curricula to prepare students for careers in the emerging bioeconomy, an area identified as a national priority.<br/><br/>This project develops a groundbreaking manufacturing approach to overcome fundamental limitations in quantum device fabrication. Currently, the semiconductor industry uses lithography?a technology for etching patterns onto silicon substrates to manufacture computer chips?but these methods fail to position quantum materials with the nanometer-scale precision needed. The project seeks to develop a sub-10 nanometer manufacturing framework for photonic quantum technologies through two complementary research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on spatially organizing individual quantum dots and quantum rods with sub-10 nm precision using DNA templates patterned on wafer-scale surfaces. A novel Cavity-Shape Modulated Origami Placement (CSMOP) technique is developed to position DNA templates with high fidelity and minimal background binding. Computer-aided design tools guide the patterning process, enabling predictive placement of quantum materials. The second thrust applies this approach to fabricate functional single-photon sources by integrating colloidal quantum emitters into photonic cavities coupled to waveguide circuitry. This research incorporates scalable biomanufacturing of DNA templates through bacterial fermentation and silicification of the resulting structures to ensure their long-term stability and performance. The integrated approach that spans the self-assembling biological molecule DNA with top-down lithography overcomes fundamental limitations of each technique on its own, establishing a general framework for quantum device fabrication that can be extended to other quantum materials including molecular qubits for transformative sensing and computing applications.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems and Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems in the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Workshop on Urban Mining and Circular Economy in Construction aims to develop a roadmap leading to the advancement and widespread adoption of circular economy in the construction industry. The worshop is scheduled to be held during May 2025 at Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Transitioning to a circular economy is urgent and vital to achieving significant decarbonization, enhancing national economic resilience and fostering national prosperity. This transformation will replace traditional linear construction practices- take, make, consume, and dispose ? with a sustainable, closed-loop system that minimizes waste, maximizes resource efficiency, and reintegrates materials into the supply chain. By promoting reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling, the circular approach enables locally available, high-value materials to be reclaimed through urban mining, driving sustainable innovation in the construction sector. Despite its potential, adoption is hindered by challenges such as the lack of advanced technologies, physical infrastructure, and digital systems, alongside entrenched reliance on new materials. Overcoming these barriers requires systemic changes to business models, policies, legislation, and workforce practices to unlock the economic and environmental benefits of building material reuse and recycling.<br/> <br/>This two-day workshop will convene a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders, including scientists, engineers, construction experts, policymakers, and social scientists, to identify barriers of urban mining and circular construction. Participants will collaboratively develop a roadmap for achieving a sustainable circular economy, while fostering innovation and knowledge-sharing through keynote presentations, panels, poster sessions, and networking opportunities.

The project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as engage Alabamian students across multiple education levels through activities that aim to inspire and prepare students for careers in science and technology.<br/><br/>This project will aim to develop a fundamental understanding of mixed ionic electronic conduction in conjugated polymers. The research will focus on probing polaron trapping in electrochemically active polymers using ultrafast near-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy. In this method, directly photoexciting polarons induces transient ion-polaron separation, leading to two key dynamical processes that report on their nanostructural environment and trapping. First, a transient Stark effect creates an electroabsorption signal that is sensitive to the electronic structure of surrounding polymer chains. Second, the picosecond re-equilibration kinetics of the ion-polaron pair report on trapping. In this project, experiments will be carried out to further develop this spectroscopy approach for probing polarons in working conducting polymer electrodes, and to elucidate how charge carrier dynamics can be controlled. Results could lead to chemical and structural design principles for enhancing mixed ionic-electronic conductivity in polymers to advance emerging technologies from flexible bioelectronics to electrochemical energy storage. The research concepts will also be integrated into multiple educational activities annually for middle-, high-school, and early undergraduate students, aiming to improve the Alabamian workforce in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current theoretical models fail to capture the complexity of real-world experiments, which involve millions of molecules interacting with a complicated photonic environment. To bridge this gap, this project will develop innovative simulation tools by integrating molecular dynamics, first-principles electronic structure methods, and computational electrodynamics.

Second, this project will develop a first-principles simulation approach to study electronic excited-state dynamics under both vibrational and electronic strong couplings, thus enabling a unified description of nonadiabatic processes under strong coupling. In addition, a semiclassical computational electrodynamics approach will be developed which treats the bulk molecular ensemble as a dielectric medium while explicitly simulating the quantum dynamics of impurity molecules. By combining these approaches, the aim is to advance the theoretical modeling of polariton chemistry and provide powerful computational tools for understanding strong light-matter interactions at experimentally relevant scales.

That is the idea behind neuromorphic computing, a new way to design computers inspired by how the human brain processes information. Unlike regular computers, which separate memory and processing, neuromorphic computers combine these functions. This makes them faster, more energy-efficient and better at handling large amounts of data. A promising approach called magnetic skyrmions could make these brain-like computers even better. Skyrmions are tiny, stable magnetic patterns that use very little energy. They could help create powerful computers that learn and adapt. However, controlling skyrmions with electrical signals and making them work on a small scale remains a challenge. This project will solve these problems by exploring new materials and their interface to improve skyrmion control. It will lead to more efficient, powerful computers, and provide hands-on learning opportunities for future scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>Neuromorphic systems, inspired by biological neural networks, require advanced materials and device architectures to replicate brain-like functions. Magnetic skyrmions?nanoscale, topologically protected spin structures?offer promising characteristics such as low energy consumption, stability, and high information density. However, controlling and scaling skyrmion-based devices remains a technical challenge, particularly in conventional heavy metal/ferromagnet systems where energy consumption and limited tunability hinder practical implementation. The objective of this research is to explore new materials and their interface to enable precise and energy-efficient control of skyrmions. Specifically, the project will investigate the ferroelectrics/ferromagnet interface, which has the potential to facilitate efficient electric-field manipulation of skyrmions due to broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling. This approach will allow for better control over skyrmion characteristics such as size, chirality, and density. The research tasks include (1) exploring new 2D ferroelectrics and ferromagnets, with a focus on room-temperature ordering, (2) fabricating and characterizing ferroelectrics/ferromagnet heterostructures, utilizing advanced microscopy techniques to observe skyrmion behavior, and (3) using electric gating to manipulate skyrmion properties. The project will integrate experimental investigations with theoretical modeling to understand the physical mechanisms governing skyrmion formation and control. By advancing the understanding of spintronic materials, the project will contribute to the development of next-generation computing technologies. Successful outcomes from this research could enable the development of more efficient, brain-inspired computing systems, fostering innovation in artificial intelligence and advanced data processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This catalyst is used industrially in hydrocarbon refining and has a rich and complex history. Most literature assigns the unique reactivity of this material to strong acid sites present from sulfate anions, while other reports suggest that pyrosulfate anions are the reactive centers that promote catalysis. This work shows that the pyrosulfate anion is responsible for activation of inert carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds in paraffins. This property is extended to activation of the inert bonds in polymer waste, a stream containing vast amounts of polyethylene and polypropylene that are difficult to recycle. The products of these reactions are processible oils that can be further functionalized using know catalytic technologies. Through these, and related studies, the chemistry of oxides containing pyrosulfate anions will help define this interesting class of catalytic materials. As part of this effort. Professor Matthew P.

Conley of the University of California, Riverside is studying the surface chemistry of sulfated zirconium oxide (SZO) materials. When considering the chemistry of SZO towards alkanes, the dominant view in the available literature is that Brnsted sites mediate all reactivity. This proposal provides a new mechanistic model to describe how alkanes interact with SZO; pyrosulfates behave as adsorbed SO3, a very strong Lewis acid capable of activating C?H bonds. The insights from this mechanistic proposal, supported by preliminary data, resulted in the formulation of a simple anion doped oxide as a catalyst for chain cleavage in polypropylene waste. Thus, a simple oxide can facilitate a reaction that is usually performed by a highly reactive organometallic or supported metal nanoparticle catalysts. The results from this mechanistic model also extends to other H-atom transfer reactions that, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the chemistry of SZO. Professor Matthew P.

This process offers a promising pathway to design materials with unique properties and applications. However, achieving self-assembly remains challenging due to the intricate interactions among the polymer chains. To understand these interactions, the researchers will employ sum-frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy, a technique that uses a combination of infrared and visible light to excite polymer vibrations, in order to determine their relative orientations.

However, in two dimensions, more exotic variants are possible. This project investigates anyons, emergent particles in two-dimensional materials that are neither fermion nor boson. The exotic properties of anyons are not only fundamentally fascinating but also hold potential for future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The research team searches for signatures of anyons by developing novel microscopic methods and exploring new classes of quantum materials. In collaboration with outreach programs, the team excites public interest in quantum physics through hands-on demonstration tours. The project also modernizes university experimental physics education by incorporating quantum information and machine learning methods, and it establishes an online platform to make two-dimensional material preparation more accessible to a broader research community.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Anyons, predicted in topological systems such as the fractional quantum Hall effects, exhibit behaviors governed by their unique quantum statistics. Theory suggests that exchanging two abelian anyons results in a fractional phase shift, while exchanging two non-abelian anyons causes a unitary transformation. Non-abelian anyons feature highly degenerate ground states that are topologically protected from perturbations and can only be altered through particle exchanges, known as braiding, making them excellent candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Although recent interferometry experiments have advanced in detecting abelian anyons, capturing signatures of non-abelian quantum statistics requires more than just extensions of current methods. In this project, the research team utilizes a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to probe and manipulate anyons. This method allows the team to directly visualize anyon wavefunctions, reveal their abelian and non-abelian statistics, and gather valuable real-space information. More importantly, the project leverages STM-induced potentials to manipulate the position of anyons while conducting interferometry, facilitating the demonstration of non-abelian anyon braiding. Furthermore, the project investigates fractional Chern insulators?the zero-field counterparts of the fractional quantum Hall effect?using STM to elucidate the origins of their spontaneous topological properties and potentially enable access to anyons without the need for large magnetic fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This lack of transparency limits trust in AI, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where understanding the reasoning behind decisions is essential. At the same time, decades of research have produced mature, well-established, and theoretically proven algorithms. This project introduces Algorithm-Informed Neural Networks (AINNs), a new approach that integrates these proven algorithmic principles into the design of neural networks. By embedding logical steps into AI architectures, AINNs enhance explainability, reliability, and efficiency, making AI systems more interpretable and reducing their dependence on large datasets. This advance is particularly beneficial in fields where data is scarce or sensitive, such as medical diagnostics or regulatory decision-making. By addressing these challenges, the project contributes to the development of trustworthy, transparent, and efficient AI technologies that can drive scientific progress and benefit society.  <br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the project is structured around two key research tasks. First, it focuses on algorithm-mapped neural models, which construct neural networks by systematically integrating well-established algorithmic logic. Instead of relying solely on training data, these models leverage predefined logical rules ? ranging from pseudocode to flowcharts ? to ensure reliability and trustworthiness in AI decision-making. This approach reduces training data requirements while improving generalization and interpretability. Second, the research develops latent behavior analysis of neural blocks, a novel debugging tool that enables AI systems to be systematically inspected for correctness. By analyzing the execution patterns of neural subnetworks, this method detects input-specific anomalies and traces them back to logical inconsistencies, facilitating targeted debugging and improving model robustness. The project will evaluate AINNs across diverse tasks, from algorithmic reasoning to perception-based applications, using key metrics such as data efficiency, error localization accuracy, and generalization performance. Expected outcomes include AI systems with greater transparency, lower data dependency, and enhanced reliability, making them more effective in real-world applications. The project will publicly release datasets, models, and tools to promote broader adoption of algorithm-informed AI across multiple domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their key predatory role in ocean ecosystems, it is important to understand how they capture prey in order to fully comprehend how they impact ocean food webs. Ctenophores are commonly thought to use sticky cells, called colloblasts, to capture prey. However, previous observations provide strong evidence suggesting that ctenophores use neurotoxic chemicals to anesthetize their prey and that this is the primary mechanism they use to capture and ingest prey. This study will investigate the role of these neurotoxic chemicals for prey capture by ctenophores by quantifying (a) how these chemicals incapacitate prey, (b) how common these chemicals are among different types of ctenophores, and (c) how effective these chemicals are on different types of prey. The project is expected to yield a transformative understanding of the mechanisms behind the remarkable success of a group of seemingly fragile marine predators that are unusually successful at capturing evasive prey. Understanding these toxins may open new opportunities for therapies and drug discoveries. In fact, it is likely this research will introduce a novel class of reversible anesthetic compounds. The nature of the research will foster engagement of many students in marine science, chemistry, and biomedicine.<br/><br/>Ctenophores, dominant marine zooplankton in coastal and oceanic ecosystems, can significantly impact global food webs through top-down control of zooplankton populations. Traditionally, their predatory success was attributed to adhesive cells (colloblasts) used for prey capture. However, new evidence reveals that ctenophores primarily rely on neurotoxic chemicals in their mucus to anesthetize prey, reshaping our understanding of their feeding strategies and prey selection. This project aims to investigate how ctenophore mucus toxins incapacitate prey, toxin prevalence across ctenophore species, and their effectiveness on various prey types. Objectives include: (a) measuring mucus effects on different prey taxa, (b) assessing how mucus influences prey retention and selection in target species, (c) determining the taxonomic distribution of toxic mucus among ctenophores, and (d) exploring the mechanistic basis of prey immobilization via mucus-ion channel interactions. This research is expected to yield a transformative understanding of the mechanisms behind the remarkable success of ctenophores that are unusually successful at capturing evasive prey. Understanding the action of ctenophore mucus toxins may open new opportunities for therapies and drug discoveries.

Historical observations have shown that oxygen concentrations are declining in many parts of the oceans, termed ?ocean deoxygenation?. The causes of the decline are linked to changes in surface water temperature and its impact on oxygen solubility, along with variations in the strength of the biological pump, ocean circulation, vertical mixing, ventilation, and biochemical processes. It is difficult to calculate exactly how much ocean oxygen has been lost to the atmosphere and how much has been redistributed within the ocean interior. This project will compare observation-based gridded oxygen datasets with the purpose of generating comparable four-dimensional (space and time) estimates of global oxygen distribution, assessing their similarities and differences and promoting scientific understanding of the drivers of ocean deoxygenation. The project will promote workforce development through support of an early career investigator, a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate interns.<br/><br/>The project has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the causes of disagreements between different gridded oxygen datasets by conducting an intercomparison of oxygen datasets from common in situ observational and model-based profiles. Many factors can affect estimates of a deoxygenation trend: existing observational studies use different sets of raw data, measurement platforms, data quality control metrics, land-ocean masks, vertical and horizontal grids and interpolation methods. Because variations in any of these factors can lead to different estimates, it is difficult to make direct comparisons and determine the causes of disagreements among datasets. Standardized protocols will be applied to isolate the interpolation method as the only source of discrepancy and to assess uncertainties in global oxygen inventory trends. The second goal is to test hypotheses for the underlying causes of ocean deoxygenation. The suite of new datasets will be used to evaluate the roles of oxygen solubility, the biological pump, and physical and biogeochemical processes driving global ocean deoxygenation. Further, the mechanisms driving the expansion of the tropical ocean oxygen minimum zones will be explored. The use of novel datasets with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution in these analyses will enable new insights into global and regional oxygen content changes. The suite of gridded oxygen datasets will be made available via public data repositories, and the results of the product intercomparisons and deoxygenation analyses will be disseminated via open-access papers. Collaboration with the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group 168 will enhance access and utility of gridded oxygen datasets through sharing and exchange of ideas, experimental protocols and data products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In safety-critical domains such as aviation and automotive systems, behaviors of cyber-physical systems are subject to stringent requirements both on safety and performance.  This project seeks to advance control design and run-time performance assurance of such systems.  Providing guarantees on safety and performance is challenging due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of their operating environments of these systems, as well as the need for real-time decision making and adaptation.  Traditional approaches to control design often fall short in handling the complexity of such systems.  There is, therefore, a pressing need for developing new theories, algorithms, and tools that can enable more effective and robust control of complex nonlinear cyber-physical systems. Such advances have the potential to significantly benefit design processes of many systems of societal importance, especially those that are safety critical such as airplanes, as well as manned and unmanned ground vehicles. This project will develop theory and algorithms that will enable efficient and assured design of complex nonlinear systems operating under tight constraints which may significantly reduce the high cost of complex system verification.<br/> <br/> <br/>To achieve these objectives, this project will develop theoretically grounded hybrid hierarchical representations for nonlinear systems that can be used for verification, correct-by-construction control, and learning. The key insight is to lift complex nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear constraints into a hybrid domain with local linearizations, where learning, control design, and monitoring can be done more efficiently. Efficiency will be achieved by 1) defining partial orders among hybrid liftings to enable refinement and improvement of representation accuracy adaptively as needed, 2) developing novel implicit invariant set computation methods for hybrid liftings, 3) developing incremental hybrid lifted model learning techniques that can incorporate physics-based priors and that are complemented with statistical model invalidation methods. The results will be demonstrated with applications in safety critical-control and monitoring of vehicle management systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrons can exist in two spin states: spin up or spin down. To separate electrons with different spins, magnetic fields are normally necessary. However, when electrons pass through layers of chiral molecules, one spin or the other can be preferentially transmitted, thus accomplishing this separation without magnetic fields. The origin of this chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is extensively debated and remains unclear. Professors Monti, Dubi and their students will combine sophisticated electron spectroscopies with detailed scattering theory to characterize the transmission of electrons passing through chiral molecules. Their discoveries could provide an experimentally tested and quantitative understanding of CISS, as well as new ways of harnessing spin-dependent effects in quantum-based technologies without the need for magnetic fields or complex device designs. The project will also provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as contribute to the development of a quantum-enabled STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to develop, test and implement a quantitative microscopic understanding of CISS. Professors Monti and Dubi will investigate CISS using cutting-edge spin- and angle-resolved photoemission methods from well-characterized and ordered films of near-identical chiral or achiral molecules on highly controlled metal substrates. Systematic and quantitative experimental observations of energy-, momentum-, and direction-dependence of excess spin, the critical fingerprint of CISS, will be compared with results from quantitatively correct scattering theories that range from mean-field to full microscopic descriptions. Both molecular and substrate parameters that could be responsible for CISS will be isolated and quantified, and their impact tested. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in carrying out highly controlled and sophisticated surface science experiments and computations to shed light on the mechanism of CISS, and to advance novel approaches in quantum information sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the drivers of exchange rates is a central objective of international macroeconomics and finance. Exchange rates are key prices affecting the relative cost of imports and exports, as well as the returns to investing in assets abroad. Yet exchange rates have long puzzled economists: they are inconsistent with benchmark models in economics and are very difficult to predict. This project makes progress on these puzzles by exploring the relationship between exchange rates and other international asset prices, such as bonds and stocks in different countries, as well as macroeconomic quantities, such as capital flows across borders. This research helps market participants use exchange rates to better understand macroeconomic conditions in the global economy. It also helps decision-makers better understand how monetary and fiscal policies affect exchange rates and thus the broader economy. The research findings could inspire innovative international policy frameworks, improve the well-being of U.S. households, businesses, and investors, and reinforce the U.S.'s leadership in global markets.<br/><br/>This award project explores exchange rates through the lens of general equilibrium models with international capital market frictions. These capital market frictions are reflected in a central role for global arbitrageurs to intermediate capital flows across borders. Such models thus allow the researchers to accommodate classic forces that have been thought to drive exchange rates, such as the supply or demand for goods, as well as drivers that have been proposed in more recent research, such as changes in the intermediation capacity of global arbitrageurs. The project includes research to decompose the drivers of the dollar exchange rate versus other advanced economies through the lens of such a model. The co-movements of exchange rates with bond yields, spreads in financial markets, and capital flows suggest a nuanced variance decomposition of exchange rates: at high frequencies, shocks to intermediation capacity play an important role in driving exchange rates, but at low frequencies and overall, demand shocks play the most important role. The project includes further research to understand the sources of demand shocks driving variation in these prices and capital flows. The researchers study the co-movements of exchange rates, bonds, and stocks to differentiate between potential sources of demand shocks. The project also includes research to understand how heterogeneous exposures to demand or intermediation shocks can explain differences in exchange rate behavior across countries. The researchers study how patterns in trade linkages and in net foreign assets give rise to heterogeneous effects of these shocks. The project finally includes research on the propagation of macroeconomic policies through exchange rates.  The researchers study whether state-dependence in the effects of foreign exchange rate intervention can account for mixed evidence on its effectiveness in the data. This research could help researchers and decision-makers gain deeper insights into exchange rates and their relationship with international asset prices, capital flows, and other macroeconomic factors, ultimately improving the well-being of the U.S. population and strengthening the country's leadership in international markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, organisms are not exclusively at the environment?s whim and mercy. Through their behavior, organisms can dictate their environmental conditions and guide the selective pressures they experience. Consider, for example, a lizard darting into the shade, a mouse digging a burrow, and humans building houses and engineering indoor heating or cooling. This project will test the idea that behavior can shield organisms from natural selection, modify adaptive response, and enhance the exchange of genetic material. The project will focus on anole lizards, a system that provides the variation and replication necessary to isolate the role of behavior in adaptation. The results of this study will provide a new lens on natural selection by illustrating the role that organisms exert over their own adaptive trajectories; all animals - including humans - can use behavior to negotiate their environments. This project contributes to a better prepared STEM workforce through student training. Educational modules will be developed for the undergraduate classroom, providing experiential learning in experimentation, bioinformatics, and statistics. The results from this project will be infused into a museum exhibit in the Yale Peabody Museum, which is free to all visitors and is the most visited landmark by Connecticut schoolchildren. Local educators and scientists will work together in summer workshops to develop educational modules for the museum exhibit that align with state curricula, providing experiential learning opportunities for K-12 students.<br/><br/>Natural selection is a powerful agent of evolution; shifts in temperature across environmental gradients, for example, should favor local adaptation and limit gene flow among populations. Yet, homeostatic behaviors like behavioral thermoregulation (e.g., basking) may buffer organisms from selection, and potentially create corridors for gene flow across environmental gradients. This project will investigate the genetic signatures of thermoregulatory behavior, and test whether homeostatic behaviors circumvent climatic obstacles to dispersal and enhance gene flow across environmental gradients. To do so, this project will leverage the replicated behavioral, physiological, and ecological diversity of anole lizards as an ideal study system. Thermal modification behavior will be quantified through detailed field studies, with preliminary results indicating that lizard species from canopied forests are poor thermoregulators while those from forest edges thermoregulate effectively. The connection between thermal behavior and the phenotype will be quantified by laboratory-based investigation of thermal and hydric physiology, and functional morphology. Preliminary results indicate that thermoregulating lizards exhibit physiological stasis across elevation, while thermoconformers exhibit the expected clinal pattern of local adaptation. Lastly, 3RAD sequencing will be used to infer patterns of gene flow across elevation, and those patterns will be compared among thermoregulators and thermoconformers. Preliminary results indicate that thermoregulating lizards exhibit high rates of gene flow across elevation, suggesting that buffering behaviors shield these animals from selection and facilitate gene connectivity among populations from environmentally dissimilar habitats.

When molecules are placed in carefully designed photonic structures that trap light, they often behave in surprising ways, forming new ?polariton? states that exhibit changes in charge and energy transport or chemical reactivity. These effects could transform photochemistry and catalysis, but they remain poorly understood and hard to predict. Professor Musser and his students will apply cutting-edge ultrafast laser-based techniques to a library of optical cavities in order to watch molecules inside move in real time and determine how their motions, which are fundamentally linked to reactive properties, are altered by the light-matter coupling. By isolating the unique dynamics of the polaritons, the team will establish how such photonic structures can be used to redirect molecular photochemistry without having to synthesize new molecules. Their studies could lead to new fundamental understanding of strong light-matter interactions and inspire new developments using polaritons for improved photocatalysts or light-emitting devices. The team will train multiple undergraduates in spectroscopy research and develop middle-school outreach programs focused on the nature of light and light-matter interactions.<br/><br/>A core premise behind the idea of polariton-controlled (photo)chemistry is that strong light-matter coupling distorts molecular potential energy surfaces.

By incorporating optical control pulses, the team will distinguish any unique polaritonic wavepacket dynamics and infer the associated changes to the potential energy landscape. Comparing these measurements over systematically tuned microcavities, the team will develop empirical guidelines for how to maximize such polaritonic distortions and thereby alter the dynamics of coherent photochemical processes. The results will lay the photophysical foundation and identify the key photonic and materials control knobs to dial in polaritonic effects.

One factor that determines whether a memory will endure or fade away is how it is processed during sleep. While we sleep, activity in brain networks that represent memories helps some memories survive and thrive. One unknown is whether sleep only helps a memory shortly after it is acquired, or whether it continues to improve memory for a long time thereafter. Previous research generally examines the role of sleep after only one sleep event; this project examines the contribution of multiple nights of sleep to memory, using a combination of behavioral, physiological, and computational methods. Whereas the current public discourse revolves around sleep?s short-term impact (?sleep well before your test?), the findings could highlight sleep?s lasting impact (?sleep well throughout the semester?).  <br/><br/>The research systematically examines the contribution of multiple nights of sleep to memory, using a combination of behavioral, physiological, and computational methods.

Agriculture has greatly benefited from the external application of nitrogen containing fertilizer, which is in large part responsible for current crop yields. Nitrogen use efficiency is a critical agricultural trait that depends on the plant?s ability to efficiently uptake nutrients from the soil and to transport and utilize those nutrients for maximum yields. A plant with improved nitrogen use efficiency will require less fertilizer that will save costs and have less negative results on the ecosystem. The size, shape and responsiveness of root systems are important contributors to how a plant uses available nitrogen. For example, large root systems have been observed to be more efficient at utilizing applied nitrogen, and roots that can rapidly modify their growth and architecture to maximize nitrogen uptake and its associated metabolism can increase the chances of plant survival when nutrients are scarce. Our project will deliver programmed plants with predictable and novel approaches to control root growth in response to nitrogen and to make plants use nitrogen more efficiently. The novel and broadly useful tools developed to engineering plants will also be available for the community.<br/><br/>Nitrogen (N) fertilizers are necessary to ensure high crop yields, but the production and application of fertilizers can disturb ecosystems. In addition, N-fertilizer production is highly energy demanding and cost intensive, representing a major challenge barrier to reliably ensure yield year after year. This project will develop tools to engineer desirable N-responsive traits and investigate their effects on nitrogen use efficiency. Engineered plants will be used to quantify how an enhanced root system contributes to improved uptake and use of externally applied nitrogen. Finally, synthetic optogenetic systems will be deployed to remotely control belowground development via the application of specific wavelengths of light to the plant canopy. All of these approaches will be employed in tomato to determine their effectiveness in a crop species.<br/><br/>This award was funded as part of a lead agency opportunity between NSF, UKRI-BBSRC (UK Research and Innovation - Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Lead) and DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft / German Research Foundation) where NSF funds the US investigator, UKRI-BBSRC funds the UK partner and DFG funds the German partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When a molecule absorbs light, it can be placed in two states at the same time, also known as a coherent superposition. These superposition states are short lived, fading away in less than 100 millionths of a billionth of a second, due to interactions of the molecule with its surroundings.  Professors McCamant, Franco, and their students will perform sophisticated femtosecond time-scale laser experiments to understand how specific molecular motions contribute to this rapid decoherence process.  These experiments will be interpreted in the context of theoretical models to learn how specific motions disrupt the electronic coherence.  Their discoveries could improve our understanding of how to manipulate electronic coherence via molecular design, with the potential to guide future molecular-based quantum technologies. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, contributing to the creation of a quantum-enabled workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed experiments will use Femtosecond Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy to reconstruct the spectral density of various families of organic dyes, and map decoherence pathways in molecules.  The spectral density, which reveals the coupling of electronic superposition states in molecules to vibrations and solvent, can be measured by determining the Raman cross-sections of these vibrations and modeling the Raman intensities and absorption spectra with spectroscopic theories. The chosen molecular families -- oligoacenes, fluorescent dyes and molecules used as single-photon emitters for quantum information application -- will exemplify how the decoherence changes with molecular size, rigidity, chemical functionalization and temperature. The analysis will further reveal the dominant vibrational modes responsible for decoherence, an understanding that is needed to develop chemical strategies for modulating this property.

This may expedite the anti-cancer drug development process and reduce excessive expenses during clinical trials, which may increase the R&D returns for pharmaceutical companies and reduce healthcare costs for the customers. Furthermore, the sooner that an efficacious anti-cancer drug can be brought to the market, the sooner that patients can directly experience improved health outcomes. Cancer has been one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. Development of safer and more effective anticancer drugs can provide patients the opportunity for both a longer and potentially better quality of life. The proposed technology may also have immense value for pharmaceutical companies. In drug development, researchers screen numerous compounds to understand drug efficacy and discard ineffective ones. 90% of drug candidates in the pipeline will fail, in part due to poor clinical translation. The product aims to help companies eliminate inefficacious drugs earlier before millions of dollars are spent on their development. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a more physiologically relevant, consistent, and versatile high-throughput screening (HTS) model to improve the translation rate between preclinical and clinical testing. Current drug screening approaches, which rely on two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and three-dimensional (3D) cell aggregates, fail to provide the necessary microenvironmental cues for accurately replicating human patient drug responses. Therefore, the proposed technology has been developed, aiming to strike a balance between throughput, which includes scalability and uniformity, and physiological relevance, such as the ability to modulate key attributes of the tumor microenvironment. Utilizing a tissue engineering toolset, the 3D hydrogel scaffold offers a more physiologically pertinent microenvironment for cell growth and drug response. Meanwhile, a patented microfluidic cell encapsulation platform allows for the rapid and consistent production of the products, which are essential for HTS applications. This project aims to 1) test additional cancer cell types to demonstrate the platform's broad applicability, 2) explore cryopreservation to reduce response time, and 3) transition to commercially available GMP-grade hydrogel precursors to improve reproducibility and scalability.

Much of the western U.S. is home to big sagebrush. This ecosystem supports many wild species and livestock grazing. However, big sagebrush communities are declining due to stress that causes loss of biodiversity. Because most ecosystems experience multiple stressors at once, it is important to learn how they work together to cause biodiversity loss. To study this, this project will test which combinations of threats are most likely to reduce the ability of these systems to recover and cause the loss of big sagebrush habitats. The project will also investigate if there are ways to manage livestock grazing to help sustain native plant species. The results will inform grazing practices for the western U.S. where livestock production is a significant economic driver.<br/><br/>The overall objective is to understand the likelihood of dryland state transitions resulting from the combined effects of multiple environmental drivers and determine to what extent transitions can be prevented using strategic livestock grazing, such as targeted grazing on invasive species. The project will co-produce data products with land management partners for a range of projected futures across large spatial scales to inform decision-making amid nonstationary, novel conditions, and to enhance the ability of managers to solve complex global change challenges. This project will integrate empirical data and simulation results from STEPWAT2, an individual-based plant model that explicitly represents fine-scale ecological and environmental processes relevant for drylands. Simulations will be used to test the individual and combined effects of these drivers under a comprehensive set of traditional and strategic grazing regimes to quantify the conditions where interacting environmental drivers are likely to lead to state transitions and whether strategic grazing can shift the competitive balance between native and invasive species and enhance ecological resilience. The project will advance the field of ecology by providing new insights into the likelihood of state transitions, along with identifying how plant community responses diverge based on life history traits and resource availability.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Population and Community Ecology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the U.S., delays in tasks such as tax filing result in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Reducing procrastination is crucial for lowering economic costs and improving well-being. Interventions such as breaking tasks into smaller subgoals and reducing the delay of reward are widely proposed in self-help books; however, their scientific foundation is lacking. Do these interventions truly work? For whom do they work most effectively? Why do they succeed or fail? This project applies cognitive science to answer these questions, providing a scientific foundation for designing more effective interventions tailored to individuals.<br/><br/>This research investigates how two specific interventions affect procrastination, who benefits most from them, and why these interventions succeed or fail from the perspective of cognitive mechanisms. Specifically, it examines the effects of reward immediacy and subgoal-setting strategies, focusing on interim deadlines and subgoal size. The project adopts a dynamic decision-making perspective, viewing procrastination as an ongoing process influenced by shifting cognitive costs and motivation, rather than a one-time choice. Using a newly developed naturalistic experimental framework, this project moves beyond traditional lab-based tasks to systematically assess intervention effects in realistic task settings. Statistical models analyze how intervention effectiveness varies based on individual characteristics, such as perfectionism. To uncover the cognitive mechanisms underlying procrastination, computational models are developed and tested against behavioral data. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of procrastination and lay the groundwork for more effective, personalized interventions that can improve productivity, reduce economic losses, and enhance overall well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, the investigators design advanced courses that incorporate major research findings from this project.<br/><br/>This research develops a scalable computational toolbox that allows for likelihood-based inference for exponential family graphical models. Probabilistic graphical models used to study relationships between multiple variables often involve an intractable normalizing constant, which precludes both maximum likelihood and fully Bayesian inference. Approximate methods, such as those based on pseudo-likelihood or score matching, provide the usual workarounds. However, full likelihood-based inference, when feasible, is statistically efficient. This project develops statistical tools that allow full likelihood-based inference for intractable graphical models that are both computationally and statistically efficient. Crucially, this also includes fully Bayesian procedures that produce automatic uncertainty quantification. These tools are extended to cover a broader class of models that are obtained by marginalizing over certain variables in the graph. These new models allow for nonparametric dependence structures between variables building on basic parametric models and are useful for item-response theory. Finally, new longitudinal models are developed to study the evolution of relationships between variables over time. A key ingredient in these longitudinal models is the decoupling of time-varying and subject-specific effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems contain scatterers, such as impurities or lattice imperfections, which can cause electrons to frequently change directions. The presence of disorder is often unavoidable in complex materials, including quantum materials. Conversely, disorder leads to fascinating phenomena, especially when quantum mechanical effects are important and interactions between the electrons are strong. <br/><br/>The project focuses on two key systems: <br/><br/>1.	The disordered electron liquid: The disordered electron liquid near where a metallic state transforms to an insulator in silicon-based transistors is a system for which the strength of interactions and disorder can be tuned by changing the density of electrons. Depending on the density, the material can either act like a metal at low temperatures, allowing electrons to flow freely, or like an insulator by blocking the electron flow. Despite much effort, the physical mechanisms causing this metal-insulator transition are still under debate. The aim of this project is to derive refined theoretical predictions for the transport of charges and heat on the metallic side of the metal-insulator transition with the goal to enable interpretation of experimental data that can advance understanding of this phenomenon. <br/>2.	Disordered quantum critical metals: The transport of heat in disordered quantum critical metals represents another focus of this project. In these systems, the interplay of disorder and the complex electron motion that arises from strong electron-electron interactions  near a zero-temperature phase transition can cause anomalies in the flow of charge and heat through the material. This research aims to compare charge transport and heat transport in quantum critical metals and to contrast the findings with conventional metals.<br/><br/>The proposed research will advance basic knowledge, and add to our understanding of semiconductors, a class of materials that are of great technological importance. In addition to its scientific merit, better knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of charge and heat transport holds promise for improving energy efficiency in electronic devices. This project also includes educational initiatives, including the development a new mathematical physics course for undergraduates, and a K-12 outreach activity that will be associated with the University of Alabama high school physics contest. In addition, the project will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports fundamental theoretical research and education on transport and thermodynamics in two paradigmatic disordered electron systems: the two-dimensional electron liquid, and quantum critical metals. The disordered electron liquid near the metal-insulator transition is an electron system close to a quantum phase transition, for which the strength of the two main factors, interaction and disorder, can be tuned externally. The physical mechanisms underlying the observed non-monotonic behavior of the resistance on the metallic side of the transition as well as the metal-insulator transition itself are under debate. Progress in the interpretation of the experimental data requires refined theoretical predictions. The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive theory of transport and thermodynamics near the metal-insulator transition. Thermal transport in disordered quantum critical metals represents another backbone of the project. In these systems, the interplay of disorder and the effective long-range interaction mediated by collective bosonic modes can result in characteristic non-Fermi liquid behavior of transport properties. A goal of this project is to obtain results for the Lorenz ratio, the ratio of thermal and electric conductivities, which is often used to quantify deviations from Fermi-liquid theory observed in experiments. <br/><br/>The main goals of the proposed research are: <br/><br/>1.	Disordered electron liquid near the metal-insulator transition: to derive detailed theoretical predictions for the temperature dependence of the resistance, the thermopower, the specific heat and the spin susceptibility of the disordered two-dimensional electron liquid near the metal-insulator transition. An important aim of this project is the interpretation of experimental findings in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors.<br/>2.	Thermal transport in strange metals: to explore thermal transport in a strange metal described by a two-dimensional generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with potential disorder and spatially random Yukawa coupling. <br/><br/>Both studies will be based on the nonlinear sigma-model formalism for disordered interacting systems.<br/><br/>Deepening knowledge of fundamental mechanisms of thermal transport may help improve energy efficiency in electronic devices. In synergy with the scientific plan, this project includes an education and outreach effort. This includes the development of a new course on mathematical physics tailored to undergraduates, and a K12 outreach activity that will be associated with the University of Alabama high school physics contest. Further impact of this project will lie in research training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This nanopatterning can leading to a rapid and low-cost alternative to the nanomanufacturing systems used today. Currently, nanopatterned technologies exist almost entirely within the semiconductor market and must meet the standards of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility, necessitate clean room infrastructure, and can require upwards of $10 million - $100 million of capital investment. This new nanomanufacturing technology platform uses a process called self-assembly, where the tiny building blocks automatically arrange themselves into organized patterns without much external help. This approach significantly reduces production costs and increases manufacturing efficiency. This approach may help pioneer new markets for nanotechnology, unlocking the potential of previously demonstrated nanotechnologies that were unprofitable due to the high capital requirements, while also helping to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in nanotechnology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a low-cost, large-area, and highly scalable nanomanufacturing platform. This solution leverages the self-assembly of colloids to create and define nanopatterns across a variety of substrate materials and substrate curvatures, with various colloidal materials, and without the need for a clean room environment. This self-assembly based nanopatterning system varies considerably from current existing technologies, such as photolithography and nanoimprint lithography, where strict clean room infrastructure is required, flat wafers are needed as substrates, and Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor CMOS-compatible processes must be used. This manufacturing technique could enable new fields of nanotechnology enhanced products, such as bactericidal medical implants, anti-reflection and light trapping nanostructured photovoltaics, and high efficiency thermal management devices for data centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural aerosol particles set the background conditions in Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, an understanding of the processes that determine the background is important to assess the influence of human activity. Marine sulfur compounds are a large source of natural aerosol to Earth's atmosphere. They undergo a cascade of atmospheric reactions that lead to either formation of new particles or growth of existing particles through competing gas and multiphase reaction pathways. Despite its importance, a complete understanding of this marine multiphase chemistry is lacking. This project will investigate controls on multiphase sulfur chemistry and provide chemical parameters that can be incorporated into large-scale atmospheric models. The project, in partnership with the CSU Education and Outreach Center, will create inquiry-driven STEM experiment kits that engage middle and high-school students in the scientific process through studying multiphase chemistry of acid rain. <br/> <br/>This project will use laboratory experiments and kinetic models to provide quantitative descriptions of the fate of multiphase biogenic sulfur fate in atmospheric particles and droplets.

Solvent environment effects on the kinetics of aqueous-phase O3 ozone reactions with dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol, and their oxidation products, will be quantified. Bulk rate constants and laboratory aerosol kinetics will be combined in a multiphase kinetic model to describe the fate of oxidized biogenic sulfur fate in aerosol.

These ulcers afflict millions of Americans, causing pain, loss of mobility, amputations, and potentially life-threatening infections. The average annual expenditure for diabetic foot care is $8,659 per patient resulting in cumulative costs of $9 to $13 billion in the United States alone. Foot ulceration often progresses to chronic infection, osteitis, and severe gangrene, resulting in over 100,000 amputations per year. The patented microneedle technology to be developed has significant commercial potential as a low-cost alternative for treating stalled wounds. By rapidly clearing the infections that block proper wound healing, the product will garner significant market share based on its ability to speed healing. The initial target market will generate approximately $4.2 M per year and is expected to accelerate rapidly when implemented nationwide. This will further increase as the product is adopted into adjacent markets. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an advanced wound care product that disinfects diabetic foot ulcers using a patented microneedle patch design that delivers three potent therapeutic agents, each of which participates in different aspects of wound healing. These agents are time-released to further enhance their function. Once the microneedle patch is applied to a recently debrided diabetic foot ulcer, a powerful antibiotic will be released to establish a bacterial killing zone in the dermal tissue of the wound. A second agent will prevent the re-formation of a bacterial biofilm, and a third agent known as a chemokine will attract and activate white blood cells to rapidly clean-up the infected area and kill any residual bacteria. Once the microneedle tips dissolve, a channel will open which facilitates wound drainage. Initial work will be performed using skin tissue cultures, followed by testing using diabetic pigs. The microneedles are expected to kill the bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It will also prevent any surviving bacteria from forming biofilms, and mop-up any remaining bacteria by activating the innate immune system. Once these wounds have been disinfected the wound will resume normal healing over the ensuing weeks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to their photovoltaic properties, certain hybrid perovskites exhibit molecular ferroelectricity?a characteristic that enables efficient charge storage and switching. This property holds significant potential to enhance the performance of solar cells and electronic devices. However, the soft and dynamic nature of their ionic lattice poses considerable challenges in understanding and precisely controlling ferroelectric behavior. In this research project, the research team aims to find new ways to control ferroelectricity in hybrid perovskites using light instead of electricity. By using light, the team will avoid problems caused by the materials? soft structure and unwanted reactions during testing. The goal is to create materials that have stable ferroelectric properties even at room temperature. This could lead to the development of new, efficient electronic devices such as memory storage systems that use light to switch states, rather than relying on physical electrical contact. Furthermore, the PI aims to inspire and train the next generation of scientists by involving broad range of students in cutting-edge research. Through hands-on demonstrations and outreach to young learners, from preschoolers to high school students, the project will spark interest in science and technology. The project will also enable real-world applications, such as improving data storage or creating new ways to control electronic devices using light.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This project will investigate light-induced ferroelectric polarization in hybrid halide perovskites to address limitations in traditional approaches to ferroelectric characterization. Ferroelectricity in 3D lead-based hybrid perovskites (e.g., MAPbI3) is hindered by their soft ionic lattice, rapid structural dynamics, and unwanted ionic effects near interfaces during electric-field-based measurements. Instead, the PI will explore a hypothesis that an optically induced electric field can avoid these issues and allow precise control over crystal structure polarization, paving the way for enhanced dynamic lattice distortion critical for generating ferroelectric polarization. The approach combines novel materials design with advanced spectroscopy tools to uncover metastable polar phases in halide perovskites, stabilizing them at ambient conditions. These transient non-equilibrium polar states, typically absent from phase diagrams, offer opportunities for non-contact manipulation of ferroelectric domains using light. By bridging the gap between transient and long-lived polar phases, the research team will aim to unlock their potential for functional ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and multiferroic applications. This five-year project will focus on probing light-matter interactions in soft dielectric halide perovskites. By stabilizing metastable polar phases and understanding their dynamics, the team will aim to advance the fundamental knowledge of ferroelectric and multiferroic phenomena in these materials system, addressing key challenges in achieving long-lived, stable polarization states under ambient conditions. Additionally, the project will emphasize broadening participation in STEM, offering mentorship and training opportunities to students, and engaging young learners through outreach initiatives to inspire the next generation of innovators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing new methods and materials allowing such manipulation of magnetic properties is essential to advancing next-generation spintronic devices. This project seeks to establish precise causal links between ferromagnetic material properties and universal torque behavior. The outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact on the knowledge and understanding of novel magnetic materials. This project engages students across educational stages, modernizes an advanced lab course, and provides hands-on physics learning to underrepresented middle and high school students. By providing participants with essential skills for developing next-generation semiconductor technologies, this project seeks to strengthen the domestic talent pool and enhance the economic competitiveness of the U.S.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Spin-transfer torque and spin-orbit torques have enabled control of the magnetization vector in magnetic materials using electric fields or currents. Recent breakthroughs in self-generated planar and anomalous Hall torques have expanded the range of materials capable of generating giant spin-orbit torques. These torques are self-generated as they act on the same ferromagnet where the spin current is produced. Alongside spin Hall torque, planar Hall and anomalous Hall torques form a triad of universal Hall torques, which are expected to arise in all magnetic conductors. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving these torques remain poorly understood. This project aims to achieve a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge and spin transport in the triad of Hall effects and how it induces self-torque on the magnetization of magnetic materials. Spin-orbit torque characterization within this project entails spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements in nanowire structures fabricated by magnetron sputtering and e-beam lithography. This project seeks to establish precise causal links between ferromagnetic material properties, in particular electronic band structure and material interfaces, and universal Hall torque behavior to uncover the microscopic mechanisms underlying these torques. The anticipated results are expected to advance the fundamental understanding of coupled charge-and-spin transport and coherent spin manipulation in ferromagnetic conductors. This knowledge has the potential to transform the design and development of next-generation spintronic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, negatively charged alginates obtained from brown algae are used in food products as thickening and stabilizing agents. Likewise, positively charged chitosan can be found in wound-healing bandages as a blood coagulation agent. The combination of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in aqueous media can form polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs). The proposed research investigates the application of electrochemical processes to control the complex formation, a phenomenon not widely reported in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed research will explore how the application of an electric field can cause the adhesion of two oppositely charged ionic gels of polyelectrolytes. The factors that control the properties of PECs, the adhesion between oppositely charged ionic gels, and the disintegration of ionic gels and complexes will be investigated by changing the nature of charged polymers, both of synthetic and natural origin.  The ability to control the properties of PECs will advance their applications in many areas, including biomedical, adhesives, food, and personal care products.  The electric field-induced dissociation of ionic gels can provide pathways for the degradation and reuse of polymer gels. The understanding of the electric field-induced adhesion of ionic gels can be translated into development of adhesives for demanding applications such as biomedical adhesives. The proposed research results will be widely disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and through conference presentations. The new generation workforce will be trained through active participation in cross-disciplinary research activities and coursework related to this research and overall polymer science. New K-12 students will be inspired to pursue STEM education through laboratory demonstrations.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This project aims to understand how natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes respond to an applied electric field in both solution and gel form. The underlying factors that dictate i) the electroformation of complexes of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and their electrodeposition on electrodes through electrochemical processes and ii) the electric field-induced dissociation of ionic gels and adhesion between two oppositely charged ionic gels will be assessed by using state of the art characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks. The underlying mechanisms for electroformation, electrodeposition, electroadhesion, and degradation will be understood and linked to the physicochemical properties of PEs, including their molecular weight and charges per chain. For the electroformation processes, the impact of various factors that dictate the outcome of the process and properties of the resulting PECs, such as the polymer concentration, the ratios of molecular weight and charges of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, and environmental conditions used, (e.g. doping with salts) will be investigated. The structure of PECs will be determined by using different microscopy and scattering techniques.  For the electroadhesion between oppositely charged ionic gels, how the network properties and applied field in tandem affect the adhesion strength via control of the gel-gel interface will be elucidated. The scientific outcomes of this project will be (i) a new pathway for PEC formation via electrochemical processes and (ii) design principles for adhesives through electroadhesion between oppositely charged ionic gels. Overall, a fundamental structure-property relationship for polyelectrolytes subjected to an electric field will be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet despite the importance of forming veridical beliefs, there is considerable debate about whether human belief revision is fundamentally rational, or whether beliefs are frequently distorted by non-rational influences and motivations, such as the desire to feel positively or to maintain one's social identity. This project examines how individuals differ in their susceptibility to different influences, and what makes people revise their beliefs more rationally. Insights from this project promise to improve scientific and health communication as well as promote better individual and collective decision-making.<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the latent associations and cognitive processes driving people's belief revision by quantifying four types of belief revision distortions: valence-driven distortions (i.e. ?good/bad news?), identity-driven distortions, self-serving distortions (e.g. beliefs about one?s own intelligence), and conservatism (too-weak updating). Prior studies examining these influences have often focused on estimating an average effect of a single form of distortion in flawed or contentious behavioral paradigms. Advancing over this prior work, the current project quantifies distinct distorting influences at the level of individual participants, with independent verification of these measurements across multiple, controlled tasks supporting comparison of human behavior against a well-defined rational standard. By measuring at the individual level, and with verification across tasks, this project hopes to determine whether individuals reliably differ from one another in the rationality of their belief revision and explore the latent factor structure of these differences. Through these advances in measurement, the project develops a platform for the rigorous examination of the correlates of rationality in belief revision, and for examining the evidential and cognitive processes underlying belief revision.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A problem of central concern for both practitioners and methodologists has been the development of techniques for the identification and characterization of the relationships between exogenous covariates; for example, similarity in personal attributes, geographic proximity, or embeddedness in specific social contexts.  One route to this goal is via the use of kernel learning, a data-efficient machine learning strategy based on the use of functions known as ""kernels"" that capture the similarity between complex data objects.  In a network context, kernels have been most heavily exploited in the field of chemometrics, where kernels for features of small unlabeled and partially labeled graphs representing molecular structures have been used for drug discovery and related applications. This project will build on these ideas and traditional methods in network regression and exploratory network analysis to develop new methods for social network analysis. Core aims of the project include advancing network regression methods using kernel learning, developing new families of kernels for comparative analysis of social networks, and kernel-based extensions of the widely used exponential family random graph modeling framework (a highly generalizable approach to network modeling).

In turn these phytoplankton provide food for nutritionally and commercially important shellfish and finfish. The sediments also store carbon and filter excess nutrients from the water column, thereby improving water quality. This project is focused on bringing together a variety of data sources - from observations to modeling results for the Northeast United States. This region was chosen because it is relatively data rich compared to other areas and plays an important role in the US blue economy. A literature review and synthesis will be conducted to gather relevant data, and these data will be evaluated to find patterns of variation. Ocean models will then be used to assess changes across this region that could happen on the short and long-term. Sediment data will also be compared to water column data to see how they are connected, and if their connection is changing over time. This study will engage the scientific community to develop best practice guidelines for sediment data collection and develop community driven priorities for future sediment research studies. The project will provide training for a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher and support workshops for both scientists and stakeholders.<br/><br/>The seafloor plays a major role in influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations, low-oxygen zones in the ocean, and ocean acidity, and represents the only geologic-scale storage of oceanic carbon. The sediments in coastal areas are particularly important as it is estimated that they account for ~70% of ocean carbon burial. Coastal sediments also recycle nutrients to the water column, fueling future water column primary production, and they can improve water quality via nutrient removal. Despite their importance, coastal sediments are poorly sampled relative to the water column, with large spatiotemporal gaps in datasets of nutrients and biogenic gas fluxes. The paucity of coastal sediment flux data leads to incomplete estimates for carbon, oxygen, and nutrient budgets in the ocean. Synthesizing disparate datasets of benthic variables therefore addresses an urgent need to improve the understanding of the role of sediments in the carbon and nutrient cycling in coastal regions at multiple timescales. This effort would further the understanding of mechanisms and environmental conditions influencing benthic dynamics, and consequently the role they play in driving pelagic biogeochemical cycles. The project seeks to do this by focusing on the Northeast US (NE-US), which is a relatively data-rich region. Specifically, existing long-term sediment and water column datasets from the NE-US, model output, and re-analyses will be combined to evaluate the role of different environmental conditions on benthic fluxes of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients. The project will characterize flux patterns in this region, help interpret the larger context these fluxes were observed in, co-locate different benthic fluxes and related variables in space and time to evaluate their relationship to changing environmental conditions, and develop community driven guidelines for data use and future observations. This project will support an early career scientist, one Ph.D. student, and one postdoctoral researcher. Results from this study will be disseminated through publications, presentations at scientific conferences, workshops with stakeholders and public outreach events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A microservice architectural approach is used to develop software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. The challenge comes when these systems evolve. System developers can foster expertise in individual microservices and their specific domains, but problems can occur when changes impact other microservices. Developers quickly lose track of microservices dependencies. This solution addresses these challenges in microservice architecture maintainability and quality by providing just-in-time insights into the architectural impact of changes. The goal is to provide change impact analysis of cloud-native systems alongside quality assurances to improve system evolvability and reliability.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of change impact analysis of cloud-native systems alongside quality assurance. The solution uses static code analysis tailored to distributed, component-based development to enable holistic reasoning and reduce change impact propagation issues. Improperly managing change impact may lead to costly errors during development, including increased communication overhead and delays. Improper management also results in challenges in identifying and addressing the impacts. The technology addresses a critical need for solutions capable of operating across multiple microservice codebases, supporting developers with change impact analysis to prevent inconsistencies and production errors in the system. This tool is designed to automatically generate a comprehensive system representation overview (intermediate representation) by analyzing codebase artifacts, offering practitioners insights into the potential impacts of individual changes on the system-wide interconnected components. In addition, the tool is designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing development and operations pipelines, serving as a quality assurance checkpoint at each stage of system changes. This technology may move the distributed systems community toward a more efficient, systematic process, improving evolvability and reliability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The traditional focus on one-off decisions may have limited impact. The idea of regulatory scope is to reduce the psychological distance of future behavioral consequences and current behavior choices by expanding an individual's range of concern or the scope of outcomes an individual considers. This is hypothesized to be achieved by exercises that help an individual recognize behavioral patterns in order to make choices guided by longer term consequences versus shorter term needs. The project tests this theory of regulatory scope on choices made. Expanding regulatory scope has the potential to be applicable to several domains of behavior change, including resilience and personal health. <br/><br/>Specifically, this research focuses on expanding regulatory scope: the range of considerations that people account for in their decisions and behaviors to include further off outcomes and possibilities. Through the framework of regulatory scope, the researchers provide a comprehensive account of resilience-related behavior and behavior change, explaining past phenomena and predicting future ones. The primary aims of this proposed project are to (1) assess the relationship between regulatory scope and existing resilience behaviors; (2) determine how regulatory scope manipulations influence resilience behavior intentions; and (3) evaluate the effect of a practical real-world change in regulatory scope on persistent resilience behavior change. These three aims are met through a combination of cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal experiments to test and evaluate regulatory scope and provide guidance for a new class of interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of this is eaten by tiny organisms who rely on oxygen to consume the methane, a process called 'methane oxidation'. Oxygen levels vary naturally throughout the world?s oceans, so it is not known whether the ability of these organisms to consume methane is disrupted in some places. Custom one-of-a-kind instruments to measure methane consumption rates and monitor what organisms are present have been built by the investigators. The instruments will be sent to the bottom of the ocean for weeks and in different locations. The goal is to see how methane oxidation and the types of organisms present adjust to different oxygen concentrations and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>Natural gas seeps along the continental margins inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying waters. This methane is largely oxidized by microbes. Although microbial methanotrophs are largely microaerophilic, it is not known how differences in oxygen concentrations enhance or hinder their ability to respond nor whether methane consumption rates are controlled by deep-sea oxygen concentrations. Recent work has shown that microbial aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) in the deep sea occurs with widely varying rate constants. The project is to explore factors that drive this variation by making in situ measurements of MOx and microbial community dynamics at known seep sites offshore Louisiana, an area with frequent episodic methane releases, and on the Cascadia Margin offshore Oregon where highly variable bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) will provide vital evidence for how oxygen limitation affects MOx in situ. The in situ measurements are possible due to newly-developed benthic landers that can make MOx rate measurements on timescales of hours to weeks using advanced laser methane and optode DO sensors. An in situ collection and incubation scheme allows collection of microbial time-series, tracking the relative abundance of methanotrophs (through 16S rRNA surveys and metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) to study methanotrophic responses to varying ambient conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast, in eukaryotes, each nuclear gene has its own regulatory sequence, and each gene leads to a separate transcript encoding a single protein. A few organisms in the animal kingdom show exceptions to this paradigm, and transcripts encoding multiple proteins have recently been found in green algae, which are related to land plants. This suggests that the expression of clusters of genes resulting in transcripts encoding multiple proteins might be more common in the plant kingdom than previously thought. This project uses DNA and RNA sequencing, bioinformatics approaches, and a combination of in vitro and in vitro experiments to explore the presence and functional significance of transcripts encoding multiple proteins among species in the plant kingdom. Plants are the primary producers on our planet, and a better understanding of the mechanisms they employ for gene expression, may enable new approaches for plant breeding. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to engage learners of all ages and increase exposure to STEM disciplines. The education-by-research component of this project will help inspire and train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Recent studies have provided evidence of polycistronic gene expression in diverse green alga, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of polycistronic mRNAs among Chlorophytes. Polycistronic mRNAs in land plants have often been regarded as the result of accidental read-through, and little research has studied the prevalence of polycistronic gene expression across Archaeplastida. This CAREER project aims to determine how widespread polycistronic expression is in Archaeplastida and investigate its functional and evolutionary significance. Research activities will (1) generate a map of the polycistron landscape of key Archaeplastida species using long-read sequencing platforms for whole genome sequencing and poly(A)-tailed RNA sequencing, along with database mining and bioinformatic approaches; (2) study the evolutionary dynamics of polycistronic transcripts through ribosome deep sequencing to assess active translation; and (3) investigate the mechanisms of polycistron translation using in vivo and in vitro assays. These experiments will test the hypothesis that polycistrons are evolutionarily conserved at the structural and functional levels within Archaeplastida. The project integrates an education and outreach program, which includes Science Discussion Seminars and training in all aspects of research. It also includes science demonstrations, hands-on activities, and the development of educational materials for K-12 students and the public. A central product of these efforts will be a public database documenting polycistronic sequences across Archaeplastida species. The outcomes of this research are expected to significantly advance our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of gene organization and expression in Archaeplastida and shed light on the broader implications of polycistronic gene regulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These panels offer a power conversion efficiency of 20% and lower manufacturing costs compared to existing technologies. The global market for perovskite solar cells is expected to reach approximately $3 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56.5%. The key metric for the success of the perovskite solar market is its stability. With a projected lifespan exceeding 25 years, a global market share of at least 1% is projected in the short term, resulting in annual revenue of $30 million by 2030, which is expected to grow significantly. Investment in the manufacturing of this type of technology is important for achieving energy security and independence for the United States.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in manufacturing high-performance mixed halide-based perovskite solar cells with long-term stability. To address the limitations of previous perovskite-based technologies, the focus is on improving stability by tackling both extrinsic factors (such as moisture and heat) and intrinsic factors (like halide ion movement within the perovskite material) that contribute to cell degradation. The more severe internal degradation is prevented through two-dimensional perovskites and ultra-thin atomic layer deposition (ALD) coated buffer layers, significantly mitigating ion migration. Additionally, the buffer layers serve as suitable moisture barriers, enhancing protection against extrinsic degradation factors. This technology is unique because it addresses instability challenges from the inside out, leveraging novel buffer layers and encapsulation methods to provide the superior durability needed for mainstream commercialization. Compared to conventional solar cells, perovskites can be manufactured using simple, solution-based, and low-temperature processing techniques (approximately 100-150C versus around 1400C for silicon), which reduces costs. Project objectives include: 1) Enhancing stability of the perovskite material to support a 30-year solar cell lifetime, 2) Constructing perovskite-based cells on flexible substrates, enabling application across a broad range of markets, and 3) Demonstrating roll-to-roll manufacturability, validating ease of scaleup and implementation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies suggest that plastics are now a major source of dissolved organic material in these regions of the ocean. Therefore, it is important to consider plastic-derived organic material as part of the ocean carbon cycle and understand its effects on ocean biology. This project will test the idea that bacteria in ocean surface waters consume plastic-derived organic matter, and in doing so they compete with phytoplankton for key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. The investigators will utilize a combination of laboratory experiments, field sampling, and numerical modeling to explore this hypothesis. The project will support two graduate students and an undergraduate student researcher. The investigators will share their research with policy makers and with the general public, with a focus on middle and high school aged students.  <br/><br/>The core hypothesis of this project is that ?nutrient-theft? by bacteria when consuming plastic-derived dissolved organic carbon (pDOC) results in sufficient drawdown of nitrogen and phosphorus in surface waters to reduce new production and the strength of the biological carbon pump, especially in the subtropical gyres where microplastic abundance is greatest and nutrients are at a minimum. The team will test this hypothesis using an ecosystem-biogeochemistry model (CESM-MARBL) augmented to include explicit representation of marine bacterial growth, nutrient use, and pDOC all parameterized using novel empirical knowledge gained through shipboard fieldwork, photochemical studies to improve estimates of pDOC photoproduction rates, and bioassays to determine the kinetic parameters of bacterial nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in response to pDOC fertilization. Global ocean model runs will simulate spatiotemporal change in net primary productivity, nitrogen- and phosphorus-based new production, and the strength of the biological carbon pump. Model simulations will be run with no added pDOC, 1948-present pDOC fertilization rates, and with predicted future pDOC fertilization based on business-as-usual increases in surface ocean plastics until 2100. These model simulations will test the core hypothesis by assessing how nutrient theft due to pDOC fertilization is altering ocean biogeochemistry and reducing the strength of the biological carbon pump today and through the 21st century.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These challenges are addressed by a cuffless blood pressure monitoring technology integrated into smart shoes, providing a seamless solution for continuous blood pressure monitoring. By embedding the sensor in footwear, the technology may non-invasively monitor vascular conditions and estimate blood pressure, aiding in the early detection and prevention of peripheral arterial disease. This technology has the potential to impact public health by enabling early detection of conditions such as hypertension and peripheral arterial disease, especially in aging populations.

The technology is based on research that demonstrated multimodal pressure sensors could be used for continuous monitoring of full pulse waveforms. Traditional cuff-based systems are often unsuitable for continuous monitoring, while current cuffless solutions have limited accuracy and consistency. This monitoring technology addresses these challenges by integrating advanced pressure sensors within smart shoes to capture pulse waveforms from the foot. The system leverages the external cyclic pressure exerted during walking, enabling the continuous acquisition of pulse data without the need for an external setup. Machine learning algorithms are used to extrapolate the external pressure at which the pulse waveform shape flattens, corresponding to vein occlusion, thereby estimating blood pressure with high accuracy. This technology not only eliminates the need for bulky cuffs but also offers a scalable and user-friendly solution for continuous blood pressure monitoring.

This device is based on a single-walled carbon nanotube electrode architecture that leverages tandem metabolic pathway-like reactions for electrochemical analysis, enabling broad-spectrum metabolite detection. This technology integrates cofactors, self-mediates reactions at maximum enzyme capacity, and employs multifunctional enzymes to facilitate accurate metabolite sensing while mitigating interference. Proof-of-concept studies on a set of 12 key metabolites and nutrients have demonstrated a 100-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio with multi-day operational stability. This technology demonstrated precise and non-invasive monitoring of highly diluted endogenous metabolites and nutrients in saliva, and robust in-vivo continuous monitoring of metabolites in the blood and brain environments. This solution may allow the use of saliva to monitor metabolites that are key indicators of physiological systems, reducing healthcare costs, improving patient adherence, and enhancing overall health outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although such ?mind-wandering? is often thought of as something to be avoided, recent research suggests that mind-wandering may help to commit memories to long-term storage, a process known as memory consolidation. Mind-wandering and memory consolidation are typically studied separately, but new evidence suggests that these two mental processes use the same neural resources: specifically, the ?reactivation? of memories in the brain?s hippocampus region and the activation of a set of connected brain regions known as the default mode network. This project involves development of a new approach based on real-time brain imaging that aims to better understand whether memory consolidation has an impact on the content of spontaneous thoughts?and in turn, whether mind-wandering impacts memory consolidation. The overall goals are to develop a new tool and to advance understanding of how memories are retained for the long term.  Additionally, this work includes STEM training and education for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The project addresses a specific problem that stems from a known feature of reactivation of memory events in the hippocampus: these events support memory consolidation but occur spontaneously at unpredictable times. Given this unpredictability, it is difficult to obtain samples of thoughts or behaviors at the precise time that these reactivation events occur. The goal of this research is to develop a new approach, based on real-time analysis of neuroimaging data, that allows precise alignment in time between memory reactivation events, activation in the default mode network, and samples of thought. In a computational simulation as well as an experiment conducted in human participants, the research uses analyses of multivariate patterns to detect reactivation events in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data. The project focuses on verifying that this method can be used in a valid manner within a real-time analysis system to trigger samples of thought that are aligned in time to neural reactivations. Taken together, the research looks to deliver a new tool that can be applied to determine when and how spontaneous thoughts may help or harm the formation of memories, potentially leading to further development of real-time neural measures to trigger interventions for enhancing learning and memory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Agricultural practices could be improved by using biotechnology to manipulate crop traits or to replace expensive pesticides with plant-produced, affordable compounds. However, both approaches require engineering multiple genes or pathways to yield predictable outcomes. Thus far, predicting the expression in plants of synthetic genes and pathways, even those composed of well-characterized DNA sequences, remains a major challenge. Indeed, when individual pathway genes are assembled into larger designs, their performance becomes unpredictable because regulatory elements and genic regions that encode proteins show strong context-dependent properties. Moreover, plant biotechnology relies on only a handful of regulatory elements, often of bacterial and viral origin, that constitutively and ubiquitously drive gene expression, interfering with growth and reducing crop yields. This lack of programmable and tunable regulatory elements contributes to unpredictable gene expression through expression interference and silencing. Together, the results of this study will enable the construction of multi-gene cassettes in which the expression of each gene is induced in response to a specific stimulus and at a specified level to produce optimal pathway flux. These efforts will generate large numbers of programmable and tunable regulatory elements and combinations of elements for future synthetic biology efforts in plants. Beyond transgenes, the ability to ?program? plants with predictable expression characteristics will deliver breakthroughs in manipulating endogenous pathways that control plant growth and yields, thereby making feasible the targeted engineering of resilient and high-yielding crops. <br/><br/>This project exploits a toolbox of novel experimental and computational strategies pioneered by  this interdisciplinary collaborative team to make plant gene expression predictable by constructing programmable and tunable multi-gene cassettes that produce antifeedants and insect pheromones as alternatives to traditional pesticides. There are three objectives, each one testing novel hypotheses as to the causes of specific challenges: 1) to develop a large repertoire of programmable and tunable synthetic regulatory elements, massively parallel reporter assays, machine learning and in silico evolution will be used; 2) to control gene expression levels more precisely through insulation and RNA stabilization, recent innovations in vaccine research will be applied to identify and test plant-based insulators in multi-gene cassettes while innovative computational machine learning strategies will be used to design optimized gene versions with increased RNA stability and codon usage; and, 3) to determine expression-limiting features, genetic engineering and a new single-molecule method to explore chromatin architecture will be used to manipulate gene order and position, DNA shape, torsional stress, and nucleosome occupancy.

Results from the first four years of OSNAP observations have challenged the current understanding of overturning circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic.  This grant provides funding for an additional four years of observations in order to deliver to the community a ten-year time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar basin. Variations in these quantities have been invoked to explain changes in a wide range of physical, chemical and biological parameters in the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas, and Arctic Ocean. Thus, by quantifying Atlantic meridional overturning variability and understanding its drivers, OSNAP is providing a critical first step towards addressing societally-relevant, interdisciplinary questions concerning the melting of Greenland ice and Arctic sea-ice, heat content in the Arctic Ocean, climate of the Nordic Seas, and anthropogenic carbon storage. The researchers will actively engage the broader international communities through four workshops, each targeting a societally relevant theme: 1) ocean biogeochemistry and carbon sequestration; 2) overturning in ocean models; 3) Arctic cryosphere; and 4) Nordic Seas variability. Two new postdocs and one graduate student will be supported in this phase of OSNAP and will benefit from the diversity of methodologies and exposure to the large number of OSNAP international scientists. In addition, approximately 20 graduate students from different US and international institutions will receive field training through participation in OSNAP cruises through 2024.<br/><br/>The first four years of data from the OSNAP observing system have shown that the eastern subpolar region, from Greenland to Scotland, dominates the mean meridional mass and heat transport in the subpolar North Atlantic, while more than half of the total meridional freshwater transport occurs across the Labrador basin.  Based on the success of the previous work, this project extends the time series and address the following critical questions: 1. What governs overturning variability in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre on intra-seasonal to interannual time scales? 2. What are the sources of freshwater across the OSNAP section and what governs their variability? 3. What are the impacts of the meridional heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar gyre? Additional motivation for this next phase of OSNAP is provided by the fundamental advancements in our understanding of subpolar North Atlantic dynamics and variability, that will result from the four main U.S. OSNAP mooring arrays, individually and in combination with other OSNAP observations. Further observations are expected to provide a strong observational basis for a new paradigm of overturning in this region, which will include an understanding of the linkage between dense water formation and overturning - a connection present in climate models, yet unobserved to date. Additionally, this this work will further quantify the structure and transport of the upper and deep ocean boundary currents off the east and west coasts of Greenland and within the Iceland Basin, as well as determine their variability and forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variation in how selective females are, termed choosiness, is common. Choosiness shapes which males' genes enter the next generation and plays a key role in speciation. However, despite its central role in numerous evolutionary processes, basic questions about variation in choosiness and its genomic basis remain poorly understood. Using crickets as a study system, this project aims to examine whether females differ reliably in their choosiness for male song and how much of those differences among females reflect their genetics. Using gene expression and genetic mapping experiments, this project also aims to identify candidate genes underlying variation in choosiness. One of the broader impacts of this project explore the use of alternative tools (dance) for teaching animal behavior to college and K-12 students as a complement to typical written and spoken approaches.<br/><br/>Choosiness describes how discerning an individual is in mate choice, and the dramatic differences animals demonstrate in choosiness has major implications for selection and speciation. Yet our understanding about variation in choosiness remains poor compared to our understanding of which traits are favored. This imbalance hinders our ability to answer crucial questions about individual differences and whether reinforcement selection could impact choosiness. This project focuses on crickets, in which pulse rate of the male song and female preference for pulse rate are species-specific and under natural selection. The proposed work will estimate intraspecific variation in choosiness for song pulse rate, examine whether there is repeatable individual variation in choosiness, and understand its relationship with variation in other preference traits. This project also aims to quantify heritability in choosiness and to identify the genetic basis of variation in choosiness variation using differential gene expression and genetic mapping experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such structural analysis is essential to help us understand the function (and malfunction) of molecules in complex samples, e.g., biofluids, cells, and tissues.  It is also crucial for the safety of therapeutic biomolecules.  The Hakansson laboratory employs electron irradiation of gaseous, charged biomolecules to yield diagnostic fragmentation.  Depending on their energy, electrons can either be attached or cause detachment of electrons from both cationic and anionic molecules.  While electron attachment to cations, resulting in electron capture dissociation (ECD), and electron detachment from anions,resulting in electron detachment dissociation (EDD), are energetically favorable and structurally informative processes that have been relatively broadly applied, including commercial implementations, many questions remain about the underlying mechanisms as well as how these processes can be tuned and how the resulting data should be interpreted.  Electron attachment to anions and electron detachment from cations are less favorable processes; however, the Hakansson laboratory has shown in previous work that negative ion electron capture dissociation; niECD is feasible and shows unique advantages for structural analysis of acidic biomolecules such as phosphorylated and sulfated analytes.  Recent work from the Hakansson group has also shown that electron detachment from cations (tandem ionization) can occur at much lower electron energies than previously demonstrated.  This research is providing new approaches to biomolecular structural characterization with important implications for drug discovery and enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms.  Students working on these projects gain exposure to highly interdisciplinary research.  Dr. Hakansson and her group also works to bring appreciation for these concepts and for broader science opportunities to middle school students in an effort to boost interest in the scientific method at an early educational stage.  <br/><br/>Under this award, the Hakansson group will explore electron energy vs. flux effects in positive and negative ion mode on both upgraded Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and beam-type implementations.  This research seeks to elucidate whether ?hot? ECD is not an energy but an electron density effect, tentatively termed electron flux dissociation; EFD.  Resulting spectra are rich in structural information, including amino acid side chain cleavages that can differentiate isomers and carbohydrate cross-ring fragments that provide linkage information for branched analytes.  Similarly, recent reports of internal fragments resulting from two backbone bond cleavages in proteins following electron irradiation do not appear to be a result of ?true? ECD but rather an electron flux effect.  In addition, because internal fragments have many isomeric and isobaric assignment possibilities, false discovery rates are high.  The Hakansson group seeks to elucidate all fragmentation pathways leading to terminal fragments, including hydrogen shuffling, radical a-type ion formation, and accompanying water/ammonia losses that can be erroneously assigned to internal fragments.  In addition, they will explore the role of de-isotoping errors in such assignments.  Furthermore, they will contrast EDD, which shows only two main fragment ion types, to collisional activation, which shows up to eight fragment ion types, with regard to false discovery of terminal and internal fragments from oligonucleotides.  Finally, the Hakansson team will leverage these insights with an eye toward improved alignment of ion-electron reactions with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of labile post-translational modifications and oligonucleotides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The amount of food wasted in the U.S. annually is equivalent to 130 billion meals, with an approximate value of nearly $218 billion. A significant percentage of this food waste happens in the fresh/produce section of the supermarkets due to the shorter shelf-life of various food items from 10 to 30 days. These foods are typically processed via retort cooking at 250-degree F, or freezing, or making food acidic (below Ph 4.6). These technologies are energy consuming, expensive, and lead to loss of most of the nutrients. The proposed Turmeric Assisted Pressure Sterilization (TAPS) is aiming to be the first technology that can extend this shelf-life to over 180 days without compromising on original taste, flavor and nutrient of food items with the goal of bringing RTE food items from the colder sections of the supermarket (below 40-degree F) to the shelf-stable section (about 70-degree F). By doing so, the company aspires to reduce RTE food waste by 20% in the next 10 years. <br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project aims to lay the groundwork for establishing TAPS as a breakthrough pressure sterilization technology. Traditional pressure sterilization is carried out at pressures around 6000 bars and 40-degree F.  This project intends to show that in the presence of natural antioxidants such as turmeric, the same level of sterilization can be achieved at pressures close to 3000 bar and 70-degree F. The project, therefore, will focus on preparing and testing a variety of RTE foods under the TAPS conditions and assessing their efficacy by third-party for shelf life, nutrient preservation, and risks to food safety and quality when challenged with common microorganisms. Besides turmeric, the experiments will also involve the use of other natural antioxidants, including a commercially available curcuminoid extract that has enhanced bioavailability and stability compared to standard curcumin and is colorless, odorless and tasteless, further expanding the potential applicability of TAPS to a much wider range of cuisines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, in many scenarios, such as devices running legacy applications for which the source code is unavailable, reliably creating, deploying, and verifying software updates remains challenging. As a result, many devices are left unpatched, even when known to be vulnerable to security weaknesses. To address this issue, this project will develop a principled and comprehensive methodology for developing, deploying, and verifying software patches. In particular, this work will ease software patching in scenarios where the original software source code is unavailable, allowing the deployment of security patches in millions of devices currently left unpatched. Additionally, this project will produce educational materials and conduct security competitions to develop and assess software patches. <br/><br/>To achieve its goals, this project will start by developing differential binary-analysis techniques to compare original and patched binaries, focusing on the modifications introduced by the patch. These techniques will then be used to efficiently assess the security enhancements introduced by a patch while detecting potential unintended side effects. In parallel, the project will develop reliable approaches to patch binary code at scale. Finally, the project will implement tools to generate human-readable representations of patch modifications to aid analysts in understanding the impact of patches and to update Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). Collectively, these efforts will establish a comprehensive, human-in-the-loop pipeline for defining, generating, and verifying software patches at the binary level, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of current and future software systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, due to incumbent users, the spectrum will need to be shared in a dynamic way, with channels opening up for short durations, requiring agile radios to hop into and out of bands. This motivates the principal investigator to pursue the design of RF front-end radios that can access very large swaths of bandwidth with programmable center frequency and programmable bandwidth, and tunable in a fast and agile fashion using electronic rather than mechanical tuning.  This is in stark contrast to how today?s radios work, as they usually cover much smaller bands (less than 1 GHz) and rely on highly selective filters to minimize interference.  The proposed radio would provide wideband tunable functionality by making the radio receiver robust against interference. The transmitter will be equally agile and generate as little out-of-band emissions as possible, so that other users can also share the spectrum. Without using explicit filters, this is a great challenge and requires much innovation in the transmitter architecture.  Successful realization of the project would enable resilient broadband connectivity for the foreseeable future, thus broadening wireless access, which is a key national priority. The principal investigator plans on training both graduate students and undergraduates who will participate in the project directly and through classroom interactions. The principal investigator will also continue to teach a chip design ?tapeout? course giving undergraduates the opportunity to build radios in advanced CMOS technology nodes and also to test their chips in the lab. This will help with workforce training. <br/><br/>The principal investigator is proposing a broadband front-end receiver with an electronically tunable filter that automatically tracks the desired channel of operation using mixer-first N-path techniques, up-converting baseband low-pass filtering to a bandpass response.  Linearity is preserved by using voltage feedback in the baseband stages. The principal investigator is also proposing a wideband mixed-signal polar power amplifier that can easily adapt to different bandwidths and modulation schemes due to the flexibility afforded by the digital nature of the architecture. To contend with the high levels of quantization noise and image transmissions, a hybrid PA is proposed that incorporates a low power linear PA that combines with the mixed-signal PA, allowing high efficiency, high linearity, and low spurious transmissions. While N-path filters and digital transmitters have received a lot of interest from the research community, the issue of in-band (rather than out-of-band) linearity of the receiver and out-of-band emissions from a transmitter have been mostly ignored. Also, most of the published work has focused on sub-5 GHz radios. Without addressing these key requirements and new frequency bands, these radio architectures cannot be applied to the envisioned new spectrum ranging from 7-20 GHz. The higher frequency bands necessitate radios without mechanical filters (SAW/BAW/F-BAR) with fast switching between sub-bands. The proposal directly addresses these shortcomings using circuit techniques which allow a new generation of programmable, dynamic, and agile front ends to be used for future spectrum allocations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term goal of this work is to develop iron-catalyzed multicomponent cross-couplings to the level of palladium and nickel-based systems in terms of synthetic applications and mechanistic understanding. The project lies at the interface of organic synthesis and computational chemistry and is well-suited to train the next generation of organic chemists at all levels. In parallel to this research activities, Dr. Gutierrez will continue to evolve initiatives aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by integrating education, research, and outreach through partnerships with the Alliance for Diversity in Science and Engineering (ADSE), TED-style talks, and expansion of on-going collaborative research and educational programs with the community colleges.<br/><br/>The development of inexpensive, sustainable, and selective catalysts that can directly convert simple chemical ?building blocks? to high-value chiral compounds remains a grand challenge in chemical synthesis. In this vein, there has been surge in the development of new iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions due to iron?s higher abundance in the earth?s crust, lower cost, and less toxic properties in comparison to most transition metal counterparts. However, in contrast to nickel- and palladium-based systems, the use of iron complexes capable of controlling enantioselectivity in catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation remains extremely rare. In this project, the Gutierrez research group will use a mechanistic-driven, multi-technique approach to design and develop asymmetric multicomponent Fe-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involving allyl-and alpha-heteroatom bearing radicals.

The fundamental issue this solution seeks to address is how to ensure AI produces trustworthy responses when used in industry applications, making it safer and more practical to use AI systems across different industries. The potential impact of commercializing this technology is more widespread adoption of AI tools in critical situations, enabling decision-makers to act more confidently, especially when time is critical. By bringing this advance to the marketplace, the gap between AI's potential and its real-world use could be bridged, helping ensure U.S. dominance in the AI industry worldwide.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a novel statistical framework for validating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in settings where traditional benchmarking is impossible or unreliable due to the lack of data or the presence of human disagreement. The solution employs advanced statistical techniques to quantify uncertainty in AI-generated responses by analyzing patterns of agreement and disagreement between multiple model runs and between models and human experts. The approach differs from traditional model validation methods that require a gold standard for comparison and only offer an average accuracy level, instead of being individualized to the exact output.

These disagreements suggest the SM is only part of some larger theory with other particles and forces that have not been discovered yet. The group led by PI Prof. Osherson is searching for such particles in proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The group focuses on discovering very light new particles that might have evaded previous searches. In particular, this project builds new tools that can probe a range of new physics scenarios with light new particles. The project also includes an educational component aimed at bringing experimental particle physics to high-school students.<br/> <br/>PI Osherson?s group works within the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaboration at the LHC. The project has two main objectives, one focused on the immediate analysis of the current CMS datasets, the other preparing for future data-taking at the LHC. The group will develop new algorithms for reconstructing the signature of two overlapping photons, a signature common to many new physics scenarios. Such signatures are also relevant to precision measurements of the Higgs. The group will use these algorithms to search specifically for axion-like particles produced at the LHC. Looking to the future, the group is working on upgrades to the CMS detector, specifically replacing the Tracker sub-detector. The new Tracker is designed to operate in the new environment of the planned High-Luminosity LHC. The group is responsible for the production of software that will operate that detector. Students from the group will also contribute to its construction.

Most of this is eaten by tiny organisms who rely on oxygen to consume the methane, a process called 'methane oxidation'. Oxygen levels vary naturally throughout the world?s oceans, so it is not known whether the ability of these organisms to consume methane is disrupted in some places. Custom one-of-a-kind instruments to measure methane consumption rates and monitor what organisms are present have been built by the investigators. The instruments will be sent to the bottom of the ocean for weeks and in different locations. The goal is to see how methane oxidation and the types of organisms present adjust to different oxygen concentrations and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>Natural gas seeps along the continental margins inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying waters. This methane is largely oxidized by microbes. Although microbial methanotrophs are largely microaerophilic, it is not known how differences in oxygen concentrations enhance or hinder their ability to respond nor whether methane consumption rates are controlled by deep-sea oxygen concentrations. Recent work has shown that microbial aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) in the deep sea occurs with widely varying rate constants. The project is to explore factors that drive this variation by making in situ measurements of MOx and microbial community dynamics at known seep sites offshore Louisiana, an area with frequent episodic methane releases, and on the Cascadia Margin offshore Oregon where highly variable bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) will provide vital evidence for how oxygen limitation affects MOx in situ. The in situ measurements are possible due to newly-developed benthic landers that can make MOx rate measurements on timescales of hours to weeks using advanced laser methane and optode DO sensors. An in situ collection and incubation scheme allows collection of microbial time-series, tracking the relative abundance of methanotrophs (through 16S rRNA surveys and metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) to study methanotrophic responses to varying ambient conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Placental insufficiency is a condition where the placenta fails to deliver an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. This condition impacts 6 million pregnancies in the United States. Current diagnostic methods for placental insufficiency are reactive, relying on symptom presentation and/or emergencies and this limits the ability of doctors to prevent adverse outcomes and fetal death. The goal of this technology is to accurately predict the likelihood of placental insufficiency. A key marker in determining placental insufficiency comes from understanding the role of blood flow in placental health.

This technology is based on detailed digital twins, numerical modeling, and machine learning and may be used to determine blood flow patterns in the placenta. This solution differs from existing AI technologies by looking at multiple parameters (e.g., blood flow, vessel geometry, patient history, and socioeconomic factors) to generate a score that identifies at-risk mothers during the first and second trimesters. The goal is to provide clinicians with a new decision support system to identify and engage at-risk mothers to improve pregnancy outcomes. This AI predictive technology has the potential to change the management of placental problems by offering earlier detection, greater accuracy, and tailored intervention strategies.

Yet, despite what should be a jittery visual mess, we perceive a relatively smooth and stable visual world. For decades, scientists have been theorizing about how the brain creates this illusion of visual stability?recent advances in AI suggest an answer that can finally help crack this human perceptual code. <br/><br/>The latest AI-powered vision-language models are becoming very good at recognizing visual objects and understanding scenes, even imagining what should be there and filling in missing parts much like the human brain does.

This project puts these new AI models to the test by having them generate plausible visual scenes, in real time, using only the few input samples that correspond to where a person looked while freely viewing the scene. This person is then shown either the real or AI-generated scene and asked if it is the scene that they just viewed. By identifying generated scenes that people cannot tell from real, cognitive scientists learn more about the semantic variability that objects viewed in peripheral vision might take while still seeming plausible (i.e., stable), and computational neuroscientists learn more about the algorithms underlying human visual stability and scene perception. This knowledge may also contribute to the development of smarter AI systems capable of perceiving the world more like humans do, thereby potentially improving performance in time-critical applications such as self-driving cars and enhancing user experiences in augmented reality contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, when machine learning predictions are deployed to make decisions, small errors can have unintended consequences. In feedback loops, these errors can compound, leading to problems in safety, bias, and performance.  This project aims to address this challenge by developing algorithms for reliable decision-making in complex systems, ensuring that the benefits of machine learning are realized while minimizing its risks. By understanding how feedback loops work, we can unlock the full potential of machine learning to improve outcomes in areas like weather prediction, recommendation systems, and human-robot collaboration.  Our research program will develop innovative solutions that benefit society as a whole, with a focus on developing theory and algorithms that have direct impact on these applications. In addition, an integrated education plan will promote computer science education and inspire the next generation of innovators. Hands-on projects and interactive modules will introduce high school students to exciting topics like weather forecasting, balloon control, and robotics.<br/><br/>The project will leverage ideas and techniques from online optimization, control theory, system identification, and reinforcement learning to answer the following questions:  How should decision algorithms make use of possibly unreliable machine learning predictions while ensuring good outcomes? How can we reliably predict the long-term impacts of decisions with models learned from temporally correlated data? How do we adaptively make decisions while learning about initially unknown impacts?  The algorithmic and theoretical frameworks will be developed in tandem with applications in weather prediction, autonomous aerial navigation, recommendation systems, and human-robot interaction, along the following three thrusts. First, consider decision-making with ML predictions. Reliably leveraging unreliable predictions requires accounting for potential errors to guard against bad outcomes. The researchers will first develop algorithms that robustly guarantee performance and safety while benefiting from predictions when they are accurate and then use decision performance as a metric to evaluate prediction quality. Second, consider learning models of impacts. Understanding the long-term impacts of decisions on individuals is crucial, and yet human activities are non-stationary, correlated, and partially observed. The researchers will develop reliable learning algorithms for data arising from such processes, with a particular focus on finite sample uncertainty quantification and bounded sample complexity. Third, consider sample-efficient reinforcement learning: Adaptive decision-making requires simultaneously learning from data while making decisions. The researchers will develop model-based algorithms which can operate even in partially observed settings, such as the non-stationary user behaviors important for applications like recommendation and human-robot collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The remote and fragile economies are exposed to compounding stressors, such as disasters, peak visit seasons, and infrastructure and workforce capacity limitations.  Future long-term resiliency planning is critical; however, existing efforts have been siloed, non-comprehensive, and limited to short planning horizons.  Multisectoral dynamic (MSD) models can provide long-term projections and explore interdependencies among multiple sectors under future uncertainties in climate and socioeconomics. However, MSD approaches may be out of reach for community planners.  Digital Twins (DTs) have recently become popular as a real-life extension of models through virtual reality.  We propose to link MSD models with DTs to assist gateways in resilience planning.  This approach provides an extension and communication strategy while soliciting community feedback as a ?reality-check? for models.  Our model framework provides a new approach to model outreach that can be extended to address long-term resilience planning in any community.  Our research supports institutional diversity and engages seven community leaders across six institutions to serve as advisors. Curriculum and training will accompany workshops to enhance utilization of our tools, as well as support workforce development.<br/><br/>U.S. National Parks, such as Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and their gateway communities are dynamic, co-dependent, and co-evolving systems. Integrated socioeconomic and environmental planning efforts, achieved through coupled modeling frameworks, are needed for holistic regional planning for YNP and communities. We propose to develop Multisector Dynamic (MSD) models, as emulators of long-term future system and sector interdependencies, and integrate these with digital twins (DTs), which provide short-term virtual realities of MSD projections, thereby producing a cycle of information feedback between data science and system dynamics. Specifically, we will project future population, economic activity, land use, and infrastructures (buildings, transportation, and water utilities), in conjunction with flood and wildfire risk. These high-resolution projections will be coupled with DTs to provide real-life simulations of alternative futures, including three-dimensional visualizations of future gateway villages, dynamic traffic patterns and congestion, infrastructure depictions, and wildlife migration corridors. In this way, DTs coupled with MSDs assist in communicating complex model results to practitioners, enhance community participation, and provide a conduit to improve process understanding, assess model plausibility, and increase the likelihood of identifying resilient outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A precise understanding of the behavior of electrons in molecules and materials is needed to reliably predict their properties. Such understanding provides an enticing way to explore new compounds in lieu of performing many delicate and expensive experiments. Unfortunately, current theoretical approaches fail catastrophically when applied to systems with a particular kind of complicated electronic structure: strongly correlated electron systems. Examples of strong correlation can be found in compounds with several metallic centers with unpaired electrons, such as rare-earth metals, lanthanides, and actinides. In these situations, the trade-off between the reliability and tractability of traditional computational techniques is unacceptable, so they can only be used in the simplest cases. Solving this problem will facilitate the design of new organometallic catalysts, and more efficient energy-conversion and high-density data-storage devices. Dr. Miranda?s goal is to develop accurate, computationally efficient, and universal methods capable of treating strongly correlated systems. Dr. Miranda will use the software packages developed in his group to boost the undergraduate quantum chemistry curriculum at UF, allowing the students to tackle more realistic problems in their classes. Moreover, he will create videos and other types of online content to introduce topics in algebra, coding, and computational chemistry to a broader audience.<br/><br/>This project has three key aims: (1) design, implement, and test new wavefunction anstze capable of describing multi-reference problems; (2) develop a new perturbation theory framework as a robust way to optimize flexible wavefunctions and to help calculate various molecular properties; and (3) extend the domain of applicability of our methods using novel embedding techniques and apply them to realistic chemical compounds and processes. Dr. Miranda?s team will develop and exploit a framework (the Flexible Ansatz for N-body Configuration Interaction, FANCI) that greatly expedites the development and testing new wavefunction anstze. In particular, the focus will be on new families of wavefunction methods, combining traditional anstze (CI, CC) with novel ideas (quasi-particles, symmetry breaking, seniority) in non-traditional ways. The second goal will be centered on a flexible Perturbation Theory (PT) framework that could suit any possible multi-determinant wavefunction. This approach will be leveraged to facilitate calculation of Reduced Density Matrices and response functions. The final focus on general wavefunction-in-wavefunction embedding protocols will help to model changes in the spin state, redox behavior, etc. of strongly correlated systems. Dr. Miranda?s team will exploit the Fanpy/FANCI/FANPT framework as a way to enhance the preparation in computational chemistry at the undergraduate and high school level. With the help of UF?s Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET), they will interact with teachers to develop hands-on tools for their classrooms, while also hosting high school students. They will also work to engage the community through materials (mostly, videos/lectures) aimed to introduce coding, mathematic tools, and computational chemistry concepts and applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies suggest that plastics are now a major source of dissolved organic material in these regions of the ocean. Therefore, it is important to consider plastic-derived organic material as part of the ocean carbon cycle and understand its effects on ocean biology. This project will test the idea that bacteria in ocean surface waters consume plastic-derived organic matter, and in doing so they compete with phytoplankton for key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. The investigators will utilize a combination of laboratory experiments, field sampling, and numerical modeling to explore this hypothesis. The project will support two graduate students and an undergraduate student researcher. The investigators will share their research with policy makers and with the general public, with a focus on middle and high school aged students.  <br/><br/>The core hypothesis of this project is that ?nutrient-theft? by bacteria when consuming plastic-derived dissolved organic carbon (pDOC) results in sufficient drawdown of nitrogen and phosphorus in surface waters to reduce new production and the strength of the biological carbon pump, especially in the subtropical gyres where microplastic abundance is greatest and nutrients are at a minimum. The team will test this hypothesis using an ecosystem-biogeochemistry model (CESM-MARBL) augmented to include explicit representation of marine bacterial growth, nutrient use, and pDOC all parameterized using novel empirical knowledge gained through shipboard fieldwork, photochemical studies to improve estimates of pDOC photoproduction rates, and bioassays to determine the kinetic parameters of bacterial nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in response to pDOC fertilization. Global ocean model runs will simulate spatiotemporal change in net primary productivity, nitrogen- and phosphorus-based new production, and the strength of the biological carbon pump. Model simulations will be run with no added pDOC, 1948-present pDOC fertilization rates, and with predicted future pDOC fertilization based on business-as-usual increases in surface ocean plastics until 2100. These model simulations will test the core hypothesis by assessing how nutrient theft due to pDOC fertilization is altering ocean biogeochemistry and reducing the strength of the biological carbon pump today and through the 21st century.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The magnetosphere, created by Earth?s magnetic field, acts as an obstacle to the solar wind, the stream of charged particles from the Sun. This project seeks to understand the processes heating electrons at polar latitudes using a combination of theory, numerical modeling, and analysis of radar and satellite observations. The processes coupling energy from the solar wind and magnetosphere into the ionosphere are highly complex.  Accurately describing electron energetics in ionospheric models remains challenging due to the complex kinetic electron physics involved.  A key parameter for understanding the ionosphere and ion escape from the ionosphere is the temperature of electrons.  This research program will be combined with educational and public outreach efforts related to teaching about the physics of high-energy electrons in space, including those electrons that create the colors of the northern lights.  The energetic electron transport phenomena studied in this project are very closely related to auroral electron transport phenomena.  The project will create a ?Make Your Own Aurora? website where users can learn about heliophysics by digitally simulating auroral emissions.  Students of graduate and undergraduate levels will be involved in this project.   <br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the physical mechanisms controlling electron energetics in the polar cap ionosphere. The ability to predict ionospheric electron temperatures is of fundamental importance to aeronomy since they affect chemical reaction rates, ambipolar electric fields, plasma scale heights, and ion upflows.  Science questions to be addressed are 1) Which physical processes explain the electron temperatures observed in the polar cap ionosphere? 2) How do polar cap electron temperatures vary with solar, geomagnetic, and background plasma conditions? And 3) How do electron temperature variations relate to ion upflow variations?  They will perform statistical studies of temperature measurements from the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR), measurements from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft, and energetic electron distributions from the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) spacecraft. The theory and modeling activities will integrate kinetic models of energetic electrons previously developed into the High-latitude Ionospheric Dynamics for Research Applications (HIDRA) model.  A computationally efficient version of HIDRA that can reproduce these measured quantities will be a major advance for high latitude modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike traditional methods, AM allows for unparalleled geometric freedom and the integration of advanced functionalities, such as functionally graded materials, shape-memory materials, and materials with enhanced properties. These breakthroughs rely on controlling the internal structure of the material, called the microstructure, which directly impacts its mechanical and thermal behavior. However, determining the optimal AM process conditions to achieve specific microstructures is a significant challenge due to the high costs, time, and resources needed for experiments and simulations. This project aims to drastically reduce the time required to predict and optimize microstructures from days to minutes, enabling faster, more efficient design and manufacturing of advanced materials with targeted properties.

How the nervous system changes to allow for stage-appropriate behaviors is a central question in neuroscience, with connections to neurological disease and mental health. Many behaviors specific to adults arise after a period of maturation, e.g., puberty, when a juvenile transforms into an adult. The nervous system transforms drastically during this time, including the birth of new cells that build the circuits for adult behaviors. Across the animal kingdom, juvenile neurons have been reported to reprogram during maturation and contribute to circuits for adult-specific behaviors by poorly understood molecular mechanisms. The lag in our understanding is due in part from the technical challenges in identifying developmentally reprogrammed neurons in the first place. This project leverages a powerful system to study maturational reprogramming of neurons at cellular and molecular level. This investigation will test the hypothesis that development can use the same neurons to construct a variety of neural circuits whose use is specific to different sexes and stages of life. The project will offer immersive neuroscience and biomedical training for undergraduates, master?s students, and postbaccalaureate researchers before pursuing a PhD in neuroscience or related fields. Undergraduate students in an investigative neurobiology course will also engage in hands-on lab experiences, contributing directly to ongoing research. <br/> <br/>In Drosophila, sex-specific behaviors, like mating, develop when juvenile larvae metamorphose into adults. Prior studies identified a small population of interneurons in the adult female nerve cord, the DDAG neurons, that influence many aspects of female fertility. These neurons are born during embryogenesis and exist as mature interneurons in larvae of both sexes. During metamorphosis, the juvenile counterparts of the DDAG neurons acquire sex-specific identity, apoptose in males, and reprogram in females for mating functions. The circuits for reproductive behavior in flies are thus partially built from developmentally reprogrammed neurons with former activities in sex-agnostic juvenile larvae. This project will use the DDAG neurons to study the developmental and molecular mechanisms that reprogram neurons during maturation. The work will (1) determine how different subtypes of DDAG neurons in adults contribute to female behavior and elucidate the larval counterparts of each DDAG subtype and their functions in larvae; and (2) uncover the molecular mechanism that reprograms the DDAG neurons during metamorphosis. This investigation will test the hypothesis that two segmentally repeating neuronal subtypes in larvae that regulate locomotion reprogram to five adult subtypes with different functions in female mating. Further, the study will test the hypothesis that a transcription factor program present in the larval counterparts of these neurons reprograms them in response to a permissive metamorphic hormone. Taken together, this project will provide transformative insights into the mechanisms that govern the reprogramming of juvenile neurons during maturation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, developing technologies that utilize singlet fission to boost their performance requires singlet fission materials that direct the spatial transport of the triplet excitons they generate. To address this, a research team led by Professor Roberts will map how the structure of molecular crystals dictates their ability to undergo singlet fission and transport triplet excitons by using mechanical strain to systematically alter their intermolecular structure. By mapping how singlet fission and exciton transfer depend on a material?s structure, the research team will establish benchmarks for refining theoretical models for singlet fission and exciton transfer while simultaneously guiding the design of new compounds that can meet current challenges in energy harvesting. To achieve its objectives, the research team will employ MEMS devices to strain molecular crystals and thin film heterojunctions in concert with transient absorption microscopy experiments that will track exciton diffusion with femtosecond time resolution and tens of nanometers spatial resolution. These measurements will be modeled using electronic structure calculations that will both predict how materials deform under applied strain and how these structural changes impact a material?s ability to generate and transport triplet excitons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These timing devices, capable of picosecond accuracy (a trillionth of a second), enable nuclear physics research, light detection and ranging, and medical imaging. This project will develop a time-to-digital converter (TDC) with unique features and the capability to operate in harsh environments. A TDC is an electronic device that measures time intervals with extremely high precision and converts the measured time into a digital value. TDCs are widely used in applications requiring precise timing, such as LIDAR, high-energy physics, medical imaging, and communications. The market opportunities and the competitive advantage are secured through an architecture that overcomes the limitations of current TDC implementations. The developed TDCs will be semiconductor chip based that will be fabricated domestically and introduced to three primary markets: nuclear physics, spacecraft instrumentation, and medical imaging devices. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a high-availability TDC that features zero dead-time, unlimited multi-hits, picosecond accuracy, and a dedicated calibration circuit. A proof-of-concept already exists, and a prototype application-specific integrated circuit is ready for fabrication. Phase I addresses research and development of hardware and software and overall robustness to withstand high radiation and cryogenic temperatures. This will be achieved through an iterative design methodology between logic design, transistor design, and transistor layout, each in their respective software environment.  At the conclusion to Phase I, the primary goal is to have a second prototype ready to send to a chip fabrication facility.  This prototype will include new features of the design, as well as radiation hardening.  The radiation hardening will allow the prototype to operate in a more extreme environment, dictated by the operational constraints of the end users.  The secondary goal will analyze the extreme temperature and radiation environments of the particle physics community and determine if and how to migrate the design to a chip fabrication process that includes radiation hardening and cryogenic models for a potential Phase II follow on.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies suggest that plastics are now a major source of dissolved organic material in these regions of the ocean. Therefore, it is important to consider plastic-derived organic material as part of the ocean carbon cycle and understand its effects on ocean biology. This project will test the idea that bacteria in ocean surface waters consume plastic-derived organic matter, and in doing so they compete with phytoplankton for key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. The investigators will utilize a combination of laboratory experiments, field sampling, and numerical modeling to explore this hypothesis. The project will support two graduate students and an undergraduate student researcher. The investigators will share their research with policy makers and with the general public, with a focus on middle and high school aged students.  <br/><br/>The core hypothesis of this project is that ?nutrient-theft? by bacteria when consuming plastic-derived dissolved organic carbon (pDOC) results in sufficient drawdown of nitrogen and phosphorus in surface waters to reduce new production and the strength of the biological carbon pump, especially in the subtropical gyres where microplastic abundance is greatest and nutrients are at a minimum. The team will test this hypothesis using an ecosystem-biogeochemistry model (CESM-MARBL) augmented to include explicit representation of marine bacterial growth, nutrient use, and pDOC all parameterized using novel empirical knowledge gained through shipboard fieldwork, photochemical studies to improve estimates of pDOC photoproduction rates, and bioassays to determine the kinetic parameters of bacterial nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in response to pDOC fertilization. Global ocean model runs will simulate spatiotemporal change in net primary productivity, nitrogen- and phosphorus-based new production, and the strength of the biological carbon pump. Model simulations will be run with no added pDOC, 1948-present pDOC fertilization rates, and with predicted future pDOC fertilization based on business-as-usual increases in surface ocean plastics until 2100. These model simulations will test the core hypothesis by assessing how nutrient theft due to pDOC fertilization is altering ocean biogeochemistry and reducing the strength of the biological carbon pump today and through the 21st century.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tyrosine kinases play important roles in regulating cell growth, cell division, cell death, and responsiveness of cells to their environment. They operate by sensing biochemical cues and then chemically modifying other proteins, but in order for this to occur faithfully, tyrosine kinases must recognize specific proteins to modify out of the sea of possible targets in a cell. Professor Shah?s laboratory will explore the molecular rules underpinning protein recognition by tyrosine kinases. This research will illuminate new mechanisms by which tyrosine kinase signaling is controlled and also inspire the design of novel inhibitors of these enzymes. In conjunction with this research, the Shah lab will develop and implement hands-on biochemistry lessons at a local middle school to show students the numerous roles that enzymes and other biomolecules play in everyday life.<br/><br/>The 90 tyrosine kinases found in humans have highly similar catalytic domains. Despite their structural homology, subtle differences in the active sites of each tyrosine kinase engender them with the ability to phosphorylate different substrates, in part by recognizing specific linear patterns of amino acid sequences. There now exists a reasonable description of sequence preferences for nearly every human tyrosine kinase. However, a complete picture of the biophysical basis for substrate selection and knowledge of how tyrosine kinases select substrates in different signaling contexts are still lacking. In this work, researchers within the Shah laboratory will first use protein chemistry and high-throughput peptide phosphorylation screens to examine how post-translational modifications to tyrosine kinases alter their substrate specificities. Next, using biochemical measurements coupled with structural analysis, researchers will assess whether the first-order approximations of sequence specificity that currently dominate the field can be improved by taking into account the energetic coupling between individual amino acids within a linear recognition motif. Finally, using the biochemical and biophysical insights into substrate recognition gained, a unique strategy for the design and synthesis of selective kinase inhibitors will be explored. This effort will produce new chemical tools to dissect kinase signaling and provide a template for the development of a new modality of kinase-targeted inhibitors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying the mechanisms by which bats avoid disease from infection offers opportunities to translate bat-inspired immunological approaches into human disease therapeutics. This meeting offers opportunities for early career trainees, particularly graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, to share ideas and research findings with experts across this wide-ranging and interdisciplinary field. The meeting also aims to facilitate conversation between bat ecologists and conservationists with those engaged in more molecular approaches to understanding bat infectious disease to reconcile bats? roles as major pathogen reservoirs.<br/><br/>BatID 2025 is organized around three major conference objectives: (1) to disseminate research on the unique role of bats as pathogen hosts, (2) to foster collaborations and expand the field of bat infectious disease research, and (3) to identify a priority future research agenda in the study of bat infectious diseases. The first objective highlights this meeting?s utility as a research-sharing forum that welcomes representatives from disparate disciplines, who may not closely follow research outputs from other fields. The second objective seeks to turn this idea exchange into action by fostering collaborations among attendees, this year with a particular emphasis on recruiting participants and speakers who have not previously attended this meeting. Finally, the third objective seeks to organize the community around future research goals through an open discussion at the end of the two-day program.

Omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats found in certain foods such as fish and fish oil supplements. The goal of this technology is to produce a sustainable alternative to fish oils, reducing the overfishing associated with current practices. Unfortunately, the fat product produced naturally from farmed black soldier flies is suboptimal for use in animal feed and is usually disposed of as waste. This technology creates black soldier flies that can produce omega-3 fats that may be harvested and used in pet or livestock feed. This technology addresses these issues by transforming black soldier fly larvae, which are primarily used for protein production, into high-value omega-3 producers. Increasing omega-3 content in black soldier flies may create an economically attractive and environmentally sustainable alternative to fish oil.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of biomanufacturing omega-3 fatty acids in black soldier flies. Omega-3s such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are essential for human and animal health but are primarily sourced from fish oil. This technology uses genetic engineering to enhance black soldier flies to produce larvae with an altered fatty acid composition that is higher in the omega-3 precursor linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acid alpha lipoic acid (ALA). This technology is based on an automated, genetic screening processes, rapid integration of beneficial transgenes, and the creation of stable, genetically modified insect lines. Currently, black soldier flies are farmed primarily for protein production. Farming genetically enhanced black soldier flies producing omega-3 lipids may improve the value of insect farming and solve the economic challenges of insect farming through a scalable biomanufacturing platform. Potential adopters, including nutraceutical companies and animal feed producers, may benefit from a reliable, scalable, and sustainable supply of omega-3 fatty acids, reducing environmental impacts and improving nutritional outcomes across the nutraceutical, agricultural, and pet food industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through engagement with the Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation (IMSI), the project will cultivate research collaborations in machine learning (ML).  Primary goals are: (1) formalize a partnership between A&M-SA and IMSI, including the PI's participation in the Spring 2025 long program on Uncertainty Quantification and Artificial Intelligence for Complex Systems, (2) advance the PI's scholarship and undergraduate training through research opportunities, curriculum development, and dissemination of content material in SciML.  The project will transform the instructional and training ecosystem at A&M-SA especially supporting SciML.  The PI would be building strong computational and coding skills for undergraduate students to be competitive in the marketplace and ready to join the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The project's first research thrust is ML-enhanced iterative coupling of complex local-to-nonlocal (LtN) problems. While local problems enjoy computational feasibility, they lose their effectiveness when dealing with challenging physics such as fracture.  In numerous applications, fracture is localized in a region.  This is where a nonlocal method such as peridynamics (PD) should take over to capture the physics, nonetheless with heavy computational cost. This is the rationale of LtN coupling. Hence, coupling approaches will make such problems computationally realistic and feasible.  The project?s second research thrust is the peridynamic differential operator (PDDO)-enhanced ML approaches to solve complex fluid flow problems. PDDO enables numerical differentiation through integration by converting differentiation to its nonlocal PD (integral) form.  It maintains the ability to use partial differential equations for modeling while treating discontinuities seamlessly in an integral representation.  Its strength lies in capturing sharp gradients, even gradient singularities.  The performance of existing physics guided ML approaches may degrade in the presence of sharp gradients.  This can be remedied by incorporating nonlocal interactions into the neural network input together with local space and time variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nitrogen is one of the primary nutrients that are essential for the normal growth of plants. Nitrogen in the fertilizers applied for food production ends up largely in wastewater. This project is to translate the innovative Vacuum Stripping and Absorption (VaSA) process into a cost-effective, scalable technology for recovery of ammonia in wastewater while upgrading the biosolids in the treated wastewater and increasing production of renewable natural gas. The proposed technology promotes efficiency by turning wastewater pollutants like ammonia into high-purity nitrogen fertilizers. It holds a great promise to substantially reduce the operational costs for water resource recovery facilities and concentrated animal feeding operations to meet regulatory requirements for discharge of treated wastewater and land application of animal manure. The recovered fertilizers and upgraded biosolids generate revenues for the facilities and operations.  <br/><br/>The VaSA process brings wastewater to boiling under vacuum at a temperature much below the normal boiling point, under which ammonia is effectively stripped out of wastewater, separated from water vapor in a demister, and absorbed to an acidic solution to form ammonium sulfate crystals. Through pilot tests using a 3-pool VaSA prototype, this project will for the first time explore the regulation of vapor-liquid equilibrium profile from the complex boiling wastewater to the water-ammonia binary system in the stripper head and demister. When scaling up the VaSA technology, vapor-liquid equilibrium evolves from the multi-pool boiling stripper throughout the demister and varies with the number of vertically mounted pools and demister configuration. Understanding the vapor-liquid equilibrium profile will derisk the multi-pool scaling-up design approach and inline production of solid fertilizers. By controlling the factors that regulate vapor-liquid equilibrium, the technology can be scaled up for continuous operation without compromise of its high efficiency for ammonia recovery while maintaining minimal energy consumption. Moreover, it is expected to prove the high efficiency of anaerobic digestion under alkaline conditions and elucidate the mechanisms of alkaline anaerobic digestion through laboratory digestion experiments coupled with a single-pool VaSA prototype.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These connections are adaptable, supporting learning and memory, while also remaining stable to ensure proper brain function. The extracellular matrix, a network of molecules surrounding synapses, plays a critical role in maintaining this balance. This investigation explores how changes in this matrix affect synapse stability and, consequently, the brain?s ability to function effectively. This work is vital because disruptions in synapse stability are linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and Alzheimer?s disease. By uncovering the mechanisms that preserve brain connectivity, we aim to inspire new strategies for addressing these challenging conditions. This project goes beyond scientific discovery to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists, contributing to our nation?s leadership in science and technology. Through engaging educational initiatives, we provide hands-on STEM experiences, focusing on providing opportunities for all. A highlight of our outreach includes LEGO-based microscopes, which combine creativity and science to make microscopy accessible and fun for all ages. Additionally, we integrate art and science, encouraging students to explore scientific concepts through creative expression. Our mission is to equip students with the tools and inspiration to excel in STEM and drive societal progress.<br/><br/>Synaptic connections between neurons are essential for brain function, balancing adaptability for information processing with stability to maintain circuit integrity. Homeostatic plasticity ensures neural circuits remain adaptive within physiological limits, yet its molecular pathways are poorly understood. Disruptions in homeostatic signaling contribute to excitation-inhibition imbalances implicated in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Alzheimer?s disease. The extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides structural support and serves as a reservoir for signaling molecules, plays a critical but understudied role in regulating synaptic function. This research focuses on how the ECM maintains synaptic stability through dynamic regulation by matrix metalloproteinases. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we identified Drosophila Multiplexin (Dmp), a homolog of mammalian Collagen XVIII, as a key regulator of homeostatic plasticity. Proteolytic cleavage of Dmp releases Endostatin, a signaling factor essential for synaptic stability. This project will investigate how matrix metalloproteinases regulate ECM dynamics during different phases of synaptic homeostasis and elucidate the mechanisms by which ECM signaling modulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonlinear efficiency is one of the most critical metrics. To further increase nonlinear efficiency, chip-scale lithium niobate devices made with nanofabrication technology have been developed. Unfortunately, despite intensive efforts in the past decade, such chip-scale lithium niobate devices failed to deliver the promised high nonlinear efficiency due to non-uniformity. To overcome this issue, an adapted poling technique has been developed to compensate the non-uniformity, and it was shown that the ideal phase-matching condition can be recovered.

As an alternative, this technology replaces physical roads with virtual roads. The robot will use virtual roads created from an architectural drawing or satellite imagery that will be automatically generated to allow the robot to accomplish its mission. This technology may prevent injuries and save lives as well as allow for more frequent substation and other inspections to avoid equipment failure and premature equipment replacement.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of fully autonomous robots using virtual roads. Currently, the use of fully autonomous robots requires predefined roads or paths to operate. This technology eliminates the need for a pre-established travel path by using virtual roads that do not require landmarks and are independent of environmental changes. The fully autonomous robot using virtual roads navigates using a digital map that is extracted from an architectural drawing or satellite imagery. The virtual roads consist of interconnected nodes on the robot environment map.  These nodes accommodate all the possible destinations required by the robot. Based on the selected destination, a virtual path is automatically generated out of the set of virtual roads allowing the robot to accomplish its mission. In addition, as this approach automatically generates a virtual travel path, it will not require training of the robot.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how organisms make accurate, time-sensitive decisions with incomplete information is critical to determine how they process and respond to environmental signals. This project focuses on understanding how the bacterial pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium makes time-sensitive decisions when engulfed by immune cells. Using quantitative approaches to track decision-making in single bacteria in real-time, this research investigates how Salmonella balances speed and accuracy to survive the hostile environment of an immune cell. Understanding how bacteria make life-and-death decisions in this environment could lay the groundwork to disrupt bacterial decision-making as a means to treat disease. This project will generate fundamental new knowledge about cellular decision-making, with potential applications in synthetic biology, such as designing bacteria for sustainable agriculture, pollution cleanup, and disease diagnosis. The interdisciplinary educational component introduces high school students to cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) techniques through a hands-on curriculum integrating biology, coding, and imaging. <br/><br/>When engulfed by a macrophage, Salmonella must rapidly adapt to the phagosome environment and activate virulence genes to survive. Activation of virulence genes is time-sensitive, as the host is actively attempting to neutralize the bacteria. However, phagosomal stimuli appear gradually and heterogeneously, making it challenging for the bacteria to rapidly classify this new environment. This project investigates how Salmonella use contextual cues for rapid and accurate decision-making in the intracellular environment. By combining microfluidics and live-cell imaging, this project tracks virulence responses at the single-cell level to determine how contextual cues impact the accuracy of the response. This research will position us to predict and perturb bacterial decision-making in the phagosome while also uncovering general principles about how cells balance the need for speed with accuracy when adapting to new environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our work will advance the frontiers of machine learning theory by enriching the field with new definitions for what these models are accomplishing and new algorithmic goals more closely aligned with how they are used in practice.

This project tests (1) whether focusing attention on a perceptual dimension makes it easier to learn about that dimension?s relationship to speech categories, (2) whether individuals who weight a dimension highly are the individuals who find it easiest to change the weight of that dimension, and (3) whether variability along a dimension has a different effect on learning rate depending on whether the dimension is to be up-weighted or down-weighted.

The remarkable property of the zero resistance has enabled many important applications, such as generating powerful magnetic fields for maglev trains and MRI machines. Moreover, superconductors hold significant promise for quantum computing, a technology that can drastically reduce the time required to solve specific computational problems. As such, advancing our understanding and control of superconductivity remains a cornerstone of condensed matter physics. Recent advances in laser technology have opened exciting possibilities for manipulating superconductivity on ultrafast timescales using light. However, many fundamental questions about superconductivity remain unanswered due to a lack of necessary tools capable of probing the underlying properties directly. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing and applying innovative ultrafast spectroscopic techniques to explore non-equilibrium superconductivity. In addition to its scientific goals, the project includes a robust educational component. It aims to enhance the curriculum in ultrafast and nonlinear optics, provide mentorship opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and conduct outreach activities with local schools in the New York area to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>This project investigates light-driven non-equilibrium dynamics in various superconductors by focusing on the terahertz (THz) frequency range, a natural energy scale of superconducting gap energy. Thus, THz driving can avoid injecting excess heat and lead to unprecedented phenomena, which provide unique properties of superconductivity that are unreachable by frequently used near-infrared excitation. Nevertheless, the study of non-equilibrium superconductivity remains in its infancy due to the lack of appropriate probes of superconductivity on the ultrafast time scale of a few picoseconds. The project will investigate THz-driven collective excitations of superconducting order parameters that can provide unique information, including couplings between two superconducting order parameters and pairing symmetry. This project employs newly developed THz multidimensional coherent spectroscopy for this goal. The project also aims to manipulate superconductivity optically, including its phase coherence and topology, using the recently proposed Floquet engineering.

Materials synthesis remains a crucial bottleneck to the materials discovery process. This project directly addresses this synthesis bottleneck in an emerging class of ternary chalcogenide-based semiconductors. Many materials in this family have been computationally predicted to have excellent properties for solar cells, energy-efficient electronics, and batteries ? materials needed to directly and indirectly advance national health and security. However, experimental synthesis of these predicted materials has proven challenging, as only a handful of these materials have been made. This project involves computationally-led experiments and experimentally-informed computational work to understand and design new synthetic approaches to access these materials. The collaborative nature of this project provides a unique training experience for graduate students through their engagement in advanced computational and experimental research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>This project aims to discover new ternary chalcogenides for optoelectronic applications by leveraging alternative entropy sources that can enable materials synthesis. Many ternary chalcogenides have been predicted to be thermodynamically stable and exhibit compelling optical or electronic properties. Yet, only a small fraction of these predicted compounds have been experimentally synthesized. This project operates under the hypothesis that synthesis of these materials requires careful control of thermodynamic driving forces through entropic factors to prevent competitive compositional decomposition reactions or polymorphic transitions. Specifically, this project employs control over entropy associated with point defect formation, crystal vibrations, and gas evolution to stabilize and synthesize targeted chalcogenide materials relative to competing binary reaction products or polymorphs. The synthesis science discoveries have potential to apply broadly to other classes of materials. This collaborative project leverages first-principles thermodynamic calculations to lead experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as experimental work to inform computational efforts.  Together, this project provides comprehensive training to student researchers in solid-state materials chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many biological molecules are chiral?like our left and right hands, they exist in two mirror-image forms that are chemically identical but structurally distinct. DNA, with its helical shape is chiral. Amino acids, and sugars,  all have ?right-handed? and ?left-handed? versions; as do screws, Slinkys, and springs. In principle, objects with this kind of mirror asymmetry can produce a voltage when we twist them, or twist when we apply a voltage. The catch? It works best when the chiral objects are very small, on the scale of molecules. This project will exploit the electric potential of common biological molecules to create cheap, abundant power sources and microscopic motors. Through publications, demonstrations, and interactive presentations, the team will share the exciting properties of chiral molecules with the scientific community, K-12 students, and the science-curious public. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This project will explore how solids made of randomly-oriented chiral molecules act as torsional piezoelectrics, generating voltage in response to a twist and twisting in response to a voltage. The majority of biological molecules are chiral, allowing for a range of cheap, abundant materials to explore for power related applications . Because the symmetry breaking arises from the molecular chirality rather than crystallinity, even amorphous and polycrystalline solids made of chiral molecules can, in principle, exhibit torsional piezoelectricity.  Arguments based only on mirror symmetry indicate that non-zero components of the piezoelectric tensor exist  and must switch sign for chiral enantiomers This two-year project will study both left- and right-handed enantiomers of at least three different molecules to establish a general relationship between chirality and torsional piezo-electricity.  Amorphous and crystalline solids of chiral molecules will be fabricated via melting with fast and slow cooling, and sintering.  The direct piezoelectric effect will be measured  by subjecting the solids to torsional stresses  in a variety of geometries and measuring the resulting voltage.  The inverse effect will be obtained by subjecting the solid to different voltage configurations and measuring the motion using optical methods. The intellectual merits of this project include the elucidation of novel piezoelectric symmetry breaking mechanisms that may result in functional materials as well as torsional piezoelectric mechanisms for biological energy transfer/mechano-sensing. This work will also provide the community with new insights into the general theory of piezoelectricity in the context of chiral solids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physics of curved quantum materials is a particularly interesting case. For instance, current flowing along a curved surface is theorized to generate a force whose nature can reveal information about the host material. In this project, the research team aims to develop a new method for detecting the role of curvature induced in two-dimensional materials by placing them on top of nanoscale resonators. The curvature alters the stiffness, which can be measured experimentally. The success of this project will be to provide a general approach to controlling properties of noel materials based on their curvature. This project features a strong, combined scientific and educational component. Educational activities include the development of new modules in the undergraduate curriculum, building laboratories demonstrations that make some our proposed concepts tangible ? for instance corrections to elasticity due to centrifugal forces. These demonstrations will be presented both at the undergraduate level within the University of Chicago and externally at popular science events.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: Rapid technological advancements in quantum science are quickly finding use in other fields. This project adapts high-quality ?trampoline? resonators pioneered for quantum experiments in optomechanics as a probe of forces in two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials by forming 2D-trampoline hybrid systems. In addition to being able to detect minute forces, 2D-trampoline hybrids promise access to previously invisible observables related to the interplay between in-plane electronic order and spatial curvature. Such exotic forces are not only interesting in their own right but perhaps provide a key general approach for identifying topological materials, which are important for metrology, classical electronics, and quantum computing. The technical approach is to place a target material on top of a trampoline resonator, and to precisely measure the mechanical motion. Curvature response of the target material will cause corrections to the mechanical eigenfrequencies. The project pursues a set of experimental goals with escalating technical demands and physical rewards. Initial experiments will measure the centrifugal force on supercurrent in a curved surface. These experiments naturally lead to exploration of the role of spatial curvature on superconducting vortices and will allow us to test predictions that vortices feel a repulsive force from regions of spatial curvature. Finally, we will integrate two-dimensional materials with our membranes to search for mechanical signatures of the Wen-Zee curvature coupling in quantum Hall systems. The end point is not only the demonstration of fascinating physical effects, but a new, general approach for exploring the interplay between geometry and topology in two-dimensional materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does the brain allow individuals to actively control signaling behaviors appropriate to different social contexts? Danionella fishes are among the smallest adult vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) and are transparent throughout their lifetime. These qualities give unprecedented access to the entire brain, not yet possible in any other vertebrate. Leveraging Danionella?s relatively simple, highly stereotyped and readily measurable acoustic and postural displays produced only during aggression, the investigators of this project investigate how the adult vertebrate brain regulates communication during aggression. Cellular and molecular methods are used to identify neurons activated during aggressive interactions in brain regions (cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus) that together are proposed to be comparable to a core aggression system in mammals. Artificial intelligence-based methods are used to quantify adult posture and movements during aggression. This approach provides a rigorous analytical framework with which to evaluate the behavioral effects of neuroimaging-guided, laser-induced disruptions to individual brain regions comprising the proposed core aggression circuit. The new model for behavioral neuroscience used in this project thus presents a unique opportunity for identifying and understanding brain networks activated in adults during social interactions and, more specifically, during aggression. The project also includes activities aimed at transferring knowledge via interactive public events, and to provide interdisciplinary training and education to individuals at different career stages. <br/> <br/>Understanding how forebrain neuronal networks (e.g., preoptic area, hypothalamus) control the output of downstream motor-patterning circuitry in the midbrain remains central to understanding how the brain enables individuals to select and sequence different patterns of behavior. Social communication behaviors in fishes are particularly tractable models for addressing this challenge. Their behaviors are often highly stereotyped, differ in a finite set of easily quantified features, and depend on precise patterns of neural activation. Recent studies effectively demonstrate that miniature, transparent species of Danionella fishes, which are among the smallest living adult vertebrates, provide particularly tractable models for uncovering principles of neuro-behavioral mechanisms applicable to all vertebrates. Unlike the closely-related zebrafish, which are neither naturally transparent nor miniature as adults, Danionella adults make robust acoustic and postural displays that are often closely linked in timing during aggressive interactions. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to map a forebrain aggression network that is activated in Danionella during multimodal displays and identify its neurochemical phenotypes. Aim 2 involves use of laser ablations of select forebrain sites identified in Aim 1 to test the predictions of a model, informed by artificial intelligence-based quantitative analysis of acoustic, postural, and jaw extension displays, about the forebrain?s role in driving acoustic and postural behaviors. These aims offer unprecedented opportunities to establish Danionella as a model to guide brain-wide optical and genetic studies of neural circuits underlying adult vertebrate aggression.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the greatest threats facing human society in the coming decades is an increase in antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The widespread use of antibiotics starting in the mid-20th century led to plummeting rates of mortality from infections and contributed to one of the greatest increases in life expectancy of any technological innovation. Unfortunately more and more infections that resist antibiotic treatment are occurring, threatening to undo those advances and usher in a much more dangerous post-antibiotic era. The overuse of antibiotics by doctors and hospitals is often cited as the cause of this change, but research suggests that environmental pollution might also play a role. In a historically contaminated part of Birmingham, Alabama, that has housed coal-burning facilities for over a century, elevated levels of heavy metals like lead and manganese appear to favor the evolution of bacteria that are resistant not only to these toxic substance but also to antibiotics. The predominantly African American residents of the affected neighborhoods already face elevated levels of respiratory and other chronic diseases, and they may also face elevated risk of dangerous antibiotic resistant infection due to the heavy metals in their environment. This research will put a scientific lens on the question of where antibiotic resistance comes from and how it spreads from point sources into the environment, but it will also confront the environmental injustice experienced by the human beings who are bearing the costs of decades of industrial pollution. The project will involve the people who live in the affected neighborhoods, where the researchers will attempt to win back some of the trust in science that has been lost due to a history of neglect and corruption surrounding this neighborhood and its ongoing struggle with the residue of its industrial past.<br/><br/>It is generally accepted that antibiotic resistance spreads fastest in bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. This research will attempt to observe these exchanges taking place using a unique laboratory method, where an environmental sample is separated from laboratory bacteria by a membrane that has pores big enough to allow DNA, but not cells, to pass, and then to see what kinds of antibiotic resistance genes from the environment are able to be transferred into the lab strains. Researchers will also collect soil and wastewater from around the Birmingham area to see how much antibiotic resistance exists in the environment, and mathematicians will use computer models to understand whether the resistance genes are coming from humans using antibiotics as medicine, from agricultural sources, from pollution in the soil, or from a combination of these factors. Despite the critical importance of horizontal gene transfer in this and other bacterial activities, very little is known about how it actually takes place in nature, how fast it can move genes around, or how far from a point source it can move resistance genes; this research will address all of these topics using cutting-edge laboratory and computational tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include searching for the perfect snack in a supermarket, looking for a misplaced phone in a cluttered room, or finding a friend in a busy restaurant. The efficiency with which humans perform these tasks has a significant impact on the quality of daily life. The current project uses behavior, eye-tracking, virtual reality, brain activity, and computational modeling to test the idea that the efficiency of visual search depends on two stages of processing with two different computational goals: 1) a first stage with ?good enough? attentional guidance to select potential targets for closer inspection, and 2) a second stage involving a decision that emphasizes accuracy over speed. The overall goal is to understand organizing principles that make visual search efficient. In addition to the scientific work, this project supports the training and professional development of undergraduate students with activities that build scientific literacy, analytical skills, and emphasize links between classroom learning and the workforce.<br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses that guidance and decisions in visual search rely on different types of information because they have different computational goals, not because they work on different feature types. One set of experiments tests the prediction that during visual search, attentional guidance prioritizes speed over accuracy, but that decisions prioritize accuracy over speed. To do this, simple stimulus arrays in which the precision and feature-dimension used for guidance and decisions are separately measured using eye-tracking data, electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERPs), and drift-diffusion modeling (DDM). Another set of experiments, also using behavior, EEG, and DDMs, test the prediction that attentional guidance relies on non-target information such as prior knowledge about typical scenes because they act as rapidly detectable spatial cues for the target.  Additionally, the project uses immersive virtual reality and DDMs to examine search efficiency in naturalistic contexts and test for hierarchical processes in which guidance prioritizes information and leads to reductions in the search space. Overall, the project aims to address important limitations of existing models of attention and aims to understand how visual search is efficient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The elaboration of building blocks such as olefins, aromatics, and saturated hydrocarbons into more complex structures can be achieved by chemical reactions involving carbene fragments, which typically require metal catalysts to proceed efficiently. The best catalyst systems available currently rely heavily on rare and precious metals, which increases the cost of the resulting products and presents sustainability challenges due to limited resource availability.

The first aim of these studies is to establish how changes in the molecular structure and coordination geometry influence the electronic structures of the resulting complexes and their reactive metal carbenoid fragments. The second aim seeks to connect differences in electronic structure to changes in reactivity by studying  catalytically competent, isolable iron- and cobalt-carbene complexes. A key hypothesis of the proposed research is that open coordination sites in square-planar carbene complexes will allow unprecedented control over the regioselectivity of carbene transfer using directing groups on the substrates. Finally, the third aim is to investigate the potential of four-coordinate iron carbenes to engage in [2+2] cycloaddition chemistry, which is a key step toward iron catalyst-mediated olefin metathesis. The proposed complexes possess coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, potentially opening up new opportunities for the control of reactivity compared to previously reported iron-carbene complexes.

Algebraic K-Theory and Algebraic Cycles are certain special techniques that can understand the geometric nature of a problem, one that is again defined in terms of polynomial equations. In recent years there have been a number of important developments in this area and the purpose of the week-long workshop and conference is to bring together established experts in these areas along with early-career researchers with the goal of stimulating further progress.<br/><br/>In more detail, in recent years there have been major developments in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles, leading up to the solution of the Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures, as well as the conjectures of Thomason and Morel concerned with equivariant phenomena for actions of linear algebraic groups. The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area, which are often arithmetic in nature, but use sophisticated tools from Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic cycles. The goal of the program is to focus on several of the outstanding problems in the area, surveying the progress made and planning strategies for further advancement.

Many genetic and biochemical methods of protein depletion are known, but all of them deplete protein throughout the cell. If one wishes to study how a DNA-binding protein does its job in a cell, these methods likewise will eliminate the protein whether or not it is bound anywhere on DNA. In contrast, the proposed technology will eliminate only those protein molecules that are bound to a specific region of interest. The project will provide training for up to four graduate students in the EPSCOR state of Kansas. <br/><br/>The proposed novel method will involve tagging a protein of interest with an auxin-inducible degron (AID), which has been used before to rapidly deplete nearly all the protein target throughout any cell when the plant hormone auxin is added extraneously. If a protein has multiple functions within a cell, however, this depletion can have multiple direct and secondary effects. The proposed High Risk/High Reward research will conbine several genomic technologies in a novel way, to develop, first, a method to selectively deplete the chromatin-bound Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (RDC) complex at specific locus that flanks a transposable element insertion in Drosophila. Next, the method will be applied to human cells and extended to deplete specifically a complex of two interacted proteins, CTCF and cohesin, without affecting each of the proteins alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Eaton and Palisades fires that broke out in early January have been labeled the second and third most destructive fires on record in California. Residents in these areas continue to face uncertainty as to how air quality during and after these fires has impacted their health. The work will provide timely information to the residents of these areas on their air quality during the fires and offer general insight into the potential health impacts of fires like these that occur at the wildland urban interface.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to: (1) Investigate the impact of the Palisades and Eaton Fires on the concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the Los Angeles area, and (2) Develop a process-level understanding of VOC persistence in indoor spaces following a wildland urban interface fire. A suite of research-grade instrumentation was deployed on the roof of UCLA?s Young Hall from January 11-30, 2025, during an intense phase of the Eaton and Palisades fires. The site is approximately 6 miles from the Palisades fire and 20 miles from the Eaton Fire. These data will be used to identify signatures of emissions from fires and burn areas, examine differences as compared to typical biomass burning emissions, assess correlations between VOC concentrations and more typical metrics of air quality, and use a photochemical box model to assess potential impacts on ozone production during and after the fires. A set of follow-up measurements will be performed 1 year later in the same location with the same instrumentation to serve as a baseline for comparison of smoke-impacted measurements. Samples of common household materials will be collected from several smoke-impacted homes in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods of Los Angeles, as well as similar materials from homes in less-impacted areas of Los Angeles. VOC off-gassing will be measured under controlled conditions to assess how individual materials and surfaces contribute to the lingering effects of VOC partitioning on indoor air after a fire.

However, access to quality STEM education experiences can be limited among historically underserved youth. Furthermore, women and individuals identifying as Latinx or Black remain underrepresented in STEM fields. Responding to community needs, this project will develop and study a curriculum that leverages sports to teach STEM content and practices to youth in informal learning settings. While the idea of contextualizing STEM learning through sports is not new, the proposed work is particularly important in that it focuses on youth aged 8 through 11, while most of the existing research on STEM and sports centers on students in middle school and beyond. In close partnership with a historically underserved community, the project team will advance youths? STEM content knowledge, practices, and identity based on community goals, values, and assets. <br/><br/>Guided by sociocultural learning theories, the positive youth development model, and theories of STEM identity development, the project team and participating community members will co-develop a STEM and sports program that is rooted in the local context, community-identified goals, and youths? own interests. Using participatory design research techniques and building on a pilot program, the project will develop a six-week STEM program, Teaming STEM + Sports, that is aligned with national STEM and physical education standards for youth aged 8 through 11 years. The project team will collaborate closely with youth, parents, community members, educators, and nonprofit organizations throughout the project. Community and nonprofit partners will implement the curriculum each summer in community settings over four years, reaching over 250 youth participants. Using iterative descriptive studies as part of the development process and a quasi-experiment to test the program?s impact, the project will address the following research questions: (1) To what extent do youth perceive the program as culturally relevant, connected with their lived experiences, and engaging? (2) How does participation in Teaming STEM +Sports associate with youths? STEM content knowledge and STEM identity? (3) What is the effect of the program on youths? mathematics and science content knowledge? (4) To what extent are youth provided with opportunities to use STEM practices? (5) To what extent do facilitators perceive the program as feasible to implement? Insights related to collaboration and codesign will be transferable to other contexts, and digital versions of the curriculum will be available on a project website, enabling others to adopt the Teaming STEM + Sports program and adapt it to their local contexts.<br/><br/>This Integrating Research and Practice project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The team will use a combination of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study electrolytes of varying salt concentrations, cations and anions, and pH values to support their hypothesis that the electrochemical window of aqueous solutions can be expanded by discouraging their solvation of hydroxides and protons, the byproducts of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Their studies will elucidate key factors in chemical environment that dictate HER and OER onset potentials in aqueous electrolytes. Besides three graduate students who will directly perform the project tasks, the three PI?s labs will engage in outreach activities via online videos and in-person chemistry summer camps.<br/><br/>This collaborative research project by Ji and Fang Labs at Oregon State University and Greaney Lab at UC Riverside will systematically investigate how solvation environments in aqueous electrolytes affect water?s HER and OER as well as the electrolytes? resulting electrochemical stability window (ESW).

Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. Enzymes may be used in the chemical industry and other industrial applications including food and beverage processing, pharmaceutical and cosmetic production, animal feeds, textiles, paper production, and household cleaning products.  Currently, enzymes are limited by the number of reactions they can catalyze and also by their lack of stability in organic solvents and at high temperatures. To address these challenges, protein engineering has been developed to create new enzymes with novel properties. However, this technology is often hampered by the inability to specifically identify or design enzymes with the combination of properties needed to make the process both technically feasible and economically viable. The aim of this discovery platform is to identify enzyme variants that have the required combination of properties to create new industrial enzymes with superior properties that will improve industrial processes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a platform to identify regions of the amino acid sequence space that encode proteins for enzyme-based industrial processes. Proteins in nature occur as protein families that share similar amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures but often have considerable functional diversity. Biotech companies developing, producing, or using enzymes may encounter a protein from a protein family of interest exhibiting excellent stability but slow catalytic activity while another protein from this protein family has the opposite pair of functional characteristics (excellent catalytic rate but poor stability). Currently, it is challenging to obtain an enzyme that combines both desirable properties. A process has been developed that may yield dually optimized enzymes. This approach provides an enhanced sampling approach to identify previously undiscoverable functional proteins in sequence space. The solution is applicable to any enzyme or protein activity for which an optical readout is available either for the purified protein or in cell-based assays and it may be used to achieve optimal combinations of a wide range of protein properties. The goal of the technology is to identify variants of proteins and enzymes that exhibit a combination of enhanced properties. This enhanced sampling technology is based on the design and experimental study of a series of computationally derived proteins.  The technology combines gene synthesis, high-throughput measurements of the properties of enzyme variants, and strategies to select the most informative sequences. Such proteins may make enzyme-based industrial processes economically viable and yield proteins with superior properties for a range of biotechnology applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It looks at the impact of the specific language that an individual encounters in day-to-day life (i.e., specific websites, videos, books, magazines, and social media), as well as factors like memory, the speed with which information is processed, and the ability to mentally track ideas. Understanding how each of these factors influence language processing and language learning informs an understanding of how humans learn language, with the translational potential of developing more effective methods of language acquisition. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of how an individual's experience with language affects language processing abilities. Factors like reading habits, exposure to different types of text, and cognitive abilities (such as working memory, attention, and processing speed) are measured to determine how each factor influences an individual's preferences and performance when processing complex English sentence structures. Although the scientific literature suggests that speakers are extremely sensitive to the linguistic frequency of grammatical structures and words in a language, how exactly frequency is used is unclear. Some work proposes that speakers' linguistic preferences match the frequency with which they encounter these structures in day-to-day life, but more recent findings suggest that people with more experience with language are more flexible in their language preferences. The project will involve two main experiments. The first experiment assesses how much experience with language, as measured by self-reported reading habits and the characteristics of the texts that participants read online, impacts preferences for dative sentences and phrasal verbs. The second experiment examines how reading experience and cognitive abilities interact to influence how quickly and accurately participants process sentences with complex syntactic structures. The findings help inform language teaching practices and help to develop interventions that better support learners based on their unique experiences and cognitive profiles.

While existing scholarship emphasizes the role of trust in shaping civic attitudes and behavior, research often overlooks how one?s willingness to take risks can vary across different aspects of life, and neglects how risk taking might affect the extent to which trust affects civic participation. By systematically investigating how trust and risk interact to shape civic attitudes and behavior, this project aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of civic engagement, for example, why individuals might trust the government but remain skeptical of the electoral process, or why people continue to participate in civic activities despite increasing distrust in civic elites and institutions over time. <br/><br/>Leveraging original data collected during the November 2024 presidential election, this project examines the relationship between different types of trust and risk taking, hypothesizing that the extent to which people rely on trust may depend on how willing they are to take certain risks. Whereas individuals who are less willing to take certain risks may rely more on trust when deciding whether to vote or engage in other civic activities, those who are more willing to take certain risks may rely less on trust when deciding whether to participate. Combined with complementary experimental data, this project provides robust evidence on the roles of trust and risk taking in shaping civic attitudes and behavior. These data will also be used to develop a novel and validated measure of civic risk taking. Findings from this research help advance interdisciplinary scholarship while offering policymakers, scholars, and society guidance for mitigating deficits in trust, enhancing civic participation, and improving democratic health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, students in rural spaces often find themselves taught through lessons and curricular materials not directly relevant to, or seemingly counter to, their lived experience. This project seeks to co-develop and implement a locally relevant and integrated computer science curriculum that centers the lived experiences of rural Hawaiian students and communities. It is hypothesized that understanding and engaging local educational needs creates opportunities for students to learn in ways that make schooling meaningful and relevant to their experiences, culture, community, identity. These impacts will increase interest, belonging and pursuit of STEM coursework and careers.<br/><br/>Using a mixed methods approach, researchers and educators will work together to iteratively co-design and evaluate curricular materials that center Hawaiian students? experiences and sense of community to support youth in developing strong connections to STEM learning that foster their future engagement and interest in STEM. Before, during, and after co-design activities, the research team will directly observe interactions amongst teachers and students during instructional time.  As implementation, design, and refinement of the curriculum proceeds, the research team will leverage interview, focus group, and observational data collection from multiple stakeholders (i.e., school administrators, staff, teachers, students, and parents of students), to develop survey items. These items reflect distinct perspectives on what schooling and school success are and should be, the perceived value of and interest in future opportunities associated with Computer Science, s well as the level of empowerment and inclusion experienced. The surveys will be administered 3 times per year. The team will initially conduct exploratory factor analyses on the responses to establish a tentative factor structure that links the meanings for items held by stakeholders within the community to broader concepts. As those components stabilize within groups across the three deployments of the first full academic year (Fall, Y1-Spring Y2), analyses will move to a confirmatory factor analytic framework to validate the within-group measurement structure, moving next to assessing measurement invariance between groups and across time. The results of this study will allow the team to develop an evidence-based, transferable model of curriculum development that centers the experiences of local students to meet the educational needs of rural communities. Further, the team will develop locally responsive measures of educational success, student sense of belonging, and agency in schooling to gauge its development in context over three years of middle school and to ascertain impacts of materials developed using this model for rural curricular development. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Although such learning algorithms have had widespread empirical success, we have yet to find a coherent mathematical foundation that can explain not only why they work and what tasks they provably solve, but also how practitioners can improve their performance either by adjusting the algorithm or even the task itself. The investigator aims to lay this foundation by advancing the design, analysis, and deployment of rigorously justified nonconvex optimization algorithms. This research will create guaranteed procedures for training practical machine learning systems deployed in government and industry, producing more reliable and robust predictive models with fewer data and computational resources. The investigator will incorporate results from this project in education efforts, including course development, local K-12 outreach, and research mentoring of Ph.D. and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator designs and analyzes nonconvex optimization algorithms. The project focuses on simple iterative methods that compute with data in its ambient form, a class of algorithms that are uniquely scalable to modern high-dimensional statistical estimation and learning tasks. The overarching goal of the project is to understand when these methods converge to local or global optima and to provide efficiency estimates of their performance, measured both in terms of data and computational resources consumed. To achieve this goal, the investigation will draw on the techniques of variational analysis, nonsmooth optimization, machine learning, statistics, and high-dimensional probability. The investigator will leverage these techniques to design and equip simple, scalable iterative methods for nonconvex data fitting problems with strong performance guarantees: generic initialization strategies, rapid local convergence near optima, and seamless adaptation to nonsmooth constraints, models, priors.

Geoeconomics, a largely unexplored area, studies the economies of countries and the relationship among countries on a global scale. Great powers use geoeconomic strengths and related policies to achieve their geopolitical and economic objectives. This research consists of five projects. It studies the consequences of a great power that can project economic influence, provides empirical measurement of geoeconomic powers, and examines how countries can shield themselves from unwanted influence. It also analyzes competition between great powers of the world and the role of a country?s currency in power projection. Finally, it investigates competition and cooperation in corporate tax regimes. The results are globally relevant given the focus on strategic sectors, trade policy, and national security concerns over ownership of strategic assets. The research findings could help develop optimal geoeconomic strategies, enhance the wellbeing of citizens, and structure international interactions among countries. The research also produces teaching materials designed to equip future students and researchers with the tools they need to further advance the field.<br/><br/>This award funds research projects that study how countries leverage their international economic relationships to pursue geopolitical and economic objectives. This theoretical and empirical research consists of five parts. This research first provides a theoretical framework, a basic model of geoeconomics, to understand how countries can leverage their international economic relationships to influence the policies and economic activities in foreign countries. Second, it focuses on the trade-off between economic security and integration and studies how countries can most effectively safeguard themselves against unwanted foreign influence, balancing the need to safeguard economic security against the benefits of international economic integration. This project provides a model-based measure of power and, drawing on public data on trade and financial service flows, estimates the sources of power for Great Powers. Third, in an increasingly multipolar world with geopolitical rivals, it examines great power competition and assesses how international economic activities and political relationships are shaped by great power competition. It develops a theoretical model of competing influence by multiple hegemons within a global production network and constructs a new dataset of government ownership to trace how governments are expanding strategic investments. Fourth, it investigates geopolitics of currency competition and studies how a country having a dominant currency shapes a geoeconomic strategy, with particular emphasis on the effect of the rise of alternative currencies. This research employs a dynamic model of reputation building in which countries compete to supply safe assets, and in which there are economic and geopolitical benefits to becoming a reserve currency. Fifth, it focuses on international national tax competition, cooperation, and geopolitics and evaluates how countries compete and cooperate over corporate tax regimes, with an emphasis on the potential for international cooperation as well as for hegemonic countries to use coercion to enforce their preferred tax regime. This study uses micro-data on activities of U.S. multinationals to estimate elasticities of firm activities to changes in corporate tax regimes. These statistics are used to inform a quantitative model of tax competition across countries that is used to evaluate the welfare and distributional consequences of corporate tax reform. These projects could enable researchers and decision-makers to gain deeper insights into the underlying drivers of international relations and the influence of geoeconomic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced DNA sequencing techniques will be used to map 6mA across the genome, providing insights into how this DNA modification is involved in gene regulation. The study focuses on the molecular mechanisms placing 6mA in the appropriate genomic context. Understanding 6mA could reveal new aspects of how genes are turned on and off, shedding light on fundamental processes of life. This research not only advances basic science but also has potential implications for understanding epigenetic changes in health and disease. The project also has strong educational and community outreach components. Data from the study will be shared publicly, supporting other researchers, and the project will involve training students at various levels. This ensures the next generation of scientists is equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to continue advancing this important field. <br/><br/>This project will study DNA N6-adenine methylation (6mA) using the unicellular eukaryote Tetrahymena thermophila as a model system.  6mA?s potential as a eukaryotic epigenetic mark has attracted great interest, but its biogenesis and functional implications remain elusive.  Tetrahymena is the first eukaryote with 6mA found in its nuclear DNA 50 years ago, and more recently, with a 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) identified and characterized.  Using Single Molecule Real-Time, Circular Consensus Sequencing, 6mA on individual Tetrahymena genomic DNA molecules are mapped with high sensitivity and accuracy, and at single-nucleotide resolution.  AMT1, a member of the MT-A70 family of MTases, is shown to be crucial for establishing the transcription-associated 6mA distribution pattern in Tetrahymena.  Nonetheless, how 6mA is specifically deposited?in the context of transcription, replication, and chromatin?still needs to be elucidated.  The PIs will dissect transcription-associated and replication-coupled targeting mechanisms for 6mA deposition.  The PIs will also elucidate the biochemical and structural basis for AMT1-dependent, semiconservative, and chromatin-guided transmission of 6mA.

With increased focus on STEM education for students with ESN, engineering practices highlight the importance of problem-solving skills (e.g., systems thinking, creativity). Further, for students with ESN, engineering lessons/units may provide a viable format for systematically planned math and science instruction, that naturally embeds opportunities to teach students skills promoting increased self-regulated learning.

First, the team will develop a framework of conceptual and epistemic understanding of engineering education for students with ESN. Data will then be collected across multiple mixed methods studies using (a) teacher interviews and focus groups; (b) evaluation of professional learning; (c) classroom observations and behavior coding; (d) fidelity of implementation of engineering curriculum; and (e) assessment of student engineering-focused behaviors and mindsets.

The upper atmosphere above 100 km altitude consists of electrically neutral gases as well as electrically charged ions and free electrons. The neutral component is called the thermosphere, and the charged components are called the ionosphere. The ionosphere significantly alters the propagation of radio waves passing through it, including communication and navigation signals transmitted from satellites. Because of their impacts on radio propagation, understanding the processes creating structures in the ionosphere is a critical part of space weather research.  This research will be conducted with numerical models of the coupled thermosphere and ionosphere as well as analysis of ionospheric data from radars and the global positioning system.  The project will support a graduate student and the models will be open-source to the community. Results of the project will be used to create classroom examples of ionospheric phenomena for use in undergraduate and graduate classes at UCLA.<br/><br/>The polar cap ionosphere contains a variety of mesoscale (100-1000 km) electron density structures, including polar cap patches and tongues of ionization. The electron density gradients associated with these structures can drive plasma instabilities and severely affect radio propagation at high latitudes.

Magnetospheric energy inputs drive significant variations in the high-latitude neutral thermosphere. This project will examine ion-neutral coupling processes at high latitudes to understand how the thermospheric dynamics affect the electron density structures and associated ion outflow. The specific science questions to be addressed are (1) How do thermospheric density and composition changes during geomagnetic storms affect the formation and evolution of high-latitude electron density structures? and (2) How do thermospheric variations modulate the supply of ion upflow and outflow?  These questions will be addressed with controlled numerical experiments coupling the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model 3.0 (TIEGCM 3.0) model of the neutral thermosphere to the High-latitude Ionospheric Dynamics for Research Applications (HIDRA) model of the high-latitude ionosphere and polar wind.

This work will address important issues regarding the emissions of acutely and chronically harmful substances being discharged into the river and subsequently released into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This project focuses on time and location dependent water-phase concentration data and modeling of the air-to-water emissions of important volatilizable compounds from the Tijuana River system. This data will be used with other information needed for estimating overall air-liquid mass transfer coefficients based on (a) the liquid-side resistance values (as determined primarily by flow velocity and depth regimes); and (b) the air-side resistance (as determined primarily by wind velocity regimes). The relative magnitudes of the two resistances are affected by the compound itself and temperature-dependent Henry?s Gas Law Constant.  Researchers from the University of California at San Diego and the University of California at Riverside will collaborate on efforts that use river water concentration data with temperature-dependent Henry?s Gas Law Constant values, flow rate and depth data/estimates, and meteorological wind data to estimate temporally dependent emissions from the Tijuana River system to the San Diego/Tijuana air shed for use in air quality modeling. The knowledge gained from this work will inform the understanding of the air quality affecting populations at widely different scales, ranging from those who live and work in the local area, to the region surrounding and including the city of San Diego, and ultimately to the entire area affected by the transport of these emissions into other regions of the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will test how categorical forensic decisions may contribute to wrongful convictions and identify ways to reduce their harm to the innocent. Wrongful conviction is a serious problem within the US criminal legal system, with far-reaching societal and economic consequences. Invalid forensic analysis is one cause of the problem; however, even valid forensic analysis can contribute to miscarriages of justice if forensic experts unwittingly miscommunicate the meaning of their findings to legal decision makers. Categorical forensic decisions, though seemingly straightforward, have the potential to convey more or less culpability than the physical forensic evidence actually supports. When this happens, innocent people can be convicted and guilty people can go free, eroding trust in the legal system, threatening public safety, and wasting valuable economic resources. This project will promote the fair administration of justice by helping to transform how forensic decisions are reported, understood, and used throughout the criminal legal system and provide opportunities to mentor students and an early career researcher and to foster the engagement of a variety of students in the research process.<br/><br/>This three-year project includes five experiments and a continuing legal education component designed for attorneys and judges. Grounded in sender-receiver models of the communication process, the laboratory experiments will (1) test whether categorical forensic decisions encourage miscommunication between forensic experts and prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges, (2) demonstrate whether an alternative forensic reporting metric can help forensic experts to more effectively communicate their findings to legal decision makers, and (3) examine the effectiveness of expert testimony for clarifying the meaning of categorical forensic decisions for jurors and juries.

Solid-state single-photon emitters experience detrimental decoherence caused by noise from spin, charge, and atomic vibrations. However, the relative contributions of these sources to decoherence and their atomistic origin are not well understood. Professor Utzat?s group will leverage a new type of spectroscopy based on quantum optics to disentangle the role of charge and spin noise in decoherence in single emitters within monolayers of boron nitride and quantum dots composed of metal halide perovskites. By accessing currently experimentally challenging timescales from picoseconds to nanoseconds, foundational insights into how the condensed-phase environment interferes with the transduction between electronic and photonic coherences will be uncovered. Further impact arises from the formulation of materials design principles aimed at suppressing decoherence, leading to higher-quality single-photon emitters. The program also supports the development of a quantum-educated U.S. workforce through an extracurricular science workshop for high school students.<br/><br/>Hong-Ou-Mandel spectroscopy compares the single-photon indistinguishability from solid-state emitters as a way to measure bath fluctuations on timescales ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds. Varying photon time separations are employed to disentangle the effects of photon scattering, spin noise, and charge noise on the loss of photon indistinguishability. This loss is probed through the reduction in time-dependent two-photon interference visibility, derived from second-order photon correlation measurements. The Utzat group will use this method to quantify the dephasing mechanisms of two emerging single-photon emitters: defects in hexagonal boron nitride and quantum dots made of lead-halide perovskites. Specific objectives include quantifying the contributions of different dephasing pathways and uncovering their atomistic origins through temperature- and field-dependent studies combined with theoretical modeling. The broader impacts of this work involve the development of tools that address a critical measurement gap in the timescales of single-emitter dynamics. This is important due to the universality of dephasing mechanisms in solid-state environments and the need for future quantum engineering at the single-emitter level. Students participating in this project will gain expertise in an array of principles and methods in quantum optics, which are highly relevant to advanced technology industries, including quantum sensing and quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically materials are used for specific purposes, for example, wood to hold up rigid floors or foam for cushioning. These materials do not change their properties as people interact with them. While a rigid floor is great for walking, cushioning properties would be desirable to prevent injuries if a person falls. This project will develop materials that can change their properties to adapt to people and their actions. Generally, materials consist of microscale structures. For example, looking very closely at foam materials that are often used for packaging reveals that they consist of many tiny randomly oriented struts. This project will generate strategically oriented struts to perform a desired deformation when people interact with it. In the floor example, structures that soften upon a large impact, such as a person falling, will be generated. Similarly, material structures to provide ergonomic support can be computed, such as a chair cushion that becomes thicker in the back when people sit down to promote an upright posture. Such materials can also be tailored to people's bodies, for example, as assistive braces for rehabilitation that can adapt their stiffness with every step.<br/><br/>The scientific aims of this project are to understand when and how users will interact with such adaptive materials and how to design and fabricate them. Materials governed by their microstructures (also known as mechanical metamaterials) with designed bulk behavior have been investigated in engineering disciplines yet a deeper understanding of their human-centered qualities is missing, for example, their capabilities for interaction, user needs, or utility. To approach such interactive passive materials systematically, this project will address three classes of challenges. The first challenge is understanding how users will interact with the materials. The second challenge is developing advanced computational design tools that optimize new structures and allow them to be shared, evaluated, and reused. The final challenge is the long-term integration and in-depth user evaluations of applications. The project will first create a robust analysis of application domains and user evaluations of initial prototypes, resulting in a new design space that characterizes the material-changing interfaces. Based on these findings, libraries of structures and computational design tools will be built to foster a growing repository of designs and associated performance evaluations, enhancing collaborative opportunities and innovation in the field.

For example, when seeing a group of people for the first time, some names and faces may easily stick in memory, while others fade away even after several meetings. Indeed, recent work has found that images, voices, and words have an inherent memorability?where some are more easily remembered than others, across people. This universality in memory means that one can make honed predictions of what people will remember, based on the events they are experiencing. Further, this universality suggests shared mechanisms across people that determines what information is saved into memory. However, it is still unknown what causes an item to be memorable?prior work suggests that it is not one singular factor (e.g., attractiveness) or a combination of factors, but instead something deeper about how the brain processes information. This project tests three major theories about what determines an item?s memorability, with the goal of answering how brains prioritize what should be saved in memory versus what should be discarded. Testing and understanding these theories makes memory more predictable?allowing for the creation of textbooks with easy-to-remember images, better diagnostic tests of Alzheimer?s disease, or art exhibits that leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>These three main theories will be tested using converging methods in behavioral experiments, brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI), and artificial intelligence (AI). The first theory poses that brains organize memories in maps, and memorability reflects where an item is in that map. In other words, memorable items may be in more central, accessible locations, while forgettable items are on the less accessible outskirts. This hypothesis is tested using computational models testing the structure of these maps and how they relate to actual memory. The second theory poses that memorable items are those that are easiest for the brain to process?in other words, if it is easy to process, it is easier to save in memory. This theory is tested by looking at measures of cognitive effort (using behavior and eye-tracking methods) and testing if AI models also show similar effects. Finally, the third theory poses that this ?memorability effect? reflects an important computation of the brain that happens between perceiving information and saving it into memory. This hypothesis is tested using fMRI scans to see how the brain represents memorable items and how it changes with task, stimulus type, and familiarity. In addition to experiments in the laboratory, this project also tests memory theories in more real-world settings.

Many materials in this family have been computationally predicted to have excellent properties for solar cells, energy-efficient electronics, and batteries ? materials needed to directly and indirectly advance national health and security. However, experimental synthesis of these predicted materials has proven challenging, as only a handful of these materials have been made. This project involves computationally-led experiments and experimentally-informed computational work to understand and design new synthetic approaches to access these materials. The collaborative nature of this project provides a unique training experience for graduate students through their engagement in advanced computational and experimental research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>This project aims to discover new ternary chalcogenides for optoelectronic applications by leveraging alternative entropy sources that can enable materials synthesis. Many ternary chalcogenides have been predicted to be thermodynamically stable and exhibit compelling optical or electronic properties. Yet, only a small fraction of these predicted compounds have been experimentally synthesized. This project operates under the hypothesis that synthesis of these materials requires careful control of thermodynamic driving forces through entropic factors to prevent competitive compositional decomposition reactions or polymorphic transitions. Specifically, this project employs control over entropy associated with point defect formation, crystal vibrations, and gas evolution to stabilize and synthesize targeted chalcogenide materials relative to competing binary reaction products or polymorphs. The synthesis science discoveries have potential to apply broadly to other classes of materials. This collaborative project leverages first-principles thermodynamic calculations to lead experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as experimental work to inform computational efforts.

The importance of quantum physics  in technology is rapidly growing. Quantum mechanics combines both particle and wave concepts leading to unintuitive but very robust effects used in modern technology. In recent years, the focus of quantum research has shifted to non-equilibrium phenomena including but not limited to quantum computation and simulation in complex circuits, various high-precision metrological applications, and designing quantum materials with desired properties by driving them away from thermal equilibrium.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two major themes: i) understanding, characterizing and controlling chaos in interacting many-particle systems and ii) developing formalism for describing systems which have both quantum and classical degrees of freedom interacting with each other. <br/>Most systems around us are chaotic. On the one hand chaos reduces our ability to predict and control the behavior of various systems. On the other, it leads to long time stability of matter. Colloquially, the situation is like with tornadoes: they appear because of chaos leading to instabilities in the atmosphere and they disappear also because of chaos eventually relaxing to a homogeneous state dictated by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics, which would not exist without chaos. The P.I. and his group recently developed a new framework of defining and characterizing both quantum and classical chaotic systems using a geometric approach. In the current project, the P.I. will focus on universal (model independent) aspects of chaos focusing on least studied intermediate and long-time behavior of such systems. A special focus will be on finding similarities and differences between quantum and classical chaotic systems.<br/><br/>The second thrust is focused on the interplay between fast quantum and slow classical degrees of freedom. A colloquial example is a bucket with water. When classical bucket quickly rotates, the quantum water molecules form a new equilibrium state where water stays in the bucket even when it is upside down. This happens because quantum and classical degrees of freedom cannot be easily separated from each other forming a joint synchronized motion. While this example with rotations is of course well understood, for more complex motions like crystal vibrations, the existing theoretical framework, known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), is insufficient. The PI and collaborators have just developed a new general approach allowing one to systematically go beyond the BOA and describe such systems. In the current project PI plans to apply this approach to specific setups relevant to materials and other experimental platforms.<br/><br/>The main broader impact is a commitment to finish a new graduate level textbook on quantum mechanics with the expected completion date in mid-2026. The book (co-authored with M. Rigol and P. Claeys) gives a new perspective on quantum physics shifting focus from understanding atomic orbitals to concepts relevant for understanding modern technology. The PI, also actively continues training students at all levels and performing extra curriculum teaching at various US and international short-term schools.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education into quantum mechanical systems of interacting particles far from equilibrium. The research part of this proposal has two main themes: i) understanding quantum and classical chaos and ergodicity through adiabatic transformations and ii) systematic expansion of dynamics of systems with joint classical and quantum degrees of freedom beyond Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA).<br/><br/>As it was shown by PI and collaborators adiabatic transformations connect into a single framework many seemingly different phenomena like emergence of local conservation laws, Schrieffer-Wolff transformations, Floquet Hamiltonians, short and long-time dynamics and operator growth, quantum chaos and ergodicity, design of fast and efficient quantum annealing protocols and quantum thermal machines. There also emerged new ideas, which will be central to this proposal like connecting quantum and classical chaos/ergodicity into a single framework, universal dynamics of systems close to integrability, and a systematic approach allowing one to go beyond the BOA for describing systems with quantum and classical degrees of freedom like molecules or electron-phonon systems. Using this approach PI also plans to study emergent nonequilibrium steady states as states approximately equilibrating in the moving frame and, in particular, to understand how these non-perturbative states affect macroscopic physical observables like transport coefficients. PI will continue close interactions with experimental groups to test these theoretical ideas in various setups such as cold atoms, trapped ions, NV-centers, superconducting qubits, and various other quantum simulators.<br/> <br/>The main broader impact is a commitment to finish a new graduate level textbook on quantum mechanics with the expected completion date in mid-2026.

When we walk through a park we not only see a rich visual world, we also hear sounds ranging from birds tweeting to the conversations taking place around us. All of this information has meaning, informing us about the structure of our current world, how it is likely to immediately change, and how we might best respond adaptively to it. Sounds are an important source of information for daily life. Sounds alert us to danger, they allow us to navigate to targets that cannot be seen, and they help us to know where we are in the environment. To use this information, the brain must both correctly identify sounds and integrate them with other sources of information to support ongoing cognitive functioning. The proposed work seeks to understand how the brain extracts meaning from sound and how the process is integrated with those used to extract meaning from other senses, primarily vision. The project also aims to provide advanced training to both graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in cutting-edge empirical, analytical, and modelling approaches. <br/><br/>In detail, the project aims to test an hypothesis about how meaning is extracted from sounds using fMRI. The auditory semantic alignment hypothesis proposes that a set of cortical areas accomplish this extraction through a dual-specialization for auditory processing and particular categories of sounds. These areas are proposed to extract particular types of information from certain categories of sound and pass that information onto a broader semantic network that is amodal, integrating over the senses. Evidence for a similar system has been observed in visual processing. If a homologous structure is observed for auditory processing, it would suggest a general mechanism for extracting meaning from external stimuli. The proposed work has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of how our cortical responses support our perception and adaptation to a dynamic natural world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While previous efforts to improve the water stability against electrolysis have focused on changes to the O?H bond strength, the team will pursue a new approach by considering the impact of changing the hydroxide and proton solvation energies. The team will use a combination of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study electrolytes of varying salt concentrations, cations and anions, and pH values to support their hypothesis that the electrochemical window of aqueous solutions can be expanded by discouraging their solvation of hydroxides and protons, the byproducts of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Their studies will elucidate key factors in chemical environment that dictate HER and OER onset potentials in aqueous electrolytes. Besides three graduate students who will directly perform the project tasks, the three PI?s labs will engage in outreach activities via online videos and in-person chemistry summer camps.<br/><br/>This collaborative research project by Ji and Fang Labs at Oregon State University and Greaney Lab at UC Riverside will systematically investigate how solvation environments in aqueous electrolytes affect water?s HER and OER as well as the electrolytes? resulting electrochemical stability window (ESW).

Driven by regulatory and customer pressure, the textile industry will require at least ~15,000 MT per year of rPET from 2025 onward, a potential $22.5B market. Most valuable is textile-derived rPET, in which clothing feedstock is made from clothing waste. Despite strong demand, this product is currently unavailable for purchase due to technical challenges. The proposed technology is a patent-pending, low-cost wash process that transforms mixed textile waste into purified feedstock at cost parity with virgin material. Along with the ability to remove elastane (a common barrier for textile recycling), the technology?s ultra-low cost provides a durable competitive advantage as a ?green? product that does not demand a ?green premium?. This proposal bridges a critical gap toward bringing this technology from bench-top to market via the development of downstream manufacturing processes and quality standards for textile-derived recycled materials. This project enables an initial market offering of 1 ton/month, providing a critical milestone toward construction 1-3 full commercial scale plants by 2030 and recycling 450,000 tons of waste textiles per year.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project enables production of textile-derived recycled polyester feedstock, a highly desired but unavailable material for textile manufacturing. Textile recycling is an immature industry limited by a lack of technical solutions for complex material challenges - circular textile recycling, in which textile waste is captured and transformed into re-usable feedstock, currently accounts for less than 1% of total mass flow of textiles. Among the most significant challenges is the ability to successfully transform complex mixtures of multiple fiber types into a single-component feedstock. Our novel process is a transformational technology for polyester recycling, capable of removing contaminants such as elastane, dyes, and other additives from mixed fiber polyester (PET) textile waste, resulting in pure, undyed polyester raw materials. This Phase II project enables the transformation of this intermediate material into market-ready feedstock by examining the critical material features that contribute quality metrics by which the market evaluates and selects feedstock products. The completion of this grant will represent a significant milestone toward our goal to divert over 150,000 tons of textile waste annually from landfills, facilitating a truly circular economy for synthetic textiles, and providing enhanced supply chain security with sustainable materials for apparel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to thrive in diverse environments is in part due to microbes? ability to convert diverse energy sources into cellular energy, often via multiple branched electron transport chains. Cytochromes c (cyt c) are a key component of most electron transport chains and much effort has been devoted to understanding the diverse roles of individual cyt c isoforms. Over one hundred different cyt c have been identified, yet all are made in the same way, a process called cyt c biogenesis. Despite the large number and diversity in function of cyt c, only three pathways exist to make it: System I (prokaryotes), System II (prokaryotes), and System III (eukaryotes). Understanding how these three pathways function is a fundamental biological question that is still not well understood. This project will obtain a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the bacterial System II cyt c biogenesis pathway through structure-function analysis. The team integrates undergraduate researchers into the project via direct participation in the research objectives. Additional educational opportunities from this project include classroom experiences to expand undergraduate knowledge, both of research and of STEM careers. These activities will increase STEM identity as a way to improve retention in STEM, leading to a more multitalented STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Cyt c biogenesis requires the covalent attachment of heme to a conserved motif on cyt c. This project focuses on the bacterial System II cyt c biogenesis pathway composed of two proteins, CcsB/A, proposed to be a bi-functional enzyme for transmembrane heme transport and attachment to cyt c. Comparison of System II proteins across bacteria has determined that CcsB/A?s have low sequence identity, can be encoded with different genetic arrangements and exhibit variability in protein size and predicted structure. Therefore, a comparative study of System II pathways will be undertaken to 1) determine if holocytochrome c synthase function is conserved despite protein variability and 2) elucidate the System II/cytochrome c interaction domain to determine specificity of heme attachment. Additionally, the distribution of bacterial cyt c pathways, System I and II, across bacteria will be determined bioinformatically to define the evolution of these pathways. These in-depth structure-function studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of System II, provide tools that can be expanded for the study of the other cytochrome c biogenesis pathways and lay the foundation for future studies to probe the regulation and impact of cyt c biogenesis in the context of bacterial metabolism and bioenergetics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program, the Division of Molecular and Cellular Bioscience, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Alaska-Aleutian arc, USA in particular poses high threats to a global aviation community due to its frequently active volcanoes (~2 eruptions and 6 unrest episodes per year) and its location beneath highly utilized North Pacific air routes. One avenue to strengthen the volcanology community?s ability to respond when unrest begins is to have a thorough understanding of the timescales of subsurface processes (e.g., magma movement) that have led to different size and styles of eruption (e.g., plume height). This progress can be accomplished through the integration of multiple datasets (petrology, gas geochemistry, seismology, geodesy) with near-real-time observations of volcanic unrest. Although significant advances have been made to understand the processes that fuel earthquakes and volcanic events in subduction zone centers over the past two decades, significant challenges remain with integrating different techniques for studying these systems (e.g., geophysics with petrology or gas emissions) as well as our ability to interpret the dense data streams collected during unrest events. To address these big picture needs, a three-day workshop will be held at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage, Alaska, to highlight specifically chosen datasets and questions that require attention by the broader volcanology community. <br/><br/>Part 2: Alaska is the most volcanically active region in the USA and one of the most active in the world. The high rate of volcanic activity, and along strike variations in subduction dynamics, provides an ideal laboratory to study the interplay between tectonic and volcanic processes. In May of 2025 a 3-day workshop will be hosted at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a consortium of the USGS, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and State of Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys, aimed at disseminating the current state of knowledge for potentially active volcanoes in Alaska and identifying compelling research directions. The high rates of volcanic activity in Alaska and the comprehensive data collected and archived by the Alaska Volcano Observatory make it the best place to study active volcanic processes at convergent-margin volcanoes in the United States. This is evidenced by several large-scale research efforts underway (PREEVENTS, AVERT) as well as proposed (CONVERSE, SZ4D) that see the benefit of studying the Alaska-Aleutian Arc. In addition, Alaska is home to other volcanoes, including recently restless Mount Edgecumbe and the massive and poorly understood Wrangell volcanic field. This as a crucial time for introducing interested scientists to the datasets and questions that are the highest priority for advancing the science pertaining to these active systems. By selecting datasets that answer crucial gaps in our knowledge, the community can tackle outstanding questions in this field and identify new mechanisms to advance our understanding of the drivers and timescales of processes within subduction zones that broadly fall into two fields: 1) improving our spatial reconstruction of the sub-surface systems that feed volcanic eruptions and 2) progress towards the interpretation and processing of datasets collected during volcanic unrest. Combining datasets allows for interdisciplinary, system-level questions to be asked and investigated, a crucial step to coordinating future efforts and resources, as well as centering science questions around solid, testable hypotheses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mineral dust deposited on snow and ice surfaces darkens the surface, causing it to absorb more energy from the sun and accelerate snow and ice melt. This process creates a cycle: exposed dusty surfaces release more dust into the atmosphere, increasing dust deposition and driving further melt. Currently, there are few observations of dust deposition on snow and glaciers in the Arctic. This project will investigate dust deposition on glaciers in Svalbard, one of the fastest-warming regions in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising five to seven times faster than the global average. By studying Svalbard, scientists hope to better understand what might happen in other parts of the Arctic and how these changes could contribute to rising sea levels that have global impacts. Two M.S. students and three undergraduate students will be trained at a regional comprehensive university. This project will advance STEM education, engage the public, and strengthen international research partnerships and knowledge exchange.<br/> <br/>The objectives of this research are: 1) Determine the spatial and temporal variability of dust deposition onto Svalbard glaciers, and factors driving dust deposition; 2) Discern the sources of dust; 3) Assess the contribution of dust and black carbon to snow and glacier melt processes; 4) Investigate recent trends in dust deposition, and 5) Apply findings to enhance understanding of dust-cryosphere feedbacks in the Arctic. Fieldwork will consist of collecting ice cores from six spatially distributed Svalbard glaciers to provide multi-year records of light absorbing particle deposition. Laboratory work will include mineral dust characterization and black carbon analyses. Remote sensing will be used to assess dust deposition across Svalbard snow and glaciers, and snow albedo and glacier melt modelling will be done to assess the relative contribution of dust and black carbon to albedo reductions and melt.

In addition, these modifications can prevent common chemical reactions that take place in unmodified peptides and nucleosides. Professor Barnes and his students will employ sophisticated simulation techniques that are analyzed using graph theory and ab initio calculations to study chemically diverse model systems where tandem mass spectrometry data is already available. A modernized simulation software package will be released to the community that can utilize artificial intelligence (AI) based potential energy surfaces. Their studies could result in reports of the first simulations of the CID of nucleosides and a user-friendly CID simulation software package made available to the community. Throughout this project, multiple high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be trained in computational chemistry and high-performance computing. They will have the opportunity to present their work at regional and national venues.<br/><br/>A combined computational and experimental approach is taken to elucidate reaction dynamics relevant to tandem mass spectrometry. Professor Barnes will select model systems that increase the chemical diversity of the systems studied through computational means and target the most commonly observed post-translational modifications seen in the dbPTM databank. Direct dynamics simulations provide an abundance of atomic-level information, allowing for the elucidation of the most relevant mechanistic steps involved in CID reactions. Advanced analysis techniques that rely on graph theory allow for chemical insight to be easily extracted from this data. Once relevant reaction pathways are identified through direct dynamics simulation, electronic structure calculations will be employed to provide reliable energetics. A comparison to experimental data will be made when possible. The data obtained will provide the community with information regarding preferred reaction mechanics in a broad range of CID systems. The importance of AI-based potential energy surfaces cannot be ignored. The software currently employed to perform direct dynamics simulations on CID systems cannot utilize such potential energy surfaces. Professor Barnes and his students will develop and release a CID software package incorporating user-specified potential energy surfaces, including AI-based surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It looks at whether the location of genes in a genome makes them more likely to help keep species separate. This is important because biologists can better predict how biodiversity is generated and preserved if the same parts of the genome are used in different speciation events. At the same time, this project combines research, education, and outreach to support biology education in the U.S., build student confidence in science, and contribute to the development of a skilled STEM workforce. It will train graduate and undergraduate students in research and mentorship, and the entire research team will visit middle school classrooms to improve public understanding of science and the natural world. Finally, this project will find useful traits in wild sunflowers, which could help make sunflower farming more sustainable and improve global food security. By pursuing these objectives, this project will also create a unique opportunity to integrate multiple levels of mentees into the research process. To achieve this, the project will include the development of a hands-on, inquiry-based module for first-year undergraduate students to explore assortative mating in sunflowers through genotyping offspring that will be incorporated into an existing course-based research experience (CURE). In addition, the research team will initiate a multifaceted operation that links existing research, professional development, and outreach experiences for small cohorts of undergraduate students. Briefly, this initiative will include recruiting students from the CURE class, transitioning them into a summer research program, pairing the students with graduate student mentees to continue their research, including the student-mentee pairs middle school outreach, and finally facilitating professional development opportunities.<br/><br/>This project explores the interaction of parallel evolution, structural variants (SVs), and the evolution of reproductive barriers using dune sunflowers as a model system to examine speciation. Previous work has shown that SVs facilitate parallel adaptation to sand dunes in sunflowers and that dune adaptation results in reproductive barriers, suggesting that SVs facilitate parallel speciation. To test this hypothesis, three primary research questions will be addressed: (1) How and why does assortative mating evolve between sunflower ecotypes? (2) Does parallel evolution lead to parallel speciation? (3) How broadly can SVs facilitate parallel evolution? These questions will be answered by phenotyping 200 individuals from 26 sunflower populations and species that span a range of environments from the dune core, to the dune edge, to non-dune populations. It will connect genotype to phenotype to fitness using GWAS, and measure components of reproductive isolation using crosses from populations with and among the same and different habitat types.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Patients with NF2 develop multiple brain tumors including vestibular schwannomas in both ears that damage the hearing nerves, and hearing aids and cochlear implants are rarely helpful. Although most ABI users can hear sounds that help with lipreading, only few can understand speech (unlike the majority of cochlear implant patients). The design of the ABI has not changed in 30 years and the electrode system is stiff and does not follow the curvature of the brain. In this NSF-SNSF research proposal and in collaboration with the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (Geneva, Switzerland), the researchers will develop an exciting new soft ABI technology that overcomes the problems of the clinical device in both mice and non-human primate. <br/><br/>The goals of this collaborative proposal will focus on advancing the technology for soft ABIs that will enable minimally invasive surgical insertion, accurate positioning over the cochlear nucleus (CN) and spatially selective modulation of central auditory pathways.  The U.S. researchers will deploy the soft ABI in rodent and nonhuman primate (NHP) models to gain complementary knowledge in electrical modulation of the CN and pursue the translation of the soft neurotechnology. Aim 1 of this project is to develop novel soft auditory brainstem implant (ABI) electrode arrays. The goal is to increase the conformability of the surface electrode array on the brainstem and miniaturize the electrodes to improve neuromodulation performance. Mechanically compliant soft ABI electrode arrays based on thin-film technology will be manufactured and systematically tested to determine the stability and integrity of the electrode implants, aiming for year-long function in vivo. Aim 2 of the project will test the soft ABI array for durability and performance in a chronic mouse model before the soft ABI is eventually used in valuable NHP models and in first studies in humans beyond the scope of this project. Performance of the mice will be assessed by behavioral tests to determine sensitivity to amplitude modulation (AM) of the electrical pulse train. This metric is chosen because, in human patients who use the ABI, it correlates best with speech comprehension. Aim 3 will test soft ABI arrays in nonhuman primate (NHP). The Boston and Swiss team will jointly implant 3 NHPs at the Swiss Non-Human Primates Competence Center for Research (SPCCR). The electrode array design will be tested and optimized, in biomimetic models prior to NHP surgery. Following chronic NHP implantation, the research team will perform assays of implant durability, record maps of activation by sound sequences on the CN and auditory cortex, and compare these activation maps to silence. Cortical maps activated by selective stimulation on the CN with the soft ABI will be collected and compared to auditory only stimulation. The introduction of soft, microfabricated ABIs has the potential to profoundly transform the landscape of neuroprosthetic interventions to enhance auditory perception. With their refined design, these advanced implants can achieve targeted stimulation of specific neural clusters within the cochlear nucleus, the target of the ABI. This precision can result in improved quality of perceived sound, increased speech intelligibility and reduced side effects. The resultant improvements will greatly elevate the overall quality of life among patients who have retrocochlear deafness.<br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To form a coherent perceptual experience, these distinct sensory signals need to be integrated even though they are received by distinct sensory systems. One possibility is that these signals are combined on the basis of spatial location. In most of our natural experience, the source of sensory signals that are related come from the same location, making it an ideal basis on which to integrate information to form a coherent perception of the world around us. The work proposed here aims to test whether spatial location serves this function for visual and auditory attention. The proposed work tests this mechanism in several tasks and for attention driven by the stimuli, internal control, and prior experience. The project also includes the development of an EEG methods boot camp and other outreach efforts that may aid in workforce development and increase public awareness of the research. <br/><br/>In detail, prior research demonstrating spatial selectively for both visual and auditory attention has often been taken as evidence for a ?supra-modal? spatial attention system that is tuned to operate similarly across the different senses. The current proposal aims to test key tenets of this spatial attention theory focusing on audiovisual interactions using a combination of psychophysics and EEG. First, it aims to examine the time course of spatial exogenous attention and assesses whether cross-modal attention follows similar temporal dynamics as unimodal attention.  Second, it aims to investigate the interactions between exogenous cross-modal attention and endogenous, sustained visual-spatial selection. Finally, the proposed works aims to quantify how selection history in one modality (e.g., audition) affects the spatial prioritization in another modality (e.g., vision) using incidental learning paradigms. The results of the proposed studies have the potential to bring forward a new understanding of how multimodal information is processed and integrated in the brain to support effective stimulus processing, advancing current models of attention and multisensory integration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scissors congruence originated in Hilbert's 3rd Problem, which asks when two polyhedra in three-dimensional space are ""scissors congruent,"" meaning one can be obtained from the other by cutting it into smaller polyhedra and reassembling in a different way.  This question, together with its solution by Dehn, initiated an extensive program of research. Over the past 120 years these ideas have grown and now connect to almost every branch of geometry. Ground-breaking recent work provides a fundamental link between this program and algebraic K-theory, which is itself a deep and rapidly developing area of research.  Algebraic K-theory intertwines three major fields of mathematics: topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. Developing the connection between scissors congruence and algebraic K-theory will significantly advance research in both.  This work also provides the platform for striking new research avenues that will bring to bear the tools and techniques of modern algebraic K-theory research on a wide range of geometric questions.  This project additionally includes a number of efforts to support students and new researchers in the field, expanding and broadening access to these innovative ideas.<br/><br/><br/>This broad new program of research develops the foundations of combinatorial, or ""cut-and-paste,"" algebraic K-theory, applies these new tools to resolve outstanding geometric questions, and expands the scope of combinatorial K-theory to new applications.  It brings modern techniques in algebraic K-theory to the emerging K-theoretic approach to cut-and-paste invariants, and applies this approach to a variety of problems in algebraic topology, differential topology, and algebraic geometry. Algebraic K-theory has seen a stunning revolution in the last thirty years due to the invention of trace methods, but these tools have not yet been developed for combinatorial K-theory, a deficiency that this project hopes to remedy. This requires developing the foundations of this new theory and exploiting connections to equivariant homotopy theory.  New computational and analytic tools for combinatorial K-theory will lead to progress on a wide variety of geometric problems, including applications to manifolds and invertible TQFTs, varieties and motivic measures, and fixed point theory.  Many questions in these fields have natural interpretations in terms of cut-and-paste invariants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On Earth, the flow of liquid is mostly controlled by gravity.  In the absence of gravity, capillary forces (surface tension) govern flow.  In space, water in a glass would not remain conformed to the shape of the glass. In space, water?s shape is driven by capillary forces, and would cover all sides of the glass and form a blob over all surfaces.  The absence of gravity also means the absence of buoyancy.  On Earth, a closed bottle of water with some air would have the air on top, but in space, the air bubbles could be anywhere inside the bottle and have any size. This project focuses on molten metallic alloys, which are a liquid useful for brazing and soldering in space for repair of damaged surfaces (due to impact of micrometeoroids and space debris), as well as for construction in space.  Such alloys melt and solidify gradually.  The goal is to control the concurrent melting and capillary flow of a molten alloy in microgravity and predict the resulting microstructure of the bond.  This project is ensuring durable bonding for repair and construction in space man-made habitats and impacting the ability to control other liquids in space and on Earth.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>It is observed that near-eutectic binary alloys, subject to concurrent melting and capillary/gravitational flow, are prone to flow-induced segregation whereupon it solidifies into two very different microstructures. The extent of segregation varies, apparently depending on the processing conditions as well as on the geometry of the capillary flow. This project consists of: (i) a series of experiments performed on the U.S. International Space Station with simultaneous ground-based experiments, and, since the melting/flow solidification process cannot be observed directly ?  (ii) a detailed mesoscale modelling program of the process (phase field computations). The objectives of the project are to: (i) understand the detailed physical mechanisms of segregation during capillary flow under both microgravity and terrestrial conditions. Focus is being afforded to the effects of gravity, temperature gradients, peak temperature, and interaction of diffusion-controlled melting and flow of the melt. This activity also allows for the formulation of the mathematical/computational theory needed to operationalize this understanding. (ii) apply this theory to the design of methodologies for brazing and soldering in both space and terrestrial materials bonding.The new theory and predictive models being produced in this work utilize a phase field formulation of the capillary flow under conditions of void formation and is being verified through the experiments capturing the differences in microstructure of the re-solidified melts obtained in microgravity and under terrestrial conditions. In addition to brazing metals, the results will be relevant for capillary phenomena involving low temperature soldering as well as processes related to bonding of ceramics and metals at high temperatures.  Furthermore, the findings of this project are leading to better understanding of capillary phenomena involved with multilayer metal deposition in advanced technologies such as additive manufacturing via selective laser melting. Educational broader impacts include the addition of new modules to the existing graduate courses at Washington State University and the University of Kentucky, research experience for undergraduate students, and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The chemicals produced could be a fuel like hydrogen, or they could be other desirable products with other commercial uses. Usually, the energy from sunlight is collected using photovoltaic solar cells made from silicon that generate electrical energy. These solar cells are typically seen on rooftops. However, these systems are not currently used to produce chemicals because it is not cost-effective. This project uses the same semiconductor material silicon to make millions of microscopic particles that each behave as a miniature solar cell. The project will design the particles to produce high voltages that make them capable of doing chemistry. Unlike a panel on a rooftop, these particles can simply be suspended in water to do the chemistry, providing a new method to perform photoelectrochemistry. The project will develop the fundamental principles to make the particles, stabilize them in water, and make them perform chemistry efficiently. It will involve undergraduate and graduate students who will gain experience in nanomaterials synthesis, microfabrication, electrochemistry, solid-state catalysis, optical measurements, and optoelectronic modeling. A broad set of outreach efforts will be pursued, including programs and demonstrations in elementary schools and local libraries and an annual public science exposition. <br/><br/>Multijunction Si nanowire photocatalysts blur the distinction between, on the one hand, a photovoltaic structure connected to an electrolyzer, and on the other, a semiconductor photoelectrode performing catalysis. The structures are created by a bottom-up vapor-liquid-solid growth process that permits the synthesis of a precise multijunction structure containing both p-i-n solar cells and n-p tunnel junctions in a high aspect ratio particulate form factor hundreds of nanometers in diameters and microns in length. They offer unique advantages for particle suspension reactors, including (1) usage of earth-abundant and non-toxic Si, (2) broadband light absorption into the near infrared, (3) photovoltage tunable for specific reaction chemistry by number of p-i-n junctions, and (4) spatial separation of anodic and cathodic reactions due to the high aspect ratio and axial orientation of the photovoltaic structure. Because the nanostructures uniquely contain both photovoltaic and photoelectrode elements, numerous fundamental scientific questions arise about the single-particle properties, ensemble interactions, and co-catalyst functionality. Thus, the overarching goals of this project are to understand (1) the chemical effects of liquid solution on individual nanowire photovoltaic and photocatalyst properties, (2) the electrochemical and photonic interactions of nanowires in suspension, and (3) co-catalyst design principles that enable well-controlled and efficient photoelectrochemical reactions. The project combines measurements on single nanowires and ensembles of nanowires in suspension with simulation and modeling efforts to predict and interpret their properties. The project will provide fundamental insights into the operation of particle suspension reactors that are applicable not just to Si nanowires but also to a range of photocatalyst material systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires observed in Southern California can attack buildings by two means: (1) flames impinging on surfaces, and (2) embers (also called ?firebrands?) being carried by the wind and raining down on buildings.

After separating from the coast of Japan, the Kuroshio becomes the Kuroshio Extension (KE), an eastward-flowing jet, that then carries these waters in the direction of the US. While flowing northward and eastward, respectively, the Kuroshio and the KE exchange heat with the atmosphere which influences weather patterns and long-term weather fluctuations in the region, but also over the North American continent. This project seeks to investigate recent changes in the Kuroshio/KE path that have been occurring since 2018 and that are referred to as a ?regime shift?. The newly detected path involves a large Kuroshio meander south of Japan and a KE system consisting of a highly stable jet that flows eastward without creating many additional meanders or pinched-off eddies. The goal is to explore, with available data and models, what caused the regime shift and what the regime shift means for North Pacific oceanic and atmospheric conditions, with implications for North American weather patterns. This project will provide training for one graduate student who will learn about ocean-atmosphere interaction in the Kuroshio/KE system and other extratropical regions. <br/><br/>The emergence of a new dynamic Kuroshio/KE regime has added new complexity to the understanding of the variability in the North Pacific coupled ocean-atmosphere system. It is hypothesized that the new, on-going dynamic regime is a result of combined external wind forcing, of nonlinear interaction between the Kuroshio large meander and stabilized KE jet, and of coupled feedback by KE?s thermal forcing to the overlying atmosphere. By conducting analyses of available satellite/in-situ data, ocean/atmosphere reanalysis products, and high-resolution coupled model output, the plan is to (1) elucidate the oceanic and atmospheric processes responsible for generating and sustaining the on-going Kuroshio/KE dynamic regime, (2) explore and contrast the basin-scale atmospheric responses to the Kuroshio/KE dynamic regime changes, and (3) quantify the impacts by the new Kuroshio/KE dynamic regime on changing upper ocean heat content and water mass properties in the northwestern Pacific basin. Since many of the scientific questions addressed in this proposal apply to other western boundary current systems, an improved understanding of the KE variability could serve as a useful step in elucidating ocean's role in extratropical ocean-atmosphere interactions in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Single-celled microbial eukaryotes (e.g. protists) remain underexplored in geothermal springs despite evidence that they can be diverse and abundant in these extreme habitats. This research project will document the biodiversity of microbial eukaryotes across geographically and geochemically diverse spring systems and describe new species of microbial eukaryotes. Findings from this research will enable more accurate estimates of species diversity and expand our understanding of the diversity of eukaryotes. Broad interest in geothermal systems will also be leveraged to increase participation by undergraduate researchers, train the next generation of protistologists, and broaden public understanding of the microbial eukaryotes.<br/><br/>The biodiversity of microbial eukaryotes in geothermal springs remains poorly understood as most lineages are only known from environmental sequencing. Single-cell technologies and new culturing approaches coupled with bioinformatics pipelines enables description of the diversity of protists in these extreme environments. This research focuses on two major clades of eukaryotes ?Amoebozoa and Heterolobosea ? that collectively represent a substantial portion of amoeba diversity and can be abundant in high temperature and low pH environments. Combining single-cell profiling, culturing, and microscopy-based analyses, this project will infer species boundaries, describe new species, and improve reconstructions of the tree of life. Gene families will be analyzed to shed light on putative adaptations that allow survival in extreme environments. Integration of project data will be coordinated with public biodiversity databases and strain collections to enhance access to microbial resources. A summer training workshop will aid in training early career protistologists in the characterization of unknown protist lineages, with modules focused on biodiversity, species discovery, and systematics.

The length of telomeric DNA in different animals and plants varies substantially, but the significance of this variation for organismal integrity is not fully understood. This study will analyze the importance of having long or short telomeres for plants grown in good or stressful environmental conditions. Specifically, it will evaluate the number of seeds produced and the timing of flowering initiation as a measure of plant adaptation to stress. The project will also help extend hands-on research options for undergraduate students. It will also provide many opportunities for STEM-themed outreach activities to increase scientific literacy and to advance career preparation for the next generations of biology students.<br/><br/>Telomeres are evolutionarily conserved protein-DNA complexes that cap linear eukaryotic chromosomes and ensure proper genome maintenance and stability. In humans, the length of telomeric DNA is often viewed as one of the most accurate cellular markers of biological age. However, in plants and many other organisms the significance of telomere length changes over organismal lifespan or in response to environmental stressors is largely unclear. Recent findings in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that natural variation in telomere length influences reproductive fitness and the timing of floral transition. Nevertheless, the exact molecular and genetic mechanisms linking telomere length with plant developmental traits are unknown. Through several transcriptome and candidate gene analysis projects this study will elucidate the functional crosstalk between telomere length regulation and flowering time control. It will also characterize the effects of telomere length variation on plant fitness and decipher molecular mechanisms acting on extreme telomere length phenotypes. Finally, the project will aid in developing career-shaping research and educational experiences for undergraduate students.

The novel interface integrates robot sensor readings and high-speed predictive simulations of hydrodynamic forces to create an immersive mixed reality (MR) display. In addition to augmented video images of the robot's surroundings, the interface converts measurements of water flow rates, hydrostatic pressure, ambient temperature, and other variables into tactile sensations for the operator. Likewise, the interface will render natural movements of the operator's body into control commands to the robot. The goal is human-robot ""sensory transfer,"" that is, seamless translation of perceptions and actions between the operator and the robot. The goal of this project is to develop and match the capabilities of the interface to industry and worker needs. One anticipated benefit is to reduce the extensive training currently required for operators, thereby increasing access to these jobs while reducing industry training expenses and downtime due to personnel shortages. The project will study the most effective way to improve worker performance, safety, and quality of life, and by requiring a diverse set of subjects, will show how such human-robot interfaces can expand economic opportunity to broad sections of society. The interface can also be used in a purely virtual mode as a training tool. The project will examine the use of this capability to recruit workers from adjacent fields, such as construction. Offshore applications that would directly benefit from this project include subsea infrastructure inspection, geological surveys, marine habitat monitoring, pollution assessments, ship-hull inspections, unexploded ordnance surveys, contraband detection, aquaculture monitoring, search and rescue, and archaeological exploration and surveys. An increase in extreme weather and rising sea levels will place increasing demands on offshore operations to protect and repair coastal damage.

Novel human-robot sensory transfer methods are suggested for reliability against conditions unique to subsea. These methods will support fast and accurate reconstruction of subsea workplaces. MR will be used to generate human-perceivable simulation of remote subsea workplaces in real time based on feedback from a novel robotic sensing and data transmission system.

Developing these systems requires engineers to correctly understand and represent the ""problem space"", that is, the fundamental questions about what the system should do and how it should interact with its environment. If these early problem formulations are incomplete or inconsistent, costly design errors can arise down the road, affecting reliability, safety, and mission success. By ensuring that needs, requirements, and system functions are represented in a mathematically sound, complete, and consistent manner, this research intends to reduce costly rework, enhance system safety, and improve performance. This effort intends to enable national leadership in cutting-edge engineering, promote scientific progress, and advance societal welfare by ensuring that future large-scale systems are designed with mathematical rigor from the earliest stages. The educational component of the project is focused on transforming the way students learn about and approach engineering problem formulation, equipping the next generation of engineers with advanced formal reasoning skills.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this CAREER project is on developing theoretical foundations for representing and reasoning about engineering problem spaces through the integration of Modal Preference Logic, Systems Theory, and Set Theory.

Automated reasoning tools will be developed to support practical application. The methodology will be validated through formal mathematical proofs and real-world case studies of space systems at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshal Space Flight Center?s Advanced Concepts Office. Scientific contributions include a unified logical framework for representing diverse problem space elements, formal criteria for assessing problem formulation quality, and theoretical foundations for verification and validation integrated directly into the problem formulation process. The framework will be implemented through an ontology that enables automated reasoning about complex system specifications while maintaining mathematical rigor. The educational component of this project integrates these formal methods into the engineering curriculum through advanced undergraduate and graduate courses, ensuring that students gain hands-on experience with rigorous logic, problem formulation, and automated reasoning.

While much is known about wildfire smoke, a significant knowledge gap remains about how far toxic chemicals spread from the active burn areas. To find out, Dr. Spada and his community partners set up an air monitoring network at locations across the Los Angeles area, downwind of the largest fires. These monitors continuously collected smoke, dust, and ash while the fires were still active and throughout cleanup activities. For millions of Los Angeles residents, these measurements will provide answers about how much toxic chemicals were released, how far they traveled, and when is safe to return to burned areas. Insights gained from this project will help bridge our knowledge gaps and allow us to be better prepared for the future.<br/><br/>This RAPID grant will support field research to collect, archive, and characterize samples during and immediately after the Los Angeles (LA) fires that started on January 7th, 2025. The aim of the project is to quantify the concentration and determine the speciation of toxic elements in airborne particulate matter (PM) collected during and following the fires. Specific objectives are: 1) To collect and archive PM during and following the fires; 2) To quantify the concentrations of elements in all samples; 3) To disseminate validated findings appropriately in order for public health and government agencies to provide accurate recommendations for residents returning to their homes; and 4) To share collected materials with scientific collaborators to maximize the learning potential from this unique scenario. Ambient PM was collected using cascading impactors with rotating stages at four locations distributed across the LA area. Samples will be analyzed initially at Crocker Nuclear Lab?s 76-inch isochronous cyclotron using Proton-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE), Proton Elastic Scattering Analysis (PESA), and Rutherford Backscattering Analysis (RBA). These combined measurements provide quantitative results for non-volatile H, C, and O alongside Na ? Br and Pb. To the team's knowledge, this will be the first dataset of its kind. Subsequent measurements will include Synchrotron-induced X-ray Fluorescence (SXRF) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource to measure higher atomic weight elements such as cadmium, cesium, and rare earth elements. Supporting measurements will include mass concentrations via soft-beta ray attenuation and broadband optical spectroscopy, which will enable factorization and source apportionment analyses by future collaborators. The sampling campaign captures PM during the fire, immediately after the fires were put out, while the burn areas were still smoldering, and during cleanup activities that may resuspend toxic substances. These results will provide information on the exposures to first and second responders and to residents downwind of the fire areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reinforcement learning, a data-driven control method that enables agents to autonomously learn desired tasks by interacting directly with the environment, has emerged as one of the predominant frameworks for this kind of real-time decision making. While reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework, it suffers fundamental challenges in its scalability and resilience. Specifically, existing methods require a vast amount of data and computational power and can be unstable in the presence of various types of errors and adversaries. These challenges are the main barriers to the wide applicability of reinforcement learning for real-world problems. This CAREER project will develop new foundations of scalable and resilient distributed reinforcement learning for real-time autonomous cooperation in open multi-agent systems. The overarching goal is to design new learning and control methods that enable agents to interact effectively in open systems, adapt gracefully in time-varying environments, and be resilient to unexpected failures and adversaries. The project will also contribute to education and workforce development by integrating the research findings with rigorous educational and outreach activities, course development, student training, and public partnerships.<br/><br/>The central idea of this project is to establish new fundamentals of two-time-scale stochastic approximation for non-monotone systems.

On Earth, the flow of liquid is mostly controlled by gravity.  In the absence of gravity, capillary forces (surface tension) govern flow.  In space, water in a glass would not remain conformed to the shape of the glass. In space, water?s shape is driven by capillary forces, and would cover all sides of the glass and form a blob over all surfaces.  The absence of gravity also means the absence of buoyancy.  On Earth, a closed bottle of water with some air would have the air on top, but in space, the air bubbles could be anywhere inside the bottle and have any size. This project focuses on molten metallic alloys, which are a liquid useful for brazing and soldering in space for repair of damaged surfaces (due to impact of micrometeoroids and space debris), as well as for construction in space.  Such alloys melt and solidify gradually.  The goal is to control the concurrent melting and capillary flow of a molten alloy in microgravity and predict the resulting microstructure of the bond.  This project is ensuring durable bonding for repair and construction in space man-made habitats and impacting the ability to control other liquids in space and on Earth.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>It is observed that near-eutectic binary alloys, subject to concurrent melting and capillary/gravitational flow, are prone to flow-induced segregation whereupon it solidifies into two very different microstructures. The extent of segregation varies, apparently depending on the processing conditions as well as on the geometry of the capillary flow. This project consists of: (i) a series of experiments performed on the U.S. International Space Station with simultaneous ground-based experiments, and, since the melting/flow solidification process cannot be observed directly ?  (ii) a detailed mesoscale modelling program of the process (phase field computations). The objectives of the project are to: (i) understand the detailed physical mechanisms of segregation during capillary flow under both microgravity and terrestrial conditions. Focus is being afforded to the effects of gravity, temperature gradients, peak temperature, and interaction of diffusion-controlled melting and flow of the melt. This activity also allows for the formulation of the mathematical/computational theory needed to operationalize this understanding. (ii) apply this theory to the design of methodologies for brazing and soldering in both space and terrestrial materials bonding.The new theory and predictive models being produced in this work utilize a phase field formulation of the capillary flow under conditions of void formation and is being verified through the experiments capturing the differences in microstructure of the re-solidified melts obtained in microgravity and under terrestrial conditions. In addition to brazing metals, the results will be relevant for capillary phenomena involving low temperature soldering as well as processes related to bonding of ceramics and metals at high temperatures.  Furthermore, the findings of this project are leading to better understanding of capillary phenomena involved with multilayer metal deposition in advanced technologies such as additive manufacturing via selective laser melting. Educational broader impacts include the addition of new modules to the existing graduate courses at Washington State University and the University of Kentucky, research experience for undergraduate students, and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simply put, optimal transport is the minimum-cost plan to transport mass from one distribution to the other, where the cost of transporting one unit of mass between two locations is the ground distance between the two locations. OT has been studied   extensively in mathematics, engineering, physics, economics, operations research, and computer science because of their numerous applications. Despite extensive work, computing OT plans has remained a computationally challenging problem, and  there is a large gap between the theory and practice of OT algorithms. The need for fast OT algorithms is becoming even more urgent with the proliferation of machine learning and algorithmic decision making in all disciplines. The scarcity of scalable algorithms that compute high quality transport plans  has limited the applicability OT to many applications.<br/> <br/>The main goal of this project is to advance the theoretical underpinnings of OT and to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of OT algorithms. By exploiting combinatorial, geometric and statistical properties of OT, leveraging new approaches for min-cost flow, and exploiting approximation and probabilistic techniques, simple and scalable algorithms will be developed for computing high quality OT plans of both discrete and continuous distributions whose supports are compact regions in Euclidean space. The emphasis will be on designing combinatorial algorithms that not only have good worst-case running time  but that have better expected running time on stochastic or semi-stochastic inputs.  The project will also explore techniques to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, which arises in the OT of high-dimensional distributions. Building on these OT algorithms, new algorithms will be developed for data analysis (e.g. clustering, training neural networks) on a family of distributions in Wasserstein space, i.e., using OT as the distance between a pair of distributions; for quality assessment of algorithms that return a probability distribution (e.g., flood-risk-analysis algorithms that return a distribution of water over a region).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant part of this is how teachers notice, or focus on, analyze, and decide how to respond to, mathematics thinking. One common professional development method is to use videos of mathematics teaching to help teachers understand what is possible for students' learning. However, professional development facilitators need to develop skills and practices to support teacher learning using classroom video. This exploratory project aims to understand how facilitators of video-based teacher professional development learn to help mathematics teachers of middle and high school students notice student mathematical thinking. The work uses an online context because it provides more opportunities for facilitators who might be limited by location or resources to participate.<br/><br/>The project consists of two strands of work. The first strand is focused on the design and enactment of an online video-based professional development for video club facilitators of mathematics teachers. The second investigates facilitator learning and ways to support it. The project will iteratively design resources for facilitator educators that can guide and support the future development and enactment of learning experiences for facilitators of video clubs and video-based professional development, something that is currently missing in the field. The research questions are: (1) How can an online, video-based professional development support facilitators in learning to lead teachers in a video club? (2) In a facilitator professional development, how do facilitators learn to support teachers? noticing? An important part of the facilitator professional development design includes helping facilitators learn to use teacher video annotations as a window into teacher thinking during video clubs.  The project will use a design-based research framework to qualitatively analyze facilitators' tagging of videos, recorded professional development sessions, interviews, and other artifacts of the facilitators' work. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) is an applied research program that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers.

Previous work in geothermal environments has led to the discovery of major groups of bacteria and archaea that have unique adaptations to cope with harsh environmental conditions. Single-celled microbial eukaryotes (e.g. protists) remain underexplored in geothermal springs despite evidence that they can be diverse and abundant in these extreme habitats. This research project will document the biodiversity of microbial eukaryotes across geographically and geochemically diverse spring systems and describe new species of microbial eukaryotes. Findings from this research will enable more accurate estimates of species diversity and expand our understanding of the diversity of eukaryotes. Broad interest in geothermal systems will also be leveraged to increase participation by undergraduate researchers, train the next generation of protistologists, and broaden public understanding of the microbial eukaryotes.<br/><br/>The biodiversity of microbial eukaryotes in geothermal springs remains poorly understood as most lineages are only known from environmental sequencing. Single-cell technologies and new culturing approaches coupled with bioinformatics pipelines enables description of the diversity of protists in these extreme environments. This research focuses on two major clades of eukaryotes ?Amoebozoa and Heterolobosea ? that collectively represent a substantial portion of amoeba diversity and can be abundant in high temperature and low pH environments. Combining single-cell profiling, culturing, and microscopy-based analyses, this project will infer species boundaries, describe new species, and improve reconstructions of the tree of life. Gene families will be analyzed to shed light on putative adaptations that allow survival in extreme environments. Integration of project data will be coordinated with public biodiversity databases and strain collections to enhance access to microbial resources. A summer training workshop will aid in training early career protistologists in the characterization of unknown protist lineages, with modules focused on biodiversity, species discovery, and systematics. A microbial diversity workshop for high school science teachers will provide a foundation on the tree of life and the phylogenetic diversity of eukaryotes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Human visual processing can be broadly categorized into two types: intuitive processing, which enables rapid, experience-driven decision-making, and deliberate processing, which involves focused and systematic reasoning for complex tasks. Robust visual intelligence, the ability to integrate these types of processing, is fundamental to real-world problem solving and developing common-sense understanding. However, current artificial intelligence (AI) systems lack this level of robustness, as they often rely heavily on language models to compensate for deficiencies in visual architecture. This reliance becomes a critical bottleneck as tasks and scenarios grow more complex, limiting the adaptability and reliability of AI systems in practical applications. The project aims to build a hybrid, vision-centric framework that integrates intuitive and deliberate visual processing to create more robust visual intelligence. This improved capability has the potential to empower research in many other fields. For example, robotics researchers could use the system to help robots see, move and act more intelligently in challenging environments. Similarly, scientists and educators could use it to better understand complex diagrams, making it easier to uncover new insights and improve learning.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop a hybrid approach that combines parametric (intuitive) and non-parametric (deliberate) visual processing methods to build robust visual intelligence. The first direction focuses on developing new ways to learn visual representations using techniques like visual self-supervised learning, language guidance, and generative modeling. And the goal for this direction is to advance vision-centric parametric knowledge to form the foundational layer of intuitive understanding. Building on this, the second direction incorporates human-like non-parametric mechanisms, such as visual search and working memory, to enhance deliberate reasoning capabilities. The third direction integrates these two approaches into a unified, hybrid architecture, where a high-level controller is capable of activating either method as needed for task-specific demands. Finally, the system will be tested in real-world, dynamic environments that extend beyond static image datasets, including tasks requiring long-form video analysis and visual-spatial reasoning. By applying the framework to these new challenges, the project aims to produce more adaptable, reliable, and broadly useful methods that expand the possibilities of vision-based applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This foundation allows for the exploration of the catalytic properties of the ?29? oxide structure, a unique copper oxide film that can be stably grown on a Cu(111) crystal, enabling the development of systems that leverage this structure. This oxide acts as an ideal support for atomically dispersed precious metals, making it highly effective for catalysis. To design and evaluate the performance of atomically dispersed Pt and Rh atoms on the ""29"" oxide Cu support, the computational work will be conducted in collaboration with experimental partners. The structure and redox properties of the ""29"" oxide surface on Cu(111) will also be examined by focusing on dynamic changes (fluxionality) as it is reduced to the ""44"" oxide structure under reaction conditions. The ""29"" and ""44"" refer to the unit cell size of each oxide structure. A key goal of the study is to reconcile previous models of the ""29"" and ""44"" oxide surfaces with recent non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) images, which show two distinct stoichiometric arrangements for these structures, as reported in a recent publication (Zhu et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 146 (2024), 15887?15896).

This research studies flooding-caused pollution in west Florida coastal waters after two major hurricanes. The project will understand how land bacteria transfer antibiotic resistant genes to coastal bacteria during flooding. The team will analyze water samples collected after the hurricanes using microbiological, chemical and molecular methods. The outcomes of this study will enhance our understanding of how marine pathogens, like vibrios, acquire toxic traits and pose threats to public health. The results will provide valuable data in guiding emergency responses in the face of future storms.<br/><br/>The recent back-to-back hurricanes in Florida, Helene and Milton, caused extensive flooding that released untreated wastewater carrying antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) from freshwater environments into coastal waters. The spread of ARGs into marine ecosystems poses a significant public health threat, as it can lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistant marine bacteria, including species such as Vibrio vulnificus, a pathogen associated with severe and sometimes fatal infections. This project will investigate how storm-driven flooding facilitates the horizontal transfer of ARGs between freshwater and marine bacteria, contributing to the long-term persistence of ARGs in coastal ecosystems. Key objectives include identifying antibiotic resistant freshwater bacteria entering coastal waters, examining the horizontal transfer of ARGs within biofilms in coastal waters, and assessing the persistence of ARGs in marine bacteria over time. Samples collected after the hurricanes will be analyzed using long-read metagenomics, single-colony sequencing, and microbial community analysis to track bacterial origins and resolve ARG profiles, as well as stable isotope analysis to differentiate freshwater and marine bacterial populations. This study will highlight how hurricanes amplify the risks of ARGs entering marine ecosystems and conferring antibiotic resistance to pathogens.

Restoring arm and hand function would greatly increase their independence.  Assistive robotics and functional electrical stimulation can potentially restore arm and hand function, but each has significant drawbacks. The objective of this project is to develop a cooperative control strategy for functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high cervical spinal cord injuries using functional electrical stimulation and a robotic exoskeleton. The results of the project will help move functional electrical stimulation and upper limb robotics from laboratory assistive technologies to wearable devices used for everyday tasks by people with full-arm paralysis.      <br/><br/>The complementary strengths of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and assistive robotics can potentially enable people with high tetraplegia to independently feed and groom themselves. FES provides free power using a person?s own muscles but cannot sufficiently control all joints simultaneously due to permanent denervation of some muscles. Assistive robots can provide additional power and control, but can be rigid, bulky, and heavy. This project's objective is to develop a cooperative control strategy that demonstrates functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high tetraplegia using a hybrid FES+rigid support robot. By maximizing the utility of muscles activated by FES, the proposed hybrid strategy will reduce the need for robot power and size, paving the way for using FES with soft wearable robotics. This project will use a rigid robot as the testbed for developing cooperative control strategies, allowing for exploration of the entire design space for future development of soft wearable exosuits coupled with FES. FES+robot assisted muscle-induced torques will be measured in real time during elbow and wrist movements. This information will feed into a coordinated FES+robot control scheme that aims to decrease robot work while maintaining tracking accuracy. Performance and robustness of the control scheme will be benchmarked for varying robot capabilities during a self-feeding task. The outcome will be a model, mapping robot capabilities to task completion success, to be used to design future wearable hybrid FES-robotic systems for upper limb movement restoration. These advances will open up new research horizons in commanding and controlling hybrid neuroprostheses that could not otherwise be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Instead, van der Waals semiconductors (vdW-S) with atomic thickness become the leading candidates to further boost the trajectory of Moore?s law. After the successful synthesis of wafer-scale raw materials, the next milestone on this roadmap is the implementation of vdW-S integrated circuits with smaller sizes, higher density, faster speed, and lower energy consumption. However, established methods for bulk material integration, such as silicon, lead to performance degradation, high heat generation, and many other issues in vdW-S. Therefore, new fundamental principles and practical methods are in urgent need, and this project is designed to fill this gap. Considering the ultra-thinness of these emerging materials, their electronic properties are typically decided by the surface and interfacial conditions. With this entry point, the project makes efforts to explore surface/interface tailoring methods and study the corresponding electronic effects for the purpose of vdW-S integration in both planar and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. As a case study, a novel 3D active pixel image sensor (3D-APS) built upon the as-developed principles can provide better color-sensing accuracy, miniature device size, and higher sensitivity than conventional counterparts. As such, it showcases the transformative impacts of this project on a broader scope of applications, such as medical imaging, machine vision, and environmental survey. Along with the research, this project emphasizes the educational responsibility, especially for the underrepresented minority groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, leveraging the advanced status of Georgia State University (GSU) as a minority-serving institute. Graduate and undergraduate students, particularly minority students, receive systematic training in modern material science, electrical engineering, semiconductor process and characterization technologies, instrumentation design and manufacturing, and many more skills. In this process, they build their capabilities and career trajectories as next-generation workforces. The team shares the research experience and achievements via seminars, conferences, and publications, to bring nationwide impacts of this project. Regular open houses, K-12 school visits, and popular science activities are arranged to broadcast the latest research progress to our community, raising public awareness of modern science and technology. <br/><br/>The very large-scale integration (VLSI) of vdW-S devices is the next essential topic for their practical applications in computing, communication, medication, and other fields. But the long-standing challenges in selected area doping, contact resistance management, material stability, and characterization methods block the pathway toward these goals. In this regard, this project is arranged to systematically and profoundly investigate the solutions to these problems, and substantially promote the planar and 3D integration of these emerging semiconductor materials. The primary research activities include the following aspects. (i) The project insightfully comprehends the charge doping effects and stability of a surface modification reaction introduced by the PI, in order to facilitate a gentle, precisely controllable, and non-destructive selected area doping approach for planar vdW-S integration. (ii) Conventional metal-to-vdW-S inter-tier contacts are replaced by newly developed direct vdW-S-to-vdW-S (v-v) contacts with conditioned interfaces, which provide a scalable and low-resistance solution for inter-tier connections in 3D integrations. (iii) The research activities leverage the home-built in-situ and non-invasive electrical and optical characterization systems to examine the devices? stability and performance with convinced accuracy and precision. Beyond that, the 3D-APS delivered by this project can exhibit rich system-level physical and electronic behaviors that otherwise are intangible from single device-level studies, and in turn, deepen the understanding of the synergistic cooperation mechanism in complex vdW-S frameworks. The prototype devices also inspire succeeding innovations of high-performance microelectronics, as core functional units in future VLSI with smaller sizes, higher integration density, faster speed, and lower energy consumption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrochemical approaches open the door to the use of electrical energy derived from sustainable sources such as wind and solar energy.  Although significant advances have been made in electrochemical reactions promoted by catalysts (i.e., electrocatalysis), many challenges remain.  Experimental studies alone often cannot unravel the complex chemical and physical processes underlying electrocatalytic reactions.  The present project addresses this ?complexity challenge? by adding theoretical and mathematics-based analysis of electrocatalytic reactions of importance to fuel cell technology and sustainable manufacturing of chemicals.<br/>  <br/>Until recently, atomistic simulation methods, primarily rooted in density functional theory (DFT), have been used to provide insights regarding catalysis at the electrochemical interface.  However, the complexity of chemistry, physics and transport mechanisms at the interface limits the models to small scales and special atomic configurations, which are often not realistic enough to accurately describe the interfacial processes.  With regard to catalysis, DFT based models alone are challenged in providing information about reaction activation energies, thus preventing direct assessment of reaction rates.  The project addresses these limitations by developing an accurate and efficient method to enable large-scale simulations for heterogeneous electrocatalysis.  Machine learning force field (ML FF) is a promising approach to realize such simulations.  The project will further enhance MLFF capability by adding features that describe the behavior of electrons under the grand canonical ensemble (GCE) in the catalyst.  The expanded ML FF model (called ?e-GCE-FF?) will be enabled by leveraging 'global state' features of graph neural networks developed previously by the research team.  The integrated e-GCE-FF approach will be used to study pH and cation effects in heterogeneous electrocatalysis.  Specifically, the project will address two long-standing questions: 1) why oxygen reduction on Au (100) proceeds through a two-electron pathway under acidic conditions, while changing to a four-electron pathway under alkaline conditions; and 2) why larger electrolyte cations promote the hydrogen evolution on Au while suppressing it on Pt?  More broadly, the  expanded MLFF code will be made open-source, and can be extended to other electrochemical systems (e.g. battery, corrosion).  From the educational and outreach perspectives, the project will provide an excellent training opportunity for students interested in computational chemistry and data science. The research results will be integrated into the course curriculum, and the project leader will actively engage the general public through the university?s outreach programs such as ?Explore UT?.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a critical step in machine learning systems, representation learning is meant to be robust in its capacity, regardless of the mutation of raw data due to noises or the variations of raw data caused by capture devices. In the era of big data, representation learning techniques are confronted with new challenges. Massive data collected from different sensors (e.g., the multi-view camera system) or presented in different modalities (e.g., audio-visual-text) have overloaded existing representation learning techniques. In addition, streaming data received from the Internet and sensitive data accumulated over time, such as personal albums and electronic health records, require the established representation learning model to adapt and account for incoming data. This project will develop a robust continual representation learning model to address these challenges. In real-world scenarios where data access is restricted (e.g., sensitive data) or the processing power of devices is limited (e.g., edge and mobile devices), stakeholders will benefit from the adaptive representation learning techniques to enable continual data analyses.<br/><br/>This project seeks to advance the fundamental understanding of continual multi-view robust representation learning by integrating machine intelligence and human knowledge in AI-enabled security contexts. There are three unique contributions. First, the project will investigate multi-view consistency pursuit to fuse knowledge and generate a view-invariant representation robust to domain shifts frequently encountered in real-world data. Second, this research will revisit and explore adversarial learning in multi-view contexts to enable new attack modes, including iterative, cross-view, and induced modes. Generated adversarial samples and training procedures will benefit and empower the acquired multi-view representation learning models to mitigate various forms of artificial noise. Third, new continual learning models will be created through a novel Memory Bounded Search Tree to enable the evolution of multi-view representation learning despite continual streams of data. Furthermore, to reduce the search space and uncertainty related to the data, this research will leverage human knowledge to acquire critical annotations and empirical strategies for the proposed continual learning models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although spot fires contribute to rapid wildfire growth and are known to be responsible for significant damages incurred at the Wildland Urban Interface incidents, the current understanding of the heat (energy) transfer mechanisms from firebrands to the exposed surfaces is incomplete. The primary aim of this project is to establish a fundamental knowledge of the heat (energy) transfer from firebrand depositions to the recipient surfaces. The outcomes of this project directly inform wildfire simulators by enabling a physics-based spot fire ignition module leading to more accurate forecasts and estimation of wildfire risk. The project will also encompass educational activities such as mentoring and training undergraduate and graduate students, engagement with stakeholders and practitioners, and creating collaborations between different engineering/scientific disciplines to address challenges in fire science.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to quantify the heat transfer from the accumulated firebrands to the recipient surface using a systematic, scalable, and accurate quantitative approach. Specifically, the project performs the following tasks: First, conducting numerical simulations using a four-way coupled method to identify the effects of firebrand properties and their interactions within the boundary layer on the deposition patterns over an inert flat surface. Second, incorporating surface fuel morphology into the computational domain, using X-Ray Computed Tomography (XCT), and quantitatively discern its influence on firebrand deposition patterns and heat transfer. Third, leveraging the generated data from high-fidelity simulations, developing a data-driven heat transfer model, and testing its accuracy. The developed model makes the findings applicable for large-scale (operational) wildfire simulators, culminating in the development of a physics-based spot fire ignition module. The results are expected to provide insights into dominant heat transfer mechanisms involved in the spot fire ignition process and establish a computational framework for quantifying the energy transfer from reacting particles to the surrounding walls.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these variations or mutations are not evenly dispersed throughout the genome. Variation is highest where regulatory proteins bind to DNA, a process that is poorly understood despite the fact that these changes can significantly impact human biology. This project will determine whether genomic variation is increased because protein binding makes DNA more susceptible to damage, and subsequently mutations, or because proteins block repair of damaged DNA leading to mutations. Assessing these possibilities requires development of innovative methods. This project will not only answer the question of whether proteins make DNA more susceptible to damage or harder to repair, but the newly developed methods will be a major leap forward in quantitative measurement of DNA damage. To ensure the broader impact of the newly developed methods, investigators will reach out to the next generations of scientists in two ways. A workshop entitled ?What is Damaging My DNA? will be offered to high school students to engage the younger generation. In addition, an intensive summer workshop entitled ?Computational Thinking for Academic Professionals? will be offered to academic scientists who need training handling larger datasets, such as those in this project.<br/><br/>Transcription factor (TF) proteins bind to specific DNA sequences across the genome to regulate gene expression. Surprisingly, recent genomic studies indicate that TF binding sites are characterized by increased DNA damage and are highly enriched for somatic mutations, suggesting that TF?DNA binding is mutagenic. This project hypothesizes that that TFs induce unique patterns of lesion accumulation within binding sites, which are dictated by the ability of TFs to enhance lesion formation and to occlude access to the nucleotide excision repair machinery. UV light will be used as a source of DNA damage to develop high?throughput in vitro techniques and quantitative models for: the affinity of TFs from different families for lesion-containing DNA and ability to compete with repair proteins; and the modulation of DNA damage formation by TF binding. These models will be used to predict genome?wide DNA damage and repair in human cells and to develop cell?based assays of damage and repair in genomic contexts. Successful completion of this work will link increases in mutation rates in TF binding sites to the molecular mechanisms by which TFs increase UV damage frequency in the human genome.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation, with joint funding from Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, stakeholders in many intelligent mobile applications/services are resource constrained in terms of spectrum, energy, computing, etc., which poses many challenges to FL inspired applications/services. This project targets to develop a novel NextG network with high degrees of resiliency to address those challenges, in particular, when there may be massive bursty workloads, insufficient spectrum availability, limited computational and storage capability on edge, and privacy concerns of the training data on mobile devices.

Despite significant efforts to develop effective cancer diagnosis and therapeutics, the ability to predict patient responses to anti-cancer therapeutic agents remains elusive. This is a critical milestone as getting the right choice of therapy early can mean superior anti-tumor outcomes and increased survival, while the wrong choice means tumor relapse, development of resistance, side effects without the desired benefit, and increased cost of treatment. An cyber-physical system that allows an accurate prediction of patient tumor responses to anti-cancer therapies; that is, enable real-time precision medicine, can have a transformative effect not only on health outcomes, but also on the costs of treatment. The goal of this project is therefore to develop an engineered cyber-physical system that combines advanced biological models with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods for predictive, automated screening of anti-cancer drugs and optimizations of their dosing. This will move science towards realizing the long-desired precision medicine paradigm leading to significant social impacts. The project has additional social impacts, including minimizing the exponentially growing ethical issues surrounding the use of animals in the past years through increased adoption of the engineered human cancer and heart tissue model systems. The project will provide opportunities to promote STEM education for K-12 students, train students, especially those from under-represented groups, and disseminate science and engineering knowledge to the public.<br/><br/>The investigators will leverage their expertise in biofabrication, tissue engineering, microfluidics, bioanalysis, and artificial intelligence to develop a generalized, self-dose-optimizing ""multi-sensor-integrated multi-organ-on-a-chip"" platform, which can be used to accurately predict both efficacy and safety of anti-cancer regimens in this project. The first innovation is the adoption of three-dimensional bioprinting for generating the vascularized ductal carcinoma model and vascularized cardiac tissue model, leading to the construction of a truly biomimetic human myocardium for evaluating drug toxicity. The adaptation of both of the bioprinted models to microfluidic systems is also a major innovation. Additionally, the real-time yet non-invasive monitoring of key biophysicochemical parameters will generate large-scale multi-dimensional data to enable accurate data-driven predictive modeling. Moreover, the platform will enable self-dose-optimization on the chips through a novel joint Bayes modeling implemented by two deep learning models capable of addressing multiple-instance learning, and dependency in sequences of multi-dimensional data, respectively.

For example, numerous experimental labs study how the strengths of synaptic connections and their dynamics affect cognition by establishing empirical correlations between in vitro electrophysiology measurements and data collected in animal behavioral experiments. However, these correlations fall short of causal explanations: to date, there exist no mechanisms connecting recordings in individual neurons and synapses with cognitive learning dynamics. The problem is not due to a lack of observations at either the neuronal or the systemic level; rather, it reflects a principal gap in our ability to link these two scales. Even if a full description of every neuron in the brain could be produced, there would still be a gap in our ability to transition from local data to making qualitative conclusions about how it combines to produce systemic cognitive outcomes. Addressing this problem requires a conceptual framework encompassing a computational model that would link the experimentally derived characteristics of individual cells with effects of those characteristics at the ensemble level.<br/> <br/>The proposed research aims to provide a way to establish such a connection: developing a data-driven, systemic model of hippocampal spatial learning based on the parameters of the hippocampal synaptic architecture, including the parameters of synaptic plasticity, using novel topological and geometric techniques. Recent developments in Algebraic Topology will be used to integrate the parameters of synaptic connectivity and synaptic plasticity (e.g., long- and short-term potentiation and depression), to study structure of this map, the mechanisms of its formation and deterioration, and to evaluate the time required to produce a spatial map of a given environment, etc. This project is a natural evolution of prior work done by the Dabaghian group on modeling the mechanisms of spatial learning, based on algebraic topology methods developed by the M?moli group.

Recent advances in AI methods allow us to train these models to understand each user?s individual biosignals patterns related to heart rate, movement, and other signal recordings using large amounts of unlabeled data that are recorded when the user wears the device. This should, in theory, enable us to refine these models to learn to predict relatively complex recurring health outcomes like stress and blood pressure spikes using much fewer labeled examples than what would have previously been necessary. We will test this paradigm in two user studies related to stress-related hypertension and substance use detection.<br/><br/>The status quo for machine learning consists of the development of a one-size-fits-all model which is usually trained on data coming from one group and tested on data from another disjoint group. However, the advent of self-supervised learning makes it possible to learn from vast unlabeled multimodal data streams recorded from a single individual, allowing for a pretrained model which learns feature representations which are specific to the baseline temporal dynamics of a single entity?s data streams. This project seeks to understand how such personalized self-supervised learning on multimodal data streams can be used to overfit, in a positive manner, a machine learning model to the unique patterns of an individual?s sensor readings, thus enabling model personalization and prediction of traditionally difficult or subjective targets. To make these artificial intelligence (AI) innovations practically useful and because these personalized models still require on the order of tens of annotations to converge, we propose to develop novel human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques which are tightly integrated into the AI workflow to facilitate reliable and effective yet minimal annotations of the adverse health event of interest from the end user.

However, the connection between genes and the energy-related traits those genes encode is complicated for two primary reasons: (1) energy-related genes are spread across three separate cellular compartments (the nucleus, the chloroplasts, and the mitochondria), and (2) all plants have experienced one or more whole genome duplication events, in which the nuclear genome has been doubled or more, during their evolutionary history. Indeed, many of our most important crop species have more than two copies of their nuclear genome inside their cells. How this ?genomic redundancy? affects energy production is largely unknown; however, the balance between nuclear genome copy number and the mitochondria and chloroplasts appear to be critical to plant energy production. We will employ and train students and researchers to investigate how plant cells maintain this balance. <br/><br/>Whole genome duplication events (WGDs), in which the nuclear genome is doubled or more as a result of allopolyploidization or autopolyploidization, are a major force for plant diversification. Because the cytoplasmic genomes are separately replicated (and inherited) from the nuclear genome, the stoichiometric balance between the three genomic compartments (i.e., cytonuclear stoichiometry) is expected to be perturbed following WGD. Recent work indicates that cytonuclear stoichiometry is maintained following WGD in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that gene dosage balance between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes represents an important component of polyploid lineage formation and evolution. We therefore hypothesize that cytonuclear stoichiometry is critical for establishing the cell?s chloroplast and mitochondrial content, such that variation in cytonuclear stoichiometry leads to variation in photosynthetic and respiratory performance and that the genomic architecture of cytonuclear stoichiometry is responsive to changes in nuclear genome size and content. First, we will test these hypotheses in diploid, polyploid, and aneuploid contexts by quantifying and measuring organelles, evaluating photosynthetic performance, and comparing nuclear vs. cytoplasmic transcript pools of single cells. We will also perform association tests in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and confirm those associations with molecular knockouts to disentangle the complex genomic architecture underlying cytonuclear stoichiometry. The findings are expected to set the stage for future applied efforts aimed at improving metabolic function in polyploid crops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does the brain work remain one of the most challenging scientific problems for humanity. For decades, scientists and engineers continually develop and refine new methods and techniques to advance our understanding of the brain. Out of these tools, imaging is essential for deciphering the brain because it allows us to directly visualize and investigate the complex brain tissues and their organizations and functional networks. However, even with the multitude of brain imaging technologies that are currently available, our ability to probe deep brain tissues beyond the cerebral cortex is still limited. This limitation can largely be attributed to the physics of imaging, which dictate the inevitable trade-off between how small of an object we can see and from how deep we can see them. This shortcoming ultimately limits our ability to explore beyond the superficial tissues of the brain and to understand how the human brain works in its entirety. The long-term objective of this CAREER proposal, therefore, is to overcome this shortcoming by developing a new ultrasound imaging technology that can probe deep brain functional neural activities at a microscopic spatial resolution. Our technique leverages the power of deep learning and ultrafast ultrasound imaging to break the barrier of imaging speed for conventional super-resolution ultrasound. If successful, this transformative new technology will become a paradigm-shifting imaging tool that provides functional brain mapping at a much finer spatial resolution with a much deeper and wider territory than ever before. The unique capabilities of this new imaging technology will also open new doors for many under-explored opportunities in both basic neuroscience research and in many neurological disease applications. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop a new and transformative functional brain imaging technology that allows continuous, real-time monitoring of neural activities of the entire brain at a micron-scale through intact skull. Thrust 1 will focus on improving the temporal resolution of conventional super-resolution ultrasound imaging by developing deep learning-based super-resolution imaging techniques. Thrust 2 will address the computational challenges associated with ultrasound image reconstruction by developing a new ultrafast ultrasound system based on modern high-speed FPGAs. Thrust 3 will concentrate on developing phase aberration correction methods based on deep learning and novel 3D ultrafast imaging techniques to achieve robust intact skull imaging of the whole brain. In vivo mouse brain imaging studies will be conducted throughout the technical thrusts to evaluate and validate the performance of the newly developed super-resolution imaging techniques. If successful, the proposed work will result in a new, radiation-free, low-cost, and widely accessible functional brain imaging technique that will be the first to enable noninvasive probing of in vivo, deep-brain neural activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. In addition to the technical thrusts, this CAREER proposal also includes educational and outreach programs aimed to instill in the new generation of students the desire to improve the standard of healthcare such that all patients have access to state-of-the-art treatment, diagnostic, and screening options. By providing research opportunities, creating ultrasound engineering labs, developing innovative teaching strategies, and establishing new courses, this CAREER proposal will provide these students with the knowledge and tools necessary to create actionable changes within the opportunities presented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insects, in particular, have repeatedly formed symbioses with microbes for metabolism, nutrition, and protection. Insect immune systems are tasked with the challenge of controlling and regulating beneficial microbes while combating often closely-related pathogenic microbes. A critical unanswered question is whether the insect immune system is a key mediator of both symbionts and pathogens across different host species. This project will combine cutting edge genomics with experimental manipulations that will link immune responses with symbiont associations across diverse host species. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how immune systems interact with symbionts is not only critical for understanding the evolution of host-associated microbiomes, it also has relevance to the invertebrate pests that vector devastating diseases of crops, livestock, and humans. In addition, there are research opportunities available for undergraduate students to train the next generation of STEM researchers.<br/><br/>This project will use aphids as a model system and involves research at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and the Queen Mary University of London. Aphids are uniquely suited for this work because they have strong non-random associations with microbial symbionts: a symbiont species may be common in one aphid species, yet rarely found in a close relative. This suggests a dynamic interplay between host and microbe that can drive symbiont spread or loss over relatively short evolutionary timescales. Preliminary data has shown that hosting certain symbionts leads to a sharp decrease in the expression of key immune genes in aphids. This suggests host immunity is of central importance to the evolution of symbiotic relationships. The primary objective of this project is to use transcriptome sequencing and immune assays to test the hypothesis that host immune suppression is a key mechanism explaining the distribution of symbiotic microbes across aphid species. A secondary objective is to determine whether there is a trade-off in the ability to harbor symbionts and resist pathogens across species. Genomes of virulent and non-virulent symbiont strains will also be compared using a novel symbiont culturing technology to identify genetic features that underlie pathogenicity in symbiotic microbes. Together, this cross-species approach will transform our understanding of how host immunity moderates relationships with symbiotic microbes. This project will thus provide key insight into how invertebrates form and maintain relationships with microbes that can drive rapid adaptive evolution in species of central importance to food security and health.

Individuals from nearly every animal group migrate and billions of individuals, migrate thousands of kilometers each year. Considerable variation in migration route has been documented but what is less well understood is the underlying genetic basis for that variation and the consequences for maintaining species boundaries or even promoting diversification of new species. This research will make use of a global network of radio towers to collect data on migration routes in the Swainson?s thrush, a migratory bird with eastern- and western-migrating subspecies. Individuals of this species, like many others, migrate from breeding grounds in the northwestern North America via central America and south into Chile each year. This project will evaluate the underlying genetics of migration route and the consequences of routes intermediate between the classical eastern and western routes for survival and the maintenance of the subspecies. Many of the radio towers are hosted by schools. Thus, research themes and infrastructure from this project will also be used as inspiration for teaching resources for elementary, secondary, and undergraduate students across the Americas. Education modules focused on migration and evolution will be designed for teachers, provided in English and Spanish, and offered to students internationally across the migration routes of the thrush. These modules will integrate ?nature of science? pedagogy and highlight the role of under-represented groups in STEM research while featuring international coordination as key to the protection of migrating species. <br/><br/>Migration?s importance for speciation was proposed nearly three decades ago but has received far less attention. Many migrants breed next to one another but use different migratory routes. These routes are largely genetically determined and often involve navigation around large geographic barriers. Accordingly, hybrids in these systems are predicted to take intermediate routes that bring them over these barriers, reducing their fitness and gene flow between species. This project will test migration?s role in speciation. Specifically, state of the art infrastructure for tracking birds and genomic resources developed to genotype hundreds of individuals at low coverage will be used to (1) compare survival rates of parental and hybrid thrushes, (2) identify genetic variants underlying migratory traits, and (3) test if selection against hybrids is acting on these variants. No direct test of migration?s role in speciation has been conducted to date, leaving critical gaps in our understanding of speciation, given that differences in migration are taxonomically widespread and could help explain the predominance of young species pairs in the temperate region. Migration could also be a compelling example of an extrinsic postzygotic isolating barrier, given that reductions in hybrid fitness derive from mismatches between their intermediate behavior and parental environments. Extrinsic isolation is thought to be important in speciation, but its extent in nature is unknown, especially in vertebrates. This work will reach fields beyond speciation as well, including the genetics of complex behavior and conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The demanding challenge in this field is to find the right carrier architecture and the optimum polymer chemistry that can facilitate controlled delivery and release of therapeutic agents (drugs) to their targets. A unique carrier is invertible polymer micellar assemblies, which are formed by the rapid self-organization/assembly of polymers with alternated and repeated hydrophobic (water-hating) and hydrophilic (water-loving) segments in a rod-like shape (tens of nanometers long). Drugs and polypeptides/nucleic acids which can treat various diseases but cannot be directly introduced to human body can be incorporated into invertible micellar assemblies. Once the environmental conditions are changed (i.e., when the assemblies from water ?arrive? to the cellular membrane), the invertible micellar assemblies reverse their dimensions and geometry (shape) in a smart way to effectively deliver and release cargo molecules to the targets (biological membranes) and, thus, treat relevant diseases. Although the structure and dynamics of invertible micellar assemblies have been understood to a certain level, the key questions that still need to be answered are (i) what properties of cargo-loaded invertible micellar assemblies make them efficient in treating diseases (ii) how significant is a fact of unique change of shape (called ?inversion? in this project) for efficient delivery performance. Answering these questions require an in-depth understanding on the interactions between drug cargos and invertible micellar assemblies under varied environments at the molecular level, which is a challenging task because most commonly seen techniques do not have a sufficiently high resolution to ?penetrate? the assemblies and probe biopolymer cargos therein. In this project, researchers from the North Dakota State University bridge this knowledge gap by labelling biopolymers and studying the behavior of the labeled sites using a unique technique known as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The obtained data will provide details on how invertible micellar assemblies interact with the solvent environment and the biopolymer cargos as well as how the cargos move and/or aggregate within the interior of invertible micellar assemblies. This information  not only answers aforementioned questions but also assists in the rational design of new delivery vehicles that better adapt/deliver biopolymers and/or drugs, broadening the application of invertible micellar assemblies as general drug carriers to treat various diseases. The research team will provide training to underrepresented students including Native American students and local undergraduate and high school students on nanotechnology and chemistry. The team will also offer scientific educational opportunities for youths whose parents are deployed as soldiers through the Operation Military Kids program in the state of North Dakota.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the interactions among the invertible micellar assemblies, cargo, and environment (solvent) at the nanoscale, in order to reveal the mechanistic details in the interior of invertible micellar assemblies when biopolymer cargos are loaded and released due to environment polarity changes. This goal will be achieved via three steps: (i) revealing the changes in the morphology, crowding, and polarity of invertible micellar assemblies under varied solvent conditions, (ii) depicting the impact of biopolymer cargo loading on the morphology, crowding, and polarity of invertible micellar assemblies in water, and (iii) elucidating the movement and aggregation state (if any) of the biopolymer within invertible micellar assemblies upon environment polarity change. The key to acquiring this knowledge is to covalently place an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spin probe/tag at specific locations/positions within the invertible micellar assemblies and on biopolymers, followed by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy study of (bio)polymer structure and dynamics. This research will provide maps of the local crowding and polarity within the invertible micellar assemblies under various solvent conditions and locate various segments of biopolymer cargos (connecting which lead to cargo conformation) in the invertible micellar assemblies based on the local crowding and polarity of the cargo. The obtained knowledge offers a direct connection between the microenvironment of invertible micellar assemblies and cargo structure/hydrophobicity/polarity to assess and rationalize the relative strength of the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. This work will also use the information of cargo location and cargo movement to depict the relative position of cargos upon interacting with the invertible micellar assemblies. Lastly, this research will elucidate the possible structural changes of cargos, if any, caused by the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. All of these efforts will result in an in-depth understanding of the cargo uptake/release performance and the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. This project will also provide training to students at various educational levels (high school, undergraduate) from diverse backgrounds by offering hands-on research experience in cutting-edge nanotechnology, biopolymer engineering, and spectroscopy. The obtained knowledge and experimental approaches from research activities will be disseminated through scientific peer-review journal publications, national/international conferences, and local science fairs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HABs can lower water quality and produce toxins, impairing fisheries, recreational waters, and drinking water sources. HABs are often related to nutrient pollution, but nutrient reductions from surrounding watersheds require collaboration, awareness, and community buy-in to make sustainable long-term changes and prevent bloom formation. This is particularly the case for areas that have limited access to drinking water infrastructure and where the impacts of HABs have been largely overlooked. In this project, community-based activities engage two rural communities in Western Oregon near Tenmile Lakes and Dorena Lake with respect to HABs awareness, risks, and vulnerabilities. The communities? economies are reliant on watershed resources, e.g., timber and agriculture, that may contribute to nutrient loading, and on resources provided by the impacted lake, such as fishing, drinking water, and irrigation water. In partnership with rural stakeholders, organizations, and community members, this project explores climate-smart, sustainable, value-added intervention strategies to prevent HABs and reduce health risks.<br/><br/>Collaborating with civic partners focused on environment and livelihood, our research addresses knowledge gaps regarding the health risks and economic impacts of cyanoHABs in rural regions. We work with local communities to address the loss of water security due to cyanoHABs and test the use of a carbon by-product technology, biochar, to mitigate impacts of cyanoHABs. Biochar is used in agriculture and forestry to improve soil and ecosystem health. Here we apply it in the context of watersheds and water treatment. Through roundtables, workshops, interviews, and pilot experiments, and in collaboration with civic partners, stakeholders, and impacted community members, our research assesses the efficacy, feasibility, and sustainability of local biochar (i) to enhance near shore buffer zones designed to mitigate nutrient loading and reduce frequency and severity of blooms and (ii) to remove cyanotoxins through gravity-fed filters.

Graph analysis has been central for multiple communities, including the classical graph theory community, network analysis, graph optimization, as well as the modern day graph learning communities. Traditionally, graphs are regarded as purely combinatorial objects. However, as applications of graphs proliferate, they tend to be regarded as much richer structures. For example, a graph might be viewed as a noisy skeleton of a hidden geometric domain, and there could be rich, complex data associated with its nodes or edges. While this viewpoint is not new, existing algorithmic treatments of graphs have not yet fully leveraged this perspective. In this project, the investigators aim to further integrate various (geo)metric and topological perspectives into graph analysis in order to enrich graph analysis algorithms and broaden the range of methodologies one can use to tackle diverse graph related tasks. This project will integrate ideas and notions from metric geometry, applied topology, spectral geometry and also algorithms to develop new perspectives and effective methods to analyze complex graphs. It will inject new ideas to graph analysis and learning, while at the same time also advancing the field of geometric and topological data analysis. Given the ubiquity of graphs data, methods resulting from this project can potentially impact various application fields, from scientific domains such as molecular biology, materials science, neuroscience, to engineering domains such as chip design. Results from this project will be integrated into the data science curriculum, strengthening the workforce by training undergraduates and graduates in data science.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigators will consider a range of important problems related to the study of individual as well as of collections of graphs. A central theme of this project is to view graphs as objects enriched beyond their combinatorial structures. Two specific research thrusts that the investigators will focus on are: (1) various graph distances, trade-offs between their discriminating power and computational complexity, and potential applications in graph sparsification and in the study of graph neural networks; and (2) modeling, recovering and using (potentially higher order) structures in graphs. To tackle the challenges emerging from these two research thrusts, the investigators will use various metric and topological methods. Examples include viewing graphs as metric spaces and bringing in topological tools (e.g., the interleaving distance from applied topology) to compare them; viewing graphs as metric measure spaces so as to use optimal transport ideas; and bringing together topological persistence through the high dimensional Laplace operator to study spectral structures induced by graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize safety as a fundamental aspect across various domains of AI research. Notably, due to the ubiquity of network (graph) data, network learning techniques have strongly impacted AI in the past decade, being widely deployed across applications such as social networks, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, real-world networks often include challenges like data issues and unforeseen environmental hazards, resulting in risky AI techniques and unsafe outcomes when these networks are employed. Existing studies for safe network learning lack versatility, efficiency, and comprehensive integration across multiple safety dimensions. They struggle to ensure timely, safe predictions in practical scenarios and fail to holistically address data, model, and usage aspects. These challenges collectively hinder their capability and effectiveness, and there is currently a lack of a holistic framework to adequately tackle safety issues in network learning. To bridge this research gap, the goal of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a novel Safety-centric Network Learning framework (SNL) for safe decision-making on networks in the wild. The project outcomes will substantially impact network learning research and offer advanced solutions to address challenges across diverse domains such as public health, cybersecurity, and social media. Additionally, the project will foster interdisciplinary collaborations and facilitate technology transfer to industry. The project outcomes will be made publicly accessible and broadly disseminated. Moreover, the project will integrate research with education through novel curriculum development and student mentoring activities with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, aiming to train and educate future generations in effectively developing and utilizing AI while also ensuring AI safety. <br/><br/>The project will involve comprehensive efforts to develop SNL that prioritizes the critical safety dimensions of reliability, stability, and explainability, and further encompasses the crucial aspects of data, model, and usage in a general, efficient, and integrated manner. Formally, SNL will provide reliable network data and network learning models (reliability) while generating stable and consistent outputs (stability) accompanied by easily understandable usage explanations (explainability). Specifically, the research components that engage innovative theories, algorithms, and models in this project are fourfold. First, design novel network learning algorithms to identify and generate reliable network data that are minimally impacted by data and environmental issues. Second, create new network representation learning models and training strategies to promote efficiency and reliability in learning network representations. Third, devise innovative data-to-model optimization theories to ensure the stability of network learning. Finally, develop novel generative learning methods to advance the usage explainability and output receptivity of network learning.

Storing data for decades is challenging and securing it for so long is even more challenging.  This project develops secure, efficient, long-term archival storage systems for digital information that endures beyond a single human lifetime.  The project uses a long-term security model that is safe against faster computers and even quantum computers and can protect against malicious ""insiders"" who abuse their access to secretly steal data slowly over years.  Lastly, the project explores how to maintain long-term data securely and efficiently, even if individual storage providers cease to exist.<br/><br/>This project develops techniques to store archival data securely and reliably for a long-time using information theoretic security and combinatorial security.  The project explores techniques to allow data to survive errors ranging from corruptions of a few bytes to large-scale cloud failures.  It then explores the trade-off between additional storage requirements, data security and reliability, and system performance.  Empirical evaluation of a prototype system provides insights into real-world issues in implementing these techniques over the project?s lifespan, and a simulator embodying these techniques allows projection of the techniques? effectiveness over much longer time frames.<br/><br/>This project fosters collaborations across systems, theory, and security researchers to develop practical techniques to both secure data for many years and ensure that the data endures unchanged.  Storage must meet both criteria for a society based on digital data to rely on it.  All source code for a prototype system and simulator is maintained and released publicly.

Programmable networks are capable of reading the data inside data packets, opening the possibility of performing computations while data is still in transit. However, computing within the network is challenging given the limited compute and memory resources of programmable network devices. The SciWiT project plans to implement a prototype system for performing scientific data analysis using in-network and near-network resources in an optimal way.<br/><br/>Many scientific workflows continuously monitor a phenomenon in search for rare events. This process generates enormous amount of data; thus, researchers rely on change detection algorithms to locate the rare event information. SciWiT is a computing model where programmable network resources operate on the raw data streamed through it. While data is still in transit, network identifies the regions of interest from the data stream and to provide feedback to the instrument. SciWiT plans to investigate how scientific workflows can leverage network-based in-transit computing and to develop novel in-network and near-network computing mechanisms to operate on scientific data streams.<br/><br/>SciWiT will benefit scientific applications that rely on change detection. Moreover, this project will enhance the viability of making programmable networks an inherent computing element in the scientific data processing pipeline, effectively making the technology widely available to the scientific community. Similar to cloud environments, in-transit computing environments distributed across campuses will onboard scientific computing community to leverage the benefits of high speed programmable networks.

From the power systems perspective, this project aims to provide capability to support high-power demand response with high efficiency and fast speed. From the power electronics perspective, it suggests a solution to satisfy the high-current requirements with high power density and low cost.

However, the increasing digitization of ICSs, involving sensing, communication, and control, brings advanced features but also exposes vulnerabilities to malicious cyber-attacks. Protecting ICSs from such attacks is crucial due to the potential catastrophic physical damages they can cause. The project aims to develop a comprehensive solution, integrating human-on-the-loop explainable machine learning (ML), detection, and recovery control in an operator-automation shared protection framework, to provide security and safety-assured ICSs against malicious cyber-attacks. Moreover, the project will incorporate engineering research and education to train students, particularly those from Under-Represented Minorities (URM), and cultivate a diverse, globally competitive cybersecurity workforce. With the goal of lowering barriers to ICSs security research and education, this project aims to have a significant impact by providing accessible testbeds for a diverse population of beginning and expert cybersecurity students and engineers to learn and practice.<br/><br/>The underlying concept of process anomaly detection, which is used for detecting cyber-attacks, involves comparing observed and expected behaviors based on physical invariants. The data-driven approach has the advantage of automatically discovering these physical invariants without requiring domain expertise. However, existing approaches based on black-box Machine Learning (ML) often overlook the role of system operators in safety-critical ICSs. The lack of insightful explanations in detection results hinders system operators from conducting troubleshooting and isolating anomalous sensors and actuators under attack, which is necessary for scheduling online recovery. To address this issue, the PI's team proposes to develop an operator-automation shared protection framework that unifies human-on-the-loop explainable ML, detection, and recovery control. This framework aims to enable real-time decision-making using cutting-edge ML and control techniques while valuing the feedback of human operators to prevent over-trust in autonomy in a safety-critical system. The research project has three major objectives: 1) The PI's team will develop insightful hybrid automata learning that captures physical invariants in a way that system operators can understand the model and the detection results, verify and correct the model, and localize anomalies; 2) A real-time provably safe control under uncertainty will be designed to restore the system to normal operation without violating safety constraints; and 3) the PI?s team will evaluate, demonstrate, and disseminate best practices of the proposed framework on 3D simulated and real testbeds with portability across a wide range of ICSs for lowering the barriers to ICSs security research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viability is the ability of a system to autonomously maintain itself or recover functionality after an adverse critical event and is a desired feature of robust intelligence and autonomy. An example of a critical event is a robot landing upside down and being unable to stand up without an external assistance. Other examples are an unmanned underwater vehicle in an unrecoverable state, a robotic arm getting stuck in clutter, or a car with poor braking performance due to a mechanical failure. The principal objective of this project is to develop a framework for the design of viable (self-recoverable) artificial agents. The main challenge is to formulate a metric for viability that can be calculated for various scenarios. This metric needs to be computable from the motor and sensor readings. The first task of this project is to develop an effective metric for agent viability from the essential properties of control systems, along with computationally efficient methods for its calculation. The second task is to demonstrate the applicability of this framework for useful problems in (i) self-recovery of walking robots and (ii) self-maintenance of car brakes. This project not only advances the understanding of robot viability, but also proposes new machine-learning approaches for control and analysis of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>To achieve its goals, this project will extend the classical notion of Lyapunov exponents towards ?Agent-Induced Lyapunov Exponents?, AILE, which prioritize states with diverse potentialities, and with a large space of effectively controllable states. AILE allows artificial agents to train autonomously, maintaining themselves or recovering capabilities without the need for problem-specific externally provided reward functions. Computational methods will be developed for the calculation of the AILE metric with known and unknown dynamics, and with partially and fully observable state. This capacity will allow for the broad applicability of the framework. It will be demonstrated in two transformative applications: self-recovery of locomotion agents, and control of chaotic ?stick-slip? friction in car brakes. This project is not framed along the lines of traditional disciplinary boundaries, but rather bridges between machine learning, dynamical systems, mechanics, and information theory.

With the advent of single cell multi-omics (scMulti-seq) biotechnology, researchers can study the  biological functions of a complex biological system at the cellular resolution. The integrative  analysis of scMulti-seq data and multiple study objects produces a wealth of rich information that enables the characterization of species or tissue specific biological functions, and at the same  time, poses great challenge on how to identify and extract biologically meaningful data patterns. Though substantial amount of efforts has been made to interpret data patterns in single cell multi omics data, most of the existing methods focused on unsupervised learning in a completely data driven manner without considering the rich existing knowledge. In addition, depending on the  types of biological functions, their underlying mathematical representation forms are different in scMulti-seq data. This calls for systems biology models and machine learning concepts to target  true biological functions from scMulti-seq data. The first challenge to study biological functions  from scMulti-seq data is to derive the data patterns that correspond to true biological functions and develop proper computational models for specific biological mechanisms and pathways. The  second challenge lies in the difficulty of knowledge representation and sharing across the studies  for different species, tissue types and experimental conditions. There remains an urgent need to integrate knowledge derived from disparate data sources to optimize the biological functional  modeling, such that the learned knowledge could be utilized to study other biological systems or  data types and promote the generation of new hypotheses. The PI?s long-term career goal is to develop mathematical formulations and computational  methods to model biological functions from multi-omics data. <br/><br/>This project will develop new  mathematical models and an advanced computational framework to optimize the mining of  biological functions, by integrating scMulti-seq data with context specific and general knowledge  derived from independent data sets or experiments. The PI's research team will achieve the goals  through the following three objectives. First, a novel subspace representation model will be  developed to identify transcriptional regulation and functional gene modules. The proposed  method will be empowered by a novel local low-rank matrix detection method to detect gene co regulation modules and a meta-learning framework to optimize results interpretation. Second, the  PI's research team will develop a new graph neural network architecture to estimate cell-wise  functional activities for flux carrying networks and a graph data clustering method to identify cell  groups with varied functional states and distinct pathways. Thirdly, a knowledge graph will be  constructed to represent the biological functions derived from scMulti-seq data, which enables the  integration of independent knowledge derived from literature data and development of new  biological hypotheses. The project is expected to deliver novel computational tools that can  effectively explore biological functions from a wide range of heterogeneous datasets, and it could  provide new capabilities for functional interpretation of individual data sets by maximizing the utilization of existing scMulti-seq and literature data, and reasoning of new biological hypotheses  and mechanisms. Educationally, the scientific discoveries, including developed methods and  biological knowledge, will be seamlessly integrated into an online educational knowledge base  for large-scale public engagement, and will also lead to new project-based interdisciplinary  training for high school, undergraduate and graduate students.

Technologies that have been proposed to provide rural broadband access are not designed to address the non-uniformity in demand for communication and computation resources that are found throughout these environments; for example, many automated farming services will have stringent delay requirements for short periods during the day while residential areas exhibit traditional diurnal patterns. This project aims to address this challenge by establishing a core set of methodologies that synergize the design of rural connectivity and computing. Emerging massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is integrated with the design of hierarchical data processing architectures across the rural infrastructure to adapt based on spatial and temporal demand variations. Extensive evaluations are conducted based on a massive MIMO platform and wireless device equipment available from the industrial partner. The project contributes to the development of a diverse workforce in rural broadband and intelligence through the formation of research teams integrating undergraduate and graduate students across institutions.<br/><br/>Project research activities are organized into three thrusts.

The developed algorithms are further enhanced by reducing scheduling overhead through position-aided channel representation techniques. Thrust 2 investigates the orchestration of computation tasks under rural non-uniformity, focusing on establishing intelligent rural data processing architectures leveraging the broadband connectivity provided by Thrust 1. Techniques for distributing data processing among clusters of rural devices aiming to execute collaborative tasks rapidly are developed via joint optimization of device-to-device communications and task utility metrics. The orchestration of data processing and intelligence synchronization steps along the rural network hierarchy is also considered to adapt based on task demand variations.

Access to resources, including money, information, flexible work schedules, reliable transportation, and time, is necessary to avoid noncompliance with these programs. The research will include a randomized control trial (RCT) that will causally investigate whether and how investments in rehabilitation programming, as well as the alleviation of particular forms of disadvantage, can increase program participation and completion rates. The project will use full sample comparisons between treatment and control groups to estimate the effects of economic, socioeconomic, and informational variables on rates of program enrollment, dropout, re-enrollment, and completion. Findings from the RCT will be included as inputs to an agent-based simulation model that will evaluate influences on compliance with rehabilitation and reentry programs at the population level.

Interpretation of specific functional roles that each protein molecule plays in cell is thus critical for us to understand the fundamental principles of the biological processes and to design new drug treatments to regulate the processes for improving human health. The task is however highly non-trivial in modern molecular biology studies. The most accurate method to interpret protein biological functions is through structural biology and biochemistry experiments. But the cost of the experimental studies is high, and the process is too slow for large-scale application due to the involvement of manual skill and data processing. As a result, the majority of proteins in human and other important species remain unknown despite decades of efforts. The lack of genome-wide protein function information has significantly impeded the progress of system biology studies aiming at a comprehensive understanding of the life process. In this project, the investigators plan to develop advanced computational methods for automatic and yet reliable protein function annotations. The developed methods and databases will be freely released to the scientific community, which can be used for large-scale and genome-wide protein function annotation studies. The project will also provide opportunities to promote participations of underrepresented groups, including women and African Americans, in computational biology education and method developments.<br/><br/>Built on the assumption that similar sequences have similar function, a routine approach to computational protein function annotations is comparative modeling, which deduces functions of target proteins from known homologous proteins. However, the accuracy and coverage of the approach are limited due to the diversity of gene evolution. Significant progress has been recently achieved in protein 3D structure prediction and the state-of-the-art algorithms can generate high-quality structures for distant-homology proteins with an unprecedented capacity. This project seeks to explore various new ideas to enhance the accuracy of distant-homology protein function annotations by using 3D models from the cutting-edge protein structure predictions, with a focus on ligand-protein binding interactions, gene ontology and post-translational modifications. Meanwhile, thermal motion and intrinsic disordering of protein structures are integrated in the pipelines for better function annotations. While the proposed approaches do not expect to address all the fundamental issues, like the first-principle methods, as of how and why proteins fold and function, the success of the studies should help establish a practical knowledge-based relation of structure and function that can be used for genome-scale applications with models useful for guiding new experimental design, and thus significantly enhance the impact of protein structure modeling on biological studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, challenges remain in bringing these mostly academic findings to the scale necessary for industrial adoption, limiting the benefits to society that would result from safer and milder chemical processing conditions. An important factor in restricting the scalability of photochemical processes is that while high light absorptivity of the feedstocks is desirable for reaction efficiency, it also limits light penetration depth into the reaction medium. Commonly used photocatalysts can also be prohibitively expensive, and residual catalyst impurities in the final products often leads to discoloration or degradation. To address these limitations, this CAREER project will study the use of photocatalyst-coated optical fibers to guide light into the reactor vessels. If successful, the proposed work will lay the scientific foundations to facilitate the implementation of modern photochemistry on an industrial scale and enhance the impact of academic photo-reaction engineering innovations. Immobilizing photocatalysts on optical fibers is anticipated to improve light-penetration and efficiency of the catalytic process. Because the catalysts are immobilized and will not be added continuously with the reactor feed, the proposed approach will improve the process economics and will provide a path to manufacturing both pristine small molecules and polymers free of catalyst impurities. Eliminating such impurities is of importance for synthesis of high purity chemicals in biomedical and electronic applications where trace metals can introduce toxicity or be detrimental to device performance. The research plans have the potential to accelerate the implementation of modern and mild photochemistries on large scales and benefit society by helping to bridge the academia-industry divide. Education and outreach activities will also benefit from the close academia-industry ties to be developed, connecting undergraduate and graduate students and potential employers through field trips and panel discussions with industry leadership. Further, this program will develop and distribute inexpensive polymer science laboratory kits that will benefit underserved middle and high school students by improving access to a quality STEM education experience.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will provide the fundamental engineering knowledge needed to translate academic advances in modern photochemistry to large-scale industrial applications. The objectives of this research program are to identify critical chemical structure-property relationships for organic photoredox catalysts that will enable surface-grafting to immobilizing substrates without affecting catalytic activity. By investigating a range of approaches to control the optical fiber evanescent field, optical fiber surface-tethered catalysts will subsequently be tested as heterogeneous photocatalysts in both batch and continuous-flow reactor systems. Catalyst surface density will be controlled through a combination of surface monolayer grafting and the use of bottlebrush polymer tethers. Once an optimal fiber unit spacing and distribution is identified, process throughput and scalability will no longer limited by light absorption, but exclusively by the size of the reactor. By bringing light into the reactor, Beer-Lambert absorption limitations will be circumvented to provide a highly scalable continuous throughput methodology. Because the photocatalyst is immobilized within the reactor (and not continuously added), it can be recycled for multiple reactions; furthermore, the final chemical product will be free of catalyst impurities, a condition necessary in many pharmaceutical and electronics chemical products. From an educational and outreach perspective, this program will broadly impact students of all ages and backgrounds by forming a coalition between university entities, rural schools, and industrial partners. The principal investigator will increase interfaces between undergraduate and graduate students and potential employers through field trips and panel discussions with industry leadership. Further, this program will pilot and distribute inexpensive at-cost polymer science laboratory kits to secondary students to benefit underserved middle and high school students by improving their access to quality STEM education. Finally, targeted community outreach events will promote university enrollment of socioeconomically challenged students while communicating scientific principles and the importance of sustainability and plastic waste recycling to non-technical audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While significant research has explored malware detection for PCs and mobile devices, these methods are not suitable for IoT systems due to their diverse operating systems and low power. Current models also struggle against sophisticated attacks that aim to evade detection. To address these challenges, the project team is developing DANGER-IoT, an approach to IoT malware detection that works across heterogeneous platforms, is efficient for low-power devices, and robust against advanced attacks. The researchers are collaborating with industry experts to ensure the project's ideas work well in real-world settings and are creating open-source tools and datasets. Spread across four universities and three countries, this project is also impacting a diverse group of students through new courses, security competitions, and international exchanges.<br/><br/>The DANGER-IoT project focuses on developing advanced machine-learning models for IoT malware detection. The first goal is to create a generic model that can detect malware across heterogeneous IoT platforms by constructing a common embedding space for similar functions across different operating systems and architectures. The project's second aim is to ensure efficiency for low-power devices by applying model compression techniques adapted from explainable AI and model pruning. To enhance robustness, the project will explore large-language models for code-style transfer, making malware appear benign to existing classifiers, and using the results to design a novel moving-target defense.

There is need to build the long-missing automated HPC I/O (Input/Output) middleware to transparently help scientists achieve optimal data access performance without their manual efforts. Designing automated HPC I/O middleware for large-scale, heterogeneous, and shared HPC storage systems is an extremely challenging task. The researchers supported by this grant plan to  leverage machine learning techniques to understand the requests and the current system status, intelligently and adaptively scheduling and coordinating I/O requests. The outcomes of this research are expected to work with existing storage components and minimize the impacts on both scientific applications and the HPC systems.<br/><br/>This project plans to tackle this grand challenge by exploring practical reinforcement learning-based (RL) methods and building relevant software infrastructure in an HPC environment.

Both tasks depend on identifying effective reinforcement learning methods and integrating these methods effectively into HPC systems. To achieve this goal, a novel, system-centric reinforcement learning framework will be developed.

Success in this project will transform how electrolytes are designed and implemented using a computational approach before costly synthesis and testing. The resulting new knowledge about electrolyte degradation chemistry and new simulation methodologies will benefit the next generation of scientists and engineers working on batteries.

The proposed methods will leverage a novel combination of two recent breakthroughs, making this an ideal time to investigate electrolyte degradation problem from a computational perspective. First, we will use modern semi-empirical quantum chemistry to provide the simulation throughout required to comprehensively describe the complex reaction networks associated with electrolyte degradation. Second, we will apply transfer learning models to improve the accuracy of describing reactions in condensed phases and at electrode interfaces. In combination, these strategies will address the tradeoff between computational accuracy and cost that has limited the application of reaction network characterizations to liquid electrolytes. These simulation methodologies will initially be applied to liquid electrolyte formulations that have widespread usage in contemporary Li-ion and post Li-ion batteries. Despite the fact that these are established electrolytes, the degradation chemistry that drives solid-electrolyte interphase formation and electrolyte-related failure is still incompletely resolved. Thus, by focusing on these electrolyte chemistries, we will be able to validate our characterization methodology while also providing the first complete view of the degradation reactions that occur in these electrolytes.

The objective of this project called MEDUSA: Mid-band Environmental sensing capability for Detecting incUmbents during Spectrum shAring is to detect the presence of static/mobile radar and anomalous transmissions within concurrent and comparatively higher power 5G and 4G-LTE signals.

Third, when the geographically separated and arbitrarily spaced ESC sensors are time and phase synchronized, they form a massive virtual array for receive beamforming.

Many of these advances are due to deep learning, through which the available data is used to train artificial neural networks in which every input is sequentially analyzed by many layers of artificial neurons to identify more complex relationships. When the prediction task is more challenging or the predictions need to be more accurate, considerably larger networks are trained with dedicated hardware such as general-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Nevertheless, individuals and organizations with more constrained resources may not have access to GPUs, and those larger networks may not fit in embedded systems such as Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices. On the one hand, there are many inexact pruning methods for reducing the size of a neural network after training. These methods may reduce the accuracy, affect the robustness of the network when applied to slightly modified data, and lead to fairness issues because the effect of pruning is uneven and disproportionally affects groups that are underrepresented in the data. On the other hand, the relationships that trained neural networks represent are often not as complex as they could potentially be. That implies that it is possible to obtain smaller neural networks representing the same relationships, hence avoiding the side effects of conventional pruning methods. This project aims to improve our understanding of what neural networks can represent, and how they can be exactly compressed for a more efficient use. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop exact neural network compression algorithms and investigate the relationship between network expressiveness in terms of the number of linear regions and network compressibility by leveraging polyhedral theory and discrete optimization techniques. Our primary goal is to develop faster and more scalable algorithms to identify network modifications having limited or no effect to the model represented by trained neural networks. Secondarily, we aim to identify theoretical connections between representability and compressibility as well as develop more efficient methods for measuring the number of linear regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process, performed in part by a structure in the brains of mammals called hippocampus, facilitates memory discrimination and is affected in brain disorders like dementia and post-traumatic stress disorders. As a result, animals and people suffering from these disorders experience difficulties recalling or accurately retrieving memories. Our understanding of how the hippocampus encodes similar experiences as distinct memories, allowing for easy discrimination during recall, is still limited. Recent advancements in neuroscience suggest that coordinated activity between excitatory and inhibitory neurons enables a specific computation known as pattern separation within the hippocampal circuit. This computation transforms similar input patterns into highly dissimilar output patterns and is thought to be the basis for memory discrimination. In the proposed research, the investigators aim to determine the contribution of a specific type of inhibitory neurons called cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK) neurons to the hippocampal circuit?s function. Their long-term goal is to enhance our understanding of critical computations, like pattern separation, performed by this brain region, which are crucial for memory discrimination.  As part of this project, the investigators also provide a strong educational and training environment to students and new generations of scientists with a strong emphasis in recruiting and training minorities and under-represented groups in STEM, and they participate in outreach programs, such as the Big Brother Big Sister event organized by the Reno Museum of Natural History, which they use as a platform to share their research with the general public and students of all ages.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to determine the contribution of CCK neurons to hippocampal circuit function, focusing on the plasticity of CCK neurons during the developmental period of juvenile mice. Their previous work demonstrates that environmental enrichment (EE) leads to increased synapses formed by CCK neurons in the dentate gyrus, suggesting their involvement in the maturation of hippocampal function and pattern separation. For the proposed work, they use an EE paradigm in mice and take advantage of viral mediated gene delivery technique combined with optogenetic approaches to manipulate the activity of the CCK neurons. They determine how the remodeling of the inhibitory CCK network adjusts the computation in the DG. In the first Objective of the project, they determine the contribution of CCK neurons to feedback and feedforward inhibitory microcircuits, both of which can impact pattern separation. In the second Objective, they measure the change in pattern separation and filtering performance of the DG induced by the EE using a novel in-vitro electrophysiological protocol. Together their research aims to unravel the mechanisms underlying pattern separation by exploring the involvement of CCK neurons in the hippocampal circuit. By increasing our understanding of these fundamental computations, they will shed light on the processes that support efficient memory functioning and potentially contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for memory-related disorders.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Modulation Program of the Neural Systems Cluster in the BIO Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Immersion is especially important for pilots, who rely on simulation to train for routine operations, but also for emergencies. While dedicated, high-fidelity, and approved flight simulators are already used as part of flight training, their cost and space requirements prohibit their wider use. VR headsets connected to a computer simulator setup can enhance training both at home and within a flight training program. Despite the popularity of air travel and the need for pilots in the aviation industry, becoming a pilot is a dream that most abandon after childhood, either in pursuit of other passions or because of its prohibitive initial investment in cost and time, resulting in a nationwide pilot shortage. This project will study skill transfer from VR-based simulation to the real world by evaluating the physical, functional, and cognitive characteristics of simulation which impact a trainee?s ability to learn efficiently and effectively, as applied to the flight training environment. This project will make flight more accessible as a career and field of study through the use of virtual reality flight simulators. Additionally, it will broaden participation in aviation-careers and interests through outreach activities at local airports and by providing future pilots with online modules to help them initiate their training. Flight simulation performance-based and emergency response competitions will allow those already in training to test their skills and educate them on using flight simulation for their own practice. This award will enhance flight training, resulting in reduced flight training accidents and decreased time to certification, thus improving our ability to respond to the pilot shortage.<br/><br/>This project will study skill transfer from virtual reality to the physical world by evaluating the physical, functional, and cognitive fidelity characteristics of simulation that impact a trainee pilot?s ability to learn efficiently and effectively. Two experiments will measure skill transfer. The first will train novice pilots completely in virtual reality and evaluate their abilities in the aircraft. The second will follow a group of pilots who are pursuing an instrument certificate throughout their training and complement their training with simulation scenarios on both traditional simulators and a virtual reality flight simulator. Complementing flight training with simulation will investigate the impact of virtual reality interventions on skill acquisition and mental workload management. The data collected through both experiments will be used to evaluate and validate the use of virtual reality in both research and training as an alternative to physical simulators. This work will collect flight data through on-board flight data recorders and simulation software, physiological data through eye tracking and heart rate monitoring, and psychometric data through mobile surveys. Scoring algorithms will detect and evaluate human performance on a series of maneuvers. This project will advance our understanding of how humans learn in complex virtual reality environments such as flight training, validating virtual reality systems as a training device option, and therefore reducing the cost and time of highly advanced training in fields, which require the use of multiple skills simultaneously. The research will identify which types of skills transfer, use data-driven metrics to measure skill acquisition and transfer, validate the use of eye tracking and hear rate metrics in virtual reality, and develop a framework to assess modern simulators based on how they address learning outcomes, informing policy and regulation. The integration of education and research in this proposal is focused on a three-level approach: (i) creating interest through outreach activities; (ii) empowering actions through online training modules and the use of VR-based flight simulation; (iii) advancing training through self-practice and semi-annual competitive flight simulation events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the century-long effort to map brain circuits, dissection of these complex networks remains technically challenging and time-consuming. This project builds on recent advances in genetic, imaging, and computational methods to develop a unified framework for reliable reconstruction of genetically identified neurons and their connections at single-neuron resolution from 3D image data. The resulting computational methods will be applicable to a wide range of problems in biological and biomedical image analysis.<br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into four thrusts. The first thrust generates a large number of super-resolution three dimensional (3D) images of whole Drosophila brains, in each of which connected neurons are labeled by multispectral trans-Tango/Bitbow labeling. The second thrust creates computer vision and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to generate neuronal tracing, and software to aid efficient human proofreading and error correction. This will allow the generation of gold-standard neuronal tracing and segmentation from relatively sparse Brainbow labeling as training inputs. The third thrust creates a generative machine learning model to create realistic Bitbow neurons and synthesize images with various labeling densities based on the sparse annotation training inputs. The fourth thrust develops an annotation machine learning model to reconstruct the densely labeled trans-Tango/Bitbow Drosophila brains with the machine-learning-generated Bitbow images and their corresponding ground truth annotations as training inputs.

For example, imagine while eating brunch at a busy intersection you witness a horrific car accident. While you may have great memory for the anguish in the passenger?s face, you may not have great memory for how the car accident transpired (e.g., was the driver texting while driving?). Understanding how emotion distorts memories is of critical importance because as a society we use personal accounts of prior events to inform communication in both legal and media contexts. This project increases our understanding of how individuals form memories for complex emotional events by defining the features of learning that contribute to distortions in memory. The project leverages rodent and animal models of how emotional arousal influences brain structures underlying memory and extends them by employing more real-life, threatening events. There is accumulating evidence that emotional events heighten threat-related arousal, such as increases in sweating and heart rate, which can impair the function of regions known to construct episodic memories, such as the hippocampus. However, most laboratory based studies use static word lists or pictures as experimental stimuli, which preclude the ability to understand how threat changes individuals? ability to construct accurate memory-based narratives of real-world situations. Threat may bias memory formation towards the most emotional parts of events while also encouraging the ignoring of mundane details (like where or when the event happened) which makes it difficult to accurately reflect on how events unfolded. A series of behavioral, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments, using highly arousing naturalistic stimuli, address arousal?s role in fragmented memory by placing individuals in more complex, threatening environments than previous research. Understanding the intersection of emotion, arousal, and memory cohesion has broad implications for improving methods to make sure when individuals convey their interpretations of past events to broader audiences?such as an individual sharing their interpretation of a traumatic event to a news outlet or a courtroom?we can accurately determine which parts of their memories are more or less fallible. Alongside the research project are plans for the mentorship of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate trainees, public outreach through theatre events and digital media, and a plan to develop collaborations with experts in eye-witness testimony, digital media, and memory research. <br/><br/>This project translates models of arousal-mediated biases in episodic memory into the domain of naturalistic, ecologically-relevant stimuli in humans. Research in both rodents and humans shows that emotional memory is supported by a cascade of events which are triggered by threat detection in the amygdala, which then increases physiological arousal and noradrenergic tone in concert with facilitating medial temporal lobe-dependent encoding. These neuromodulatory signals are specifically thought to bias memory encoding towards cortical medial temporal lobe-based memory representations over hippocampal-dependent representations, which in turn results in greater memory for the most salient features of an emotional event at the expense of more mundane details. Critically, intact hippocampal function is necessary to form cohesive memories that maintain their temporal order, contextual details, and a continuous narrative. It follows that, due to amygdala involvement, memories of emotionally arousing events would lack typical markers of hippocampal-dependent memory such as a cohesive temporal narrative. However, prior research has precluded testing such hypotheses based on the use of more simplistic stimuli that are static and lack narrative structures (i.e., word lists, pictures). Emerging work in the cognitive neuroscience of memory has provided behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging techniques to assay memory processes that unfold over time by utilizing more complex memoranda that include a narrative structure. In the first set of studies, participants attend a highly arousing haunted house during the collection of physiological data and then complete free recall tests characterizing the cohesive structure of their memories. In a second series of studies, the investigators leverage neuroimaging methods during the encoding and free recall of horror and neutral movies clips to better understand the relationship between amygdala-medial temporal lobe interactions, physiological arousal, and memory distortion. In the final series of studies, the investigators manipulate individuals? agency while playing a horror-themed video game, testing a novel hypothesis that agency may protect individuals from arousal-based memory distortions by providing them control over the event, a form of intrinsic emotion regulation. Thus, these studies expand our knowledge on emotional memory by moving beyond simple laboratory-based stimuli into more naturalistic memoranda (i.e., staged events, movie viewing, videogame play). Together, this project tests a model by which physiological arousal disrupts hippocampal-dependent encoding resulting in fragmented, distorted representations of past events which are less communicable to the public. Understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms that drive memory distortions for complex, aversive events provides a foundation of knowledge to more accurately assess the veracity of individuals? memories for traumatic events, and provides targets of remediation to reduce distortions in memory. Thus, the findings from this project inform practices of incorporating first-person narratives in service of societal well-being in legal and media contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fairness has increasingly become crucial in distributing precious and scarce medical equipment, and its absence has exacerbated healthcare issues during the COVID-19 global pandemic. A wide variety of real-world applications such as scheduling, dispute resolution, healthcare management, and refugee settlement assume complete knowledge about allocation decisions, which gives rise to negative computational and impossibility results. The existing approaches to mitigate these challenges, in turn, impose a high cost on transparency. The broad goal of this project is to provide theoretical and algorithmic solutions for fair allocation of indivisible items in practical, large-scale settings, as a broad contribution to the grand scheme of artificial intelligence (AI) and economics for social good. This research will offer a novel and promising perspective for developing practical and transparent fair solutions while providing a systematic investigation on the perceived fairness of allocation mechanisms that are applicable to societies at large. This project will integrate and develop algorithmic solutions for transparent fair division in a publicly available software system with the goal of extending its reach--and in general promoting fairness and transparency--to a broad national and international audience. <br/><br/>This project will develop a new framework for achieving fairness and efficiency in the allocation of indivisible resources with minimum cost on transparency. Specifically, it will make progress in four interconnected dimensions: 1) Tradeoffs between transparency, fairness, and efficiency, that aim at analyzing the compatibility of the properties and devising algorithmic solutions when allocating indivisible items, 2) Strategic aspects of fair division, that investigates agents' behavior and strategies under transparency requirements, 3) Domain restriction, that focuses on developing tractable solutions by circumventing the impossibility results in achieving compatible solutions, and 4) Bads and mixtures, that extend the transparency and fairness framework to include desirable (goods) and undesirable items (bads).

Attention is dynamic and tends to fluctuate between external and internal states, and thus focusing attention on an instructor in undergraduate science courses for a long period of time is extremely taxing. While external attention, the selection and modulation of sensory information (e.g., focusing on an instructor?s voice while ignoring background noise), has been studied extensively, very little is known about the functional significance of internal attention, the selection and modulation of internally generated thoughts (e.g., quietly thinking about a prompt while ignoring distracting thoughts). Some researchers and practitioners have suggested that ?thinking? periods can promote the development of student ideas, while others argue that internally-generated thoughts are primarily off-task and lead to poor learning. The current CAREER project at the University of Connecticut will attempt to reconcile these competing claims by exploring how opportunities to focus attention internally during a biology lecture can support or jeopardize student learning. Further, since it is currently unknown how often students switch between internal and external states of attention and how long these states last, this project will manipulate the frequency and duration of ?thinking? periods during a lecture and examine the impact on students? conceptual understanding of core biology concepts. Whereas most prior research on student attention relies on self-reports, this project will explore and validate neural indicators of attention, measured with electroencephalography (EEG), which can be collected continuously without interfering with naturally occurring learning activities. Finally, the project will explore an innovative method of engaging undergraduate biology students as study participants as well as investigators of their own attentional states and associated brain activity. Taken together, this project will propel research both in the cognitive sciences and in discipline-based education research and inform the design of learning experiences in undergraduate science education that leverage attention fluctuations. The project is funded as a CAREER award from the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, with co-funding from the Perception, Action, Cognition (PAC) program in SBE. <br/><br/>Little is known about internal attention and how it can support or hinder student learning. Some Discipline-Based Education Researchers (DBER) and practitioners have proposed that providing students with opportunities to focus their attention internally during a lecture (such as the first step in the ?think-pair-share? classroom activity) can promote student learning, but the results of cognitive science research on the topic has been inconclusive. Some studies link internally-generated thoughts to poor learning, whereas other studies have linked it to increased creativity, problem solving, and goal setting. The current project will attempt to reconcile this divide in the literature by: (1) investigating how internal attention (?thinking?) periods during a biology lecture can promote or hinder student learning by manipulating the frequency and duration of these periods as well as the guidance provided to students; (2) identifying neural signatures of attention fluctuations during biology learning using EEG (more specifically, EEG spectral power and brain-to-brain synchrony across students at different frequency bands will be extracted and compared between periods of internal and external attention); and (3) developing Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE) in which biology students will investigate their own attention states and associated brain activity with low-cost, portable EEG technology. By investigating student attention using ecologically-valid biology materials and EEG technology that can be later deployed in classrooms, and by developing and disseminating an innovative CURE, the project will contribute to undergraduate STEM education and pave the way for future DBER-cognitive science cross-disciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineering students come to learn engineering design through an intensive project-based course known as their capstone course, a process critical to their formation as engineers. In these courses, students often emulate industry practices by designing projects within a team, in a process intended to be similar to what they might experience in the workplace. However, research in engineering education and practice continues to show that much design learning happens after students graduate with their engineering degrees. Might engineering students be better equipped to practice high-quality design in the workplace if they were more engaged in their capstone course? And how might capstone courses be designed in a way that motivates students to learn design with a deeper connection to the process? This project will address these critical questions through an in-depth study of engineering students and professionals and a sustained plan to equip engineering design instructors in preparing students for the workplace.<br/><br/>There is little knowledge of the specifics of how engineering students engage in capstone courses and how their engagement is driven by identity and motivation needs. The objective of this project will be to investigate how and why civil and mechanical engineering students and practicing engineers engage with engineering design activity. In particular, this project will be characterized by the following objectives: 1) Develop a model of design activity engagement and identity motives of students and professionals, 2) Expand our model to account for resistance and synergies, alignment and tension between academic and workplace settings and across disciplines, and 3) Advance holistic and authentic engagement of students in multiple academic settings through extensive collaboration with and training of engineering faculty. The capstone design experience is particularly unique because explicit and implicit goals focus on simulating the engineering design experience to the extent possible. How and why students engage in engineering design in capstone courses is therefore foundational to understanding and improving the efficacy of capstone courses. We will use constructivist grounded theory (CGT) to examine the how and why of this phenomenon in four important settings. The rationale for this research is that understanding differentially how students and engineers in different disciplines engage in design is a critical step in enhancing our understanding of engagement in academic and workplace settings and results can broadly inform efforts to enhance student engagement. This project is further characterized by the formation Engaged Design Learning Institute (EDLI), where we will enroll a cross-institutional cohort of 8-10 capstone instructors to support them in their design instruction and to develop contextually relevant insight on how the research findings may be applied by educators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Failures of such goal-directed decision-making can result in an array of maladaptive behaviors, such as financial risk taking, drug abuse, or gambling. While past research has helped identify the drivers of goal-directed decisions, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how people are able to reorient those decisions as flexibly as they do, as well as when and why they fail to do so. In a series of studies that combine computational modeling with measures of behavior, attentional focus, and brain activity, we are studying the capacities and limits of human decision-makers to flexibly adjust their information search and actions to different goals and task demands. By uncovering the hidden levers and potential failure modes of goal-directed behavior, our work better disentangles sources of real-world decision-making failures, and provide a path towards targeted interventions to better align choices with long-term goals. <br/><br/>Our project addresses critical gaps in research on the neural and computational mechanisms that link decision-making and cognitive control. Past work on the computational and neural mechanisms of goal-directed decision-making has been singularly focused on a narrow subset of human goals (how people select the best option from a set). It is therefore unknown how people flexibly reconfigure to their wider array of goals ? for instance, selecting under different criteria or accumulating information across options rather than comparing between them ? and when and why they fail to do so. Our project develops and tests a computational framework that accommodates the range of flexibility observed in human decision-making, by representing explicit choice goals that define a) how information is translated into evidence and b) how evidence is then integrated to select responses. We are testing our framework in a series of studies that combine behavioral tasks with eye-tracking, EEG and fMRI. This multi-modal approach allows us to uncover the neural circuits and dynamics that enable people to flexibly transform and integrate information about their options to achieve their current goals, and to understand how and why people vary in these capacities. The project further supports outreach activities aimed at training researchers in computational methods for predicting and testing a wide array of decision-making behavior.<br/><br/>A companion project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A robust and low-cost solution for the estimation of fall risk and detection of falls will allow seniors to live independently and reduce medical costs due to falls.  Wearable devices have been developed to detect ?hard falls?, namely falls that cause injury.   However, many falls in the elderly do not cause physical injury (?soft falls?).  These occur in association with weight transfer activities such as turning and sit-stand transitions.   Indeed, the ability to control the position and movements of the trunk (?core?) is essential for coordinating the movements of the limbs during weight transfer.   The goal of this project is to combine real-world limb-core dynamics of an individual with data collected by accelerometer via a commodity wristwatch and a cell phone on the opposite hip to improve the detection of hard and soft falls.  A personalized fall risk analysis and detection model will be created for each user via real-time learning of the limb-core dynamics using state of the art machine learning algorithm.  We will also assess the perceptions and preferences of elderly patients using this technology and evaluate their attitudes towards continuous data collection and sharing of health data for improved health.  The software system, the real-world gait and weight transfer movement and the associated accelerometer data will be made freely available to any institution, investigator or research student interested in the study of machine learning on health conditions as well as on fall risk and analysis. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in technical skills (machine learning, wearable technologies and data analysis skills) as well as in people skills for working with the elderly who live in long-term care facilities.   <br/><br/>While numerous fall detection devices incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms have been developed, this project focuses on personalizing fall risk detection.   This project will explore the use of kinematic measurements of an elderly individual?s movements associated with weight transfer to enable multi-task and multi-modal machine learning algorithms to personalize fall risk detection.  A small-sample-based deep learning algorithm optimized to incorporate individual kinematic characteristics using multi-task and multi-modal learning frameworks is developed.  Second, the team will analyze the movement transitions captured by the Azure Kinect system in order to identify relationships between the accelerometer data and the complete skeletal frame with an emphasis on the limb-core dynamics.  Specifically, our goal is to determine whether or not Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to augment missing modality from a small amount of body motion data, smartwatch and phone acceleration data collected directly from elderly participants who are at most risk of falling, namely those living in an assisted living center. Finally, we will evaluate the perception and attitudes of the elderly participants towards the continuous use of wearable devices for fall risk analysis and detection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
