However, from pond dabblers to deep-sea divers, duck swimming ability varies considerably among species, and how foot anatomy contributes to this variation has yet to be investigated. This project will quantify duck foot shape by looking at both the skeleton and foot webbing. Then physical models of duck feet will be robotically actuated to directly measure how aspects of foot shape and paddling behavior influence swimming force production. The findings of this study will apply to numerous fields by inspiring designs of industrial, commercial, and robotic paddles (e.g., hydroelectric turbines, boat sails, scuba flippers). Further, by helping explain ecological and evolutionary patterns in birds, our results have the potential to inform conservation initiatives and paleontology research. In addition to the direct impact of these findings, a major goal of this project is to promote diverse future STEM researchers by supporting undergraduate biology students through their first research experience. Funding from this project will establish a professional development program (PDP) for 10 undergraduates per year. Each annual PDP will meet weekly over the summer of the first research experience and during the subsequent fall semester to build a supportive community for students while providing workshops that develop advantageous skills for future graduate studies or science careers.<br/><br/>More specifically, the first half of this project aims to identify evolutionary patterns in duck foot shape by measuring bone dimensions and toe splay broadly across duck species. Undergraduate students will analyze foot bones using CT-scans of duck specimens, including a visit to the Natural History Museums of LA County to choose specimens and learn about museum collections. Foot bone data will be coupled with shape analysis of webbed feet through photography and 3D scanning of collected specimens. Together, these morphological data will provide the basis for phylogenetic analyses to identify evolutionary patterns among species. The second half of this project aims to directly relate anatomical variation in foot shape to swimming performance. Informed from the measurements in the first section, students will construct 2D and 3D physical models of duck feet that vary in shape. These models will be robotically-actuated in a water flume while directly measuring hydrodynamic forces using force sensors and visualizing flow patterns using Particle Image Velocimetry. The project will initiate a productive collaboration capable of extending investigation into webbing material properties, complex paddling kinematics, and webbed foot diversity among non-bird paddling animals (e.g., frogs, aquatic mammals). The results will reveal a critical component of avian evolutionary history and provide a crucial framework for analyzing fossils of extinct dinosaur and bird species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop a novel plasma-electrochemical approach for steel manufacturing that eliminates the need for carbon-based reducing agents and fuels. By leveraging renewable electricity to drive the reduction of iron ore to metallic iron, this process has the potential to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of steel production, which currently accounts for 20% of all industrial CO2 emissions. The project integrates fundamental research on high-temperature plasma-electrochemical reactions with techno-economic and life-cycle analyses to assess the viability and environmental benefits of this transformative technology. The educational component of the project focuses on curriculum development in plasma manufacturing, a multi-disciplinary student project to assess the economic and environmental impacts of various decarbonization routes for steel manufacturing, and outreach to the steel manufacturing industry. The project's educational initiatives will prepare a diverse cohort of students and future leaders to tackle the challenges of industrial decarbonization and drive the transition to a sustainable manufacturing future.<br/><br/>The research plan comprises three core activities: 1) Establishing reactor design principles by fabricating a lab-scale prototype and studying the impacts of operating parameters on iron production rate and efficiency; 2) Elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of iron oxide reduction and oxygen evolution at the plasma-electrolyte interface using a variety of characterization techniques and multiphysics modeling; 3) Quantifying the techno-economic and environmental benefits of the proposed technology via life-cycle and cost analyses benchmarked against state-of-the-art steel manufacturing processes. By integrating research and educational activities, this project will generate fundamental knowledge and engineering design principles for a new approach to decarbonizing steel manufacturing. The insights gained will lay the foundation for sustainable steel production and advance the broader field of high-temperature plasma-electrochemical processing for energy-efficient, environmentally benign manufacturing of critical materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental chemistry knowledge to be gained from this research is expected to have broad impact in three different hydrogel technologies that benefit society: (i) controlled release of pharmaceuticals from hydrogels for chemotherapy; (ii) controlled release of cell growth factors for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and (iii) Controlled release of nutrients to maintain healthy biofilm factories for industrial-scale, cell-based manufacturing of commodity chemicals and fuels. There is also a complementary project to update the free internet workbook Organic Structure Elucidation: A Workbook of Unknowns which is used around the world by many instructors and students, especially those located in under-resourced educational environments. All activities will be conducted by a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students who will be trained in experimental research at the interface of nanoscience, supramolecular chemistry, and macromolecular chemistry. <br/><br/>The research aims to gain a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of multivalent binding versus monovalent binding. This fundamental knowledge will be used to develop a generalizable, controlled-release platform that is based on a trivalent loader molecule with high affinity for the hydrogel interior. After hydrogel loading, the loader molecule will undergo a fragmentation process that simultaneously releases molecular payload and produces waste molecules that have weak hydrogel affinity and are readily displaced upon reloading with fresh loader molecule. A versatile synthetic method will enable the structure of the molecular payload on the loader molecule to be varied by a late-stage chemical reaction. The broad project goal is to demonstrate three sets of conceptually important thermodynamic and kinetic performance features, and this will be done by conducting experiments that measure the rate and extent of payload loading and release from hydrogels. The work will assess the impact of multivalency on the efficiency of hydrogel loading and release over multiple cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polypeptoid BCPs are structural mimics of naturally occurring polypeptides or macromolecules that contain chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.  A unique feature of polypeptoid BCPs is that they lack extensive hydrogen bonding along the polymer backbone, making them soluble in many common solvents and amenable to thermal processing like conventional thermoplastics.  As a result, they are very attractive materials for a wide range of biotechnological applications.  In this project, systematic studies will be performed to understand how the structure of polypeptoid BCPs changes in solution as a function of the number and position of charged monomers in the polymer chain, as well as chemical identity of ionic monomers.  If successful, this research could lead to new design rules and reliable protocols in producing polypeptoid-based nanostructures with controlled dimension and internal structure.  This project will provide an excellent interdisciplinary training environment for student researchers at all levels.  Participants will gain experience in areas ranging from polymer synthesis, solid phase synthesis, to structural characterization of polymer solutions using microscopic and scattering methods.  The research team will continue participating in ChemDemo program at Louisiana State University by developing new demo kits focused on introducing polymer topics to K-12 students.<br/><br/>Charge pattern and charge identity have been increasingly recognized for their significance in modulating the conformation, intra- and intermolecular interactions, phase behavior and biological function of biomacromolecules.  There is comparatively much more limited understanding on how these molecular attributes can be manipulated to control the structure and interactions of non-natural polymers. This research will aim to fill this knowledge gap by investigating how charge pattern and chemical identity modulate the aqueous micellar assemblies of ionic polypeptoid block copolymers (BCPs) and the intermicellar interactions from the dilute to the semi-dilute regime.  In Objective 1, polypeptoid BCP with varying charge pattern and chemical identity of ionic monomers (including polymer bound ions and counterions) will be designed and synthesized.  Objective 2 will systematically study the roles of charge pattern in modulating the structural evolution of aqueous micellar assembly of these polypeptoid BCPs.  Lastly, in Objective 3, the roles of chemical identity of ionic monomers including polymer bound ions and counterions in modulating the structural evolution of micellar structure of polypeptoid BCP from dilute to semi-dilute concentration regime will be investigated.  This project has the potential to yield significant outcomes that will be of interest to the broad scientific community that studies solution polymer assembly, sequence-defined polymers, soft colloids, and biomimetic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a fundamental challenge for medical applications, not only for diagnostics but also for research in biology and medicine, with potential daily benefits to our society. Image quality is hindered by complex physical effects arising when light propagates in the sample, however, high resolution is achievable by combining subtle techniques involving state-of-the-art experimental systems, mathematical modeling, and computations. This project will introduce new methods for imaging that both improve on existing strategies and are successful in regimes where current approaches fail. In addition, interdisciplinary training at the intersection of mathematics, physics, engineering, and computational sciences will be offered to the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The project consists of four related research directions. The first concerns the asymptotic characterization of the speckle, which is the fully randomized part of the wavefield, and of the aberrations, which are random phases distorting the wavefront. Both are essential for the design of efficient imaging methods, and the approach will be based on asymptotics of random partial differential equations and probabilistic techniques. The second project is related to the field of adaptive optics, consisting in estimating the aberrations for wavefront correction. The goal is to develop new correction algorithms based on the so-called distortion operator method, which is an original approach recently developed by physicists. The objectives of the third project are to investigate novel ideas for speckle imaging for which standard methods break down. Blind source separation techniques which only require a minimal number of measurements will be used to address this challenge. The fourth project will leverage the potential of machine learning to develop new imaging algorithms and test them against state-of-the-art methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular importance are shapes that are ""optimal"" under natural constraints. An important class of optimal shapes is given by ""minimal surfaces"": a soap film spanning a metal wire, which tends to minimize its energy, is an example of minimal surface. This type of surfaces appears in many places in physics, but is also of intrinsic interest. The investigator will work on deforming smooth spaces, also called ""manifolds"", into an optimal shape by using the concept of minimal surfaces. Manifolds are ubiquitous in mathematics, and hopefully this approach will give new insights on their possible shapes. This project will moreover support student training and inclusion through seminars, workshops and knowledge dissemination efforts. <br/><br/><br/>The notion of ""geometric structure"" serves as a unifying concept in geometry and topology, as exemplified by the Uniformization theorem for surfaces and the Geometrization theorem for 3-manifolds. In those classical instances, geometric structures are essentially defined as homogenous spaces with a geometric discrete group action. In higher dimensions, those geometric structures are very rare, and perhaps too rigid compared to the diversity of closed manifolds. In this project, the investigator proposes to consider a more general and flexible notion: minimal surfaces in (possibly infinite dimensional) homogeneous spaces, invariant under a geometric discrete group action. With this point of view, the investigator will explore a series of questions which relates minimal surfaces to geometric group theory and representation theory. A typical problem is the following: what group can act geometrically on a connected minimal surface in a Hilbert sphere?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such societal applications rely on cellular connectivity, and impose stringent bandwidth, latency, and scalability requirements on the cellular infrastructure. Current network infrastructure?s inability to meet these requirements has been a key impediment for realizing these applications effectively. Next generation (5G/6G) cellular standards promise to meet these requirements, but the mechanisms for delivering this promise are yet to be worked out. The proposed research will develop techniques that will aid in fulfilling this promise, with the end goal of enabling such emerging societal applications. The proposed research will also contribute to education by engaging students at different levels to assist with the research activities, and curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels. All code and teaching materials developed as part of this proposal will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>The proposal will build upon the notion of radio access network (RAN) slicing, a new feature in 5G cellular standards, defined to meet the above requirements. With RAN slicing, each slice (composed of a group of users) enters into service-level agreements (SLAs) with the network operator who divides radio resources among slices so as to achieve efficient spectrum usage, meet the SLAs, and allow each slice to customize how their share of resources are allocated to their users. Current proposals for RAN slicing adopt a two-staged approach where the network operators first divide their radio resources among slices, and slice operators then divide their share of resources among their users. However, such a two-staged approach ignores the inherent inter-dependencies between the network operator?s inter-slice resource allocation decisions and the slice operator?s intra-slice policies, which results in inefficient spectrum usage and lower user throughput. This proposal puts forward a new approach to RAN slicing that explicitly embraces these inter-dependencies, allowing the inter-slice and intra-slice resource allocation decisions to feed into one another, so as to better meet the network-wide objective of efficient spectrum usage, as well as the customizable objectives of individual slices. To that end, the proposed research will break its efforts along the following dimensions: (1) new network-wide (inter-slice) resource allocation mechanisms that are informed by intra-slice policies, (2) new intra-slice resource allocation mechanisms, driven by the requirements of emerging applications, that inform the network-wide mechanisms, and (3) an end-to-end system that brings together the above mechanisms, tackling practical challenges around timely decision-making at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This region, known as the ionosphere, plays a crucial role in mediating the transfer of energy from the Sun to the Earth.  It is a region where small-scale plasma irregularities occur that disrupt radio-frequency transmissions and degrade satellite-based navigation systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS). Progress on understanding how these irregularities form has been hampered by a lack of observing techniques that provide a time-dependent, multi-scale view of the ionosphere.  Citizen scientists offer a novel and impactful solution.  GPS measurements on the new generation of smartphones can provide a measure of the total integrated plasma density between the satellite transmitter and the phone, a parameter referred to as `Total Electron Content' or TEC.  When TEC is measured along many paths simultaneously, it becomes possible to construct a high-resolution image of the ionosphere, with resolution limited only by the number and location of receivers.  This project seeks to provide proof-of-concept for an adaptive ionospheric sensing network formed by groups of citizen scientists. Such a human-powered observatory concept could revolutionize ionospheric science and cultivate strong connections with the public who may know little about our near-space environment and its effects on everyday technologies.<br/><br/>This project will enlist citizen scientists with dual-frequency smartphones to help address one of the great overarching questions in ionospheric science:   How do macro-scale Geospace dynamics lead to the micro-scale density irregularities that disrupt radio-frequency signals?   The latest dual-frequency, multi-constellation smartphones have been shown to provide a scientifically useful measure of carrier-phase TEC.  The rapid proliferation of these phones has moved this concept to a critical transition where we may now consider deploying networks of smartphone-wielding citizens as an augmentation to TEC maps derived from permanent reference receiver networks. The project explores an innovative idea to develop an adaptive ionospheric observatory formed by networks of citizen scientists, cued to a particular location in space and time based on forecasts (e.g., an eclipse, a geomagnetic storm, weather patterns) or now-casts (geological activity, STEVE events).   The one-year project seeks to provide a proof-of-concept for a distributed smartphone observatory through some observational efforts centered on specific cases like solar eclipse, and dynamical auroral events. This project will bring a multitude of positive impacts to the Geospace discipline, including (1) introducing the ionosphere to a cross-section of citizens, which promotes solar and Geospace physics; (2) leveraging the remarkable sensing, computation, and networking capabilities of smartphones for Geospace research, and (3) training of a female Ph.D. student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, AI artists can create an artistic image of a person when given the person's photograph as input. AI-based medical services can look at a patient's X-ray imagery and diagnose a disease. Smart glasses equipped with AI can detect obstacles or hazards to aid the visually impaired. However, these AI-based services may pose risks when the input contains privacy-sensitive information. For example, an AI-based service might learn a user's location by looking at the background of the photo or infer personal characteristics from their X-ray images. This project will develop methods that reduce such privacy risks while still allowing users to enjoy high-quality AI-based services. A key goal is to create methods that include mathematical guarantees, so that the protection is not only safe against existing attacks but robust to potential future attacks. This, in turn, will pave the way for justified trust in image-based systems by both end-users and service providers, even in privacy-critical domains like health, law, and national defense.<br/><br/>This project will study how to create an encoding or an embedding (a noisy latent representation of the input), from which a useful downstream task can still be performed, but specified private information of the original input cannot be extracted. The core idea is to use Metric Differential Privacy (Metric DP) in a pixel space to provide a strong privacy guarantee while designing the end-to-end system to maintain high downstream utility. Focusing on image-based applications, the project will address three main research challenges: (1) designing encodings with Metric DP -- simultaneously designing methods to generate privacy-preserving encodings and provide tight privacy guarantees; (2) improving the utility -- developing methods to improve the quality of the model when using privacy-preserving encodings; and (3) designing the overarching system -- improving the end-to-end user experience by developing systematic optimizations like caching and post-processing of the model output. These research directions will be evaluated by a new dataset developed as part of this project, which will be open to the research community and expedite future research efforts on this topic. The project outcome will directly affect closely related fields, such as instance encoding, split learning, and vertical federated learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE) award is made in response to Dear Colleague Letter 23-109, as part of the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative. Rare-earth elements (REEs) are essential components of emergent energy technologies that are key to the development of a sustainable energy future. Projections developed for REEs critical to the clean energy sector indicate that in the absence of efficient reuse pathways, demand is on target to outpace supply within the foreseeable future. Urban mining of REE-rich end-of-life products is a promising alternative to traditional energy-intensive mining of geological deposits. However, the costs and environmental impacts associated with re-separating and processing these materials are also substantial. This research targets an unexplored high-temperature pathway to REE recovery that may form the basis for new separation technologies with the potential to alleviate domestic supply risks and environmental concerns while enabling more circular manufacturing practices within the clean energy sector. Moreover, as clean energy technologies reduce carbon output due to hydrocarbon use, and as recycling of these metals also has a significantly lower carbon footprint than traditional mining, these efforts may further benefit society by reducing carbon emissions related to REE production and traditional energy strategies. This research will also promote awareness of critical minerals, their properties, and importance to clean energy technologies amongst the broader public through the development of an undergraduate and graduate curriculum and an interactive museum display.<br/><br/>With the recent discovery of high-temperature REE-sulfate liquids, and the growing demand for alternative REE extraction and separation technologies, there is an urgent need to assess the potential for high-temperature liquid-liquid phase equilibria to provide viable alternative routes to REE recovery from complex mixtures. Moreover, as these dense liquid phases are composed of only inorganic ionic species and water, the solutions in which they form also represent a unique class of high-temperature aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) whose basic physical and chemical properties remain uncharacterized. This research aims to provide new insights into the physicochemical processes that promote the self-concentration of REEs within high-temperature ATPSs and to investigate the properties of the resulting REE-rich dense liquids that influence their formation kinetics, thermodynamic stabilities, and potential for recovery. The formation of REE-sulfate liquids will be observed in high-pressure optical cells over a range of temperatures, pressures, and solution compositions. Further characterization of the dense liquids by synchrotron-based X-ray techniques will provide information about the local structure and REE content of the sulfate liquids as they form, and structure modeling will be employed to generate atomistic models of the liquid phases that are consistent with the resulting datasets. The interfacial tension of the liquid-liquid interfaces will be measured by a droplet deformation method within a custom-made microfluidic device that will also facilitate separation of the dense and dilute liquid phases and the recovery of REEs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's novelties are developing new, realistic privacy measures and devising strategies to protect against subtle but potentially devastating breaches. This effort is crucial as federated learning becomes increasingly popular in healthcare, finance, and public services, where privacy is paramount. The project's broader significance and importance are in its potential to protect data privacy in these critical fields, thus fostering a safer environment for knowledge sharing and collaboration. <br/><br/>The project addresses two weak links of federated learning, namely, improper definitions of visual privacy and reconstruction attacks from honest-but-curious clients.

AMP algorithms are known to offer optimal solutions in certain situations and are well-understood theoretically under certain asymptotic assumptions, notably when it is assumed that the number of data samples approaches infinity. However, practical settings often operate under a very limited number of known data samples such that asymptotic knowledge no longer applies. Indeed, contemporary data-science applications often call for the ability to extract actionable information from datasets of limited size. AMP algorithms commonly serve as fast-convergent and statistically efficient estimators and can be employed as powerful theoretical machinery to study other statistical procedures in high dimension. However, the asymptotic nature of most of the existing AMP theory limits the capability of fully characterizing the convergence behavior of these algorithms in real-world settings. Accordingly, this project aims to develop a new, non-asymptotic statistical foundation for AMP that allows one to predict its finite-sample dynamics in a fine-grained manner.  Broader-impact aspects of the work lie in its potential to substantially enrich the statistical and algorithmic foundations for information processing and machine learning in data-hungry applications and to contribute significantly to various science and engineering applications such as optimal imaging, social-network analysis, single-cell data analysis, and generative modeling. The investigator also plans to create new courses, develop tutorials and short courses in high-profile conferences and workshops, and organize corresponding materials into a monograph.<br/> <br/>The technical activities aim to significantly advance the foundation of AMP by developing a versatile non-asymptotic framework capable of handling a polynomial number of AMP iterations in the most-challenging, sample-limited regime. To achieve this goal, the research program will leverage insights and techniques from various fields, including high-dimensional statistics, statistical signal processing, information theory, convex geometry, random-matrix theory, and statistical physics. To facilitate specific investigations and discussions, the project revolves around several stylized problems, subsuming as special cases structured linear models, spiked low-rank models, tensor learning, and diffusion generative models, among others. It is anticipated that this project will contribute novel insights into this foundational area from both theoretical and algorithmic perspectives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improved graduate education systems are one way to increase the degree completion of graduate engineering students. About half of engineering graduate students do not complete their degree. Students leave graduate degree programs for many reasons including conflict with faculty or peers, financial or academic difficulties, or family concerns. Additionally, well-paying industry positions in many sectors of engineering also provide attractive alternatives to continued education. However, some students who leave would have preferred to complete their degree. These partially trained graduate students represent a missed opportunity for future innovation and development. Changing research labs during doctoral study is one avenue doctoral students use to resolve serious conflicts. The research will measure how often students change research labs and identify obstacles, processes, and solutions needed in the graduate education systems to support students in addressing academic, personal, or social reasons for changing research labs. The research will inform strategic recommendations to improve engineering graduate education systems to facilitate students changing research labs as an opportunity to retain skilled and partially trained students.<br/><br/>Engineering education requires creative solutions to the continued attrition of talented and well-qualified doctoral students who choose to leave without a doctoral degree. Over 70% of engineering doctoral students consider departing their programs and many, 40-60%, leave due to conflict with advisors and peers, financial or academic difficulties, and personal or family concerns. Some students choose to remain in doctoral engineering by changing their research lab or advisor, program, or university. In a recent preliminary survey, 60% of doctoral engineering students seriously considered changing or had changed research labs or universities during their doctoral training. Lab change provides the opportunity to retain partially trained and qualified engineering doctoral students. However, the costs for the individual, programmatic barriers, and advisor conflicts complicate changing labs. The research will describe and contextualize the lived experience of changing research labs during doctoral engineering training through quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. First, longitudinal data from a new survey will capture the frequency, predictors, and career outcomes of lab change. The second phase will use qualitative data from students planning, who are currently or have recently changed research labs or universities during doctoral engineering studies. A third phase will combine longitudinal quantitative data (Phase 1) with the qualitative interview data (Phase 2) to construct timelines for mixed-methods analysis of the process of changing research labs.<br/><br/>Increased persistence of students with the experience, knowledge, and interest to be admitted for doctoral education impacts the industries and communities they participate in post-graduation. In particular, the persistence of underrepresented groups represents an opportunity to profoundly impact marginalized communities through the socioeconomic benefits of advanced engineering training and attention to marginalized research questions unasked by current engineers. Marginalized groups are focused on due to the disproportionately higher attrition rates. Findings from this research will be developed into proposed guidelines and considerations for lab-change policies to be adapted and integrated into existing department and college policies. <br/><br/>The research will advance knowledge about why, how, when, and who changes research labs during engineering doctoral education. Outcomes include the identification of considerations to retain students in graduate study while addressing their academic, personal, or social needs that require changing research labs.

This important and often overlooked question was brought to light by the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Several techniques have been used to account for silent spreaders along with varying testing and healthcare seeking habits as the main reasons for under-reporting of incidence cases. It has been observed that silent spreaders play a more significant role in disease progression than previously understood, highlighting the need for policymakers to incorporate these hidden figures into their strategic responses. Unlike other disease parameters, i.e., incubation and recovery rates, the case reporting rate and the time-dependent effective reproduction number are directly influenced by a large number of factors making it impossible to directly quantify these parameters in any meaningful way. This project will advance iteratively regularized numerical algorithms, which have emerged as a powerful tool for reliable estimation (from noise-contaminated data) of infectious disease parameters that are crucial for future projections, prevention, and control. Apart from epidemiology, the project will benefit all real-world applications involving massive amounts of observation data for multiple stages of the inversion process with a shared model parameter. In the course of their theoretical and numerical studies, the PIs will continue to create research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including women and students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. A number of project topics are particularly suitable for student research and will be used to train some of the next generation of computational mathematicians.<br/><br/>In the framework of this project, the PIs will develop new regularized alternating minimization algorithms for solving ill-posed parameter-estimation problems constrained by nonlinear dynamics.

However, scientific studies show that these materials can be easily damaged during the manufacturing process for applications. In this project, the PI will investigate the underlying reasons why these ultrathin semiconductors and quantum materials degrade when exposed to commonly found manufacturing environments (air and other gases). Building on this, this research project aims to find effective ways to protect these surfaces from the environment by decorating various organic chemicals on their surfaces. In addition, the project will explore how the electronic and chemical behavior of the surface changes after being engineered with these chemicals. The educational portion of the research will engage high school students through the 'World of Quantum Materials' program.  Also, the PI will provide research opportunities designed to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The research project will focus on the degradation kinetics of emerging halide and telluride-containing quantum materials and effective ways to improve their stability using innovative surface chemistry techniques. The testbed material systems will include technologically relevant yet environmentally sensitive halide and telluride-based quantum materials, including recently discovered two-dimensional magnets. The primary scientific problem will center around understanding the kinetics and rate-determining steps of degradation processes within these materials. To achieve this, advanced in-situ spectroscopy and microscopy techniques will be employed, ranging from bulk to monolayer levels, and under various light exposure and gaseous/liquid environments. With the knowledge gained from the degradation mechanisms, the project will establish aryl salt, maleimide click-chemistry, and carboxyl acid chemical functionalization methods to improve material stability. Comprehensive adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies will aim to refine surface chemical reactions and chemical processes to achieve designer functionalization with minute consistency and repeatability. Lastly, comprehensive in-situ and ex-situ characterization studies will be carried out to assess the quantum properties of the functionalized materials within the 3D to 2D limit, and to understand the impact of the amount of functionalization (areal coverage) and thickness. The successful outcome of this project will introduce novel chemical approaches to enhance material stability without compromising the unique properties and possibly discovering new ones. The educational activities will emphasize K9-12 education through the 'World of Quantum Materials' program, and undergraduate, master?s and Ph.D. level higher education with a focus on diversity and inclusivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will introduce new tools for studying manifolds, which are central objects in mathematics and physics, and will shed light on some basic unanswered questions about manifolds while simultaneously building bridges between topology and logic. Beyond the scientific investigation and attendant international collaborations, the PI will continue to promote access to education. Activities include organizing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) both in the United States and in Vietnam, with the goal of attracting global talent to US educational institutions and fostering academic pipelines between Vietnam and the US. The PI will also write a textbook making geometric group theory accessible to a wider range of students. <br/><br/>The PI's research involves synthesizing ideas from model theory and applying them to the theory of groups acting on compact manifolds. This work builds on a theory of critical regularity of group actions in one dimension, as developed by the PI and Kim, and on more recent results about first order rigidity of homeomorphism groups of manifolds. One motivating goal is to prove the existence of finitely generated groups with prescribed critical regularities for compact manifolds of dimension two and higher. The methods to be applied here are two-fold: one is dynamical, concerning smooth group actions on manifolds, which has for example been successfully applied to finding groups of critical regularity 1 acting on compact two-manifolds. The second is to understand the interplay between mathematical logic and homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds, in particular the expressivity of first order logic in homeomorphism and diffeomorphism groups, and in countable groups that are elementarily equivalent to homeomorphism and diffeomorphism groups of manifolds. Potential payoffs include examples of torsion-free countable groups that cannot act on given compact manifolds, insight into the smooth Poincare conjecture, and potentially a proof that Gromov random groups cannot act nontrivially on compact manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is annually organized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (SIGSPATIAL), which is an association for researchers, students, and professionals interested in research, development, and deployment of solutions to spatial information handling and spatial knowledge extraction problems. The conference started in 1993, has established itself as the world's premier research conference in spatial computing, spatial data, and GIS. It provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of GIS ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to storage management and indexing issues. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, a student research competition, a data competition, and demos. The importance of spatial information handling continuously increases with new application domains and the availability and ubiquity of large spatial data such as maps, remote-sensing images, 3D medical atlases, and the decennial census. Businesses, industry, academia, and governmental agencies utilize spatial information to improve their daily operations, structure new strategies, and increase overall productivity and US competitiveness.<br/><br/>Spatial data and applications pose novel research challenges in a wide variety of sub-areas, including (but not limited to) spatial information acquisition, modeling, data structures, and algorithms, analysis, querying and integration, human-computer interaction and visualization, and systems and architectures. From these sub-areas, deep research questions emerge that are motivated by a broad range of applications (e.g., emergency and crisis management, environmental monitoring, global positioning and location detection, geosciences, location-based and mobile services, navigation, and route planning). ACM SIGPATIAL GIS provides a forum for this research, including presentations of accepted technical papers, poster and demo exhibition encouraging lively interaction among all participants, and presentations by leading related industry members. The participation of U.S. graduate and promising undergraduate students will result in the intellectual stimulation of young minds to pursue advanced research and development activities in an area that has a huge technical and societal impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Small cetaceans such as dolphins can be locally abundant and due to their fast metabolism, they rely on predictable sources of food. They are also prey for a range of predators such as sharks, particularly in tropical ecosystems, and are vulnerable to habitat degradation and disturbances from vessel traffic. However, the factors behind how marine predators such as dolphins use their habitat, such as where to find food, safe places to rest, and to socialize, are not well understood. This information will be useful for predicting how they may respond to climate change or to human impacts, such as pollution, overfishing, or boating activity. The goal of this project is to assess how environmental factors affect the behavior and habitat use of marine predators, using coastal dolphins as model organisms. The factors measured will be food availability, predation risk, and boating activity relative to observed dolphin behaviors. The results from this project will help us to better understand and predict how vulnerable marine predators respond to long-term habitat degradation in coastal marine ecosystems.<br/><br/>Little is known about the impacts of urbanization on coastal marine mammals, both directly and indirectly, through changes in prey dynamics and predation risk, or anthropogenic disturbances that can be perceived similarly as predation risk. This project will investigate how variation in anthropogenic and natural drivers are influencing foraging and habitat use decisions of a model upper trophic level predator (bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus) in a highly urbanized coastal environment. The study will use behavioral ecological theory to test predictions about how dolphins should respond to spatiotemporal variation in prey abundance and predation risk that are likely being modified by human activities in the study area. The study will also investigate whether human disturbance (i.e. boat traffic) results in changes in dolphin behavior that are consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis. The methods used in this project will be to: 1) conduct an assessment of prey landscapes along a gradient of human pressure using novel eDNA sampling techniques and baited remote underwater videos (BRUV?s), 2) use active acoustics and video imaging to map benthic habitats, and 3) integrate data on dolphin behavior, boat traffic, prey, and predation risk to test a priori hypotheses of dolphin habitat use and behavior. This interdisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive method of examining habitat use and behavior of elusive marine predators in highly impacted systems. Anticipated results of this study will not only advance the capacity to predict changes in movement, habitat use, and behavior of coastal marine predators in other similar urbanized waterways, but it will also allow us to make future predictions on the viability of populations or population segments exposed to different levels of human impacts and provide important information for stock assessment and management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the prior research treated electrons in these materials as noninteracting particles. However, under certain conditions, electrons may strongly interact with their counterparts, holes, which are vacancies of electrons. In this case, quasiparticles made of electron and hole pairs, which are often referred to as excitons, may form a quantum state with exotic properties such as transport without energy dissipation. Topological excitons may provide new and exciting paradigm of exploiting excitons instead of electrons for higher temperature quantum computing. This project focuses on understanding excitons in topological materials, which is based on the principal investigator?s recent results of fast and long-distance transport of photogenerated charge carriers in topological insulators at low temperatures. The project uses innovative experimental techniques including spatially, temporally, and spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements, to offer key insights for fundamental understanding of the nature of topological excitons. This project also provides opportunities for educating and training undergraduate and graduate students in the critical areas of quantum and spintronic devices, nanodevice fabrication, and topological materials.<br/><br/>Technical Description: <br/>Excitons formed at topological surface states can be protected against back-scattering and enjoy robust spin-polarization, providing a truly promising route to quantum devices and spintronic applications. Although single-particle physics has been extensively investigated, much less work has been carried out to understand excitons in these materials. Recent experimental studies of single-crystalline Sb-doped Bi2Se3 nanoribbons conducted by the principal investigator have revealed fast relaxation and ballistic transport of photogenerated carriers, strongly suggesting a possibility of highly dissipationless transport of photogenerated charge carriers in topological insulators. This project aims to uncover properties of the photogenerated excitons such as their velocity, lifetime, spin, and effects of magnetic field. Spatially resolved ultrafast pump-probe photocurrent measurements are used to determine the relaxation time and propagation velocity of excitons. Spatially resolved helicity-dependent photocurrent measurements in the visible and mid-infrared range are performed to better understand the exciton spin polarization and the momentum coupling properties at the surface. Optically modulated magnetoresistance measurements are carried out to understand the effect of magnetic field on exciton transport. This project helps graduate and undergrad students to acquire skills and knowledge to pursue research and development in the field of novel materials and quantum technologies in collaboration with industrial partners. The broader impact activities of the project are also integrated into the Cal-Bridge and American Physical Society Bridge programs, dedicated to mentoring underrepresented minority students, toward advanced degrees in physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knot theory is an important sub-field of topology where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, for example, knotted pieces of strings inside the three-dimensional space that we live in. Knot theory is useful for a variety of applications, such as for studying DNA knotting, analyzing orbits in magnetic fields, or creating new data encryption schemes. One of the fundamental problems in knot theory is to study if a knot can be transformed into another without tearing or crossing itself; knot invariants are mathematical objects (such as numbers or groups) which one associates to knots which remain unchanged during such a transformation, and are therefore, widely used in knot theory. Occasionally, one imposes additional restrictions on the knots---if one imagines a knot to be a path traced out by a particle moving in the three-dimensional space, then these restrict the velocity of the particle depending on its position. Knots with such restrictions are called Legendrian knots, and these have many real-world applications as well, such as motion planning for robotics. The current topology project will focus on knot theory, and will create new knot and Legendrian knot invariants based on existing ones. Broader impacts of the project are through workshop organization, graduate student mentoring, undergraduate research, high school outreach, and the writing of a textbook for Directed Reading Programs.<br/><br/>This project will concentrate on three families of modern knot and Legendrian knot invariants: Khovanov homology, knot Floer homology, and Legendrian contact homology. These invariants are all of the homological type, that is, they take the form of chain complexes whose chain homotopy types are (Legendrian) knot invariants. The project will construct and study spectrifications of these theories, which are cellular spaces whose cellular chain complex is the original chain complex, and whose stable homotopy type is also a (Legendrian) knot invariant. For the three families of invariants, three specific goals of the project are: to study the behavior of the odd Khovanov spectrum invariant under disjoint union, to prove that the knot Floer spectrum is a knot invariant, and to construct new Legendrian contact spectrum generalizing Legendrian contact homology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often this quantum-ness becomes hidden in their macroscopic aspect, but with care it can be revealed by modern techniques and harnessed to produce novel functionalities. This project focuses on the observation and manipulation of ""excitations"", which are particle or wave-like disturbances that move within a quantum material and can carry energy, charge, or information with them. The way in which these excitations are created, move, and interact reveal fundamental physics of the quantum world.

The goal of this project is advance the theoretical understanding of the dynamics of excitations in exotic quantum states, by developing new theoretical models and techniques, with applications to specific quantum materials of particular interest.<br/><br/>The research is divided into three thrusts.

The composition of fossil coral skeletons provides records of past environmental change which are used to understand drivers of past climate variability and contextualize modern climate change. The most common sources of such records target the geochemical composition of the mineral that corals produce. For example, measurements of Sr/Ca in coral skeletons allow us to reconstruct past temperature because Sr substitutes for Ca in the coral skeleton?s mineral aragonite lattice in a temperature-dependent manner. However, the mineral aragonite is not the only phase that exists in coral skeletons. For decades, it has been known that coral aragonite contains ~1% by weight of water. While this water has been investigated for its potential to trap samples of ancient seawater, the water has never been visualized in situ in the coral skeleton. The gap in our understanding of how and where coral skeletons archive water limits the ability to leverage the presence of water in corals as a paleoclimate archive. This research will create 2D and 3D maps of water in lab-grown coral skeletons using nanoscale imaging techniques. Proposed experiments will also fingerprint the origin of water in coral skeletons and test the ability of coral skeletons to retain water after the skeleton is formed. Ultimately, this work could open the door to using water in coral skeletons as an archive of past seawater conditions, helping to develop better models/forecasts and conservation efforts for coral reefs. The work will also support an early career scientist, transitioning to mid-career, at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. The project will provide opportunities for at least ten St. Olaf College undergraduate students from a range of STEM disciplines to engage in sustained research with mentorship designed to support underrepresented groups in STEM. Additionally, the PI will co-create a science communication conference for academic and non-academic participants with St. Olaf?s public-facing Institute for Freedom and Community. <br/><br/>Water in coral skeletons has been investigated for its paleoproxy potential, implicated as a facilitator of diagenetic transformations, and linked to the presence of ?vital effects? (i.e. geochemical patterns in coral aragonite that differ from those expected for inorganic aragonite). At present, however, the scientific community lacks knowledge about where this water exists and its origin. Specifically, water has never yet been visualized in coral skeletons and its exact origin and form is not confidently known. This project seeks to improve the understanding of water?s distribution and origin in coral skeletons by creating 2D and 3D maps of the distribution of water in cultured cold-water corals (Balanophyllia elegans) grown in deuterated water using Nanoscale Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT), respectively. Given concerns about contamination with ambient water, the analysis of corals cultured in deuterated water will ensure that these analyses identify water incorporated into the coral skeleton during growth, and not water introduced by contamination during sample preparation. Additionally, this work will test the ability of corals to retain intra-skeletal water incorporated at the time of calcification using deuterium isotope immersion experiments with natural corals that will subsequently be analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These analyses will help determine whether the isotopic composition of water in the sample (whether it is free or bound to organics) has been overprinted during the immersion process. Finally, the proposed work will test if coral water records coral metabolism, seawater properties, or a combination of both. Specifically, this work will produce cultured corals grown in solutions bubbled with Ar gas having different isotopic compositions in order to ground-truth whether coral skeletons record dissolved noble gasses in seawater. It will also produce cultured samples fed with deuterium-labeled food in order to explore the impact of coral metabolism on the isotopic composition of water measured in the coral skeletons. If the proposed work shows that water in corals can be used as an archive of seawater isotopic composition, coral metabolism, and/or noble gasses, it could lead to big-picture impacts such as improving our understanding of hydrological variability through new records of seawater ?18O or the response of coral metabolism to thermal stress and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Masson will also use this model to identify guest molecules that are most likely to react with each other inside the host molecules. The host molecules will thus become miniature vessels that will catalyze these reactions. The project will expose students to core theoretical organic chemistry concepts, to synthetic chemistry especially with the preparation of new basket-shaped hosts, to molecular modeling, and to analytical chemistry techniques. Masson will also engage in domestic and international collaborative programs that he spearheaded in Spain, France, Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as outreach activities at English-French bilingual high schools in the US. <br/><br/>The chosen hosts will be Cucurbiturils, a family of hollow, pumpkin-shaped molecules that can tightly encapsulate guest molecules; and tailor-made molecules resembling empty baskets.  To quantify intermolecular interactions, the Masson team will mimic host molecules with hard-sphere fluids of low polarity. The unique advantage of this model is that it does not invoke the host structure explicitly. The only required input is the volume of the guest, and its free energy of solvation in both water and the low polarity solvent; both solvation energies will be calculated rapidly. The scope and limitations of this model will be thoroughly tested as part of Aim 1. In Aim 2, the selectivity and packing predictions from the model will be used to identify suitable reaction partners inside hosts. In Aim 3, a new family of glycoluril-based baskets for neutral and positively charged amphiphilic guest recognition in water will be synthesized.

Radical polymerization is industrially used to produce annually more than 100 million tons of polymers worldwide. However, these polymers are ill-defined and serve as commodities rather than specialty materials. ATRP, discovered by Matyjaszewski, is an advanced radical polymerization technique used to prepare uniform polymers with precisely controlled chain lengths, compositions, and shapes. ATRP is also used to prepare bioconjugates and nanocomposites. Professor Matyjaszewski?s team will develop powerful catalytic systems that can operate with very low Cu-based catalyst concentration (in the range of parts per million). However, the catalysts lose activity due to unavoidable radical termination and must be regenerated by various reducing agents such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or sulfites. This study aims to develop a dual catalytic system in the presence of sub-stoichiometric amounts of co-catalysts. They will be driven by light or other external stimuli such as electrical current or mechanical forces. This should provide a benign pathway to prepare precisely controlled polymers and also expand the range of monomers polymerized under mild conditions with diminished environmental impact. The new dual catalytic system is expected to also depolymerize polymers back to monomers. In addition to the planned scientific activities, this work will have broader impacts through education and outreach. The broader impact plans include training undergraduate and graduate students in polymer science and educating the public about controlled radical polymerization via instructional webpages and videos.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Matyjaszewski research team will explore various organic and inorganic co-catalysts to diminish Cu-catalyst concentration with preserved polymerization control in aqueous media and in open-to-air conditions. This will also facilitate high throughput photoATRP synthesis of bioconjugates in 96-well plates. ATRP is based on a reversible atom transfer process between dormant alkyl halides and growing radicals, catalyzed by redox-active transition metal complexes and now co-catalyzed by reducing agents that will be activated by low energy light (red and near-infrared) and weak tribochemical mechanical forces rather than ultrasound. The compounds used as co-catalysts in Cu-mediated ATRP can act as reducing agents, as supplemental activators and also as reagents enabling oxygen tolerant procedures. The fundamental understanding and optimization of dual and plausibly triple catalytic systems requires a detailed photochemical investigation of kinetics and thermodynamics of the involved reactions using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational methods, followed by complete analyses of the obtained polymers.

The effect of temperature on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the involved reactions will be studied in detail because special emphasis will be placed on the depolymerization of polymethacrylates at temperatures below 200 C and temporarily activated by external stimuli.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen is a key component of national decarbonization plans, and potential benefits are associated with its integration within multiple sectors. For example, in the electric power sector, hydrogen production via electrolysis may help balance fluctuations in variable generation because electrolyzers are controllable loads that can be ramped in response to grid needs. Despite these potential benefits, many open economic, technical, policy, and environmental justice questions remain about hydrogen integration. For instance, there is a tradeoff between using green electricity for grid decarbonization vs. hydrogen production via electrolysis, but the costs, benefits, environmental effects and social impacts of these competing uses are unclear. Policymakers must navigate uncertainty over these tradeoffs, while continuing to shape incentives that enable the hydrogen supply chain as part of a just energy transition. A case in point is given by the implementation of the 45V tax credit for clean hydrogen production in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently released its proposed guidance on the implementation of the 45V tax credit, suggesting that hydrogen producers demonstrate their fulfillment of an ?incrementality? (previously known as ?additionality?) requirement (i.e., that the electricity used to produce hydrogen comes from clean generation that goes online less than 36 months before hydrogen production begins, in order to avoid diverting clean generation away from other uses). However, proving incrementality poses a challenge because electricity does not, in general, travel directly from a generation facility to a particular consumer. At present, it is unclear whether and how incrementality requirements might be demonstrated in the United States. This RAISE project investigates the complex systems interdependencies raised by hydrogen integration with other energy systems and grid infrastructure, and its potential for supporting a just energy transition.<br/><br/>The project develops a framework that integrates energy and transportation systems modeling, policy analysis, environmental justice and stakeholder engagement to assess cost, environmental and social impacts of alternate hydrogen pathways in the Northeastern U.S. This region enjoys several hydrogen-enabling conditions, while facing challenges that may hamper development of its full hydrogen potential. The integrative research approach couples a regional model of the hydrogen supply chain with a model for the joint operations and planning of gas-electric systems with realistic nodal representation. Such spatial resolution is missing in state-of-the-art energy systems models of hydrogen deployment, but necessary to enhance understanding of hydrogen integration into existing energy flow networks. The framework also considers interactions with the transportation system, which are often overlooked in hydrogen system modeling efforts. This feature enables evaluation of the tradeoffs between consuming electricity for electric vehicles vs. hydrogen production, and integration of price feedbacks among energy systems. The models are informed by policies affecting the evolution of gas-electric-transportation sectors and the hydrogen supply chain, and simulate planning and operating decisions in the natural gas, electric power, transportation and hydrogen sectors to quantify the associated cost, environmental and social impacts at a scale suitable for illuminating regional vulnerabilities. In addition, the project develops a novel set of environmental justice indicators that can aid communities, decision-makers, and policymakers in understanding and proactively addressing potentially negative social impacts of transitions to hydrogen. The research is deeply integrated with a robust engagement program involving a range of key stakeholders, including energy companies, non-profit organizations and national laboratories. The research and stakeholder engagement advance the understanding of potential improvements to hydrogen, electric grid, and natural gas policy that could ensure a more efficient, just, and environmentally beneficial hydrogen economy in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In direct ink writing, a material, typically a paste or a viscous ink, is extruded through a fine nozzle or syringe tip onto a substrate according to a computer-controlled path. This manufacturing process is particularly well-suited for materials with high viscosity or those containing particulate fillers, such as polymers, ceramics, and composites. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in understanding the intricate relationships between feedstock material composition, additive manufacturing process parameters, resulting microstructures, and the properties of the manufactured parts. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports fundamental research to address this gap by investigating material-process-microstructure-property relationships in direct ink writing of high-viscosity rubber nanocomposites with fillers. Such materials, with their unique blend of flexibility, durability, and enhanced mechanical and electrical properties have extensive applications in the manufacturing of medical devices, soft robotics, automotive components, flexible sensors, and electronics, among other products that could benefit society and the economy. The project also aims to advance educational and diversity initiatives by actively engaging students from underrepresented minority groups, including women, first-generation college students, and ethnic minorities, in hands-on experiences with advanced technologies and cutting-edge research.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to advance the understanding of material-process-microstructure-property relationships in the direct ink writing of highly viscous rubber nanocomposites to optimize both material composition and process parameters to achieve high-quality manufactured parts. This will be achieved through three main tasks: 1) Preparation of high molecular weight liquid isoprene rubber compounds with various reinforced fillers such as silica or carbon black, and conductive fillers such as conductive carbon black, carbon nanotubes, or graphene nanoplatelets, followed by rheometric analysis to characterize viscosity and flow at varying shear rates and temperatures; 2) Systematic variation of the manufacturing process parameters such as nozzle diameter and temperature, print speed, and infill angle, within processes constraints established by rheological analysis, to investigate the influences of these parameters on microstructure and defect formation, as captured by high-resolution optical and scanning electron microscopy; 3) Experimental investigation of mechanical, electromechanical, and time-dependent behaviors of 3D-printed samples to understand the correlation between microstructural features and macroscopic properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of knots in general dimension has applications to other areas of science such as biology, condensed matter physics, cryptography, and data analysis. One can study an object by investigating the possible behavior of knotted objects contained within. This project deals with ""low-dimensional"" topology, where the ambient space is of dimension at most five.

This fact stems from two key observations: a) these equations can capture various physical phenomena that cannot be described by simpler models, and b) these equations allow for various classes of solutions that can be calculated in explicit form. For example, the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation (NLS), is widely used to model wave propagation in weakly nonlinear dispersive media (fiber optics, deep water gravity waves) when dissipation can be neglected. It was observed that solitons, which are the most celebrated explicit solutions of integrable systems, can be viewed as ?""quasi particles"" of complex statistical objects called soliton gases. The main idea of this project is to model random nonlinear waves, which are frequently encountered in natural phenomena, with large random ensembles of solitons. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance our ability to predict and, in some cases, to control random nonlinear waves, as well as to derive their statistical characteristics. Being by nature a mixture of pure and applied mathematics and also leading to new lab experiments, the work on the project could benefit by cross pollination of ideas and methods originating from different parts of nonlinear waves research community. The project is expected to advance our general knowledge of random nonlinear waves, including the rogue waves (RW), and to improve methods of prediction of the latter. In the fiber optics, the results of the project may help to model and, perhaps, to control the evolution of noise in NLS governed nonlinear fibers. The project will also serve as a vehicle for training graduate and undergraduate students, including minorities, as well as postdocs.<br/> <br/>The main goals of this project are a) development of a rigorous spectral theory for soliton gases for integrable equations (KdV, fNLS, sine-Gordon, etc.), and b) statistical characterization of such soliton gases. The work in part a) requires rigorous derivation and analysis of the nonlinear dispersion relations (NDR), which describe spectral characteristics of the gases, as well as construction of explicit families of solutions to NDR (condensates, periodic gases, etc.) that can be of special interest in applications. The recent observation by the principal investigator (PI) that the NDR can be considered as a large genus (``thermodynamic"") limit of Riemann Bilinear Identities on some special sequences of Riemann surfaces reveals a deep and intriguing connections between the algebraic geometry and the spectral theory of soliton gases for integrable equations, which the PI is interested in understanding and analyzing. This approach requires some new potential theory methods for solving minimization problems on Riemann surfaces. Calculation of important statistical characteristics (probability density function, power spectrum, kurtosis, etc.) of the soliton gases from part b) contains both analytical and numerical components. The obtained theoretical results will lead to laboratory experiments in collaboration with leading experts in the area of experimental fiber optics and water waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine learning models will then be trained using these surface features to predict specific NP-protein binding sites. The technical approach will be developed in three major tasks. Task 1 will determine surface representations and topological descriptors for predicting protein-protein and NP-biosystem interactions. Task 2 will use these data representations to train models for predicting NP-protein interactions.

Technical activities focus on a special class of prediction problems in which the predictive model itself affects the problem environment - this is a phenomenon known as performativity, and such performativity is often caused by the strategic behavior of agents in the environment. For example, spammers (the agents) will change the content of their messages to evade spam filters (the prediction models). The investigators aim to leverage performativity to improve social welfare and reduce objectionable disparities among the agents. Broader-impact aspects of the project include application of the technical work to steering labor markets and social-media platforms with possible extension to the criminal-justice, sustainability, and transportation sectors.<br/><br/>Towards this goal, the project intends to develop methods that enable artificial-intelligence (AI) practitioners to learn how their predictive models affect the problem environment in order to overcome barriers to the leveraging of the impacts of predictive modeling for social good.

Rather than treating performativity as a problem to be overcome as is usually the case, the investigators instead leverage performativity to circumvent long-standing barriers to the broader adoption of algorithmic-fairness interventions, aligning the incentives of (possibly non-altruistic) organizations and users in sociotechnical systems so as to escape from impossibility-of-fairness results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In heterogeneous systems, these interfaces provide unique chemical environments with molecular structures and thermodynamic and chemical properties that are different from those far from the interface. For example, the interfacial properties can facilitate molecular self-assembly (i.e., molecular rearrangement) to form micro- and nano-structured thin films, which are potentially useful for industrial chemical processes. However, harnessing this phenomenon in an application requires generating a large interfacial contact area, which is challenging because the contact areas between bulk solutions are self-minimizing. A class of porous materials called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consists of a group of continuous hollow or liquid-containing networks of uniformly sized or hierarchically cross-connecting channels. Hierarchically cross-connecting channels are larger structures formed from building blocks that have their own distinct molecular structure. Hierarchically nanoporous channels are expected to create nanoconfined interfacial spaces that distribute polar and nonpolar molecules to form stable and periodic arrays of molecular-scale interfaces, overcoming the limited interfacial contact area challenge. This project aims to develop nanosized liquid-liquid interfaces in MOFs, enabling select chemical reactions to occur at the interface between the nanoconfined immiscible liquids. The fundamental knowledge gained here will provide insight into the distribution of polar and nonpolar molecules in a hierarchically nanoporous environment and build a foundation for studying important industry-relevant chemical processing, nanoconfinement-enabled reactions, molecular separations, and energy conversion processes. This research program is integrated with course development that bridges advanced undergraduate and graduate content across science and engineering disciplines. The project also creates opportunities for undergraduate and graduate research student training.<br/><br/>The project?s research goals are to (1) examine polar and nonpolar molecular adsorption/desorption thermodynamics and kinetics and demonstrate the formation of liquid:liquid interfaces in hierarchically nanoporous MOFs and (2) develop reaction systems for the manipulation of these interfaces in nanoconfined space by investigating model chemical reactions, such as the interfacial synthesis of nanomembranes and catalytic phenol alkylation with olefin, and use combined experimental and computational tools to obtain structure-function relationships. The project will explore the self-sorting phenomenon of polar and nonpolar molecules in hydrophilic and hydrophobic channels in hierarchically nanoporous MOFs. The sitting location of molecules in MOFs will be determined using difference electron (envelope) density (DED) mapping from powder X-ray diffraction data. Neutron scattering measurements combined with computational simulations will enable further characterization of the liquid:liquid interfaces. The results from this project will be used to develop new systems where the periodic nanosized interfaces will enable efficient reactions for those rate-limited by the liquid:liquid contact areas. A bridge course for undergraduate seniors and graduate students majoring in science and engineering will be delivered at Rochester Institute of Technology. The research results will be integrated into this course to foster interdisciplinarity across chemistry and engineering fields. Three elements will be incorporated into the course to maximize the potential impact on students and the broader community: delivery of core concepts of porous structured materials, analysis of high-impact research articles, and guest lectures from neighboring academic institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crumples in a sheet of paper, wrinkles in curtains, defects in liquid crystals or superconductors share at least one thing in common - they are the results of a certain energy minimization. Hence, this project is aimed at creating novel energy minimizing models, in particular, in metallic alloys, which would be capable of capturing and explaining certain experimentally observable effects. The investigator is developing new mathematical techniques that address the mechanism behind the optimality of these models. Furthermore, these techniques have the potential to be used in other areas of materials science, such as the location of defects in superconductors or the analysis of random porous media, which are also addressed in the project. The project has both scientific and educational components. The importance of this work is not only that it introduces novel variational problems in materials science and develops new methods to analyze them, but it also advances the discovery and understanding of new phenomena and contributes to the development of new materials, such as shape memory alloys. The educational component of the project involves development of special topics courses at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) as well as mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups. As a part of this project, an applied mathematics seminar series is being held at VCU by bringing national and international experts to interact with faculty and students.<br/><br/>The common aim of the project is understanding the structures, formed in a variety of physical systems of practical interest. The first part of the project is devoted to the patterns in martensitic phase transitions, or thermal material transformations, leading to shape memory effect. The investigator is obtaining a theoretical insight on certain experimentally observed phenomena in shape memory alloys, induced by bending and described in the physical literature. The investigator also addresses the effects of anisotropy and develops a novel approach to show that the experimentally observed patterns are energy minimizing. The second part of the project deals with the patterns in the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity.  The investigator considers the variational problem, related to the minimization of Ginzburg-Landau functional with certain (semi-stiff) boundary conditions, and shows that this problem has solutions with defects (vortices) near the domain boundary. The technique of matching upper and lower bounds is used to predict the precise location of these defects. Finally, the third part of the project deals with optimal control problems for porous media equations with stochastic forcing. Optimal control problems have a vast range of applications, ranging from economics to engineering. In this project the investigator considers the porous medium equation, subject to additional stochastic influence, and extends the classic techniques of homogenization theory to the stochastically perturbed optimal control case.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is particularly interested in how these interactions can transform energy from light, such as sunlight, into chemical energy when molecules are near the metal surface. Understanding this process, especially when the properties of the incident light are very similar to sunlight, has great potential for renewable energy applications. Furthermore, the project promotes educational inclusion by offering first generation college students, especially from underrepresented backgrounds, opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research starting their freshman year, thereby supporting the national interest in scientific literacy and diversity in science and engineering fields.<br/><br/>This project seeks to quantify the non-equilibrium electronic energy distribution in plasmonic metals and decipher its role in chemical transformations of analytes at the metal surface. Leveraging plasmonic nanostructures that can concentrate light, the research will dissect complex photochemical processes through inelastic spectroscopy, distinguishing between charge transfer due to photo-excited electrons versus those in an elevated temperature distribution. The technical aims are twofold: first, to quantify the behavior of these ""hot electrons"" and their involvement in surface chemistry, and second, to explore resonant vibrational energy transfer, a process that could aid strategies for mode-selective chemistry. Collectively, the insights gleaned from this research are expected to inform the steady-state dynamics of plasmonic photochemistry, thus broadening the scientific understanding of light-matter interactions and offering new perspectives on the mechanisms underlying sunlight-driven chemical processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most biological molecules are chiral, from the basic building blocks such as proteins and DNA to larger structures including biofilms. However, current approaches are limited to sensing large, ordered samples. Yet, more sensitive measurements are essential to measure heterogeneous mixtures or subtle changes. Toward the overarching goal of sensing chiral signals at the single-molecule level; the Biteen research group is developing a polarimetric microscope that leverages the precision of advanced microscopy and the signal enhancement of plasmonic antennas. The work is enabled through collaboration with the Masiello research group; this team is building the theoretical framework needed to interpret the measurements. Furthermore, the proposed activities emphasize to broad audiences how exciting science can be when teams work across disciplines?for instance, using advanced optics to investigate biological questions. Moreover, through class lectures, hands-on demos for middle school girls, and broad inclusion in laboratory research, this project will promote an image of science as an exciting field with a particular focus on increasing the diversity in STEM (science, technology, engineering & mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>This project is developing a multifunctional, high-sensitivity instrument to measure plasmon-enhanced chirality and to enable sensing of subtle, heterogeneous changes in chirality. Ultimately, this collaborative project seeks to make unprecedented measurements by leveraging single-particle plasmonics experimental methods, theoretical and numerical frameworks, and extensive microbiology expertise. The design and implementation of plasmon-coupled fluorescence microscopy is expected to advance knowledge in high-sensitivity detection of optical activity and provide access to subtle signatures of chirality in biology.  The work bridges chemistry, physics, and biology and shows how novel interdisciplinary approaches can overcome the limitations of conventional, discipline-specific techniques. Overall, the program has promise to advance the field of super-resolution microscopy by providing an innovative new tool for enhanced polarization-sensitive fluorescence imaging, developing a new theoretical framework for understanding plasmon-coupled chiral absorption and emission, and sensing biogenesis of chirality in bacteria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key feature of active matter is the presence of ""active agents"" that convert energy from the environment into mechanical motion, e.g., a bacterium ""eats"" and converts chemical energy into mechanical motion. The research on active matter addresses the complex behavior of both biological systems and bio-inspired manufactured materials. Two areas of active matter will be studied: active gels and suspensions of active swimmers in fluids. In the first area, the focus will be on active gels such as the cytoskeleton gel that drives the motion of a living cell. Understanding this motion is important because of its role in wound healing, immune response, and cancer metastasis. The key challenge of the proposed mathematical models is the presence of a moving deformable boundary (""free boundary"") of the domain where the equations of motion of the active gel are defined. The project will address fundamental mathematical questions concerning the stability of solutions to differential equations in domains with a free boundary. In the second area, the focus will be on the collective motion of bacteria in anisotropic biofluids. The aim here is to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the behavior of complex biological systems such as dense bacterial colonies. The proposed work in both areas will result in the development of novel mathematical techniques that can be applied to various problems in biophysics and materials science. This award will provide opportunities for involvement of students in the research projects.<br/><br/>The proposed work is aimed at the rigorous analysis of recently developed free boundary and homogenization PDE models of active matter. The project will investigate two areas of active matter: (A) crawling cell motion on a substrate and (B) collective motion of microswimmers in anisotropic fluids. The goal of the proposed work is two-fold: to develop novel mathematical techniques for the analysis of active systems that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and to provide a better understanding of the biophysical phenomena in areas (A) and (B). In area (A), novel asymptotic techniques for spectral analysis of non-self-adjoint operators will be developed to rigorously prove bistability, i.e., the coexistence of two stable states of the cell: motile and sessile states. Due to the nonlinearity and non-self-adjointness of the free boundary problem that models cell motion, new techniques for both linear and nonlinear stability analysis will need to be developed. In area (B), the PI will develop novel stochastic homogenization techniques to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas for the effective rheological properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to classify Riemannian and Kahler manifolds with k-positive curvature operator of the second kind. The second explores Ricci flows with positive isotropic curvature, aiming toward a classification of compact manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. The third objective entails an investigation of gradient shrinking Ricci solitons and Einstein four-manifolds with positive sectional curvature, aiming to make progress toward two folklore conjectures. Primary strategies include finding new Ricci flow invariant cones, studying the evolution of various curvature under Ricci flow, analyzing partial differential equations satisfied by various geometric quantities, and understanding the relationship between various notions of curvature via tensor algebra and Lie algebra. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Topology and Geometric Analysis Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Copper, however, can be toxic at high levels.  The human body must carefully and continuously remove excess copper.  Wilson Disease is a congenital disorder where the body cannot control internal copper levels. This results in serious and irreversible damage to the liver and brain that is fatal if untreated. Current FDA-approved therapies are of no use if acute organ damage has already occurred, and in some patients, simply do not work. Better therapies are needed to treat Wilson Disease. Some bacteria produce a novel compound called methanobactin that binds copper extremely strongly. Based on animal studies, it has great potential to treat even advanced cases of Wilson Disease. This project will identify how bacteria synthesize methanobactin and craft strategies to enhance its production so it can be used in clinical trials. Further, ?hands-on? science experiments will be developed and delivered to 3rd grade students at a local elementary school. The explicit objective of this effort is to engage and excite young children in science such that that they will pursue STEM careers in the future.<br/><br/>Copper is critical for the activity of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria. To collect copper, some methanotrophs produce a copper binding compound, or chalkophore, called methanobactin. It is a ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified polypeptide (RiPP). Methanobactin has exceptional promise in the treatment of copper-related human disorders, particularly Wilson Disease. Efforts to use methanobactin as a treatment option for these diseases are hindered by a lack of detailed knowledge regarding the genetics underlying methanobactin biosynthesis and an inability to scale up methanobactin production. Herein, a three-pronged strategy will be used to: (1) delineate the function of all the genes in the methanobactin gene cluster, (2) make modified forms of methanobactin that have the potential to expand the range of copper-related disorders methanobactin can be used to treat, and (3) characterize the mechanism whereby a key regulatory element controls methanobactin gene expression. Collectively, these efforts will not only enable us to define the entire biosynthetic pathway of methanobactin production, but also provide critical insights into how best to increase methanobactin production to accelerate its use in clinical trials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Allenbaugh of Murray State University will study small molecule mechanosynthesis kinetics under temperature-controlled conditions to enhance basic understanding of mechanochemistry.  Mechanochemistry has the potential to open up new, more sustainable chemistry methods.  Traditional chemical processes involve dissolving starting materials in a solvent and heating.  The solvent usually must be removed and often becomes a hazardous waste. Consequently, new methods not involving solvents would be very desirable.  Mechanosynthesis is such a technique that does not rely on solvents and replaces thermal energy derived from heating with mechanical impacts. This technique also tends to improve yields while reducing reaction time, thereby increasing the efficiency and lowering the cost of a process.  Dr. Allenbaugh and her group will be developing methods for temperature-controlled ball-milling to better understand the kinetics and mechanisms in the production of commercially relevant transition metal complexes.  In this project, a diverse group of undergraduate and M.S. students will be trained in sustainable synthesis methods. High school students will be introduced to sustainable chemistry through continuing education activities with local high school teachers.  Methods for integrating mechanosynthesis as a part of a cost-effective, sustainable synthetic methodology for primarily undergraduate institutions will be explored. <br/>  <br/>Despite the advantage of mechanosynthesis, widespread adoption is hindered by the absence of systematic reaction optimization methods and the limited kinetic understanding in small molecule mechanosynthesis.

Kinetic modelling will allow for a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms of mechanosynthesis, resulting in more rational methods for optimizing yields and reaction times. More broadly, Dr. Allenbaugh?s research seeks to introduce a wider community to alternative  methods for imparting energy into chemical reactions, an approach that includes mechanosynthesis and microwave chemistry.

Over 80 FDA approved peptide-based therapeutics exist, including insulin, which was the first drug of this class. While the synthesis and production of linear peptides, a straight chain of amino acids, is now seen as a relatively mature science, the use of linear peptides as therapeutics is limited by their general lack of bioavailability and in vivo stability. Often these limitations can be addressed if the peptide is cyclic, but cyclizing peptides via chemical synthesis remains challenging. Further, if the chain of amino acids is short enough, cyclization becomes even more challenging, as the final product has strain, and the molecular transitions leading to those products are geometrically less accessible. To address these challenges, the O?Reilly Lab is developing general tools to make strained cyclic peptides, unlocking them for the entire scientific community, where they can then be used in the areas of therapeutics, materials science, or catalysis. The synthetic methods are being validated through our synthesis of various biologically active strained cyclic peptide natural products. Beyond the purely scientific goals, this project will expand research opportunities at Villanova University to undergraduate researchers, and a course-based undergraduate research experience is being implemented in the undergraduate teaching curriculum to involve a broader audience in the research aims. Toward public engagement, collaboration with a children?s museum is planned to bring a facilitated exhibit focused on peptides to the public and to students.<br/><br/>The research from the O?Reilly group is focused on developing consistent and reproducible methods that will be applied to the preparation of a wide variety of strained cyclic peptides. Initial efforts will be focused on the synthesis of cyclic tetrapeptides. The first objective involves the design and use of reagent arrays to facilitate cyclization, which will be simultaneously screened to examine reaction progress around a variety of parameters with rapid reaction analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. As amino acid identity and stereochemistry have profound impacts on the rates of cyclization, computational efforts will be employed to evaluate product stability and the energetic considerations involved in cyclization. Combining the experimental data and computational insights are expected to provide for a more rational approach to the evaluation of strained cyclic peptides. The O'Reilly team will also examine auxiliary-mediated ligation approaches to facilitate cyclization to a less-strained, kinetic intermediate. The team anticipates that these intermediates will then undergo ring contraction to provide the strained, but thermodynamically favored amide products.

The team seeks to unravel the nucleation and growth mechanisms of molten salt synthesis for metal oxide nanoparticles. This is to be achieved by determining particle size, size distribution, and chemical composition over a wide  range of time and length scales, from early precursor reactions and metastable intermediates and aggregated states to the final growth states. This study is designed to explore the mechanism of nanoparticle growth under molten salt conditions and compare the characteristic empirical nucleation and growth phases reported in the recent literature with that observed in the present study. This investigation should answer establish whether nonclassical nucleation and growth processes are generally observed for the molten salt synthesis process and how these complex systems can be described in terms of their nucleation and growth kinetics.

Activities are designed to broaden understanding of anion-based chemistry and supramolecular chemistry for undergraduate students with laboratory experiments. Outputs from the research have the potential to benefit researchers in other areas of chemistry, as well as industrial chemists looking to manipulate anions.<br/><br/>In this project on anion recognition, reactivity and assembly, the Flood research group will synthesize a series of organic anions and organic cations to understand how their binding dictates reactivity and hierarchical assembly with cyanostar macrocycles. The project has three Aims that use molecular synthesis and self-assembly, titration data and crystal structures as general methods to address the project goals. Aim 1 seeks to examine how additional positive and negative charges will change the binding of boron-based anions to cyanostars, and how the binding of borohydride reductants will alter their reactivity. Aim 2 aims to establish how the structures of organic cations can be used to control formation of salt bridges in the hierarchical assembly of ionic supramolecular architectures, and to confer stability, chirality, and dynamic behaviors. Aim 3 seeks to expand the role of organic ammonium cations in anion-driven assembly towards 1D polymers, 2D networks, and non-equilibrium systems under the control of light and chemical fuel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These technologies, such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), have attracted significant national attention due to its conversational power and widespread availability as an open-source application. Such technologies are considered to be ?disruptive? because their impacts on education are uncertain and unpredictable. While many educators tend to take a cautious approach of blocking the application or restricting its use in academic settings, this technology has experienced widespread adoption within a short period of time, and students have been open about their use of ChatGPT to complete coursework and progress through academic programs. In the field of engineering education, prior research has focused on instructor and faculty reactions to these technologies, with little to no work exploring why and how students proactively leverage these technologies in learning engineering content. For this reason, this project aligns with the National Science Foundation?s high priority to research that pushes the frontiers of knowledge in STEM education in the EAGER program. The knowledge gained from this exploratory work has the potential to transform teaching and learning by providing insights into how educators can proactively integrate disruptive technologies into existing engineering curricula and beyond. By gaining a deeper understanding of students? interactions and perceptions of disruptive technologies, this research can be used to inform the development, design, and implementation of educational interventions that leverage the advantages of these technologies to meet the needs and motivations of diverse groups of learners.<br/><br/>This project will quickly establish a foundational understanding for harnessing the capabilities of disruptive technologies to promote learner agency by gaining insights into why and how students choose to use them in their learning. Using the theoretical lens of self-authorship, this research will examine the ways undergraduate engineering students use disruptive technologies to facilitate learning and their motivations for doing so. The self-authorship constructs of self-agency (i.e., the internal capacity to define one?s own decisions) and motivation (e.g., performance versus learning goal orientation) will be used to gain deeper insights into students? goals and motivations for engaging with and applying disruptive technologies to navigate their learning as engineers. Specifically, this study will employ an exploratory mixed method design to answer the questions: (1) why do undergraduate engineering students choose or choose not to engage with disruptive technologies such as ChatGPT; and (2) how do undergraduate engineering students perceive and utilize advancing disruptive technologies such as ChatGPT to assist learning? Findings from this work will be applied and expanded in future proposals examining the use and perceptions of disruptive technologies among other groups of learners such as graduate engineering students. This work will provide the initial first steps in moving from reactive to proactive approaches for integrating emerging and advancing technologies in engineering curricula and educational practice. The findings from this research will enable the engineering community to begin to understand the impacts of disruptive technologies on the professional formation of undergraduate engineering students, particularly in areas of learning orientation and motivation. For engineering educators and researchers, these findings have the potential to provide more nuanced insights into the various ways students from different engineering sub-disciplines perceive, approach, and adopt disruptive technologies to support their learning. For industry, these findings can be used as a starting point for testing and refining disruptive technologies for enhanced career training. Lastly, this project will foster a new community of practice in this unique and uninvestigated area of educational research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Renewable energy can be implemented in our oceans, which represent approximately 71 percent of our planet's surface, but proper implementation of renewable energy in the marine space is not trivial. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project supports research that attempts to address fundamental issues that can occur when producing electrical power within the perimeter of our marine space. As a rich source of invaluable natural resources to our society, the marine space deserves special treatment and attention. This project advances the field of power production in the marine space by addressing issues that can decrease energy production. A rigorous investigation will be carried out on how to efficiently build, operate, and integrate offshore wind systems with other forms of marine energy, such as wave and tidal energy. A rich set of activities will be developed at the third most diverse university in the United States: University of Massachusetts Boston, including presentations at local high schools in low-income communities and community colleges. The products of this project will be accessible to the public through an open-source format and will include easy-to-use, accessible analysis tools for optimizing marine energy production that will benefit a broad range of stakeholders, including students and professional engineers, energy analysts, investors, entrepreneurs, consultants, lawyers, economists, environmentalists, and biologists. <br/><br/>The prevailing technology worldwide for offshore wind farms is bottom-fixed based, constrained to water depths below 60m. More recently, floating wind turbine structures anchored with mooring lines have been developed to go beyond these water depth levels. Following these recent developments, the US Climate Action Plan has set a goal of deploying 15GW of floating wind energy by 2035. When looking at areas suitable for these technologies, there is a significant concern about the effects of farm-to-farm interaction. On the US East Coast, most areas suitable for floating wind farms lie in the wake of areas suitable for fixed-bottom technologies. On the southern US coast, fixed-bottom suitable areas lie within the perimeter of the wake from upstream floating wind farms. The power losses from the interaction between these wind farms could decrease the efficiency of using the marine space for power production. This research project aims to explore other alternatives for power production in areas where wake effects from upstream wind farms can be more significant. Under the umbrella of the recommendations from the US Climate Action Plan for increasing the use of marine energy, the synergies between offshore wind and marine energy will be evaluated, aiming for efficient integration of these power systems and reduced socioeconomic risks. Our aim is to perform a rigorous evaluation of farm-to-farm wake interaction over a broad spectrum of possible scenarios for offshore wind development. Next, the areas affected by upstream wind farms, which might be less efficient for offshore wind but suitable for marine energy deployment, will be identified and tested as potential sites for implementation. The open-source package released from this project will couple optimization with the offshore wind and marine energy analysis, researching optimal solutions for integrating offshore wind and marine energy systems through co-located hybrid power systems sharing the same marine area, grid connection, vessels for operation and maintenance procedures, and ports infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reducing flood risks is an urgent challenge for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation for as much as 23% of the global population. Protective infrastructure (e.g., dikes, seawalls, dams), otherwise known as ?a structural approach,? is currently the dominant risk management strategy, but this approach has significant shortcomings. As climate impacts intensify, communities will require transformative adaptation strategies that reduce risk and address vulnerabilities equitably. In this project, we focus on managed retreat (MR)?relocation of people, property and infrastructure away from the most vulnerable areas?as an adaptation approach that offers both risk reduction benefits and opportunities to advance social justice for disproportionately-impacted groups. Co-created with communities in the U.S., Canada, and Indonesia, this project will produce fundamental and actionable knowledge on how diverse communities can adopt managed retreat as a climate adaptation strategy, to reduce risk and advance social justice for disproportionately-impacted groups. This project will strengthen international partnerships and transform international understanding of managed retreat as an adaptation strategy. This project will train three graduate students with an interdisciplinary, international research experience with deep community engagement.<br/><br/>The project?s goal is to co-create new knowledge and actionable outputs to support the development and uptake of equity-informed, community-engaged managed retreat programs as a viable climate adaptation strategy. This project includes six research tasks that will advance fundamental knowledge on the decision support needs for municipalities and Indigenous communities as they consider and/or seek to implement equitable managed retreat programs as an adaptation strategy to build flood resilience. Iteratively refined with community partners, this project will: analyze past managed retreat initiatives to identify best practices, dynamics, challenges, and complexities; compare case studies of managed retreat programs at different implementation stages across Canada, the U.S., and Indonesia to understand managed needs and constraints from residents and decision-makers through roundtables and focus groups; and develop decision criteria and case study summary briefs to show future risks and vulnerabilities. Using practitioner input, the project will co-develop contextually-relevant decision-support tools (e.g., training module, best practices guidebook, conversation toolkits) that will enable community leaders to engage constituents on managed retreat.<br/><br/>This award is part of a collaboration jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and funding agencies from Canada via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition, led by Canada.

It is crucial to understand the structure and dynamics of solvents and their effects on transport properties and stability to develop new electrolytes for these batteries. The success of this research will provide reliable methods to measure the structure and dynamics of concentrated battery electrolytes at both bulk and interface levels. Additionally, integrating research with education initiatives will have profound implications for universities, secondary education, and the public. The project will integrate research findings into teaching courses, fostering interdisciplinary research skills among the involved undergraduate and graduate students. An innovative educational outreach effort includes an annual workshop on Batteries for Energy Storage for local high school students and educators, aimed at expanding the impact of NSF programs and promoting STEM education. Through collaborative efforts between research and education, this project seeks to engage a broad audience, deepen understanding of energy technologies, and inspire interest in STEM subjects.<br/><br/>While much research has focused on solvent-in-salt electrolytes, most studies have been limited to local and short-range solvation structures due to a lack of practical characterization tools. This project seeks to systematically study solvation structures and their dynamics from short to long-range at both bulk and interface levels. Understanding these structures is crucial to harnessing their unique transport properties and their impact on battery performance. This research targets the connection between molecular interactions and macroscopic and electrochemical properties of alkali metal electrolytes, employing advanced characterization techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, and neutron scattering. This project aims (1) to fully understand the solvation structures through multimodal characterization methods Raman, X-ray, or neutron scattering; (2) to investigate the dynamics of the electrolyte structure through advanced techniques, including X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) and Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS); (3) to study interfacial solvation structures and early-stage solid-state interface formation employing Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS); and (4) to correlate the structure-property relationship by studying transport property and battery performance with their solvation structure and dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most biological molecules are chiral, from the basic building blocks such as proteins and DNA to larger structures including biofilms. However, current approaches are limited to sensing large, ordered samples. Yet, more sensitive measurements are essential to measure heterogeneous mixtures or subtle changes. Toward the overarching goal of sensing chiral signals at the single-molecule level; the Biteen research group is developing a polarimetric microscope that leverages the precision of advanced microscopy and the signal enhancement of plasmonic antennas. The work is enabled through collaboration with the Masiello research group; this team is building the theoretical framework needed to interpret the measurements. Furthermore, the proposed activities emphasize to broad audiences how exciting science can be when teams work across disciplines?for instance, using advanced optics to investigate biological questions. Moreover, through class lectures, hands-on demos for middle school girls, and broad inclusion in laboratory research, this project will promote an image of science as an exciting field with a particular focus on increasing the diversity in STEM (science, technology, engineering & mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>This project is developing a multifunctional, high-sensitivity instrument to measure plasmon-enhanced chirality and to enable sensing of subtle, heterogeneous changes in chirality. Ultimately, this collaborative project seeks to make unprecedented measurements by leveraging single-particle plasmonics experimental methods, theoretical and numerical frameworks, and extensive microbiology expertise. The design and implementation of plasmon-coupled fluorescence microscopy is expected to advance knowledge in high-sensitivity detection of optical activity and provide access to subtle signatures of chirality in biology.  The work bridges chemistry, physics, and biology and shows how novel interdisciplinary approaches can overcome the limitations of conventional, discipline-specific techniques.

Population growth and urbanization are increasing global demand for energy sources that are capital-intensive, environmentally damaging, and inequitable. Shallow geothermal energy systems are a promising sustainable energy technology, but their applicability in areas where soils are partially-saturated can be limited. Their wider utilization is also hampered by the high capital costs. Here, microbially induced calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation (MICP) can be used to improve the heat transfer and energy storage efficiency of soils, because CaCO3 is low cost, and has a high thermal conductivity, and excellent chemical and thermal stability. Moreover, this enhanced heat transfer can be utilized to trigger the geometric phase transformation of thermomechanical architected metamaterials (TAMs) under thermal loads to generate energy. This research will advance fundamental engineering knowledge by creating an entirely novel shallow geothermal heat exchanger (GHE) that relies on site-specific natural minerals and 3D printable, programmable TAMs for cost-effective geothermal energy harvest with fast installation capability. The technology has the potential to be broadly used for energy and CO2 storage solutions, power transmission/distribution, and construction and heat recovery technologies. The project has four specific educational objectives: mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students; facilitate the retention of underrepresented minorities through workshops and training; integrated modules and dissemination through documentation, publications, presentations at conferences and webinars, and developed COMSOL Apps (user-friendly, accessible interfaces to access complex simulation models); and a USA-UK exchange program. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to engineer a novel, cost-effective, and easily deployable concept of shallow geothermal heat exchanger (GHE) that couples Microbially induced calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation (MICP) with thermomechanical architected metamaterials (TAMs). This overall goal will be achieved through three objectives: 1) develop a MICP treatment method for enhanced heat transfer in soils under mechanical loads; 2) develop geometric phase transforming structures tuned by temperature variation; and 3) integrate MICP with TAMs for geothermal energy harvest. The tasks mirror the project objectives and focus on combining experimental and numerical approaches to optimize MICP for enhanced thermal conductivity of soils under in-situ stress conditions, engineer the manufacturing and functionality of TAMs, and evaluate the system design and performance. This evaluation includes the development of a numerical model to investigate the multi-year operation performance of this novel GHE at a household system scale, thereby providing insights into its deployment potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) calls for an undergraduate engineering student to be able to apply engineering judgment upon graduation.  However, when asked what is engineering judgment, engineers, including faculty, are often not able to readily respond.  Thus, although judgment is a common term, it tends to be an elusive notion.  Consequently, the assessment and measurement of engineering judgment to ensure its formation is currently limited due to lack of a holistic, agreed-upon, concrete definition for it.  In addition to not assessing judgment specifically, educators generally do not provide explicit instruction on judgment as part of the formation of the engineering student.  Given this absence of direct instruction and assessment, research is needed to create educational materials and tools to support the formation of all engineering students.  This research will develop these materials and tools based on an expert, consensus-driven definition for engineering judgment, which will be generated as a first step in the research.  This study will significantly impact the engineering field ? engineering curriculums, students, educators, ABET accreditation, and industry stakeholders, ultimately strengthening society through well-engineered products, systems, and services. Purposefully educating and assessing aspiring engineers relative to judgment is the major impact of this work, as this has not occurred to any widespread nor consistent degree to this point.  <br/><br/>This exploratory research will first determine an expert-driven definition for engineering judgment using a consensus-based Delphi panel study.  The expert panel will be comprised of a diverse group of professionals and include faculty who have investigated and published on various aspects of engineering judgment, ABET program evaluators, and instructors of design and data analysis courses across multiple engineering disciplines.  The first research question is as follows: What is a holistic, expert-driven definition for engineering judgment?  The agreed-upon definition will be used to develop assessment tools for judgment and test and apply them in the context of three courses covering competencies highly relevant to engineering judgment ? design and data analysis.  Written reflection by students will be investigated as a method to assess judgment, with reflection questions to be posed after team engineering projects.  Using a coding scheme informed by the Delphi study, a qualitative content analysis of the reflections will be conducted to extract evidence of judgment.  Evidence of judgment will also be extracted from student interviews, surveys, and project deliverables using the coding scheme and a related rubric (also to be developed), allowing validation of results from various sources.  Knowledge from the Delphi study and assessment process will directly lead to development of educational modules for explicit instruction on engineering judgment for use by educators and students.  By considering demographic variables such as gender and ethnicity as part of the assessment process, the development of educational modules applicable to all students will be promoted.  The assessment data will further address the following questions: 1) What breadth of engineering judgment competencies do students exhibit in their reflections, interviews, survey responses, and projects, and 2) What are students? understandings of engineering judgment, and how can we support them in developing this ABET outcome, including consideration of potential differences by demographic variables?  To promote adoption of the educational modules and assessment tools and disseminate the findings widely, a professional website will be employed, and we will have a presence at national conferences and collaborating engineering schools to create awareness through workshops and presentations.  This work will start the needed conversation across engineering about the elusive (and critical) notion of engineering judgment in pursuit of assessment and instructional resources to support the formation of today?s engineer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly speaking, whenever there is a notion of multiplication on a set of things, this set becomes a group. We say a group can be left-ordered if one can order elements of the group so that the relative size of any two elements remains unchanged when multiplying both elements by another element on the left.  When it comes to the case where the group is derived from a 3-dimensional space (a 3-manifold), known as the fundamental group, there is a surprising connection between whether the group can be left-ordered and two other natural structures on the 3-dimensional spaces. One structure is called foliations, which views the 3-dimensional spaces as a union of 2-dimensional layers, akin to the foliations seen in metamorphic rocks. The other, called flows, captures the motions of points in the 3-dimensional spaces. The main objective of this project is to deepen our understanding of this connection. Additionally, this project will support initiatives focused on improving mathematical education in the community, making advanced mathematics more accessible and engaging to a broader audience. <br/><br/>There are two main research directions in the project: 1. Investigating the L-space conjecture, which connects the orderability of groups, foliations on 3-manifolds, and the complexity of certain Floer homology of the manifolds. The project will particularly focus on the conjecture for toroidal manifolds through notions of slope detection. 2. Studying various actions of 3-manifold groups on 1-dimensional spaces (circles, lines, trees) naturally arising from foliations and flows. This includes their dynamical properties and their connection to the existence of left-orders on the 3-manifold groups.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the NSF-DMS Topology and Geometric Analysis Program (TGA) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these early signs can be anxiety, depression, impulsivity, or aggression. These behaviors, or some combination of them, are thought to be related to a person?s genes. Children who experience poverty, abuse, or neglect during childhood can also have these same behaviors. Teenagers with these behaviors have also been shown to have differences in their brains which can be seen in imaging studies. Using data previously collected, this study seeks to understand how the development of these behaviors might be influenced by the effects of genetics and environment. The study will also examine brain images from these children in an effort to understand how brain development might also be changed under those conditions. By advancing knowledge about how genetics and environment work together to influence behaviors could help with identifying at-risk individuals earlier. Knowing what is changing in the brain may also guide treatment, leading to fewer problems later in life.<br/><br/>The interplay of genetics and environment influences in childhood can lead to manifestations of known precursors to adult mental illness. These precursors, identified as internalizing and externalizing behaviors, are known to share common genetic vulnerability, be associated with the severity and chronicity of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and impact brain development. Currently, understanding is limited about the combined effect of ACEs and genetic vulnerability on the longitudinal development of internalizing and externalizing behaviors during adolescence. There is also limited knowledge into how this combined effect may modify brain development. Using data collected from approximately 10,000 subjects annually over five years starting at age nine from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort, this study will use a parallel process latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to understand the developmental trajectories of internalizing and externalizing behaviors under the combined influence of polygenetic risk scores (PRS) and ACEs. Those trajectories will then be used to inform a multimodal neuroimaging analysis to extract neural features specific to these particular developmental trajectories, highlighting the differences in brain development associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors as influenced by PRS and ACEs. Gaining deeper insight into how genetics and environment interact to give rise to these internalizing-externalizing behaviors, as well as how these are changing neural development during adolescence, could assist early identification of individuals at high risk of later mental illness, allowing earlier and more targeted interventions. These in turn could greatly reduce social/economic dysfunction experienced in adulthood and mitigate the expense of treatment later.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are collections of distributed energy resources, such as batteries, and rooftop solar, which can be intelligently coordinated to improve the reliability, affordability, and sustainability of the electric grid. Traditional VPP models and programs are afflicted by both barriers and disproportionate risks to participants in disadvantaged communities (DACs). This is, in part, due to insufficient data for understanding how socio-technical factors influence energy flexibility and how providing opportunities for community input can improve the VPP design process. Further, algorithms and computational models for making technology and control decisions have neglected fairness and equity. To address these gaps, this project works directly with DACs in Philadelphia to design and evaluate new approaches to VPP participation that consider the unique conditions within a community along with issues of preference and fairness.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to construct new models for equity-based design and control of VPPs from the ground up, considering the unique conditions and priorities in DACs. It adopts an interdisciplinary fusion of methods and data to solve the challenging problem of characterizing the needs and preferences of potential VPP participants in a way that facilitates new computational methods for design and control. The project uniquely focuses on services-based approaches, rather than considering electricity as a mere commodity, which enables new perspectives on what it means to deliver energy justice and equity within engineered systems. New equity-promoting and privacy-aware algorithms, with the ability to seamlessly resolve misspecification in model parameters by utilizing a learning layer, are studied, which will have broader application to other domains. Further, DAC participation in VPPs can potentially broaden the beneficial impacts of VPPs by monetizing behavioral flexibilities in access to energy services, a novel consideration for the basic science of VPP optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, there has been great effort to assemble colloids into new functional materials with designer architecture using electric and magnetic fields. Of particular interest are colloids that spin (rotors), because in such systems the flows stirred by the rotating particles add to the electrostatic interactions, thereby vastly expanding the possible structures. This project will theoretically study the dynamics of colloids placed between two planar electrodes in order to understand the mechanisms of the field-driven particle assembly. The project integrates knowledge across the fields of applied mathematics, fluid mechanics and soft matter, which will be very beneficial for the training of the students associated with the project. Visually appealing experiments will help educate the public about mathematics and fluid dynamics. <br/> <br/>This project is concerned with a theoretical investigation of motile particles in confinement. The focus is on particles driven to either roll or rotate by the Quincke instability in a uniform electric field between two electrodes. Quincke-driven particles are a popular model of active matter, which are systems composed of entities harvesting energy from the environment and converting it into motion. A fascinating feature of active matter is the emergence of macroscopic structures or coherent motions on scales much larger than the individual unit. Agent-based models are often employed to describe the collective dynamics of motile individuals. A key challenge is the choice of rules for the interaction between the agents. In the case of Quincke-driven particles, demonstrating the importance of physics-informed mathematical models has been a major thrust in the research conducted by the investigators. Current models of the particle dynamics are unable to explain the experiments due to inadequate description of the boundary effects. To fill this void, the investigators develop mathematical models, analytical solutions, and accurate and efficient computational solutions of the electrohydrodynamics of many particles between two walls, which are mathematically challenging multiphase and multibody problems. The mathematical advances are many and include analytical solutions of single particle dynamics between electrodes, detailed analysis of the pair-wise particle interactions in confinement, and integration of these analytical results into an algorithm based on multipole expansions for many particles. Experiments integrated with the mathematical research inform and test the mathematical models and to ensure that the research has impact both in and beyond the applied mathematics community. Educational impact includes bringing direct experimental experience in fluid dynamics and soft matter research to applied mathematics undergraduate and graduate students at Northwestern University. The emergent behavior of the Quincke rotors will likely open new research directions across various fields, e.g., non-equilibrium soft matter, materials engineering, and fluid dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, existing technologies to perform these measurements are large, expensive, and not portable. Research efforts have explored portable technologies that shine light into the head and then measure its scattered response to estimate blood flow beneath the skull. These imaging technologies are promising, but they are not able to effectively measure deep into tissue. This project aims to explore new optical methods to measure blood flow much deeper within the human head than existing technologies. By accurately measuring blood flow from multi-centimeter depths, this project aims to open new areas of the brain for neuroimaging studies, and thus new frontiers for scientific exploration. To promote and share knowledge gained, this project will develop new education modules that will be accessible to the public. These modules will explain basic principles of optical neuroimaging methods, provide details on software used to convert optical measurements into blood flow estimates, and detail how blood flow estimates can be analyzed.<br/><br/>This project will focus on development of a specific optical neuroimaging technology termed diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), which measures the temporal dynamics of scattered coherent light to extract deep tissue hemodynamics. By parallelizing DCS detection over many thousands of individual single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) within an integrated array, it is possible to dramatically increase blood flow measurement accuracy from deep tissue areas. This project will explore co-optimized software that jointly exploits temporal and spatial correlations within diffusely scattered light to maximize the accuracy of blood flow measurements from deep within tissue. A key aim is to establish a spatiotemporal DCS approach that will use a new spread-speckle detection strategy across a large SPAD array, along with Bayesian optimization software that account for low photon counts, to unlock the ability to measure blood flow from within the hippocampus. To achieve this aim, this proposal will utilize whole-head photon transport modeling, optical system development, and human subject experiments to push non-invasive optical measurement of hemodynamics significantly deeper within the human head.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its goals are to design, implement, and evaluate a scalable and replicable model for an apprentice program for community college students to explore careers in research administration and compliance. This will be accomplished via a partnership with Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC) to find and prepare a cohort of seven apprentices for a six-month mentored apprenticeship in either research administration (n=5) or research compliance (n =2). A mixed methods evaluation will be performed to evaluate the experiences of the apprentices, their hosting departments, and a cost-benefit analysis to determine if a program of this nature can be scalable at emerging institutions. If successful, this will have a dual impact: first, an increase in the potential pool of staff for research administration and compliance positions nationwide, especially for less resourced institutions. Second, the diversification of the research administration workforce, drawing on the economically and racially diverse population of America?s community college students to fill the need for trained research administration and compliance staff. The expected outcome of this project is the validation of an apprenticeship model to prepare community college students to be successful in research administration and compliance roles, supporting the nation?s research enterprise by increasing research support capacity through additional resources. As community colleges are found across the nation, these individuals can provide co-located support with specialized skills and knowledge to those at emerging institutions who require resources to bring their sponsored research and scholarship ideas to fruition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Initial demonstrations of nanoparticle purification involved exosomes, a class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from diverse biological media, via a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) protocol on polyester C-CP fiber columns.  EVs are integral components in intracellular communication, and thus are involved in the evolution of many disease types.  The same analytical approach has been extended to the isolation of lentivirus particles and adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles.  These three classes of BNPs are similar in many physical and chemical aspects, which tend to make them very difficult to isolation by most chromatographic methods.  Separations on C-CP phases represent a completely different paradigm to methods currently employed in the processing of BNPs. Approaches developed would touch aspects of fundamental biochemistry, clinical diagnostics, and gene therapy delivery; the latter being an area of intense interest and importance. The goal of the studies is to produce efficient and selective separations in an economical manner. This work is interdisciplinary, involving collaborative efforts between research groups in chemistry, bioengineering, and biological sciences. The project includes investigators affiliated with the Clemson University Center for Advanced Engineering of Fibers and Films. If successful, the project may have long term implications for the textile and biopharmaceutical industries. <br/><br/>The proposed studies are directed at exploiting C-CP fiber platforms to affect highly productive/ selective separations in the realm of bionanoparticle (BNP) analytics. The vast majority of separation/purification strategies for these species involve physical means such as ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, and size-exclusion methods. Use of C-CP fibers to affect these separations rests on the ability to differentiate BNPs based upon chemical functionality, whose interaction strengths are determined in-part based on particle size and the solvents employed to effect the separation. The C-CP fiber platform can be implemented across a number of formats including spin-down micropipette tips and microbore chromatography columns, as such, relevant problems in fundamental biochemistry, clinical analysis, and process analytical chemistry can be addressed. In-line absorbance detection for quantification, followed by particle sizing/counting via multi-angle light scattering (MALS), provides greater information about eluted nanoparticles/vesicles.  This approach will be complemented by the use of novel instrumentation which provides particle sizing and number density via light scattering, but also specific BNP identification through fluorescence immunoassays, here for discrete samples.  Multidimensional separations of target exosomes from cell cultures typically used to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) brings a completely novel aspect to potentially achieve greater value from a single fermentation operation. In all cases, performance metrics will be directly compared to commercial columns and standard methods employed for nanoparticle isolation/purification. Development of practical methods will be augmented with fundamental studies directed at understanding physico-chemical processes at the microscopic level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project also supports an education plan that exposes students to sustainability concerns in developing our digital infrastructure.  The course material will be made widely available via the web and video.<br/><br/>LEO satellites must orbit the Earth once every 100 minutes to maintain their altitude, continuously changing the topology of the network. This highly dynamic topology introduces significant variability in network performance. This project will develop robust and intuitive models that can accurately describe and predict variability in satellite networks and leverage these models to improve network protocols used for satellite networking. Such modeling efforts were instrumental to the proliferation of other types of networks (e.g., cellular networks and datacenter networks). The project will also provide a deeper understanding of the impact of variability on applications (e.g., video conferencing and gaming), developing algorithms to mitigate the negative side effects of variability on the quality of experience of application users. All findings made in this project will be validated using a distributed and programmable testbed and crowdsourced measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As computing moves to edge devices such as cell phones, federated learning becomes more important.  Unlike traditional artificial intelligence (AI) applications that train on data gathered and processed at a central location, federated AI applications learn collaboratively at the edge. With federated learning, multiple users remotely provide their data to train an AI learning algorithm in a collaborative fashion. The process runs in an iterative fashion with local updates at the edge using private data, while benefiting from global collaboration from several remote/edge users with their own private data. It enables training machine learning models on large-scale distributed data without sharing the raw data. Conventional federated learning focus on the standard minimization problem poses challenges to new learning paradigms such as the compositional learning paradigm. This learning paradigm has been attracting a surge of attention recently because it covers many new machine learning models, such as model-agnostic meta-learning, imbalanced data classification, and contrastive self-supervised learning. Traditional federated learning concentrates on centralized setting and suffers from single-point failure and communication bottleneck. This project focuses on enabling decentralized federated learning for the compositional learning paradigm. It pushes the boundary of federated learning, advancing the development of both federated learning itself and the emerging learning paradigms. The developed federated learning algorithms can be applied to a wide range of application domains, such as healthcare and social science. This research provides education and research opportunities for students from underrepresented groups and K-12 students.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a new decentralized federated compositional learning (DFCL) framework to enable federated learning for the compositional learning paradigm. To address the fundamental challenges caused by the compositional structure and decentralized communication, this project will systematically investigate decentralized federated compositional optimization problems from the perspective of algorithmic design and theoretical foundation. Thrust 1 focuses on the computational foundations for the multi-level compositional minimization problem of DFCL, including developing converging-fast and generalizing-well algorithms. Thrust 2 concentrates on the communication foundations for DFCL, aiming to develop robust communication topologies and efficient communication strategies. Thrust 3 investigates the computational foundations for the compositional minimax problems of DFCL, which aims to propose efficient algorithms for multi-level stochastic compositional minimax problems. Finally, DFCL will be evaluated on biomedical applications and generic machine learning applications to address the challenges in real-world learning tasks. The developed research will provide abundant topics and opportunities in education and research for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Occurring at very low temperatures (possibly only a few degrees above the absolute zero), superconductivity allows electric current to pass through a material without any resistance. Despite the challenges posed by the need for cryogenic cooling, superconductivity finds a wide range of applications. These include superconducting coils in hospital MRI machines, magnetic field sensors in medical and industrial laboratories, and detectors and amplifiers of very weak electromagnetic signals, to name a few. In the recent decades, superconductivity emerged as the basis for the most viable designs of quantum computers. Concurrently, new superconducting materials were discovered, some of which are only a few-atoms thick. These include structures based on graphene -- a one-atom-thick two-dimensional crystal cleaved from graphite (the common material in pencil leads) -- and structures combining layers of conventional semiconductors and superconductors. The appearance of new materials and uses for superconductivity calls for theoretical developments which would enable the materials study and guide the design of new superconducting devices. This research project covers three specific directions within this broad task.<br/><br/>Superconductivity is a quintessential quantum phenomenon. The mobile electrons in a material form a collective state, or condensate, due to an effective attraction between the electrons. Exciting an electron from the condensate requires a finite energy. This energy gap leads to the zero electric resistance of a superconductor. The ?glue? capable of changing the conventional repulsion between electrons to an effective attraction may consist of quanta of vibrations, or phonons, of the host material. In one of the directions of this research project, we will develop a theory for measuring phonon properties using a newly developed tool, the Quantum Twisting Microscope.<br/><br/>The two other directions of the project aim at investigating the effects of magnetic field and material imperfections on the properties of the novel superconductors. The new graphene-based superconductors are special because of the unusually low electron density in them; this may substantially alter how magnetic field affects superconductivity. Investigating superconductivity in materials with low density of electrons is the first of these two directions. The other direction aims at studying the role of material defects in the so-called topological superconductors. The electron condensate in such materials may simultaneously reside in two (or more) quantum states, which is a prerequisite for quantum computing. Unlike the conventional superconductors (such as aluminum), topological superconductors are sensitive to the structural disorder of the host material. Our research will aim to determine the length limits that allow a wire to retain the properties of a topological superconductor.<br/><br/>Graduate students will be actively involved in the research and will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The Principal Investigator also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-experts.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project aims to develop the electron transport theory of low-dimensional and mesoscopic conductors with topologically nontrivial single-particle or collective states. The emphasis is placed on theory applicable to superconductor-semiconductor hybrids and van der Waals materials exhibiting superconductivity. The motivation comes from the advances in engineering of new materials, experimental techniques enabling the high-precision electron transport measurements, and from the challenges the evaluation of electric responses of such systems presents for the theory.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is devoted to developing new probes of the topological superconducting phases. We focus on the vicinity of the transition point separating the topological phase from a trivial one. We aim to elucidate the signatures of the critical behavior, obscured by disorder, in the nonlocal conductance.<br/><br/>The second part of the project aims to broaden the transport theory of two-dimensional superconductors in an out-of-plane magnetic field. The recently measured superconductivity in trilayer graphene points to an anomalously short coherence length in it. This raises a host of questions regarding the crossover between the weak- and strong-coupling limits of superconductivity and its manifestations in the magnetoresistance.<br/><br/>The third part of the project develops a theory allowing to find the electron-phonon interaction parameters and the superconducting gap structure from the measurements of momentum-resolved electron tunneling using a new device, Quantum Twisting Microscope.<br/><br/>This work will require a variety of techniques, including diagrammatic expansions, Fermi liquid theory, renormalization group theory, continuous medium theory, the use of exactly solvable models, and numerical methods. Graduate students will be actively involved in the research and will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The PI also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-experts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The offshore wind energy resources in the U.S. are broadly distributed and within reasonable  distances from major urban centers. The majority of offshore wind energy farms have been developed in shallow and intermediate water depths (<60 m), in which offshore wind turbines are supported by fixed-bottom substructures. However, almost 70% of the U.S. offshore wind energy resource is in deep water (>60m), where floating offshore wind turbines are needed. Developing economically competitive floating offshore wind energy production faces numerous barriers, including limited innovation of substructures (platform, moorings, and anchors) and poor understanding of critical interactions among subsystems of the floating offshore wind turbine system, as well as insufficient data from high quality, applicable experiments. This multi-disciplinary project will address these barriers by facilitating a deeper understanding of coupled experimental and numerical simulation methods leading to enhanced performance, efficiency, and reliable simulation of next generation floating offshore wind turbines. This research will be complemented by an educational plan to assist in addressing the expected demand for a well-educated workforce in the offshore wind energy industry by organizing workshops, recruiting diverse graduate and undergraduate students to broaden their participation in the future workforce, and engaging talented middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and resilience of floating offshore wind turbines under extreme loading conditions. This goal will be achieved by: (1) creating new understanding of and novel concepts for reducing floating offshore wind turbine platform motions, using innovations such as tuned-mass dampers and bio-inspired oscillating hydrofoil hydrokinetic turbines for the dual function of motion control and energy co-production; (2) evaluating the effects of platform motion reductions on mooring line fatigue response; (3) investigating bio-inspired foundations to improve the response of floating offshore wind turbines under realistic loading conditions; and (4) developing coupled aero-hydro-geotechnical-mechanical real-time hybrid simulations of  complete floating offshore wind turbine-platform-mooring-foundation systems to accurately represent field conditions in the laboratory and to simulate floating offshore wind turbines under extreme loading conditions. Achieving these goals will enable the project to advance the knowledge required to address the technical challenges facing cost-effective floating offshore wind energy production. The overarching focus will be on improving the understanding of energy efficiency and resilience of floating offshore wind turbines under extreme loading conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Immune cells fight these invaders, but new discoveries reveal that non-immune cells deploy xenophagy to eliminate these intruders.  Xenophagy utilizes lysosomes, tiny organelles inside the cell  that contain acidic ions like calcium to recycle old cell contents, but how these organelles help clear pathogens is poorly understood.  This study will discover how lysosomes get rid of pathogens by focusing on ion channels that pass calcium into and out of cells to regulate lysosome functions.  Investigating these ion channels will reveal novel approaches to enhance xenophagy and improve our body's natural defenses to fight illnesses and infections.  This project provides educational and research opportunities for students at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), an officially recognized Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).  The Principal Investigator will promote hands-on research experiences and training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  Sophomore and junior students at UTRGV will have an exciting opportunity to take part in a 10-week summer internship program at prestigious medical institutions in Texas, to expand student knowledge and passion for cell physiology.  In collaboration with UTRGV?s High Scholar program, the PI will transform the 9-week summer programs into year-long research experiences for high school students.  To further improve research training for these students, an existing course will be refined to offer an advanced curriculum focused on cellular imaging.<br/><br/>This proposed research will address the current lack of mechanistic understanding of xenophagy regulation by investigating the roles of key ion channels in the function of lysosomes in xenophagy.  By using gastrointestinal cells as an animal cell model and Escherichia coli as the pathogen, this study aims to:  1) identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing lysosomal homeostasis when cells encounter E. coli invasion, and; 2) determine how ion channels facilitate the breakdown of internalized E. coli within lysosomes.  Preliminary findings suggest that lysosomal calcium and potassium channels, along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, collectively play a crucial role in assisting cellular machinery in eliminating E. coli through xenophagy.  This project takes a multi-disciplinary approach by combining ROS/calcium imaging, organelle electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and mouse models to investigate how ROS and lysosome ion channels connect to xenophagy initiation pathways to trigger E. coli clearance.  The goal is to illuminate the intricate networks that govern these vital cellular processes for destroying pathogens. The research will also examine natural/synthetic modulators of lysosome ion channels and xenophagy pathways to gain valuable insights into how these compounds impact cell responses to bacterial invasion.  Overall, this research will contribute to expanding our knowledge of how cells detect and respond to infections by optimizing lysosome synthesis and enhancing the function of xenophagy machinery in digesting internalized bacteria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most existing algorithms are designed for datasets represented in vector spaces, real-world data often comprises distributions or point-clouds, presenting both theoretical and computational challenges for manifold learning algorithms. This project will develop manifold learning algorithms tailored for distributional or point-cloud datasets, with a particular emphasis on theoretical analysis and computational efficiency. Leveraging the framework of optimal transport and established manifold learning theory in vector spaces, the project will address these challenges. This project will also train students in interdisciplinary aspects of the research.<br/><br/>This project will develop and analyze algorithms for uncovering low-dimensional intrinsic structures of data sets within Wasserstein space, a natural space for distributions or point-clouds. This is motivated by the recent success in representing data as elements in Wasserstein space, as opposed to Euclidean space, and the necessity to develop efficient algorithms for their analysis. To accomplish the goals of this project, the research team will leverage the eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix built from a data-dependent graph. Specifically, consistency theory of operators such as the Laplacian between the discrete (graph) and the continuous (submanifold) setting will be developed, drawing inspiration from the well-established theory for finite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. The project will develop theoretically provable methods that provide algorithmic insights, which in turn can be used for efficient algorithms.

This project  will explore the ability of the carbon  nanostructures  to handle heat and its relationship to mechanical deformation. By studying the effects of strain on their heat transfer properties, this project aims to enhance the understanding of the complex thermal behavior of carbon nanostructure materials under strain.

Both experiments and theory will be pursued with the ultimate goal of designing structures that maintain efficient heat dissipation even under mechanical deformation. There is limited information on the impact of strain on the thermal conductivity of 3D carbon nanostructures and the reported results show variability. The proposed research endeavors to bridge this knowledge gap by systematically measuring the thermal conductivities of a variety of 3D carbon nanostructures, each with distinct molecular architectures, utilizing a novel thermal-mechanical characterization apparatus. Molecular dynamics simulations will be instrumental in understanding the molecular-level thermal behavior exhibited by the 3D carbon nanostructures under mechanical strain. These simulations will offer a detailed microscopic view of the heat transfer mechanisms within carbon nanotube-carbon nanotube, carbon nanotube-graphene, and graphene-graphene junctions, particularly focusing on how these interactions evolve when the materials undergo deformation. Success of the proposed research could fast-track advancements in next-generation flexible electronics by introducing novel designs of 3D carbon nanostructures that maintain excellent thermal performance even when strained.

The researchers aim to explore approaches to teaching college calculus by mathematics instructors through content analysis of a range of course materials sampled across multiple 2-year and 4-year colleges, characterizing the calculus content and cognitive framing of course materials. Additionally, interview and survey methodologies will be used to investigate expectations of calculus coursework among engineering faculty.

The Boltzmann equation is often regarded as the first-principle model for plasmas; however, its numerical simulation is prohibitively expensive even on today?s most powerful supercomputers. The challenges manifest as: 1) High-dimensionality. The Boltzmann equation resides in six-dimensional phase space. Hence, full 6D deterministic simulation requires excessive computing effort and memory. 2) Collision operator. Collisions between particles are described by nonlinear, nonlocal integral operators that are extremely difficult to approximate. Yet, they play a critical role in driving the system towards local thermodynamic equilibrium and must be included in the simulation, especially in transition and fluid regimes. 3) Multiple scales. Plasmas inherently exhibit multiscale physics. Different scaling can lead to different asymptotic models. How to conduct efficient kinetic simulations such that multiscale behaviors are properly captured is a long-standing problem. The overall objective of this project is to develop a set of ultra-efficient deterministic numerical methods for multiscale kinetic plasma simulations. The algorithms to be developed in this project have the potential to provide high-fidelity kinetic plasma simulations across a range of regimes at a manageable computational cost. <br/><br/>The basic framework we will employ is the dynamical low-rank method (DLRM), a robust dimension reduction technique for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. In essence, DLRM can be viewed as a time-dependent singular value decomposition; instead of solving the 6D equation, it tracks the dynamics of low-rank factors of the solution, which depend on either the three-dimensional position variable or the three-dimensional velocity variable, thus drastically reducing the computational cost and memory footprint. Our focus will be on the nonlinear collisional kinetic equations for plasmas, allowing us to address a broader range of regimes beyond the collisionless ones. We will design an efficient low-rank ansatz inspired by various asymptotic limits of plasma kinetic equations such that the method only requires a few ranks in the limiting regime and is as efficient as solving the reduced fluid models. We will also study the uniform stability and longtime behavior of DLRM rigorously, justifying the method's robustness for treating multiscale problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gradually, it was realized that the algebraic invariants called cohomology theories could themselves be represented by geometric objects, known as spectra. A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra (representing objects for multiplicative cohomology theories) which are suitable for performing constructions directly analogous to those of classical algebra. This move has turned out to be incredibly fruitful, both by providing invariants which shed new light on old questions as well as by raising new questions which have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. This research proposal studies such constructions in algebraic K-theory, the newly emerging field of Floer homotopy theory, and the foundations of equivariant stable homotopy theory. Broader impacts include workforce development in the form of graduate student advising, undergraduate and postdoc mentorship, high school mathematical science project mentorship, conference organization, and development of new education and training programs.<br/><br/>This proposal describes a broad research program to study a wide variety of problems in homotopy theory, geometry, and arithmetic. The PIs' prior work gives a complete description of the homotopy groups of algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectral at odd primes and a canonical identification of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace via a spectral lift of Tate-Poitou duality. In this proposal, the PIs describe a vast expansion of that argument to study the fiber of the cyclotomic trace on more general rings and schemes over algebraic p-integers in number fields and a related K-theory question more generally for other kinds of Artin duality. The prior work also leads to a new approach to the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture based on Bkstedt-Hsiang-Madsen's geometric Soule embedding that the PIs propose to study. The PIs' recent work with Yuan established a theory of topological cyclic homology (TC) relative to MU-algebras, where there are many interesting computations to explore. Prior work of PI Blumberg with Abouzaid building a Morava K-theory Floer homotopy type has opened new lines of research in Floer homotopy theory; this already has been used to resolve old conjectures in symplectic geometry. The PIs propose to extend this construction to its natural generality, building the homotopy type over MUP and KU and rigidifying the multiplication. They propose to obtain spectral models of deformed operations on quantum cohomology (i.e., quantum Steenrod operations). This work will have myriad applications in symplectic geometry and potentially have transformative impact on the Floer homotopy theory program. The PIs propose to resolve the longstanding confusion about the role of multiplicative norm maps in equivariant stable homotopy theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. This requires a new foundation for factorization homology and will lead to genuine equivariant factorization homology for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. In prior work, the PIs identified previously unknown multiplicative transfers on geometric fixed points of G-commutative ring spectra. The PIs propose to study how these fit into the foundations of G-symmetric monoidal categories; a first step is to establish new multiplicative splittings that have the feel of multiplicative versions of the tom Dieck splitting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global sustainability concerns demand greater alloy versatility, longer part durability, greater reduction of the amounts of energy used during Al processing, and higher material recycling rate. To this end, addressing current alloy limitations is a priority. Here, the project will focus on model Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys whose commercial counterparts are widely used in the transportation industry with the objective to understand the fundamental mechanisms controlling the development of strength and formability during processing. The combination of these main properties is required for the fabrication and durability of Al components. Such understanding will help make Al alloys both stronger and more formable, improve alloy versatility by tailoring thermo-mechanical treatments to alloy compositions to achieve desired mechanical properties, and contribute to the development of physics-based models in support of accelerated material development, manufacturability, and deployment. The proposed GOALI project will benefit from the expertise of the industrial partner, a leader in aluminum transformation. This university / industry collaboration will provide unique interactions, professional development, and internship opportunities for the undergraduate and graduate students working on the project.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Aluminum alloys are used in structural components in many sectors to promote light-weighting and reduce global CO2 emissions. However, global sustainability concerns also demand larger alloy versatility, longer part durability, and higher material recycling rate. To this end, addressing property limitations is a priority. This program will focus on model Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys whose commercial counterparts are widely used in the transportation industry with the objective to understand the fundamental mechanisms controlling the development of strength and formability. Through a systematic approach combining state-of-the-art characterization techniques, this program will elucidate synergies between nanoscale solute clusters that result from heat treatments and/or inevitable natural aging and deformation. Such understanding will also improve alloy versatility and possibly recyclability by enabling the tailoring of thermo-mechanical treatments to alloy compositions to achieve desired mechanical properties. While the proposed program is largely experimental, the findings will support on-going theoretical efforts focused on integrating physics-based knowledge within deformation modeling, from the atomistic to the continuum. Furthermore, the program will contribute to the recruitment, retention, and training in advanced research methods and techniques of a diverse student body and workforce through the proposed research activities, educational and collaborative research interactions and synergies with the industrial partner, opportunities for industrial internships, and activities focusing on increasing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility awareness and practice in the classroom, laboratories, and campus wide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They can address important questions such as the nature of dark matter, the possibility of new particles and interactions at energy scales beyond the Large Hadron Collider and new fundamental symmetries.   The PI will join the GRAND (Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) observatory which has been proposed to study UHE neutrinos.    When these neutrinos enter the atmosphere, they will interact and produce large particle showers that will emit radio signals.   GRAND will detect these emissions with the most extensive array of radio antennas ever assembled.   There are several projects in the proposal that will each have significant student participation and will be accessible to undergraduates as well as Masters students at a Hispanic-serving institution.<br/><br/><br/>The proposal consists of three projects for the GRAND observatory.    This observatory has the potential to make major contributions to multi-messenger astronomy.    It will detect much-awaited cosmogenic neutrinos and distinguish the contributions of newborn pulsars, AGNs, afterglows of gamma-ray bursts and galaxy clusters.   The three projects will make ample use of modern Machine Learning techniques to develop software and various statistical tools for the detection and analysis of UHE neutrinos.   They will implement a fast and accurate model parameter regression framework for the reconstruction of air showers using modern optimization algorithms, efficient disentangle real radio signals from background noise by configuring and training a Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder and will use modern Machine Learning methods to build a fast and accurate emulator for radio emissions from extensive air showers.

While significant advancements have been made in the development of materials to enhance electrode performance, further progress relies on a comprehensive understanding of key thermodynamic and kinetic processes at the nanoscale that govern electrochemical behavior. Metal oxides have emerged as promising electrode materials and optimizing nanostructured metal oxides in terms of their composition, morphology, electroconductivity, and defect chemistry offers a significant avenue for improving the charge storage mechanisms. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project aims to study the influence of hydrogen on the growth of metal oxide nanostructures, with the ultimate goal of enhancing electrode performance in energy storage devices. The project will address a significant research gap by focusing on the synthesis and fabrication of metal oxide for use in high-energy capacity electrodes. The research not only addresses key challenges in energy storage technology, but also contributes to the advancement of clean energy initiatives, supporting national efforts for a sustainable future. This ERI project will also develop educational and early research engagement activities at Kennesaw State by increasing the participation of freshmen undergraduate students in research, engaging the research group in outreach activities to mentor high-school students, and integrating the research outcomes in undergraduate and graduate curriculum.<br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the role of hydrogen on the growth of multiphase and single-phase metal oxide nanostructures to enhance the electrode performance in energy storage devices. This research will develop a novel approach to promote high aspect ratio nanostructures by utilizing hydrogen diffusion and oxide defects to achieve high surface area electrodes with superior performance. While preliminary findings indicate that hydrogen diffusion influences nanostructure morphology, the mechanism of hydrogen diffusion and charge transport in metal oxide remains unknown. To achieve this goal, the project will conduct fundamental research on two fronts: 1) understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen diffusion towards controlled oxide growth, and 2) evaluating the electrochemical performance of the developed electrodes to achieve superior charge storage capacity. Understanding hydrogen-assisted growth in metal oxides will enable the development of a novel method for creating ordered electrode architecture with a binder free array of electrode platform for high and fast energy storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, their perceptions of stereotypical STEM culture are incongruent with such values and discourages consideration of STEM education/careers. This is commonly referred to as Goal Congruity Theory. Not only does this incongruity discourage consideration of STEM education/careers, it also thwarts efforts to broaden participation of HMM in STEM. In fact, despite the countless resources invested to broaden participation in engineering, women and Hispanic, LatinX/e/a/o, XicanX/e/a/o peoples, inclusive of their intersectionalities (HLX+), represent only 16% and 9% of the college educated engineering workforce, respectively. Although, the efforts have resulted in an increased share of engineering Bachelor?s degrees awarded to women (24%) and HLX+ (14%) over the years, women and HLX+ are still unacceptably underrepresented in the college educated engineering workforce. Considerable research has explored engineering identity development as a potential solution to address many of the issues facing engineering education. However, critiques of the narrow focus of the literature (e.g., identification with the profession itself, historical definitions of the profession) disclose that none ask students to connect their beliefs, values, or other aspects of identity to engineering. Engineering identity may support recruitment and retention efforts, but it is wanting if the central goal is to broaden participation and increase diversity because individuals? backgrounds (e.g., ethnic, racial, cultural, gender, sexual preference, historical) and their associated beliefs and values are not even considered in many of the engineering identity constructs. Therefore, in alignment with the National Science Foundation?s Broadening Participation in Engineering program, this project intends to enable and encourage the participation of all citizens in the engineering enterprise by challenging these patterns. <br/><br/>This project will take on a holistic approach to enhance ?servingness? at HSIs and beyond by creating an identity affirming culture in engineering education. Hispanic, LatinX/e/a/o, XicanX/e/a/o undergraduate students, inclusive of their intersectionalities (HLX+), in engineering will participate in a program that nurtures holistic identity development and empowerment informed by Anzaldua?s Path to Conocimiento (i.e., Conocimiento). Path to Conocimiento is framework that contributes to their making meaning of the transitional journey that naturally occurs during higher education. Students will engage in autoethnographic inquiry to make meaning of their experiences as HLX+ in engineering education and then identify where and how they can dismantle cultural barriers or transform hegemonic structures. The Conocimiento will also provide the context to explore HLX+ Cultural, Community, Racial, Ethnic (CCoRE) values. The research component, using a combination of qualitative and participatory research methods, will seek to answer: (1) What are the salient CCoRE values that HLX+ undergrads bring with them into their engineering education?; (2) Where and how do HLX+ undergrads experience conflicts with their CCoRE values during their engineering education?; and (3) How do HLX+ undergrads navigate conflicts with their CCoRE values when empowered with their own conocimiento? This new knowledge will be used to develop a workshop to inspire and aid faculty to create an identity affirming culture within their research teams and/or in their classes, departments, and beyond. Ultimately, this project seeks to (1) empower students to recognize and disrupt hegemonic engineering education structures and, by extension, the profession, (2) dismantle cultural barriers that dissuade historically minoritized and marginalized people from participating in engineering education/careers, and (3) transform the dominant engineering culture by inspiring radically inclusive values, particularly among faculty and HLX+.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How do they learn word meanings amidst the chaos and clutter of daily life? The context ? where, when, and how words are spoken ? is known to support infants? word learning. Infants connect the words they hear to the accompanying context, including what they see, the location, and social cues from caregivers (e.g., the word ?cup? is often spoken in kitchens, at mealtimes, with a cup in view). Such context cues help infants learn words. However, the role that infants? own motor actions play in generating context cues remains unclear. Infants are not passive recipients of the language input they receive. Rather, infants? motor actions often direct the conversation (e.g., an infant draws with crayons and their caregiver responds by saying, ?are you drawing a picture??). The goal of this project is to address two open questions: (1) Over the course of their development, are infants? motor skill acquisitions related to the specific words they learn? (2) Does language input that aligns with infants? motor actions facilitate word learning? The knowledge gained from this project stands to inform theories of language development that consider infants? rapidly developing motor skills. Additionally, this project will provide in-depth research training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, this project seeks to generate a longitudinal, fully annotated video dataset of a diverse sample of infants and their caregivers, creating opportunities for data reuse and replication.<br/><br/>Aim 1 of the project is to describe the naturalistic coordination between infants? actions and caregivers? language longitudinally across 2.5 years. Infants and their caregivers are video recorded at home for two hours during their typical daily routines over five sessions occurring at infants? 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 month anniversaries. The research team aims to identify caregivers? spontaneous language input, infants? motor actions, and infants? vocabulary growth. Aim 2 of the project is to experimentally test whether action-language coordination facilitates in-the-moment word learning. The experimental setting involves measuring outcomes of novel word learning when infants hear the labels for novel objects synchronously with their actions or receive the same labelling input not synchronized to their actions.

One of the greatest scientific triumphs of this century was the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.   This made the Standard Model complete and self-consistent.   However, there remain several phenomena that the Standard Model does not explain, including dark matter, the existence of matter instead of antimatter, the huge disparity between the strength of the non-gravitational forces and that of gravity, etc.     Many of these phenomena can be explained by extending the Standard Model and popular extensions involve additional Higgs bosons.   The PI proposes to search for these additional Higgs bosons at the Large Hadron Collider as part of the ATLAS Collaboration.   He has identified a particular signature that has not been thoroughly studied and proposes to do a complete analysis of this signature.   The project is accessible to undergraduates and the PI will recruit several students to work on the computational aspects and travel to CERN to work with others in the collaboration.   An important aspect of this Collaboration is the Open Data project, which releases data, simulation and analysis tools to the public, and the PI will work with undergraduates as well as local high school teachers to develop this material.    His institution, CSU Stanislaus, is a Hispanic-serving institution which is largely first-generation and low-income.<br/><br/><br/>Many extensions of the Standard Model involve additional singlet or doublet scalar fields which then predict the existence of new scalar bosons similar to the Higgs boson and which might mix with the Standard Model Higgs.   The PI proposes to search for a class of these scalars using data from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, focusing on resonant scalar production in the highly sensitive 2-bottom quark, 2- tau final state.   The search will include developing selection criteria to separate signal from background, estimating background processes using data-driven techniques and developing machine-learning methods to reconstruct and identify the 2-tau signature arising from a resonance of an unknown mass.   There are several distinct projects, including a signal Monte Carlo Simulation, signal Topology, Trigger Efficiency, Missing Mass Calculator and Signal Selection.   Undergraduates will be able to play an active role in all of these projects. Although a search has been studied by the CMS Collaboration, it has not yet been done by ATLAS which might provide stronger limits (or a discovery).

The two collaborating laboratories bring together synergistic expertise in new spin physics (Goodson) and NMR instrumentation (Chekmenev). The Goodson/Chekmenev team is developing new, inexpensive, and easy-to-perform means of enhancing nuclear magnetization - a sensitivity-limiting factor in many NMR, MRI, and nuclear science applications, including: diagnostic tests for a host of diseases; chemical and materials analysis and quantification; and the creation of substances and devices used to measure fundamental interactions in physics.  Anticipated cost savings can also make these methods more available for other lab settings, particularly those that have more limited research infrastructure and/or that feature undergraduate research.  Several students are involved, gaining exposure to highly interdisciplinary training.  The team is also engaged in efforts to recruit undergraduate students and provide them with research opportunities on both campuses; and to provide enriching hands-on magnetic resonance activities for elementary and high school students with the goal of increasing the numbers and diversity of students ultimately exploring careers in science.<br/><br/>The NMR/MRI approaches being used in this collaborative research project are based on Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange, or SABRE.  In SABRE, an organometallic catalyst is used to co-locate parahydrogen and a target molecule (substrate) within a transient complex. With properly matched external magnetic fields, nuclear spin order can transfer spontaneously and efficiently from parahydrogen to the substrate, giving rise to NMR and MRI signals that are increased by several orders of magnitude.  Work by the Goodson/Chekmenev team seeks to: (i) improve the understanding of SABRE processes involving complex spin networks under homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic conditions?and at ultra-low fields?to achieve improved hyperpolarization of key substrate classes; (ii) leverage what is learned to achieve high spin polarization in both protons and key heteronuclei (e.g. 117Sn, 15N, and 13C) prepared continuously, in large volumes, and consistently over long durations to enable new types of experiments (including for neutron science); and (iii) exploit spin networks to enable novel modes of NMR/MRI read-out, including through-proton detection and MR imaging of hyperpolarized heteronuclei and RASER (Radio Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)-based NMR/MRI sensing of hyperpolarized media?with the potential to enormously improve the sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution of measurements of chemical reactions, including potentially in living tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of this, legumes are important plants in agriculture as both a food source and a way to naturally fertilize soils. Although the legume plant family has many species, for many of these species, there is no information about their partnerships with rhizobial bacteria. This project will look at the diversity of partnerships between legumes and rhizobial bacteria to solve whether legume species can have few or many bacterial types living within their roots. This research is important for sustainable agriculture and the bioeconomy. The project will also provide training to students underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>As a team of community and ecosystem ecologists, the researchers will assess the diversity of compatible rhizobial strains associated with a wide variety of legume species that naturally occur in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem of the United States. The identities of rhizobial strains nodulating with each legume species will be determined in a two-stage process. First, a subset of rhizobial strains will be collected from legume roots, cultured, and whole genome sequences obtained. These strains will then be tested in a greenhouse assay to determine the ability of each legume species to form associations with each rhizobial strain. In addition to assessing the rhizobial diversity associated with each legume species tested, the researchers will identify genetic markers that can be used to identify rhizobial diversity in future. This information will directly improve ecosystem theory on the drivers of nitrogen fixation, eco-evolutionary theory on the maintenance of mutualisms, and community theory on coexistence and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is not only the largest operator theory in the world, but it is also considered the premier event that connects operator theory to other disciplines that employ operator theoretic techniques and related mathematical results. IWOTA 2024 will be devoted to all aspects of operator theory and its applications and will feature top researchers from all around the world. Having such a major event organized in Canterbury will also provide a unique opportunity to reinforce research ties between some of the best experts in the field in the United States and the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>Many problems in physics, mathematics, and engineering can be best described by representing complex physical entities as large arrays of numbers and mathematical symbols called matrices. Matrices help us visualize how linear transformations act on vector spaces; determining their structure reveals important properties of the transformations. Hilbert space operators are infinite-dimensional generalizations of matrices. The generalization of a vector is often a function, so operators are frequently modeled as multiplications on spaces of functions. IWOTA 2024 will consist of ten plenary speakers, eleven semi-plenary speakers, and several special sessions. The topics of the special sessions include harmonic analysis and related areas, orthogonal polynomials and special functions, Jordan algebra structures, differential operators and mathematical physics, multivariable operator theory, hypercomplex analysis, free analysis and convexity, quantum information, noncommutative geometry and operator spaces, random matrices and free probability, finite and infinite dimensional moment problems, Herglotz functions and composite materials, linear algebra and control theory, systems theory/control theory, numerical ranges, spectral problems and computation, positive operators and their dynamics, operator semigroups and evolution equations, fractional calculus operators, operators on Banach spaces and lattices, operator theory on analytic function spaces, special matrices, and operator theory and applications.

Information about which trees are best to plant to help reduce air pollution can inform decisions about tree planting in parks and urban areas.<br/><br/>This project includes both field measurements and laboratory experiments with the objectives of assessing: (1) the uncertainties in the emission rates and composition of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in urban areas, and (2) the particle deposition efficiency on different types of leaves and needles (particle deposition leaf resistance). The results will provide a survey of the BVOC emission rates and composition of the top 10 major tree species located in Los Angeles parks and streets and generate a range of different particle leaf resistance values that can be integrated with a resistance framework for particle dry deposition parameterizations. Box modeling will be used to quantify the net effect of urban trees on atmospheric particle number concentrations, size distributions, and mass loadings under a range of urban greening and climate scenarios.

The two collaborating laboratories bring together synergistic expertise in new spin physics (Goodson) and NMR instrumentation (Chekmenev). The Goodson/Chekmenev team is developing new, inexpensive, and easy-to-perform means of enhancing nuclear magnetization - a sensitivity-limiting factor in many NMR, MRI, and nuclear science applications, including: diagnostic tests for a host of diseases; chemical and materials analysis and quantification; and the creation of substances and devices used to measure fundamental interactions in physics.  Anticipated cost savings can also make these methods more available for other lab settings, particularly those that have more limited research infrastructure and/or that feature undergraduate research.  Several students are involved, gaining exposure to highly interdisciplinary training.  The team is also engaged in efforts to recruit undergraduate students and provide them with research opportunities on both campuses; and to provide enriching hands-on magnetic resonance activities for elementary and high school students with the goal of increasing the numbers and diversity of students ultimately exploring careers in science.<br/><br/>The NMR/MRI approaches being used in this collaborative research project are based on Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange, or SABRE.  In SABRE, an organometallic catalyst is used to co-locate parahydrogen and a target molecule (substrate) within a transient complex. With properly matched external magnetic fields, nuclear spin order can transfer spontaneously and efficiently from parahydrogen to the substrate, giving rise to NMR and MRI signals that are increased by several orders of magnitude.  Work by the Goodson/Chekmenev team seeks to: (i) improve the understanding of SABRE processes involving complex spin networks under homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic conditions?and at ultra-low fields?to achieve improved hyperpolarization of key substrate classes; (ii) leverage what is learned to achieve high spin polarization in both protons and key heteronuclei (e.g. 117Sn, 15N, and 13C) prepared continuously, in large volumes, and consistently over long durations to enable new types of experiments (including for neutron science); and (iii) exploit spin networks to enable novel modes of NMR/MRI read-out, including through-proton detection and MR imaging of hyperpolarized heteronuclei and RASER (Radio Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)-based NMR/MRI sensing of hyperpolarized media?with the potential to enormously improve the sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution of measurements of chemical reactions, including potentially in living tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal of solving inverse problems is to use measurements to estimate the parameters of physical models. Being able to solve inverse problems efficiently, accurately, and with quantifiable certainty remains an open challenge. Randomized algorithms have made several advances in numerical linear algebra due to their ability to dramatically reduce computational costs without significantly compromising the accuracy of the computations. However, there is a rich and relatively unexplored field of research that lies between randomized numerical linear algebra and inverse problems, in particular for dynamic and hierarchical problems, where randomization can and should be exploited in unique ways. This project will address fundamental issues in the development of computationally efficient solvers for inverse problems and uncertainty quantification. The project will also train graduate students on start-of-the-art randomized algorithms. <br/><br/>The project will develop new and efficient randomized algorithms for mitigating the computational burdens of two types of inverse problems: hierarchical Bayesian inverse problems and dynamical inverse problems. The two main thrusts of this project are (i) to develop efficient algorithms to quantify the uncertainty of the hyperparameters that govern Bayesian inverse problems, and (ii) to develop new iterative methods that leverage randomization to efficiently approximate solutions and enable uncertainty quantification for large-scale inverse problems. This project will advance knowledge in the field of randomized algorithms for computational inverse problems and uncertainty quantification.

Many data from these applications share three common and salient features: (i) they can be represented as tensors (multi-dimensional arrays), (ii) they are generated over time and exhibit dynamic relationship, and (iii) the values of the data are binary, counts, proportions etc. Such diverse data types, which are referred to as the non-Gaussian tensor time series, call urgently for the development of more adaptable analytical tools. The investigators introduce a general, flexible and efficient framework for the modeling, interpretation and prediction for such non-Gaussian tensor time series through dynamic factor models. The dynamic factor models contain an observation layer specified for the generation of the non-Gaussian observations, and a latent layer to account for the dynamic and concurrent dependence. They are capable of extracting dynamic information, enhancing comprehension of underlying mechanisms, and generating reliable forecasts, and are therefore poised to assist organizations and policymakers in making well-informed decisions. The project advances education through the research training of both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as its incorporation into special topic courses. <br/><br/>A novel dynamic matrix factor model for non-Gaussian data marks a significant advancement in modeling large and complex dependent data. These models effectively tackle challenges arising from the size, complexity, and discreteness of the data. More specifically, the dynamic is introduced in the hidden layer through the factor structure with tensor Tucker or CP decompositions, and a nonlinear or generalized linear model (Poisson, negative binomial, Gamma, zero-inflated, etc) is employed in the observation layer for the generation of the observations. An autocovariance-based approach is used for the estimation of the loading matrices and vectors, which takes advantage of the temporal dependence to reduce the bias. A tensor autoregressive model is imposed on the factors to enable the forecasting. For the estimation of the autoregressive model, again an autocovariance-based procedure is used to mitigate the impact of the estimation error of factors. This approach's computational efficiency is particularly well suited for handling big and complex data. The methodology and theoretical analysis lay the groundwork for applying the moment method in broader models and applications. Furthermore, the methodology underscores the significance of the ""blessing of dependence"" phenomenon, demonstrating how the temporal dependence can be utilized to enhance/reduce the signal/noise to achieve more accurate estimation, compared to the corresponding works under the IID setting. It is noteworthy that the framework accommodates extensions to more general distributions, and the developed methodology has broad applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While we know much about how children use various digital media devices, little is known about what children expect to learn from digital media and how those expectations, in turn, inform their actual learning. This is important to understand as developmental science indicates what children already know and what they expect plays a crucial role in how they pay attention, explore, and learn from the world around them. Given the increasing use of technology to teach Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, both inside and outside the classroom, the proposed research intends to explore how early media experiences shape children?s expectations of learning from digital media devices and how those expectations impact their learning of STEM content. The plan is to share the results of this research widely with the local community, aiming to help families design educational experiences tailored to the needs and challenges of children growing up in today?s tech-driven learning environment and ensuring learning from digital media devices is as effective as possible. The STEM Ed PRF postdoctoral program aims to support projects that advance the development of theories, knowledge, and practices in STEM education that will benefit learners and the broader community.<br/><br/>As technology advances and the age of first exposure to digital media decreases, it becomes imperative to evaluate how diverse media experiences impact learning. Despite extensive research characterizing children?s diverse media use, it remains unclear how these diverse experiences shape young children?s educational expectations to learn from digital media and how those expectations, in turn, influence their learning outcomes. Given the increase in the use of technology to facilitate STEM learning in formal and informal learning environments (Vahidy, 2019) and a large body of research showing that expectations influence and guide learning (e.g., Brod & Shing, 2022; Persaud et al., 2019; 2021; Stahl & Feigenson, 2015; 2017; see Brod & Shing, 2016 for further review), it is important to examine how diverse media experiences relate to children?s expectations to learn from media devices and how those expectations influence their STEM learning outcomes. Using a combination of behavioral, physiological, and computational approaches, this project intends to 1) examine the contextual factors that might shape children?s expectations about the educational value of digital media devices, 2) investigate if science learning outcomes differ based on children?s endorsement of digital media as a learning tool, 3) test whether children?s science learning from media can be impacted by simple one-time instructions to use a digital media device ?to learn? versus ?just for fun,? and 4) explore whether explicit trial-by-trial instructions can change children?s media expectations, increasing the likelihood that children will endorse diverse media as tools for learning. The goal of this research program, integrating educational media, cognitive development, computational modeling, and physiological measures, is to encourage the use of underutilized analytical toolkits to answer existing empirical questions and create new ones about the interplay between children?s diverse media experiences, media beliefs, and STEM learning, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of children?s media-based learning.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the subtle instrumental effects and finding ways to cope with them ? through innovative hardware or software improvements ? is needed to unlock the potential of low frequency radio astronomy. This project will build local expertise and capabilities at a predominantly undergraduate institution to support an accessible radio astronomy observatory in the rural Midwest. Three student researchers will be hired each year.  In addition to enhancing their astronomy education, the students will gain a wide array of transferable skills including high performance computing, electronic design, RF testing, system engineering, data analysis, statistics, and algorithmic development. <br/><br/>The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) Swarm is a novel concept to build several radio interferometers across the continent. Each station will operate independently with capabilities to study stellar bursts, pulsars, and the ionosphere. But the real capability of the Swarm is enabled when the stations operate together as a long baseline interferometer. The resulting instrument will have sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies below the FM band, opening opportunities to study magnetic fields of extra-solar planets and resolve the scattering disks of pulsars. Over the course of five years, this project will establish the Midwest Minnesota site for the observatory and perform a variety of demonstrations and experiments that will enhance future proposals to build a larger scale facility. The observatory will provide opportunities for U.S. based researchers to perform ad hoc instrumentation experiments as well as host a station for a continental scale interferometer. Furthermore, the location will add significant value to the point spread function of the LWA Swarm by providing a much-needed North-South baseline and improving sky coverage at high latitudes to open the possibility of continuous observing of the north celestial pole.  A low-barrier testbed site will enable fast development of technologies to progress larger experiments in high-priority science fields, while giving low-cost hands-on field experience to students, particularly undergraduates where research experiences have significant impact on retention and views toward STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kinetic theory serves as a bridge between these two approaches, utilizing probabilistic tools within the position-velocity space, also known as the phase space, to establish a mesoscopic description. The probability density of particles present in the phase space satisfies the Boltzmann-type or the Landau-type equations, which are evolutionary nonlinear partial differential equations.

While payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning network help to overcome their inherent limitations with respect to payment throughput and transaction speed, the reliability of such off-chain payments is not guaranteed, especially for participating individuals with limited abilities to allocate large capital amounts to establish payment channels. So-called multipart payments have the potential to ensure reliable, cheap payments within PCNs, but to reach their full potential, require the solution of non-standard optimization problems which are challenging for currently available optimization algorithms and solvers.

The resulting algorithms will also of useful for urban planners, in particular in the context of public transportation and road systems.

While there has been significant progress made in the understanding of light scattering by particles of different sizes and shapes, there is still significant uncertainty introduced when those particles are inhomogeneous or roughened, such as in cases with coated dust particles.  This award will advance a methodology that will improve light-scattering modeling capabilities through new approaches that will allow for the consideration of the effect of non-sphericity and inhomogeneity on particle optical properties.  The results of the research will not only be important for atmospheric applications, but potentially for bio-optics, planetary science, astrophysics, and ocean sciences.  The project will include training of an early-career researcher and graduate student in light scattering research.<br/><br/>Prior studies have found that the surface roughness and inhomogeneity of particles have a non-negligible impact on particle optical properties and will inevitably introduce large uncertainties to downstream applications such as remote sensing and radiative transfer simulations in climate studies. However, the current light-scattering modeling approaches are far less accurate and far more inefficient than they need to be for obtaining realistic optical properties. The primary goal of this award is to develop light-scattering modeling capabilities for inhomogeneous and roughened particles with small-to-large sizes and arbitrary shapes. The first major objective is to develop an analytical solution for two-layer spheroids. The second major objective is to modify/improve the invariant imbedding T-matrix method (IITM) ? physical-geometric optics model (PGOM) approach and make it more accurate and efficient for particles with roughened surfaces and other inhomogeneities. The new model will be used to study the hypothesis that particle microscopic surface roughness and ensemble-averaged macroscopic shape irregularity, if appropriately defined, have the same effect on optical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One desirable goal of this optimization is to maximize the stability of a system, to avoid designs for which small disturbances can get magnified until failure occurs.  This project will study new approaches for assessing such stability, including a technique for simultaneously analyzing an entire ensemble of systems across a range of design variables, rather than analyzing individual systems one at a time.  These techniques involve the symbiotic interplay of data and mathematical models. The project will involve graduate student training and professional development through summer research and capstone projects for Virginia Tech?s Computational Modeling and Data Analytics major.<br/><br/>Nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NLEVPs) arise naturally in many applications throughout science and engineering, from networks of vibrating structures to dynamical systems with time delays.  In contrast to the linear eigenvalue problem, algorithms for solving NLEVPs remain in an unsettled state due to the fundamental challenges these problems pose.  This project approaches NLEVPs through the lens of control theory, identifying contour-based eigenvalue algorithms as examples of system realization techniques. Given this perspective, this research program seeks to develop robust, reliable algorithms and software for NLEVPs, with an eye toward optimal parameter selection and efficiency for large-scale problems. This analysis and computational methods will be extended to handle parameter-dependent NLEVPs, where the problem varies based on one or more physical parameters.

Although the words river or stream elicit images of permanent flowing water, most rivers and streams worldwide are not permanent. The immediate impacts of drying are often apparent (e.g., loss of water, dead fish), but less visually obvious effects of drying persist after water returns. A fish cannot live in water alone - it needs all the elements that make up its body and a suitable chemically balanced environment. But water returning to dried sediments kicks off multiple interacting chemical processes leading to the creation of a uniquely complex multi-elemental soup. Despite this complexity, studies of post-refill aquatic systems generally only chronicle surges of single elements (such as iron) rather than the 20-plus elements required for essential biological functions. Although life is similarly a complex combination of interacting chemical reactions, its recipe is far more constrained by what combinations and amounts of elements can sustain biological functions. These constraints lead to organisms having to constantly balance their internal elemental composition and altering that of their environment. This research will measure how prior drying events affect waterbodies after they refill through changes in biologically important elements and their effects on aquatic life in a warming world. It will also establish a critical foundation for understanding and predicting complex responses of aquatic systems to the consequences of global climate change. This education-research program directly involves the next generation of high school students from the largest school district in Kansas (USD 259) who are primarily from underrepresented and underserved communities (>70% come from homes of poverty). Students will receive hands-on scientific training, collect and analyze real-time environmental data, and earn college credit as part of a newly created field ecology course (dual listed with Wichita State University). Student-collected data will also be used to create five free-to-the-public lessons on data literacy geared towards helping high school students meet Next Generation Science Standards. These lessons will be produced as a collaboration between a professional education studio (Galactic Polymath), five paid high school teacher fellows, and WSU researchers on the project.<br/><br/>A more complete understanding of how global climate change affects organisms in recovering ecosystems requires understanding of: (1) the large-scale generalities in how suites of elements (ionomes) jointly change in response to drying and rewetting; (2) how these changes affect organism-ecosystem feedbacks of elemental cycling; and (3) how these effects change with temperature. This program will expand our understanding in these areas, produce a trove of open access ionomic data and lay the foundation for future empirical-theoretical frameworks around multi-element dynamics across thermal regimes in functioning ecosystems. These experiments draw on the PI?s experience across taxa (single-celled organisms to vertebrates) to link responses in controlled laboratory experiments, more realistic but controllable outdoor mesocosms, and field-based studies of intermittent streams in the Flint Hills of Kansas. Research objectives at every level evaluate the interactive effects of changing climate forcers (drying and warming) on linked elemental cycles and their effects on organismal fitness. It is vital that we understand responses to multiple changing climate forcers while accounting for the broader context (e.g., post-refill water chemistry and community composition) of the ecosystem within which those organisms must function. These ambitious experiments span spatial and taxonomic scales beyond typical manipulative experiments in dynamic systems. The experiments and the data produced will be foundational to our understanding of how interdependent elements (the ionome) respond to environmental change and interact synergistically with organisms.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Population and Community Ecology (PCE) Program in the Division of Environmental Biology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Controlling the alloy composition, and thus the microstructure, influences the properties of the final product. The current approach to controlling the alloy composition during the 3D printing of a part is to use individual metal powders and melt them together using a high-power laser beam. Laser melting can lead to undesirable residual stress, distortion, and cracking in the manufactured part, however, and digital printing with metal precursor inks can avoid these issues. This process uses chemical reactions and modest heat to form metal alloy structures. The research focuses understanding the how the process of fabricating metal alloy structures with different elemental ratios by dispensing individual metal precursor inks using an inkjet printer affects the properties and performance of resulting parts. This work has the potential to substantially reduce the cost associated with metal additive manufacturing, by moving way from expensive Laser 3D printing machines and toward Inkjet printers that use metal precursor inks. These Inkjet printers could be used in small-scale industries, teaching institutions, and workshop activities. Additive manufacturing by digital alloying can open the door to new applications in many industrial sectors which benefits the U.S. economy. The project provides training opportunities in engineering for female and under-represented minority students, encourages presentations at conferences, and stimulates interest in STEM among K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project aims to involve research that gains insight into the digital printing of alloy structures of desired composition by ex-situ mixing of individual metal precursor inks in appropriate proportions. The mixing is done on a substrate after jetting the inks. Printing with metal precursor inks uses a bottom-up chemical/modest heat route to form the metal alloy structures as opposed to top-down physical/high temperature route used by laser 3D printers. Despite the large body of work on printing metallic inks, mixing two or more metal precursor inks to form an alloy has not been thoroughly explored. This project develops an understanding of thermally induced reduction of multi-metal precursor inks and decomposition of the metal complexes along with the nucleation and growth processes. The reduction temperatures are determined by thermogravimetric analysis. By obtaining a better understanding of the degree of mixing after jetting and how multi-metal precursor inks are reduced, researchers can more effectively predict and manufacture multi-metal functional metal alloy parts with desired microstructures. The project has the potential to create a library of metal precursor inks with different compositions and properties, which can be used to print and sinter a variety of multi-functional components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing effective methods for testing complex materials to detect structural defects or identify unknown targets efficiently and with minimal a priori information is highly desirable. This need is particularly pronounced for materials exhibiting directional properties, multi-periodicities with non-commensurable periods, nonlinear interactions with probing waves, or peculiar geometric structures, all prevalent in modern applications across the mentioned domains. This project involves the development of novel techniques in inverse scattering theory to address contemporary imaging challenges, aiming for reliable target signatures or useful information about examined objects in computationally efficient ways. The objective is to reduce reliance on a priori information describing the physics and geometry of targets, as well as on mathematical and computational complexities arising from complex background environments.  Graduate students will be trained and participate in this research. <br/><br/>This project will investigate a non-iterative approach for solving inverse scattering problems for both linear and nonlinear inhomogeneous media.   The generalized linear sampling method and interior eigenvalues form the unified mathematical framework for four interconnected projects. 1) Imaging of Inhomogeneous Media with Interior Eigenvalues: Motivated by the theory of transmission eigenvalues, the investigator and collaborators have developed a framework for modifying the scattering data, leading to new eigenvalue problems related to injectivity of the relative scattering operator. These eigenvalues are determined from scattering data and show versatile potential to image changes/faults in the media. The goal of this project is to address mathematical and computational questions in this framework to broaden the applicability of these techniques to anisotropic/absorbing/dispersive media, meta-surfaces, and clusters of defects. 2) Transmission Eigenvalues and Non-scattering Phenomena: A fundamental challenge in scattering theory is whether incoming time harmonic waves at a particular wave number are not scattered by a given inhomogeneity. The investigator will address mathematical questions on this topic involving non-selfadjoint spectral theory and free boundary regularity. These questions are important in applications since at a non-scattering wave number, the scattering operator is not injective. 3) Qualitative and Spectral Imaging Approach for Nonlinear Media: This project aims to establish mathematical foundations of inverse scattering for second-order harmonic generation in nonlinear optics as well as to develop the generalized linear sampling method and related spectral imaging for this model. This approach is promising for nonlinear models since it does not require solving the nonlinear partial differential equations. 4) Scattering by Almost-periodic Layers and Imaging of Local Defects: Periodicity plays an important role in the engineering of exotic materials in contemporary applications. Mathematically, almost periodic coefficients in the equations that govern wave propagation are viewed as traces along a hyperplane with an irrational normal of higher-dimensional periodic functions. This leads to a degenerate augmented principal differential operator in the model. Having understood the direct scattering problem, the investigator plans to extend the generalized linear sampling method to reconstruct local perturbation within an almost periodic layer without knowing a priori the almost periodic coefficients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AI has brought promise and peril to nearly every aspect of human life. Nurturing AI engineers who can design AI systems responsibly has become a key objective from business and policy perspectives. For engineering educators committed to supporting students to become competent and responsible engineers, thoughtful consideration of how to effectively incorporate ethical principles into the classroom is paramount. However, translating existing research-based AI ethics tools, such as ethics principles, into engineering practice and education is not easy. Ethical principles are often too abstract to be integrated into design practices, as they do not provide clear explanations or procedural details on how they can be integrated into technical practice. Therefore, scholars have recently called for a transition in AI ethics research toward a translational approach, which focuses on ensuring that AI practitioners can implement AI ethics tools such as ethical principles into actual AI systems designs. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence for the extent to which engineers integrate these ethical principles into their daily practices of AI developers, which generates challenges for engineering educators to incorporate these resources into their own teaching and educational research.<br/><br/>This research aims to advance the fundamental knowledge of the formation of future AI engineers poised to innovate responsibly and construct advanced engineering systems empowered by AI technologies. It will investigate a practical competency critical for socially responsible AI engineering. This includes translational ethical competency, or the ability to translate general ethical principles and values into specific decisions in AI engineering practices in the day-to-day work of AI engineers. To achieve this, researchers from diverse backgrounds including computer science, engineering education, and the ethics of engineering will investigate how to define and cultivate a ?translational competency? that allows engineers to translate general AI ethical principles into engineering practices in AI system designs. This project will address the following key research questions: (1) What processes do AI engineers follow to translate ethical principles into engineering practices? (2) What competencies are critical for translating ethical principles into engineering practices (translational competencies)? and (3) How do AI engineers develop the translational competencies for responsible AI engineering? Answering these research questions is critical to ensure future engineering professionals have sufficient learning opportunities to integrate ethical values into real-world engineering problems. The project aligns with the Research in the Formation of Engineers initiative goal of advancing understanding of the educational and professional formation of engineers. Specifically, the research seeks to improve the development of professional and technical skills in postsecondary education through a more practical approach to engineering ethics and to improve the transition from education settings to the workforce for engineers seeking to use what they learn in ethics courses in their future work. Additionally, this project seeks to improve the relationship between engineering and the public by equipping engineers to more effectively handle real-world challenges related to the ethical deployment of AI, including bias, privacy, and autonomy. This research is thus necessary to improve ethics education for engineers, and to help bridge the gap between classroom and job site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Grayson of Tulane University and Sergei Nazarenko of the University of Southern Mississippi will collaboratively  explore why extremely hydroxylated branched polymers can have very high dielectric constants but very low energy dissipation, and investigate what factors (structural, architectural, physical) allow these polymers to regulate this behavior. If the collaboration can reduce the price of polymers with high dielectric constants and low dielectric losses, these polymers will be critical as the most versatile and inexpensive material platform for advanced dielectric applications, such as in advanced capacitors, actuators, memory elements, and energy storage devices. This effort will include extensive outreach efforts to actively support diversity in science by providing opportunities to members of underrepresented groups at multiple educational levels.  This will include  outreach to predominantly minority high schools and the incorporation of female and underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in these collaborative research laboratories.<br/><br/>Polymers that exhibit high dielectric constant and low dielectric losses are important for various advanced dielectric applications and in particular for energy storage.  Dielectric constant relates to the ability of a material to polarize in response to an applied electrical field. Polarization based on dipole orientation is a predominant mechanism which defines dielectric constant. Unfortunately, most polymers exhibit a rather low dielectric constant. In this project, this problem will be addressed with the help of highly branched hydroxylated polymers. This research team previously discovered that bis-MPA based hydroxylated dendrimers demonstrated record-high dielectric constants and low losses. The high dielectric constant of the dendrimers were attributed to H-bond organization of the terminal hydroxyl groups (dipoles), which exhibit linear coordination and form chain-like OH-OH-OH clusters. The mechanism of polarization in this case depends not just on the value of individual dipole moment of the hydroxyl groups but also on the degree of coordination between neighboring dipoles. The goal is to explore this polarization mechanism as well as to identify new polyhydroxylated branched structures, architectures and topologies that result in further enhancement of the dielectric characteristics. The synthesis-related part of this project produces various 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (bis-MPA) polymers including bis-MPA dendrimers, pseudodendrimers, and dendronized linear polymers.

Grayson of Tulane University and Sergei Nazarenko of the University of Southern Mississippi will collaboratively  explore why extremely hydroxylated branched polymers can have very high dielectric constants but very low energy dissipation, and investigate what factors (structural, architectural, physical) allow these polymers to regulate this behavior. If the collaboration can reduce the price of polymers with high dielectric constants and low dielectric losses, these polymers will be critical as the most versatile and inexpensive material platform for advanced dielectric applications, such as in advanced capacitors, actuators, memory elements, and energy storage devices. This effort will include extensive outreach efforts to actively support diversity in science by providing opportunities to members of underrepresented groups at multiple educational levels.  This will include  outreach to predominantly minority high schools and the incorporation of female and underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in these collaborative research laboratories.<br/><br/>Polymers that exhibit high dielectric constant and low dielectric losses are important for various advanced dielectric applications and in particular for energy storage.  Dielectric constant relates to the ability of a material to polarize in response to an applied electrical field. Polarization based on dipole orientation is a predominant mechanism which defines dielectric constant. Unfortunately, most polymers exhibit a rather low dielectric constant. In this project, this problem will be addressed with the help of highly branched hydroxylated polymers. This research team previously discovered that bis-MPA based hydroxylated dendrimers demonstrated record-high dielectric constants and low losses. The high dielectric constant of the dendrimers were attributed to H-bond organization of the terminal hydroxyl groups (dipoles), which exhibit linear coordination and form chain-like OH-OH-OH clusters. The mechanism of polarization in this case depends not just on the value of individual dipole moment of the hydroxyl groups but also on the degree of coordination between neighboring dipoles. The goal is to explore this polarization mechanism as well as to identify new polyhydroxylated branched structures, architectures and topologies that result in further enhancement of the dielectric characteristics. The synthesis-related part of this project produces various 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (bis-MPA) polymers including bis-MPA dendrimers, pseudodendrimers, and dendronized linear polymers.

Asandei of the University of Connecticut is developing new methods for the precise synthesis of novel fluorinated polymeric materials with complex architectures, as well as exploring the re/upcycling of commercial fluoropolymers.  Fluoropolymers are contrasted to conventional polymers with even simple homo/random fluoropolymers exhibiting outstanding chemical, thermal and flame resistance, biocompatibility, and unique electronic properties which render them important in high-end applications such as battery, aerospace, sensing, medical device, building, construction, and automotive industries.  However, the chemical tools for the precise synthesis of analogous complex fluoropolymer materials (blocks, grafts etc.) are lacking. Thus, the project goals include the development of the required novel chemistry, to explore hitherto unknown and unavailable materials with potentially superior properties and applications leading to the associated societal benefits. This project provides training and education to undergraduate and graduate students, including minority and female students, in synthetic organic, organometallic, and polymer chemistry. The project also has strong industrial impact, important outreach activities, and the results will be broadly disseminated in the scientific literature and national and international meetings.  <br/><br/>While technologically important, fluoropolymers suffer from a number of factors that have hampered new developments. These factors include a combination of very low monomer reactivity, very high propagating polymer chain end reactivity, complex and often hazardous laboratory setups, and the general lack of appropriate polymer chemistry tools (initiators, catalysts, coupling agents etc.). Accordingly, fluoroalkenes remain some of the most challenging monomers for both controlled radical and coordination polymerizations, where manipulation of molecular weight, polydispersity and architecture/sequence are of paramount importance for the emerging properties.  In addition, current re/upcycling of industrial fluoropolymers remain minimal. The proposed research aims at developing innovative and environmentally conscious chemistry (e.g. water, visible light catalysis etc.), to overcome the above deficiencies, and significantly enlarges the fluoro, organic and polymer synthesis toolbox, while providing access to novel fluoropolymer materials. This includes the elaboration of novel, functional, universal radical initiating systems that enable both controlled radical fluoro/regular alkene polymerizations and chain end derivatizations/couplings towards the synthesis of multiblock copolymers, in-depth mechanistic investigations on optimizing polymerization parameters and understanding the structure/property/function in the resulting fluoropolymers, as well as exploration of the coordination polymerization of fluoroalkenes, and the up/recycling of industrial fluoropolymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first concerns the creation of accurate mathematical models of networks that can serve as a foundation for many other calculations, such as simulating realistic network structures when only limited data are available.  The second focus is on practical methods for analyzing network structure and behavior using tools of information theory, which will allow us to quantify complexity and similarity between networks and processes on networks.

Graduate students will be trained as part of the project. <br/><br/>This project will develop new mathematical tools for the modeling of network structure and processes taking place on networks, and the analysis of network data. The first of three research themes focuses on expressive yet solvable new models for network structure.  This work will leverage recent developments in message passing methods to show how a large class of random graph models can be implicitly defined to directly mimic the local structure of any observed network.  The second theme focuses on information-theoretic approaches for analyzing and understanding networks and network data.

Gradually, it was realized that the algebraic invariants called cohomology theories could themselves be represented by geometric objects, known as spectra. A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra (representing objects for multiplicative cohomology theories) which are suitable for performing constructions directly analogous to those of classical algebra. This move has turned out to be incredibly fruitful, both by providing invariants which shed new light on old questions as well as by raising new questions which have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. This research proposal studies such constructions in algebraic K-theory, the newly emerging field of Floer homotopy theory, and the foundations of equivariant stable homotopy theory. Broader impacts include workforce development in the form of graduate student advising, undergraduate and postdoc mentorship, high school mathematical science project mentorship, conference organization, and development of new education and training programs.<br/><br/>This proposal describes a broad research program to study a wide variety of problems in homotopy theory, geometry, and arithmetic. The PIs' prior work gives a complete description of the homotopy groups of algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectral at odd primes and a canonical identification of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace via a spectral lift of Tate-Poitou duality. In this proposal, the PIs describe a vast expansion of that argument to study the fiber of the cyclotomic trace on more general rings and schemes over algebraic p-integers in number fields and a related K-theory question more generally for other kinds of Artin duality. The prior work also leads to a new approach to the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture based on Bkstedt-Hsiang-Madsen's geometric Soule embedding that the PIs propose to study. The PIs' recent work with Yuan established a theory of topological cyclic homology (TC) relative to MU-algebras, where there are many interesting computations to explore. Prior work of PI Blumberg with Abouzaid building a Morava K-theory Floer homotopy type has opened new lines of research in Floer homotopy theory; this already has been used to resolve old conjectures in symplectic geometry. The PIs propose to extend this construction to its natural generality, building the homotopy type over MUP and KU and rigidifying the multiplication. They propose to obtain spectral models of deformed operations on quantum cohomology (i.e., quantum Steenrod operations). This work will have myriad applications in symplectic geometry and potentially have transformative impact on the Floer homotopy theory program. The PIs propose to resolve the longstanding confusion about the role of multiplicative norm maps in equivariant stable homotopy theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. This requires a new foundation for factorization homology and will lead to genuine equivariant factorization homology for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. In prior work, the PIs identified previously unknown multiplicative transfers on geometric fixed points of G-commutative ring spectra. The PIs propose to study how these fit into the foundations of G-symmetric monoidal categories; a first step is to establish new multiplicative splittings that have the feel of multiplicative versions of the tom Dieck splitting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several Amoebozoa are also significant human parasites, contributing to health problems. Despite their importance, little is known about their genomic and cellular diversity.

Many properties of Pop III stars are highly uncertain, and resolving these uncertainties is necessary to understand the origin of the elements, the properties of the first galaxies, the reionization of the Universe, and the seeds of supermassive black holes. Two graduate students will be supported by this program to perform the large-scale data analysis, and one undergraduate student from an underrepresented minority will participate in the research each summer.

The ratios of the elements created depend on the Pop III initial mass function as well as their binarity, rotation, and fragmentation rates. Those elemental abundances consequently constrain the otherwise unobservable properties of Pop III stars. The project will conduct a comprehensive spectral analysis of high-resolution optical spectra to calculate the photospheric stellar parameters, detailed abundances, isochrone-derived ages, and orbits of 341 stars in the inner and outer regions of the Milky Way galaxy. The data will be used to explore the Pop III initial mass function and its role in the origin of the elements, the properties of the first galaxies, the reionization of the Universe, and the origin of supermassive black holes.

Their flexibility makes them invaluable across various applications, from autonomous driving and remote sensing analysis to scientific data analysis at variable resolutions. However, the complexity of unstructured meshes presents significant computational challenges, hindering their widespread adoption. This project addresses the enduring tradeoff in unstructured mesh processing by developing novel computational techniques well suited for High Performance Computing architectures. These techniques will offer fast and memory efficient solutions for processing and visualizing large unstructured mesh data. Furthermore, this project will implement these techniques within plug and play data structures, facilitating seamless integration into existing data processing frameworks. The outcomes of this project will significantly simplify the adoption of unstructured mesh processing across numerous scientific domains, fostering new opportunities for outreach and education activities.<br/><br/><br/>This project aims to develop computational solutions for efficient, scalable, and versatile unstructured mesh processing. Mesh processing algorithms are characterized by two tasks: data provisioning and data consumption. The data provisioning task is where connectivity data is computed. The data consumption task uses connectivity data to run a chosen algorithm. Processing large datasets is often impractical due to the memory overhead of data provisioning, exacerbated by the serialized computational approach running both tasks sequentially. This project aims to disrupt this serialized approach by introducing pipelined and overlapped processing paradigms. Instead of executing data provisioning and consumption sequentially, pipelined approaches will enable the precomputation of data connectivity for a mesh subset while data consumption proceeds concurrently elsewhere. This project will first provide a better understanding of pipelined approaches with dynamic data provisioning for large mesh processing. The project will then generate new pipelined approaches well suited for heterogeneous and distributed architectures. Finally, the project will generalize these techniques to simplify unstructured mesh data. The new insights gained from this investigation will be integrated into existing open source frameworks for scientific visualization, facilitating their adoption. This transition to practice will empower users to efficiently process and visualize large unstructured mesh datasets, unlocking new possibilities for data exploration and analysis.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Core Research Program (OAC Core) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the effectiveness of boiling breaks down beyond a critical heat load, due to the growing surface bubbles forming a continuous and insulating vapor film. The principal aim of this project is to fabricate arrays of microstructures that promote the spontaneous ejection of ultra-small micro-bubbles during boiling by leveraging surface tension. For example, bubbles inflating from closely packed micro-cavities will dramatically jump from the surface as they coalesce together. By rapidly ejecting surface bubbles at unusually small sizes, boiling heat transfer should be enhanced while also delaying the breakdown in boiling due to film formation. The heat transfer of a jumping-bubble boiler will be measured across a wide range of surface architectures, surface temperatures, and working fluids. The project will also encompass significant educational activities, including an intensive undergraduate research mentoring program, a picture gallery of jumping bubbles exhibited at Virginia Tech?s Moss Arts Center to communicate boiling concepts to a broader audience, summer camps for high-school students, and the production of general-audience YouTube videos on the physics of making bubbles or droplets jump by surface tension.       <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enhance pool boiling by designing microstructures that serve as tailored nucleation sites to spontaneously eject micro-bubbles by leveraging surface tension.  Preliminary results identified two frameworks for jumping-bubble-enhanced boiling: close-packed micro-cavities for coalescence-induced jumping or a micro-groove for Laplace-pressure-induced single-bubble jumping. Alternately using water or an electronic fluid, three specific research tasks will greatly mature the fundamental and practical impact of jumping-bubble-enhanced pool boiling: (i) Widely vary the micro-cavity geometry to minimize the departure diameter of coalescence-induced jumping bubbles, (ii) Vary the micro-groove geometry to minimize the departure diameter of Laplace-pressure-induced jumping bubbles, and (iii) Using optimized microstructures from the first two tasks, measure the boiling curves and compare to a smooth control surface. The intellectual significance of this project is achieving rapid and wickless (i.e., above-surface only) liquid rewetting by jointly leveraging surface tension and the spatial control of nucleation sites to continually detach inflating bubbles from their impaled vapor necks. The broader impact is the dramatic increase in both the heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux that is expected by virtue of the ultra-small bubble departure size, using uncoated and relatively large microstructures to maximize surface manufacturability and durability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past 50 years, a large body of knowledge has been accumulated on the nonlinear wave equations known as ?integrable systems?, which are used to model a wide variety of physically interesting phenomena, ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to low temperature physics and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Several integrable systems are studied as part of the project: scalar and multicomponent nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) type equations, Maxwell-Bloch equations describing the interaction of light with an active optical medium, discrete integrable and non-integral lattices such as the Ablowitz-Ladik equations, the discrete NLS, the Salerno model, etc. The project has concrete applications in nonlinear optics and BEC, and the investigator also collaborates with physicists to seek experimental validation of the results of obtained by the principal investigator (PI). It is therefore anticipated that the outcomes of the project will also provide practical information that will help scientists and engineers more broadly, thus potentially benefiting the society at large. As part of the project, the investigator is involved in the organization of several conferences and special sessions at larger professional meetings in the US and abroad, e.g., a 4 week-long program on ?Emergent Phenomena in Nonlinear Dispersive Waves?, to be held at Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK, in July-August 2024. Notably, the investigator organizes an event to showcase the research of female scientists. The training of graduate students is an integral component of the project, and two graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow are expected to work with the PI on research problems arising from this project.<br/> <br/>This project is aimed at advancing our theoretical and practical understanding of physically relevant integrable systems, as well as non-integrable systems in regimes that are not too far from the integrable ones, and it collects a suite of problems combined into a cohesive and coherent research effort, whose results will fundamentally further our knowledge of nonlinear waves and solitons, and their applications in various settings. Specifically, the investigator and her team pursue the following objectives: (i) formulation of a rigorous perturbation theory for dark and dark-bright solitons; (ii) development of a numerical inverse scattering transform on a nontrivial background; (iii) study of rogue waves, solitons and soliton interactions in scalar and coupled integrable and nonintegrable equations; (iv) investigation of the effect of radiation on the norming constants associated with the defocusing NLS equation, and their renormalization for solitonic models of condensates; (v) concrete applications to specific problems in BEC and nonlinear optics; (vi) study of Maxwell-Bloch systems both with rapidly decaying optical pulses and pulses with a constant background, and long-time asymptotics of their solutions. The project is carried out by developing and using a combination of: (a) exact methods, such as the inverse scattering transform, Backlund and Darboux transformations, and other direct methods; (b) asymptotic techniques, multiple scales and other perturbative tools; (c) state-of-the-art numerical simulations; (d) comparison with experiments in BEC and nonlinear optics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and the performance benefits afforded by graphics processing units (GPUs) are driving researchers across nearly every domain to adopt GPUs. The National Science Foundation has made substantial investments in providing the community with GPU resources, expertise, training, and other programs in support of this transition. The innovative Cosmos system at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) features AMD?s MI300A accelerated processing unit (APU), which contains both a CPU and a GPU accelerator in a single chip together with high-bandwidth, unified memory. The unified memory facilitates an incremental programming approach, lowering the barrier to the adoption of GPUs by many communities, easing the process of porting and optimizing applications. Cosmos enables researchers to exploit this innovative and powerful accelerator technology in an open software environment to expand the range of applications that can effectively use accelerators. The benefits of accelerating the applications described in the proposal will aid discoveries in materials science, genomics, astrophysics, large language models, artificial intelligence, and many other domains. Cosmos nodes contain AMD MI300A APUs, each with high-bandwidth, unified memory, integrated into 4-socket nodes with all-to-all connectivity using AMD?s high-speed interconnect, which provides a socket-to-socket global memory interface. The system architecture is based on HPE?s EX2500, which provides a dense, energy-efficient, liquid-cooled system. A high-performance, flash-based storage system provides the high IOPS and bandwidth needed for the anticipated mixed-application workload. The system can be cross-mounted to other SDSC systems to facilitate data sharing, software development, and benchmarking. Capacity storage is provided via a Ceph filesystem.<br/><br/>The project is structured as a three-year testbed phase, followed by a two-year allocations phase. During the testbed phase Cosmos project staff will collaborate with research teams covering several exemplar science and engineering applications including those from astronomy, neuroscience, molecular biology, structural engineering, machine learning and others. Included are applications that have yet to be ported and those that can already run on GPUs but would benefit from the flexible and open architecture of the APU and its software ecosystem. Collaborations specifically target community codes, science gateways, and enabling middleware, where success in porting a single application brings along many users and institutions. Integration with the Open Science Grid aims to further extend the benefits of the APU to thousands of users in the high-throughput computing community. Lessons learned and best practices developed from the research collaborations will be shared with the wider user community through project workshops, user training events, and participation in the AMD User Forum. The allocations phase will incorporate lessons learned from the testbed phase regarding application porting to the APU, leading to software development resources, training materials, and publications that allow others to migrate their applications to realize the benefits of accelerated computing.

This ""Climate Resilience through Multidisciplinary Big Data Learning, Prediction & Building Response Systems"" (CLIMBS) project aims to advance the fields of climate science, geohazards engineering, and disaster management to facilitate improved sustainability, resilience, and adaptative engineering to climate change.  CLIMBS research will target underserved communities in eastern Kentucky, an Appalachian region that is especially vulnerable to climate change. The research will produce a holistic understanding of climate change processes in Kentucky across multiple spatial and temporal scales, determine the influence of climate change on geohazards that threaten the commonwealth, and establish an enhanced ""tools and technology framework"" for climate change mitigation and community disaster response. Results of this research will benefit Kentucky's key industries of manufacturing, data analytics, energy transition, and engineering, and help train a science and engineering workforce that will allow smaller industries to flourish. CLIMBS will be administered by the University of Kentucky in collaboration with seven other institutions: University of Louisville, Eastern Kentucky University, Northern Kentucky University, Western Kentucky University, Morehead State University, Murray State University, and Thomas More College.<br/><br/>CLIMBS seeks to address major knowledge gaps that surround: (i) climate change processes affecting Kentucky; (ii) patterns in climate change impacts; (iii) controls on severe weather and extreme events; (iv) climate triggers, thresholds, and feedbacks that result in flood and landslide hazards; and (v) climate-smart sustainable design and resilience engineering in the built environment.   To address these issues, CLIMBS will  acquire the contemporary atmospheric and paleoenvironmental data needed to assess the causes, patterns, and characteristics of regional climate dynamics (to include extreme weather) across space and time, as well as facilitate predictions for the impacts of climate change on Kentucky's critical zone and water resources.  Researchers will pursue integrative, long-term environmental monitoring experiments to develop the ""big data"" and cyberinfrastructure needed to quantify the processes, feedbacks, and threshold conditions that trigger floods and landslides,  and establish instrumented watersheds and hillslope monitoring sites. Initial monitoring sites will be deployed in socio-economically vulnerable areas of eastern Kentucky, to bridge with project elements designed to improve education and outreach in Appalachia. Additionally, CLIMBS will analyze Kentucky's built environment and socio-behavioral systems, and use big data, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and computational tools to evaluate vulnerabilities to climate change and improve real-time disaster detection, warning systems, and the response toolkit.

More examples are being reported every day that range from racist outputs of ChatGPT to imaging AI that predicts former president Barack Obama's face to be white. The mathematical community has fallen behind the rush to use ML and AI, yet mathematics is at the heart of the algorithmic designs and mechanisms behind ML and AI. This project will study fairness in ML and AI from several angles. First, it will create a framework that identifies fairness metrics throughout the algorithmic pipelines. Second, it will develop technologies to mitigate biases and improve fairness. Third, it will develop mathematical foundations to help us understand the mechanisms at work inside of many of these so-called black-box methods. In addition, medical and social justice applications will be integrated throughout the project, helping many nonprofits with high data driven needs meet their goals. These include medical applications helping to understand manifestations of Lyme disease as well as tools to help Innocence projects that work to free innocent people from prison, make appeal decisions, and synthesize case files. This synergistic approach both serves the community while also allowing those applications to fuel motivation for new and better mathematics. In addition, students will be integrated within the research team as part of their training. <br/><br/>Although ML and AI methods have expanded by leaps and bounds, there are still critical issues around fairness and bias that remain unresolved. The focus of this project consists of two main goals. First, it will create a framework where ML and AI methods generate informative descriptions about fairness across population groups. Subsequently, a mechanism will be applied based on this assessment to promote fairness across the population. This direction will both establish a structured framework for researchers and practitioners to report fairness metrics and emphasize their significance, while also enabling algorithms to adjust for fairness. The majority of the first goal revolves around showcasing this framework in ML applications including dimension reduction, topic modeling, classification, clustering, data completion, and prediction modeling. Second, the project will provide foundational mathematical support for more complex, seemingly opaque techniques such as neural networks and large language models. This includes the investigation of mathematically tangible shallow networks to understand their behavior in benign and non-benign overfitting. The project will also analyze the geometry of embeddings derived from large language models using a linear algebraic topic modeling approach, which is tied to the first goal.

For many infectious diseases, multiple species are involved in the amplification or dampening of disease risk and these species can be differentially affected by environmental conditions. For example, if the available suite of species upon which mosquito vectors of disease feed are not very effective at carrying the pathogen, disease risk may decrease even if mosquitoes are abundant. Alternatively, if the vector is active when effective hosts are abundant, disease risk likely increases more than otherwise expected.  Thus, how disease risk will change will not only be determined by mosquito responses to environmental change, but how animal hosts of disease respond to these same processes. Using West Nile virus (WNV) in California?s Central Valley as a case study, this project will investigate how seasonal activity of mosquito vectors and bird hosts will respond to environmental change, and whether and where activity of mosquitos and birds is likely to become more, or less synchronous as climate changes. More synchronous activity will likely increase disease transmission and human health risks.

This research will leverage a combination of machine learning-based species distribution modeling, causal inference statistical approaches, citizen science, and vector surveillance data. Together those approaches will be used to model mosquito and bird host phenology, its influence on West Nile virus infection rates in mosquitos, and potential future phenological mismatch.

This strong societal impact of glass continues in the modern times in the form of applications such as optical fibers for long-distance telecommunication and damage-resistant display panels for electronic devices, which have transformed the ways we live and communicate in the modern world. Accelerating the design of these functional glasses to address the grand challenges faced by society requires a fundamental understanding of the underlying relationships between their atomic structure at various length scales and the dynamical processes in their parent liquids, their progression across glass transition along with the temporal evolution of structure-property relationships during physical aging of the derived glasses.  This project aims to provide unique and comprehensive knowledge regarding the mechanistic connections between these ?microscopic (atomistic)? and ?macroscopic? aspects in oxide liquids and glasses for the very first time, using a unique and powerful combination of cutting-edge characterization techniques. Scientifically, this work impacts materials science, physical chemistry, and solid-state physics. The interdisciplinary nature of this work transfers knowledge between fields and provides students with unique opportunities for intellectual growth. Graduates typically find employment in both academia and in glass and semiconductor industry.  The impact of this research in education and outreach is in three major areas: (1) engagement of undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research, (2) active collaboration with scientists at multiple National Labs, and (3) disseminating knowledge, especially of glass science and technology, to the broader scientific community. The research findings are embedded into special topics courses that are offered to students in materials science, chemistry, and other related fields; and they contribute to campus programs for the recruitment of promising undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/>Accelerating the smart design of functional oxide glasses to address some of the grand challenges faced by our society today requires fundamental knowledge of the structural relaxation kinetics of supercooled oxide liquids and glasses at length scales extending beyond that of short-range order and of their mechanistic connections with melt fragility, dynamical heterogeneity and physical aging phenomena, which are intimately linked to their viability for various processing techniques utilized in industry.  The proposed project will systematically investigate these challenging problems utilizing a uniquely powerful combination of cutting-edge characterization techniques including X-ray photon correlation, NMR, shear-mechanical and electrical impedance spectroscopy and calorimetry to build a comprehensive atomistic understanding of the dynamics and various relaxational phenomena in oxide glasses and deeply supercooled liquids.   The results obtained from these studies will provide important and novel constraints for addressing some of the key outstanding questions in glass science, such as the length scale dependence of relaxation and its implications, the nature of the dynamical heterogeneity and its evolution across glass transition and the temporal evolution of structure-property relationships during physical aging. This fundamental knowledge will enable the advancement of predictive models critically needed for optimization of the chemistry and processing parameters of oxide glasses and glass-ceramics for enhanced functionality, thereby permitting their widespread application in transformative technologies with strong societal impact.

Unlike existing optical microscopes, this instrument can produce images of important protein structures without the need for artificial chemical labeling. Instead, the microscope leverages a particular property that the targeted protein assemblies exhibit: chirality. This property relates the chemical structure of the protein and the way it is assembled, forming a unique signature that can be used for mapping relevant cell and tissue structures without the need for labeling. Professor Potma and his group will use this new instrument to study dynamic structural elements of cells, as well as the organization of proteins that form plaques associated with Alzheimer?s disease. The research has the potential to produce new insights into important biological processes that have been difficult to study with conventional optical imaging techniques. The project provides extensive training for graduate and undergraduate students, equipping them with advanced skills in the areas of physical chemistry, optical microscopy, and molecular biophysics. These opportunities will be extended to students from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), providing an exciting and immersive summer research experience with an aim of increasing the number of African American doctoral students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The optical microscope is essential for visualizing protein structures in cells and tissues, yet the fluorescent labels needed for generating molecular-specific contrast can perturb cellular function and provide an incomplete and/or distorted picture of key cell and tissue structures. Label-free optical imaging techniques have matured into attractive alternatives to conventional approaches, providing solutions to imaging challenges that cannot be addressed with standard protocols. Although second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy can map fibrillar protein assemblies that display non-centrosymmetry, this popular approach lacks the spectroscopic selectivity to enable a deeper analysis of such protein structures. This project seeks to develop a new imaging technique for chemically selective imaging of fibrillar protein structures based on vibrationally-sensitive, sum-frequency generation (SFG) microscopy. The technique will map structures based on molecular chirality, thereby increasing sensitivity, boosting signal levels, and visualizing structures that have hitherto remained invisible in label-free optical microscopy. The newly developed chiral SFG microscope will be used to study the dynamics of the microtubule network in cells and the structural organization of amyloid-beta proteins in plaques associated with Alzheimer?s disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

IYQ Conferences are planned for Fall 2024 to coincide with the upcoming International Year of Quantum in 2025. This innovative approach to K-12 quantum education will be a replicable model for grass-roots efforts to implement quantum learning and reform state-level STEM curricula to reflect QIST advancements in research and practice. The first one-day conference, the IYQ School District Leadership Conference, will host 100 STEM leaders who serve as superintendents, assistant superintendents, and/or STEM directors. The project will strengthen their commitment to district-wide quantum education so they may facilitate QIST learning. The second one-day conference, the IYQ Teacher Leadership Conference, will host 120 K-12 STEM teachers and 40 high school students at BNL. This event is designed to engage, inspire, and motivate K-12 teachers and students in learning QIST research innovations and connection to STEM disciplinary content. When considering indirect impacts, the 100 school district leaders oversee approximately 250,000 K-12 students, and the 120 teacher participants will indirectly impact 15,000 K-12 students, for a total of 265,000 students. This represents a monumental large-scale effort to broaden participation in QIST education. In addition, a newly formed EduQation Network will disseminate resources and opportunities to all district leaders and teachers throughout the Southeast New York region and beyond.<br/><br/>IYQ Conferences will focus upon diversity in two ways: (1) promoting quantum sciences and computing among precollege school district leaders, teachers, and students, particularly those with high representations of  traditionally underserved students, and (2) establishing a regional network for coordinating resources and training for implementing QIST curricula and promoting careers in developing next-generation technologies. Research and evaluation activities are aligned with the overarching goals of ITEST, including (1) the development of QIST knowledge and practices that promote critical thinking, reasoning, and communication skills; and (2) increased student knowledge and interest in QIST careers and academic pathways. The research and evaluation plan will measure both immediate and midterm outcomes for school district leaders, teachers, and students. The research plan includes both quantitative and qualitative components to measure immediate outcomes and outcomes 3-4 months post-conference. The project team will further analyze outcomes with a 6-month review of participant involvement in the newly developed QIST education network. The outcomes will be analyzed through quantitative measurement of website views and posts, along with interviews with teachers and administrators to determine district-level policy shifts and initiatives and teacher implementation of QIST content and career advisement. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, they are used to describe the orbital paths of satellites. Taking the satellite scenario, for example, a natural question to ask is whether there are recurring orbits that a satellite can traverse. Contact homology offers a systematic way to explore the geometric features of these contact manifolds. In the satellite scenario, one can gain deep insights into all possible orbital paths of satellites by analyzing recurring satellite orbits. Contact homology has been highly successful in distinguishing different contact manifolds. This project aims to refine our understanding of contact manifolds using an enhanced approach based on contact homology. Furthermore, the PI intends to apply the techniques developed in this process to study other types of spaces beyond contact manifolds, such as spaces with symmetries. Symmetries play a crucial role in many aspects of daily life. For instance, ensuring that machine learning models treat people fairly, irrespective of their sex or race, reflects a key symmetry requirement. <br/><br/>Symplectic Field Theory, introduced two decades ago, aims to provide invariants for symplectic and contact manifolds. It encompasses essential concepts such as cylindrical contact homology, contact homology, chain homotopy types of contact differential graded algebras (dga), and linearized contact homology. The projects presented here revolve around the foundational aspects of Symplectic Field Theory. The primary challenge addressed by the Principal Investigator (PI) concerns achieving transversality while preserving symmetries to derive the desired algebraic formula. Various tools and techniques, including obstruction bundle gluing and evaluation maps for cylindrical contact homology, and semi-global Kuranishi structures for contact homology, have been introduced or employed by the PI. The project applies these tools to investigate two specific invariants: the chain homotopy type of contact dga and linearized contact homology. Furthermore, the PI has developed a new tool, the semi-global Kuranishi structure for clean intersections, which lies between obstruction bundle gluing and semi-global Kuranishi structures. This tool offers increased computational efficiency and bridges seemingly unrelated techniques. The project also aims to establish a Smith-type rank inequality related to the Floer homology of the fixed point set, contributing to the understanding of the L-space conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Arctic sea-ice cover is smaller, thinner, weaker, and younger than it used to be. These changes affect the marine ecosystem, economy, and society. Understanding Arctic sea-ice change is limited by the way different types of sea-ice knowledge are practiced separately from one another. When combined, these knowledges can give a more complete picture of sea ice as an essential part of the Arctic system. But, there are few opportunities for different knowledge practitioners to come together. This project creates an opportunity through the Sikumiut Field School: a field-based experience designed to bring together Indigenous Knowledge holders, numerical modelers, remote sensing experts, and field observers to learn and share sea-ice knowledge in Utqia?vik, Alaska. The school will create a collaborative environment to learn different perspectives of sea-ice knowledge.

Before traveling to Utqia?vik, participants will discuss sea-ice conditions using local observations, weather reports, and satellite data in virtual seminars. Seminars will give participants opportunities to build relationships before meeting in person and learn about the Utqia?vik sea-ice lifecycle.

NHC-functionalized nanoparticles are now being studied for many applications including electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide  Despite this substantial success, current NHC ligands for nanoparticle applications are all structurally similar.  For this proposal, the Camden and Jenkins research teams will rationally design new NHC ligands for nanoparticles to improve their robustness and expand their applicability.

First, the collaborative team will perform a series of isotope labeling experiments to study the NHC transfer process and exchange dynamics on nanoparticle (NP) surfaces.  Second, the researchers will synthesize new macrocyclic and hemispherical bidentate NHC ligands for gold nanoparticles to increase electrochemical and chemical resistance.  Third, the team will design NHC ligands with chemically addressable functional groups that are capable of stabilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in aqueous or organic environments, respectively, to establish their potential for post-synthetic modifications with model analytes.  These studies will focus on a top-down approach wherein the AuNPs are prepared and then functionalized NHCs transferred from isolated coinage metal NHC complexes.  A top-down approach is beneficial because multiple sizes and shapes of AuNPs can be prepared and the NHC transfer reactions are more universal compared to a bottom-up approach where each individual reaction must be optimized to form AuNPs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The growth of wireless data traffic is significantly accelerating because of increasing demands for high-speed wireless connectivity, ubiquitous network access, and end-user experience. Data show that more than 50% of internet traffic is from mobile networks that consist of end-users who require last-mile service, the part of the wireless network that stretches from the radio access network to end-users. The growing disparity between increasing demand and limited solutions has created a bottleneck in wireless connectivity that is hindering the advancement of new applications that require wide bandwidth. This is especially true in rural areas. This integrated research and education program creates a Midwestern hub that will contribute to overcoming this bottleneck through fundamental research that advances scientific understanding of a wireless last mile that provides greater bandwidth, better flexibility, and higher scalability than current fixed access solutions and is more cost efficient. This program anticipates that with new applications that require ultra-low latency and high rendering quality (e.g., extended reality and digital twins), more mobile traffic will be created and consumed, requiring more bandwidth resources. This trend will, in turn, stimulate the U.S. economy, create jobs, and advance health and prosperity in rural areas. <br/><br/>This highly integrated research and education program is addressing critical scientific problems on the physical layer for enabling a dynamic last mile at terahertz (THz) bands in 6G wireless networks while simultaneously establishing a unique research and education hub in the Midwest with capabilities to measure and test THz communication systems and networks. The research performed includes (i) characterizing the THz propagation channel under spatial dynamics, (ii) creating statistics models for THz networks under temporal dynamics, and (iii) designing self-adaptive THz systems under a mix of both dynamics. This work will help to enable the dynamic THz last mile. Closely integrated with these research objectives are education and outreach objectives that (i) promote convergence education through new curriculum, interdisciplinary research opportunities, and entrepreneurial skill-set training and (ii) foster responsible innovation by engaging with rural communities and stakeholders to deepen interdisciplinary teaching and entrepreneurial skill-set training and broaden stakeholder participation in the process of technology development.

Dynamical systems provide mathematical models for the long-term trajectories of objects moving according to physical principles. The subject has its foundations in Newtonian mechanics, and features widely in both pure and applied mathematics (e.g., fluid dynamics, airflow dynamics, Hamiltonian mechanics). Hamiltonian mechanics, which provides an alternative formulation to Newtonian mechanics and is particularly useful in classical and quantum mechanics, expresses the time evolution of a system in terms of partial derivatives of a certain energy. The resulting equations, called Hamilton?s equations, describe how the coordinates and momenta of a system evolve over time. The project will seek to further the understanding of quantitative aspects of the analysis of various dynamical systems, under the mathematical rubric of rigidity. The project also provides opportunities for the training and mentoring of early career researchers, especially graduate students. The PI will contribute to the dissemination of mathematical knowledge through the organization of various conferences, workshops, and long research programs.<br/><br/>The project resides at the intersection of dynamical systems, ergodic theory, number theory, and geometry. It seeks both to establish new rigidity results and to advance and refine existing results, in the setting of the dynamics of group actions on structured spaces. A major focus is on an enhanced understanding of finitary analysis and effective conclusions. Rigidity phenomena for the dynamics of group actions on homogeneous spaces and moduli spaces have been studied extensively. However, a quantitative understanding of the behavior of orbits has proven to be challenging. This project seeks results in this direction, with an emphasis on systems with polynomial rates, and will also investigate implications of these findings within the domains of number theory and geometry.

This innovative microscopy approach is designed to observe structural changes in nanoparticles during electrochemical reactions. Nanoparticles are crucial catalysts in important energy-conversion reactions, such as hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction to chemical feedstocks. The structure of nanoparticles is known to change during these reactions, affecting efficiency, but until now no quantitative correlation has been established to understand how these structural changes impact reaction efficiency. To tackle this issue, the research team is using a calcite crystal, known as the Vikings? sunstone, as a polarizer to track the morphological transformations of the nanoparticles and correlate these observed changes with measured efficiencies. The development of CLocK microscopy has the potential to accelerate materials characterization, thereby fostering the discovery and development of functional materials that positively impact and benefit society. The project offers training opportunities that will help build a diverse workforce, including outreach activities for high school students from groups underrepresented in science, particularly in the field of microscopy ? a field with a broad range of applications from medicine to materials science.<br/><br/>The CLocK microscopy technique being developed by the Sundaresan research team at U. Mississippi utilizes a rotating calcite crystal positioned in the infinity space of the optical microscope. This configuration splits the scattered light from single nanoparticles (NPs) based on two orthogonal polarizations to generate a unique point-spread function resembling a ""clock."" CLocK images provide not only the spatial position of the NP, similar to traditional super-localization imaging, but also additional quantitative details such as anisotropy, orientation, and temporal information of the single-NP emitter. Using in situ CLocK microscopy, the team aims to quantify changes in anisotropy and orientation of individual NPs during electrochemical/catalytic reactions and understand their effects on electrochemical activity by integrating CLocK with scanning electrochemical cell microscopy at the single-particle level. This approach is expected to enhance understanding of how NP morphological changes influence the activity and selectivity of electrochemical systems. The technique is to be extended to NP transport at the electrode-electrolyte interface by correlating it with the NP collision electrochemistry technique. Overall, CLocK microscopy has the potential to offer the materials chemistry community valuable insights into dynamic morphological changes during electrochemical reactions, and enhance understanding of structure-property relationships for optimized electrochemical system design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A n-dimensional manifold is a space that locally resembles n-dimensional real space.  For example, the surface of a donut is a two-dimensional manifold, because under very high magnification, this surface looks like a two-dimensional plane.  Three-dimensional objects arise naturally in our physical world, and four-dimensional objects can be motivated by thinking about the evolution of three-dimensional objects over time.  Notably, low-dimensional topology has a number of interesting applications to biology, chemistry, physics, and quantum computing.  This project focuses on the search for deep connections between manifold theory in dimensions three and four.  In addition, the project includes funding for graduate and undergraduate student research, and it will support the Great Plains Alliance, a program that pairs graduate students with speaking opportunities at other institutions for the purpose of broadening the impact of their work and promoting graduate school in mathematics to the undergraduate attendees.  The project will also fund the Distinguished Women in Mathematics colloquium series at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the PI?s home institution.  This series connects UNL faculty and graduate students with prominent women mathematicians and their research.<br/><br/>Topology in dimension three has seen an explosion of activity over the last several decades, and a number of important open problems have now been resolved.  In contrast, the topology of four-dimensional manifolds has become an increasingly active area of research, motivated by fundamental conjectures that have stubbornly resisted progress.  Two of the most famous examples include the smooth four-dimensional Poincar conjecture (SPC4) and the slice-ribbon conjecture.  Recently, the PI has shown that a substantial family of four-manifolds satisfies the SPC4 in joint work with Jeffrey Meier.  The work connects four-dimensional handle calculus with results about Dehn surgery on knots and links in three-manifolds; it brings together a wide range of tools and techniques; and it subsumes several historically important results.  The collection of manifolds can be characterized by families of links, including some of the most promising potential counterexamples to the slice-ribbon conjecture.  This project describes a varied set of problems stemming from past work and interweaving ideas from knot theory, three-manifolds, and smooth four-manifold topology.  Specific objectives include proving additional cases of the SPC4, finding new relationships between the topology of certain homotopy four-spheres and the Andrews-Curtis conjecture in combinatorial group theory, developing connections between three- and four-dimensional knot invariants, and utilizing bridge trisections in new constructions of surfaces in four-manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, the cause for the increase in atmospheric CO2 during this period is poorly known. Early human activities associated with new agricultural practices may have been partly responsible, but recent work has suggested that the migration of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) may have altered carbon cycling and storage. While this may be a compelling explanation, it does not address whether this process was unique to the Holocene as compared with previous warm periods. To address this knowledge gap, the team will generate proxy records for the last 900,000 years in the Southern Ocean and evaluate several hypotheses regarding changes in CO2 levels. The project provides an opportunity for early career researchers and students to develop their research programs and take part in outreach activities. This research is relevant to society given its implications for understanding the role of humans in climate change.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to reconstruct the SWW movement during earlier warm periods (interglacials) and compare those with the response of the Southern Ocean biological pump, atmospheric CO2, and other climate metrics.

Despite its appeal, this complexity and flexibility also often makes its mathematical analysis intractable. In cases when the game is played by a large number of identical agents, mean field paradigm widely employed in physics offers a simplifying approach without compromising its modeling potential.  This new perspective has been actively studied over the past decade and proved to be effectively applicable across various fields.  Additionally, as in the mean field regime the players have small impact on the macro behavior of the system, it becomes feasible to coordinate their actions through a central planner providing equilibria that are beneficial to all. This project is centered around these models that are centrally controlled.  While in some cases this is the natural setting, games that have potential structure are also intrinsically connected to these mean field control problems. This project also provides opportunities for the involvement of students in the research.<br/><br/>Technically, the main feature of mean field type optimization is the dependence of its evolution and cost, not only on the position of the state, but also on its probability distribution, making the set of distributions its state space. Thus, the dynamic programming approach results in nonlinear partial differential equations set in the spaces of probability measures. For games these are coupled Hamilton-Jacobi and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov systems. For mean field control however, the differential equations characterizing the minimal value are naturally set in the Wasserstein space of probability measures with finite second moments, and they are not expected to admit classical solutions.  Towards the central goal of building an efficient theory for these equations, this project aims to develop a complete theory for the associated dynamic programming equation for mean field control, to study the potential games in detail, and to establish efficient numerical approaches using modern optimization packages with theoretical guarantees based on tools from statistical machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional quality of service metrics, such as data rate and latency, fall short of capturing the performance and service requirements of these applications. This gap may be addressed by contemporary performance metrics, including age of information, quality of experience, and timely throughput. Current research, however, often approaches these metrics in isolation, hindering the transfer of insights across different applications. This project aims to bridge this gap by pursuing a comprehensive theory for second-order cross-layer design, unifying the analysis and optimization of diverse performance metrics within a single framework. By doing so, it seeks to advance the fundamental understanding of wireless networks' capabilities in supporting emerging applications and facilitate the development of network algorithms for next-generation networks. The project seeks to tightly integrate research with a significant education and outreach program that includes developing hands-on projects for undergraduate students, creating new course components, and engaging students with diverse backgrounds in research activities.<br/><br/>At the core of this project lies the development of a novel theory of second-order cross-layer design for complex and dynamic networks. This theory characterizes all network processes, including information arrivals, channel rates, and goodputs, by their respective means and temporal variances. The consideration of temporal variance enables the proposed theory to provide a simple and yet precise characterization for the network behaviors in the non-asymptotic regime. To realize this theory, this project pursues three complementary research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on centrally scheduled wireless networks, aiming to precisely characterize the second-order capacity region and devise low-complexity resource allocation policies. The second thrust addresses interference among nearby wireless devices, seeking to develop distributed policies that converge to the desirable mean and temporal variance. Lastly, the third thrust applies this theory to a range of emerging network applications, tailoring network policies to accommodate diverse requirements and behaviors. Through these efforts, this project aims to not only advance the theoretical foundations of wireless networking but also to facilitate the practical implementation of novel network algorithms to support the next generation of wireless technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chromatographic methods are widely used to support biomedical research, environmental monitoring, and development of new drugs and therapies. To develop highly efficient and specific methods for various applications, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the chromatographic principles behind practical methods. The retention mechanisms for separation in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) are very complex involving multiple forces and interactions. Professor Guo and his team are developing a new methodology to quantitatively understand each force or interaction involved in HILIC separation. The new methodology will investigate the separation of medicinally relevant molecules on many columns with diverse chemistry. The research results are expected to lead to a better understanding of selectivity, faciliate method development, and provide guidance on designing new columns. The proposed research will engage both graduate and undergraduate students, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented groups, and provide advanced training in separation science and chemical analysis which can prepare the students to pursue advanced degrees or careers in biotech and pharmaceutical industries.<br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on quantitative assessment of the retention mechanisms in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). A major objective is to develop and validate a new methodology that can be used to quantitatively determine the contribution of each retention mechanism (i.e., hydrophilic partitioning, surface adsorption, and electrostatic interactions) to the overall retention of both non-ionized and ionized analytes. The main retention mechanism for any compounds can be unambiguously identified based on the quantitative contribution data. The quantitative information on the retention mechanisms will also provide new insights into the selectivity for various compounds on different stationary phases and help design meaningful selectivity tests. The new methodology will help create a mechanistic-based classification system for the stationary phases used in hydrophilic interaction chromatography, which will facilitate column selection in method development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the last decades, the water levels of inland saline lakes have been shrinking rapidly due to increasing water withdrawals for human consumption and climate change. Dry lakebeds exposed by shrinking saline lakes have become the sources of increased dust storms with adverse impacts on human and ecosystem health throughout the world. However, a fundamental understanding of the impacts of dust storms and pollution on the environment and ecosystem health has remained elusive. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to advance the fundamental understanding of how plant ecosystems respond over time to exposure to salt-rich dust storms generated by the exposed dry lakebeds of inland saline lakes. Additional benefits to society will be accomplished through education and training activities including the mentoring of one graduate student at Utah State University.<br/><br/>Contaminated lakebeds exposed by shrinking saline lakes have become the sources of increasing dust storms resulting in negative environmental and public health consequences throughout the world. Understanding the extent and severity of increasing dust deposition in the environment remains a challenge, as current approaches are limited to monitoring active dust events, modeling emissions and deposition at coarse spatiotemporal resolutions, or sampling deposition fluxes at single geographic locations. This CAREER project will integrate laboratory analytical and field methods with the latest developments in hyperspectral imaging technology and deep learning to continuously monitor dust deposition, estimate deposition abundance, and evaluate environmental responses to dust storms and pollution generated by the exposed dry lakebeds of inland saline lakes using the Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah as case study.  The specific objectives of the research are to 1) evaluate the responses of different plants to variable levels of dust exposure and how imaging spectroscopy can assess those responses; 2) develop novel hyperspectral unmixing techniques for detecting and quantifying dust deposition in vegetative systems; and (3) determine how satellite data and field observations can evaluate transport, deposition, and effects of dust pollution over time by applying domain adaptation techniques to dust detection models constructed from laboratory data. To implement the educational and outreach goals of this project, the Principal Investigator proposes to leverage existing programs and resources at Utah State University to  1) develop new experiential course modules in environmental engineering and laboratory methods for undergraduate and graduate students; 2) create and deliver experimental protocols and curriculum for middle school students to learn about plant responses to dust pollution; and 3) engage community stakeholders in local, personally relevant observational research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Canonical metrics can provide valuable insight into the specific geometry of geometric objects called manifolds. An example of canonical metrics are solutions to the Einstein field equations which relate the geometry of a spacetime, specifically the curvature, with the distribution of matter, energy and stress. In complex geometry, Calabi-Yau metrics, which are those with zero Ricci curvature, are a prime example of canonical metrics and their existence is directly related to solving a particular nonlinear partial differential equation called the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The equations of unified string theories are expected to yield new notions of canonical metrics as well as special geometries. This project aims to further our understanding of the existence of certain canonical metrics by developing necessary tools and new techniques in partial differential equations. Furthermore, the project will continue the PI's involvement in mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and organizing numerous seminars and conferences, with an emphasis on the inclusion of women and under-represented groups. <br/><br/>The project will pursue a program in which the PI will investigate several geometric problems related to canonical<br/>metrics on a complex manifold and the classification of algebraic varieties using the methods of nonlinear partial differential equations. One of the main goals is to prove existence of constant scalar curvature Hermitian metrics by obtaining a priori estimates and applying them to glean insight into the geometry of the complex manifold through the use of a continuity path or parabolic flow approach. In addition, the PI would like to transform our understanding of canonical metrics on a given manifold to the problem of searching for a family of canonical metrics given by the process of reducing a complex manifold to its minimal model, as per Mori's Minimal Model program, and the Analytic Minimal Model program by Song-Tian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Florida?s aquatic ecosystem presents a distinct local workforce demand and learning opportunity, with a variety of under-publicized entry points that do not require a four-year degree. The project will advance understanding of how community colleges can provide associate-level students field-based technical training with real-world applicability for positions in state water management agencies, as well as environmental and agricultural settings. Few associate-level STEM students participate in high-quality, high-impact field experiences, internships, and research. In aquatic disciplines, the invisibility of entry-level pathways means that technician-level work is being conducted by individuals who hold a four-year degree or conversely, whose only post-high school training has been completed on-the-job. Changing this paradigm to effectively address workforce needs will require technical training programs and aquatics employers to actively develop new intermediate-level training and employment pathways. Through partnerships with area high schools, the project has the potential to engage underrepresented minority students who have an interest in and aptitude for the unique workplace settings where aquatic research occurs, thereby broadening the diversity of entry into Florida?s technical workforce. By supporting paid internships and research-based field experiences, the project will train students with an interest in technical careers with real-world skills that prepare them to enter the workforce. <br/><br/>The goal of the 36-month project will be to engage at least 150 associate-level students and 100 high school juniors and seniors in hands-on learning about aquatics careers through course-based field experiences, internships, research activities, and career exploration about technical occupations where water quality technical skills are in high demand. The project objectives are to:  (1) increase technical skills for at least 130 associate-level students in data analysis, geospatial technology, and water quality assessment by developing and piloting a new interdisciplinary course, Global Change: Freshwater Ecology and Sustainability; (2) provide industry-aligned research, internships, and field work for 48 associate-level students, to prepare them to enter Florida?s technician level aquatics workforce; and (3) expand the recruitment pathway into aquatic ecology associate-degree programs through targeted outreach to local high schools, including those serving rural and underrepresented minority students, through a dual enrollment program in environmental science serving 60 students, as well as outreach and field-based technical education for an additional 30 students. The project will include an independent evaluation of how research-grounded and field-based technical education can effectively support graduates to advance into the workforce, and to disseminate findings and lessons learned among ATE grantees, technical education programs, and aquatic industry leaders to promote new avenues for building a well-trained technical workforce.

This framework is ubiquitous across various scientific and technological disciplines, encompassing fields such as medical imaging, atmospheric remote sensing, geophysics, and non-destructive evaluation. In many practical scenarios, medium parameters exhibit anisotropy, meaning they depend not only on position but also on direction. Examples include conductivity in muscle tissue in human bodies, electromagnetic parameters in crystals, composite materials like fiber-reinforced polymers, and seismic wave propagation in the Earth. The project aims to develop novel mathematical methods for investigating inverse problems related to the recovery of anisotropic medium parameters from measurements taken at the exterior or boundary. A particular focus of the project is on determining parameters in models involving long-range interactions, prevalent in phenomena from anomalous diffusion to random processes with jumps, with broad applications spanning image processing, fluid dynamics, biophysics, network science, epidemiology, and finance. Additionally, the project places significant emphasis on providing educational training for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project leverages nonlocality, nonlinearity, and high frequencies as powerful tools to tackle significant and challenging inverse problems in anisotropic media. It is organized around four pivotal research topics. The first topic concerns inverse problems for elliptic partial differential operators at a large but fixed frequency. The goal is to solve important inverse problems for both linear and nonlinear elliptic operators at a large but fixed frequency in a geometric setting where the corresponding inverse problems at zero frequency are wide open and seem difficult to reach. The second topic focuses on inverse problems for nonlocal elliptic operators, with a particular emphasis on the fractional counterpart of the Calderon problem. The aim is to recover the coefficients of nonlocal operators based on measurements taken in exterior regions. The inherent nonlocality of these operators renders inverse problems more tractable than their local counterparts. The third topic deals with inverse problems for significant nonlinear hyperbolic and elliptic partial differential equations, encountered in physical models. The primary objective is to recover the leading terms that govern the underlying geometry. Finally, the fourth topic addresses inverse problems for both linear and nonlinear perturbations of biharmonic operators, with applications ranging from elasticity theory to conformal geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study implementing collaborative learning and design thinking in three freshman and sophomore courses to foster engineering identity. This project will generate new knowledge on how to produce a more diverse and innovative engineering workforce, which are critical for maintaining the US position as a global leader in science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM).<br/><br/>The three objectives of this project, i.e., 1) bridge math gap, 2) build communities of practice, and 3) instill design thinking, contribute directly to the three constructs of engineering identity, i.e., performance/competence, recognition, and interests.

The second strategy is to introduce ?design thinking? as a creative, iterative, human-centric process that guides decision-making and problem solving. Students will learn and practice how to apply design thinking to solve complex math, engineering, and life problems. The principal investigators will collaborate with students participating in a summer fellows program to create course contents, including videos. The student summer fellows will also participate in undergraduate research, accelerating their transition from engineering students to engineering practitioners. Leveraging student-faculty collaborations, this project will promote teaching/learning effectiveness, culture awareness, and community supports for both students and faculty.

Well-known, and perhaps familiar, examples include the Stefan problem for melting and freezing of ice in water and the capillary problem describing the shapes of water droplets on a car window or a leaf.  In these problems it is very important to understand the effects of heterogenous media. Microscopic structure plays a major role in determining the macroscopic physics, for example whether a water droplet will ""stick"" to a surface (due to contact angle hysteresis) or roll off (low hysteresis and/or superhydrophobicity). In mathematical terms such interface problems lie at the intersection of several fields: partial differential equations (PDE), geometry, and probability / statistical physics. This project aims to advance the theory of phase interfaces in heterogeneous media by developing new techniques which make connections between these distinct mathematical fields.  The project will contribute to the development of STEM workforce and STEM education through training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>This project will study free boundary problems in heterogeneous media at micro and macro scales, especially as related to problems of capillarity and wetting.   The two main goals are: (1) to develop a theory of large-scale regularity for one- and two-phase free boundary problems and obstacle problems in periodic and random media, (2) to derive and study models for the rate independent evolution of capillary drops under the effects of contact angle hysteresis.  Quantitative results in homogenization and hydrodynamic limits enable more efficient computations which can be rigorously validated.  The large-scale regularization properties of elliptic and parabolic PDE in periodic and random media is central in the study of quantitative homogenization.  Much less is known in the context of phase interfaces or free boundaries.  This project will advance the quantitative homogenization theory of free boundaries and interfaces by studying several important model problems. In the theory of wetting on a rough surface, a rigorous mathematical formulation in terms of calculus of variations and homogenization theory can clarify the meaning of ambiguous physical models for computing effective contact angles.

This nanosized container can release molecules in response to small forces exerted within tissues. Forces play an important role in biology. During tissue development and disease, cells exert forces on the extracellular matrix (ECM), the protein web that surrounds cells. These forces both create tissue structure and communicate information to other cells. Small forces occurring during tissue injury can damage the ECM. The project will connect the nanosized container to the ECM through specific DNA sequences that bind to strands of the protein web that constitute the ECM. These DNA sequences will connect both the container lid and container edge to the ECM through a mechanical lock. When forces are exerted on strands of the web, this mechanical lock will open and molecules in the DNA origami container will leak out, conveying a signal to surrounding cells. The DNA origami container can be filled with a wide array of different molecules that can instruct cells in the vicinity to perform certain functions. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the engineering design rules associated with creating nanosized DNA structures.

Tasks in these studies are to: 1) select ECM binding aptamers that are uniquely sensitive to ECM fibril structure and composition, 2) uncover the design constraints of force-mediated rupture of aptamer-linked DNA sequences and 3) build DNA origami boxes and characterize force-mediated cargo release. This work is built upon novel strategies to select for DNA aptamers that bind fibrillar ECM proteins with high affinity. DNA aptamers provide the ability to mechanically link the DNA origami to the ECM. Furthermore, these DNA aptamers are extensions of double-stranded DNA origami locks containing complementary DNA sequences that rupture at defined forces depending on the specific application. Mechanically inducible molecular cargo release will be useful in numerous applications including drug delivery during fibrosis progression, injury during mechanical lung ventilation used to treat respiratory illness or decompression sickness. Furthermore, mechanically inducible molecular cargo release will allow for the control of tissue engineered systems including organoid systems where cell contractile forces are exerted and communicate signals important to tissue structure and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, worldwide industrial gas phase chemical reactions consume large amounts of energy and emit high levels of carbon dioxide each year.  For studying and optimizing alternative processes, new measurement techniques are needed because existing gas phase infrared techniques are overwhelmed by spectral congestion at moderate and elevated temperatures.  This new 3D infrared spectrometer should be able to handle this congestion and complexity, leading to strategies for consuming less energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

In photoelectron spectroscopy, a high-energy photon is used to detach one of the electrons in a molecule, and the velocity of the departing electron contains information about the molecular energy states at the instant of ejection. The method can be applied to any molecule and has been used to great effect in the study of isolated gas phase molecules for decades. However, analogous studies in liquids are considerably more challenging since the surrounding solvent could interfere with motion of the departing electron. Professor Neumark and his students will pass the solutions through liquid jets, which will enable the study of solvated molecules using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Their approach has the potential to address the origin and mechanism of photostability in molecules including DNA constituents, which have strong UV absorption yet do not dissociate. The project will also contribute to the development of a diverse scientific workforce by providing research opportunities for graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral scholars.<br/> <br/>Under this award, photoexcited anionic and neutral solutes in flat liquid jets will be studied by the UC-Berkeley team using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photoelectron spectroscopy. Femtosecond ultraviolet (UV) pump and XUV probe pulses will excite the solute and then follow its dynamics by measuring the photoelectron spectrum as a function of UV/XUV delay. Experiments will be carried out using probe photon energies of 22 eV and 90 eV. Light at 22 eV serves as a universal valence ionization probe; one can ionize valence electrons from initially excited electronic states and from any electronic states populated by subsequent relaxation. Target systems of these experiments are the phenolate and nitrophenolate anions as well as the neutral species indole and tryptophan. At 90 eV, one can photoionize I(4d) core electrons and thus monitor time-dependent chemical shifts in the photodissociation of iodine-containing species. Experiments at 90 eV will first be carried out on aqueous iodide anions in order to track energies and solvent relaxation upon excitation of the charge-transfer-to-solvent band of iodide at 240 nm. Experiments on photoexcited iodobenzene and iodophenolate at both probe energies will probe the competition between relaxation within the manifold of valence states on the aromatic ring and dissociation to iodine atoms or iodide anions.  Such experiments, if successful, will serve to significantly extend the range of experiments available to photoelectron spectroscopy, giving valuable information about chemical dynamics and solvent effects in the condensed phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, achieving this goal relies on imparting high electrical conductivity in bi-CCPs to allow the use of electric current as a viable device output. In this combined theoretical and experimental project, Professors Farnaz A. Shakib and Mengqiang Zhao from the New Jersey Institute of Technology will develop a fundamental molecular-level understanding of the structure-property-function relationships in existing bi-CCPs. The produced knowledge will then be utilized in designing new classes of tunable/controllable bi-CCPs equipped with an inherent high electrical conductivity, realizing a dream ?nano-scale sensing material?. The theoretical investigations will be followed by the synthesis and characterization of the designed multi-functional materials. This project will advance science by employing novel computational and experimental techniques to design, synthesize, and investigate the functionality of a new class of materials and will encourage their further applications in exotic electronic devices. During this project, graduate students will be trained as the skilled workforce for the future of STEM. Undergraduate and K-12 level students will also be exposed to the fundamentals of theoretical and experimental materials research through full-day workshops and Summer Schools, which will help their growth in STEM fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Incorporating high electrical conductivity in spin-crossover (SCO) materials has been a challenging and somewhat overlooked task, with most reported bi-CCPs to date being insulators. Here, novel bi-CCPs equipped with high electrical conductivity will be designed following an inverse chemical engineering route. First, noticing that the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of bi-CCPs have a dynamic interrelation, the research groups will establish the features that induce the highest electrical conductivity without diminishing the thermodynamic/dynamic stability or hindering their SCO behaviors. Using Shakib group?s in-house developed Crystal Structure Producer Python Package (CrySP), a new database of electrically conductive (EC) bi-CCPs will be created by systematic conjugated pillar ligand insertions in the selected EC-CCPs from the online EC-MOF/Phase I database. The DFT-calculated properties of the hypothetical structures gathered in this newly developed database will be used (i) to find the optimal EC bi-CCPs for synthesis and characterization and (ii) to train machine learning (ML) algorithms. These ML algorithms will then be used to calculate bulk properties such as electrical conductivity, carrier mobility, and magnetic properties, bypassing the astronomical computational cost of periodic DFT calculations and accelerating the design and discovery procedure. The chosen systems with the highest electrical conductivity, carrier mobilities, and desired magnetic properties will be introduced to well-established experimental synthetic procedures, i.e., the precipitation method or the liquid-phase epitaxy method. The morphology, structure, electronic, and SCO properties of these materials will be investigated in detail using well-established characterization methods. The results of the experiment/characterization will be used to further refine the ML models. This closed feedback loop of theory and experiment will lead to optimal EC bi-CCPs for applications in nano-scale electronic switches, temperature/pressure sensors, and quantum information science.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), which produce large thunderstorms of tens to hundreds of kilometers wide, over the Congo Basin account for more than 80% of the total rainfall, much higher than their contribution to rainfall over other tropical regions.<br/><br/>Of all the tropical regions, the Congo Basin stands out as the least studied in the meteorological research, largely due to sparse in-situ observations. Yet, the existing studies have shown that MCSs over the Congo Basin exhibit distinct relationship with large-scale thermodynamic and dynamic meteorological conditions not seen in other tropical regions. These features challenge the understanding of the mechanisms controlling MCSs over the Congo Basin. A few available studies have evaluated MCSs over this region from a climate perspective. However, there remain major knowledge gaps in understanding physical and dynamic mechanisms governing Congo Basin MCSs, especially on the weather time scale. This project, for the first time, use one of the state-of-the-art global cloud-resolving models, namely, the Model for Prediction Across Scales, to simulate MCSs over the Congo Basin and understand their initiation, development, and propagation at the process level and connections to environmental factors.

The use of enzymes as industrial biocatalysts continues to expand, offering environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions to a wide range of industrial processes while driving innovation in fields such as pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and food production, and more recently biomining and carbon capture. Viewed as an alternative to conventional chemical catalysts, enzyme biocatalysts offer greater sustainability in their processes owing to their biodegradable nature, high selectivity, ability to operate under mild reaction conditions, and their ability to generate a low amount of byproduct during a reaction; they also negate the need for potentially toxic or energy intensive reagents typically needed for conventional chemical catalysis. These advantages confer downstream impacts on operational efficiency, costs, and energy requirements. With the proposed technology?s enhanced capabilities, there is potential to increase this impact by providing novel enzyme solutions that confer greater robustness and efficiency at lower costs and environmental impacts.<br/>The proposed project aims to apply directed evolution and high-throughput screening technologies to spore-displayed enzymes, enabling rapid prototyping of spore-enzyme variants to improve important variables like enzyme activity, stability, and loading density. While enzyme catalysis is used in a wide range of industries, the ability to create enzymes with thermal and chemical stability that are also reusable remains a challenge. Using a process called spore-display immobilization, the platform uses bacteria to make and assemble enzymes on the surface of spores, a self-assembling and genetically encoded microparticle. The platform is based on key foundational research that resulted in the characterization of 37 proteins that make up the spore coat of Bacillus subtilis and their ability to act as fusion partners for enzymes. To further develop this technology, the following objectives are proposed: 1) Use the platform to implement directed evolution of a commercially relevant enzyme on the spore; establish feasibility of approach to yield improved biocatalytic properties and benchmark to industry standard;  2) Advance system screening capabilities to enable high throughput selection using a microfluidic encapsulation approach; demonstrate ability to screen >1 million enzyme variants per day, and 3) use machine learning to predict and learn from improved catalyst variants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project also involves the training of graduate students and postdocs, the organization of seminars and workshops on related topics, and dissemination of ideas to non-expert audiences through public lectures and survey articles.<br/><br/>This project concerns the existence and geometric structure of harmonic maps, minimal surfaces and minimal submanifolds of codimension 2 and 3, in relation to isoperimetric problems in spectral geometry and singularity formation for gauge-theoretic PDEs. With his collaborators, the PI will exploit new techniques for constructing extremal metrics for Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalues--developed in recent work of the PI with Karpukhin, Kusner, and McGrath--to produce many new minimal surfaces of prescribed topology in low-dimensional spheres and balls, and study related constructions of minimal surfaces in generic ambient spaces via mapping methods. Building on prior work with Pigati and Parise-Pigati, the PI will continue to investigate the relationship between the abelian Higgs model and minimal submanifolds of codimension two, and explore an analogous correspondence between the SU(2)-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations and minimal varieties of codimension 3. In another direction, the PI will further develop the existence and regularity theory for harmonic maps on manifolds of supercritical dimension n ? 3, combining variational methods with new analytic techniques to study the existence and compactness theory for harmonic maps with bounded Morse index into general targets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, dimension four has been one of the most enigmatic dimensions, as various mathematical theories falter here. Therefore, the PI aims to develop new theories that can enhance our comprehension of this space.

This will  advance scientific knowledge, bolster maritime defense, and strengthen the economy. These new capabilities will be achieved using innovative machine learning methods to simultaneously capture the robot?s surroundings and pinpoint the robot?s location by combining acoustic and visual information. Project outcomes will be demonstrated for use in archaeology by mapping historically significant shipwreck sites. The results will also apply to tasks such as underwater construction, infrastructure maintenance, and emergency response. The underwater environment is a challenging workplace for robots and humans. Most electromagnetic radiation is absorbed or scattered over short distances, precluding reliance on satellite navigation signals or ambient illumination. Other effects due to water movement or variable transmission properties can further distort interpretation of sensor measurements. Because different types of signals respond differently to these effects, the fusion of diverse imaging modes such as light and sound offers the promise of improved mapping and localization error, while also reducing the amount of data required. Reducing or eliminating the need for a human pilot allows allocation of human expertise to higher-value tasks. This project will develop virtual resources for K-12 education, university curricula, and public outreach platforms, making marine robotics research and education accessible to a broader population. Software and datasets developed throughout this work will be published to foster innovation in robotics for ocean exploration.<br/><br/>Marine environments pose unique challenges to robot perception due to the complex nature of underwater sensing across multiple modalities. Imagery collected with cameras provides high resolution observations at close range but can be highly degraded due to the effects of underwater light propagation. This results in loss of information about the scene, especially at longer ranges. Sonar can provide long-range sensing capabilities but has low resolution and viewpoint-dependent appearance. While acoustic and visual sensors appear complementary, multi-sensor fusion is non-trivial due to the differences in geometry and appearance across these modalities. This research project investigates implicit neural representations for multimodal fusion of underwater imagery and acoustic data. This project will contribute new knowledge in adaptive multimodal fusion and uncertainty estimation for deep learning to leverage the learned implicit neural representations for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The developed methods will be demonstrated in real underwater environments through the task of autonomous real-time dense mapping of shipwreck sites in Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary. This work will be broadly applicable to survey and inspection of complex marine structures beyond shipwrecks, including offshore energy infrastructure, pipelines, and underwater caves. Knowledge developed through this project will be transferable to mobile robots operating in challenging terrestrial environments, such as in poor weather conditions or GPS-denied environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major theme in differential geometry has been to study the interplay between the curvature and the large-scale properties of a manifold. To study these questions, various techniques have been developed, many of them based on partial differential equations. Examples include the minimal surface equation and the partial differential equations governing optimal mass transport. This project is aimed at understanding these partial differential equations. This is of significance within mathematics. There are also connections with general relativity. Moreover, ideas from optimal transport have found important applications in statistics and computer science. The project also includes a variety of mentoring and outreach activities. <br/><br/>An important topic in geometry is to understand the geometric meaning of the scalar curvature.

Many of the projects in this proposal concern the connection between problems in number theory and the distribution of zeros of L-functions. This connection is central to two of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, the Riemann hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

Each of these problems requires using explicit formulae (connecting zeros of L-functions to the primes) to create a novel Fourier optimization framework and then to solve the resulting problem in analysis.

In contrast, the design of algorithms is far from systematic and often involves extensive numerical computations to tune hyperparameters or insight of experts guided by computer-assisted analysis. Building on these recent advances in algorithm analysis, this project aims to develop a principled approach to algorithm design.

Concerning a): Certain materials, often made up of rod-like or disc-like molecules, display a range of ""liquid crystalline phases"" at suitable temperature/concentration ranges; these phases lie between the traditional (disordered) liquid and (ordered) crystalline phase, and thus possess varying degrees of order. Liquid crystals and their suspensions have revolutionized the industry of ultra-thin display devices and are showing promise in a number of other applications such as drug delivery, active matter and the orientation of carbon nanotubes. Concerning b): The photonic devices studied in this project include certain novel kinds of resonators, waveguides, and antennas. Particular focus is on devices made from epsilon near zero materials: these are materials whose dielectric permittivity is close to zero at the frequency of device operation. These novel devices find applications in efforts to enhance light-matter interactions.

The scientific broader impact of this research is that its findings are expected to shed valuable insights on specific models used in application areas. These insights are expected to explain the results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) when this is possible, and more importantly, provide qualitative and (sometimes) quantitative information when DNS becomes formidable or even prohibitive. The project will also include a significant component on human resource development: a number of the projects in this award will be carried out in collaboration with graduate students and postdocs at the University of Utah. The trainees will learn, use, and develop tools in the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory and homogenization theory.<br/><br/>Concerning liquid crystals, at the heart of their role in the aforementioned applications are both their anisotropic properties leading to their ordered phases on the one hand, and the rich phase transitions they can undergo between phases displaying varying degrees of order. This project will elucidate these effects through mathematical modeling and analysis and explain how they robustly result in a description of the shapes of the phase boundaries between the ordered nematic and disordered isotropic phase. A different goal of the research thread on liquid crystals is the justification of the widely used ""electrostatic"" description of the many-particle interactions in out-of-equilibrium liquid crystal colloids. Such a description is invaluable, because without it the modeling of liquid crystal colloids consists of a highly nonconvex, nonlinear problem in a domain exterior to the colloidal particles (coupled with other multi-physics aspects of the specific application). Concerning photonic devices: The mathematical problems addressed will involve either the Maxwell system (in 3D) or the scalar Helmholtz equation (in 2D) but with piecewise constant, complex coefficients; often such systems interact in interesting ways with geometric features such as corners, producing resonance effects. This project is aimed at understanding these effects, and some novel shape optimization problems arising from these physical situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advantages of carrying out reactions within nanoscale confined spaces have been demonstrated in systems ranging from electrocrystallization to chemical synthesis in nanoreactors. However, these studies have been limited by poor characterization and control of the chemistry and geometry of the nanoconfined spaces.  To overcome these limitations, the PIs and their students will employ a powerful combination of nanoparticle-imprinting techniques with novel scanning electrochemical probes. Using this approach, they seek to unravel the contributions of several physicochemical phenomena to the complex electrochemistry of confined systems. An improved understanding of confined electrochemical processes has the long term potential to impact nanofabrication efforts and advance the development of sensors and electrocatalysts.  The graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will be trained in a multidisciplinary research environment in nanomaterials, interfacial electrochemistry, scanning probe microscopy, mathematical modeling, and nanoscience.<br/><br/>Nanocavities of differing size and chemical functionality on the inner surface will be formed to study the effects of confinement on electrochemical processes.  Precise control of the physical and chemical properties of the pores will be attained through surface modification and extensive characterization. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) based approaches will be developed in an effort to map individual nanocavities and provide quantitative measurements of chemical processes in confined spaces. Nanometer-sized SECM tips will be used to measure fluxes of electroactive species generated inside a nanocavity, induce local electrodeposition, and image the topography changes in growing nanostructures inside the pores. SECM theory will be developed, and finite-element simulations will be performed to facilitate the extraction of quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. Several fundamentally important electrochemical reactions will be investigated in nanocavities with well-defined geometry and surface chemistry, including the oxygen reduction reaction in water, electrodeposition of Cu, and electropolymerization of conductive polymers. The main goal is to reveal the origins of confinement effects on each process and explore the possibility of controlling their kinetics and pathways by tuning the geometry and chemical properties of nanocavities. <br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israel Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will contribute theoretical and computational approaches for understanding the dynamics of such reaction-diffusion systems.  One theme of this research is understanding how complexities in the spatial coupling of components affect the dynamics of these systems.  This complexity could take the form of network-based interactions of components or it could consist of understanding the role of spatial barriers for which the rate of diffusion or reaction is different from that of the bulk of the domain.  Outcomes will include mathematical results validating certain reduced systems, modeling and analysis of several applied problems, as well as the development of rigorous computational methods for the study of traveling interfaces.   The project will also contribute to the training of PhD and undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>Three specific project areas are to be considered.  The first revolves around the analysis of reaction-diffusion equations defined on networks.  When the number of components is large, it is often convenient to pass to a mean-field limit where the discrete graph is replaced by a more tractable nonlocal equation.  The goal of this project is to contribute theoretical results relating the nonlocal equation and the discrete system thereby validating the use of the nonlocal equation.  The second project involves the development of validated numerical techniques for the study of fronts propagating into unstable states.  The primary challenge in this analysis is the appearance of repeated eigenvalues and resonances in the linearization of the traveling wave equation near the unstable state.  The third project involves partial differential equation models defined on spatial domains with dynamical barriers.  Focusing on the dynamics near unstable states, the project will quantify how the dynamics within these barriers affect the evolution of the overall system and speed of invasion of the unstable state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, approximately 40% of food produced globally is wasted due to inadequate refrigeration practices. Avoiding these losses is a priority, particularly in light of the anticipated food shortages resulting from climate change. Furthermore, the United States is impacted by hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths every year due to foodborne illnesses caused by undetected exposures of refrigerated items to inadequate temperatures. Similar challenges are also experienced by the pharmaceutical industry, which is increasingly relying on biologics and vaccines requiring deep-frozen or cryogenic storage temperatures. While the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has generated new computational capabilities to improve the efficiency of the cold chain, using these capabilities requires having access to highly miniaturized and massively deployable wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) to remotely and continuously measure the temperature of any items with high sensitivity and long detection ranges, even when operating at exceptionally low temperatures. Developing such WSNs is critical to timely identifying any items undergoing temperature irregularities along the cold chain before it is too late for corrective actions. This project will leverage the team?s interdisciplinary expertise in micro- and nano-technology, nonlinear dynamics, electromagnetics, and microwave acoustics to demonstrate a new class of passive WSNs, namely the Remote Sensing and Identification Chips (RSICs). Through this project, a new chapter in the history of wireless sensing will be written by generating long-range remote sensing microsystems with mm-scale spatial resolution that can be manufactured en-mass through standard semiconductor processes. The team will also collaborate with the STEM education and workforce development program at Northeastern University to organize and host on-campus activities involving students and educators from K-12 schools, community colleges, and local schools, with the goal of stimulating greater engagement in STEM, particularly among underrepresented student populations.<br/><br/>The new RSICs will surpass all the limitations that have prevented practical implementations of chip-scale WSNs for identification and remote temperature sensing, significantly enhancing the remote sensing capabilities of passive WSNs operating in rich multipath settings. The RSICs will exploit the unique features of monolithically integrated magnetoelectric, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric devices, combined with unexplored dynamics of the exotic wave propagation features produced by acoustic metamaterials, to i) overcome the fundamental limit in the smallest size of passive WSNs, enabling a remote temperature sensing with mm-scale spatial resolutions; ii) achieve record-breaking long sensing ranges never attained before by any on-chip counterparts; iii) exhibit dynamically boosted sensing performance immune from clutter, multipath, and readers' self-interference. The RSICs will occupy an area more than 100 times smaller than their existing counterparts and can be manufactured with the same fabrication processes used to build integrated circuits for consumer electronics. Prototypes of the RSICs for both continuous temperature sensing and temperature threshold sensing will be developed by the end of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The construction is deeply rooted in the interaction between modern mathematical methods and ideas from mathematical physics; and indeed, Heegaard Floer homology has found interactions with many other mathematical fields, including symplectic geometry, analysis, representation theory, and homological algebra. But in its essence, Heegaard Floer homology was designed to study low-dimensional phenomena, such as how knotted a circle can be in a three-dimensional manifold, how knotted two-dimensional surfaces can be in four-dimensional space, and how interesting a four-dimensional space can be.  The project aims to further explore the topological applications of Heegaard Floer homology; and to further build the foundations of this invariant, both to develop computational schemes and to build a broader theoretical framework into which the theory fits in algebraically. The project will also help support graduate students studying in low-dimensional topology and related areas.<br/><br/>The project will further develop bordered aspects of Heegaard Floer homology, specifically for dealing with its U-unspecialized versions, which are more sensitive to four-dimensional differential topology than the U-specialized versions. Parts of the project involve collaborations with other researchers, including Robert Lipshitz, Zoltan Szabo, and Dylan Thurston. Joint work with Lipshitz and Thurston sets up the algebraic background needed for this extension of weighted A-infinity algebras, their tensor products, and modules; constructed the weighted A-infinity module for the torus; weighted modules associated to three-manifolds with (bordered) torus boundary. The project aims at proving a pairing theorem, which expresses the Heegaard Floer homology module of a union of two three-manifolds glued along a torus as a suitable tensor product of the modules associated to the two manifolds. The project also aims to generalize the picture to three-manifolds whose boundary is a closed, hyperbolic surface.

Solving such systems directly often proves to be intractable. A fundamental theme in algebraic geometry is the interplay between the qualitative geometry of algebraic varieties and the quantitative analysis of solutions to polynomial equations. Central to this is the question of classifying algebraic varieties. The answer to the classification question often comes in the form of a so-called moduli space, which is a parameter space for the algebraic varieties of interest. Each point of a moduli space represents a variety, and the geometry of the moduli space reflects the ways these varieties change and deform as the parameters vary. The classification question, then, is tantamount to understanding the geometry of the corresponding moduli space. This project will develop new tools in moduli theory and use them to advance the classification of algebraic varieties. In addition, the project will provide research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the space of pointed curves by pointed stable curves has been the gold standard in moduli theory. In higher dimensions, the stable pair, or KSBA, compactification serves the same role. However, its construction and geometry are considerably more intricate, and few general reults about its local and global geometry are known. This project will develop and refine techniques in the deformation theory of stable pairs and wall-crossing phenomena for higher-dimensional moduli, thereby offering a path toward developing higher-dimensional enumerative geometry. A second focus is to explore the log Calabi-Yau wall. The theory of stable pairs applies to varieties of log general type, and the theory of K-stability applies to log Fano varieties. This project will develop a moduli theory for log Calabi-Yau pairs that will bridge the gap between KSBA- and K-moduli. Finally, the project aims to use the previously developed moduli theoretic techniques to answer questions in arithmetic geometry and arithmetic statistics, namely on counting rational points of bounded height on stacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These defects can change the normal flow of blood through the heart and can be life-threatening. It is important to find these defects soon after birth. In the U.S., all newborns are checked for CCHDs before they leave the hospital. This is done using a method called pulse oximetry which measures how much oxygen is in the blood.  However, this method doesn?t always find some types of CCHDs. This project will work on a new way to find these heart defects. It is based on the idea that the small movements of a baby?s chest caused by heart activity are different in babies with CCHDs. The project will focus on finding the specific patterns of these chest movements that could indicate a CCHD. This could offer a new way to check for these heart defects. The knowledge and tools created by this project could help improve care for newborns with these heart diseases and reduce healthcare costs. The project will also include activities to teach people about CCHDs and how they are diagnosed, especially among groups who are more likely to be affected by these conditions. These activities include outreach to K-12 students, mentoring K-12 and undergraduate students in CCHD-related research, creating and publicly sharing short educational videos, and developing a mobile app to enhance parental awareness of congenital heart defects. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this CAREER project is to enhance our understanding of the impact of major types of CCHDs, including coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, and patent ductus arteriosus, on the patterns and characteristics of chest surface vibrations recorded by seismocardiography (SCG) and gyrocardiography (GCG), and therefore, evaluate the clinical value of these signals in detecting CCHDs. The project?s central hypothesis is that these vibrations vary between newborns with CCHDs and those without cardiovascular diseases, and thus, they hold significant diagnostic potential for identifying CCHDs of interest. The goal of this project will be attained by (i) identifying indicators of CCHDs by evaluating the signatures of SCG and GCG signals in the presence of CCHDs, using machine learning and statistical models, (ii) understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of chest vibrations in the presence of CCHDs by creating and validating a novel vision-based pipeline, and (iii) investigating the genesis of CCHD indicators through developing and validating multiscale computational models.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Engineering of Biomedical Systems Program (EBMS) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fundamental studies are important because they will make it possible to discover how molecular structure correlates with the energy is associated with its folding/unfolding and how quickly this takes place, in the absence of the complicating effects of other nearby molecules. This is key information, for example, in addressing problems that involve basic components of molecular devices such as ""wheel and axle"" structures that could be used in switches and memory storage devices built from the smallest possible parts, individual molecules. These new characterization methods are fundamental to applications that may impact manufacturing, computing, and medicine. This work will be carried out by graduate students who will be trained in advanced analytical techniques that are vital for the U.S. biotechnology industry, and by undergraduate students who will gain experience in chemical research that prepares them to enter the future science and technology workforce.<br/><br/>Prior studies of changes in collision cross sections of gas phase ions have focused on large protein molecules and are based on ion mobility or traveling wave techniques. Such large molecules usually have complex structures, making observed changes in collision cross sections difficult to interpret, difficult to model, and difficult to correlate with structure. The work to be carried out here uses powerful but non-specialized Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometric (FT-ICR MS) instrumentation to study smaller molecules that have a limited number of well-defined conformational possibilities and are straightforward to model computationally, facilitating discovery of correlations between structure and folding energetics and kinetics in a simple, solvent-free environment. The overall goal is to characterize the change in size of molecules following activation through desolvation, collisions, or photon absorption, followed by subsequent collisional or radiative cooling. These fundamental studies are important because much of chemical and biochemical reactivity and kinetics depends on molecular shape, and the ability to change shape as well as the rate of change can be an important modulator of chemical behavior. Because the cross section measurement methods developed here have been shown to be transferable to Orbitrap mass spectrometers and to the emerging field of electrostatic linear ion traps, the techniques developed here are expected to be immediately useful for interpretation of biomolecular studies such as those of the collision-induced unfolding of peptides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the years, researchers and practitioners have created and tested different ways to support students who struggle with learning mathematics. These methods include directly teaching various mathematics skills and strategies that affect mathematics performance, such as alleviating mathematics anxiety and fostering motivation and engagement in mathematics learning. The idea is that teaching mathematics using a mix of these skills or strategies might help students learn better than teaching just one skill or strategy at a time. However, it remains unclear which skills or strategies should be taught together and if mixing different skills or strategies leads to differential effects across different students or contexts. Understanding this is vital because it can help researchers and practitioners determine the best ways to address the need of struggling students in mathematics. Whereas a traditional meta-analysis allows for examination of the effectiveness of a skill/strategy, a network meta-analysis will allow the field to examine different combinations of instructional skills/strategies as well as their interaction effects. This can provide more optimal information about different instructional approaches.<br/><br/>This study is a comprehensive systematic review and network meta-analysis of research on the impact of mathematics interventions on mathematics outcomes for Grades PreK to 12 students. The goal of this project is to explore 1) the effectiveness of mathematics intervention with different combinations of instructional and affective components on mathematics outcomes among PreK-12 students with and without mathematics difficulties and 2) for whom, on what mathematics outcomes, and under what conditions mathematics interventions and combinations of intervention components work the best. This study will focus on evidence-based mathematics instruction tapping the following components: Worked examples, mathematics language, multiple representation, number lines, word problems, mathematics fluency, mathematics motivation, mathematics anxiety, and engagement.

To date, the cause for the increase in atmospheric CO2 during this period is poorly known. Early human activities associated with new agricultural practices may have been partly responsible, but recent work has suggested that the migration of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) may have altered carbon cycling and storage. While this may be a compelling explanation, it does not address whether this process was unique to the Holocene as compared with previous warm periods. To address this knowledge gap, the team will generate proxy records for the last 900,000 years in the Southern Ocean and evaluate several hypotheses regarding changes in CO2 levels. The project provides an opportunity for early career researchers and students to develop their research programs and take part in outreach activities. This research is relevant to society given its implications for understanding the role of humans in climate change.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to reconstruct the SWW movement during earlier warm periods (interglacials) and compare those with the response of the Southern Ocean biological pump, atmospheric CO2, and other climate metrics. Specifically, the investigators will use sediments collected during Expedition 379T, along the southern Chilean Margin (site J1001; 46 24.3?S, 77 19.4?W 3067 mbsl) to generate a foraminiferal oxygen isotope stratigraphy and an alkenone sea surface temperature record, which will be compared to records of climate, CO2 and insolation. Project participants will compare the Holocene with five earlier warm periods (MIS 5e, 9e, 11c, 13, and 19), characterized by both similar, and different orbital parameters as compared with the Holocene.

Such structural analysis is essential to help us understand the function (and malfunction) of molecules in complex samples, e.g., biofluids, cells, and tissues.  It is also crucial for the safety of therapeutic biomolecules.  The Hakansson laboratory employs electron irradiation of gaseous, charged biomolecules to yield diagnostic fragmentation.  Depending on their energy, electrons can either be attached or cause detachment of electrons from both cationic and anionic molecules.  While electron attachment to cations, resulting in electron capture dissociation (ECD), and electron detachment from anions,resulting in electron detachment dissociation (EDD), are energetically favorable and structurally informative processes that have been relatively broadly applied, including commercial implementations, many questions remain about the underlying mechanisms as well as how these processes can be tuned and how the resulting data should be interpreted.  Electron attachment to anions and electron detachment from cations are less favorable processes; however, the Hakansson laboratory has shown in previous work that negative ion electron capture dissociation; niECD is feasible and shows unique advantages for structural analysis of acidic biomolecules such as phosphorylated and sulfated analytes.  Recent work from the Hakansson group has also shown that electron detachment from cations (tandem ionization) can occur at much lower electron energies than previously demonstrated.  This research is providing new approaches to biomolecular structural characterization with important implications for drug discovery and enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms.  Students working on these projects gain exposure to highly interdisciplinary research.  Dr. Hakansson and her group also works to bring appreciation for these concepts and for broader science opportunities to middle school students in an effort to boost interest in the scientific method at an early educational stage.  <br/><br/>Under this award, the Hakansson group will explore electron energy vs. flux effects in positive and negative ion mode on both upgraded Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and beam-type implementations.  This research seeks to elucidate whether ?hot? ECD is not an energy but an electron density effect, tentatively termed electron flux dissociation; EFD.  Resulting spectra are rich in structural information, including amino acid side chain cleavages that can differentiate isomers and carbohydrate cross-ring fragments that provide linkage information for branched analytes.  Similarly, recent reports of internal fragments resulting from two backbone bond cleavages in proteins following electron irradiation do not appear to be a result of ?true? ECD but rather an electron flux effect.  In addition, because internal fragments have many isomeric and isobaric assignment possibilities, false discovery rates are high.  The Hakansson group seeks to elucidate all fragmentation pathways leading to terminal fragments, including hydrogen shuffling, radical a-type ion formation, and accompanying water/ammonia losses that can be erroneously assigned to internal fragments.  In addition, they will explore the role of de-isotoping errors in such assignments.  Furthermore, they will contrast EDD, which shows only two main fragment ion types, to collisional activation, which shows up to eight fragment ion types, with regard to false discovery of terminal and internal fragments from oligonucleotides.  Finally, the Hakansson team will leverage these insights with an eye toward improved alignment of ion-electron reactions with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of labile post-translational modifications and oligonucleotides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to use integrated molecular dynamics simulations and active machine learning to fill these knowledge gaps.

It employs an integrated approach, combining molecular dynamics simulations and active machine learning techniques, to address these questions. Its goal is to uncover previously unexplored physics governing interfaces, phase changes, and molecular transport within transcritical high-pressure flows. The incorporation of machine learning not only substantially diminishes the computational burden associated with molecular simulations but also possesses the potential to generate innovative, more precise models without prior knowledge of the underlying physical laws.

However, many of the polymers used exhibit low thermal stability and high flammability, especially biopolymers such as polylactic acid (PLA), which is one of the most common feedstocks for fused filament fabrication (FFF). One potential solution to this problem is to print polymer nanocomposites.  However, the layered structure and bonding in FFF can lead to anisotropic properties and internal voids or gaps between printed layers that are not found in their counterparts manufactured using thermocompression. These properties may affect the ignition and combustion behaviors of 3D-printed polymer nanocomposites. The principal aims of this project are to systematically study heat and mass transfer dynamics of 3D-printed PLA nanocomposites with FFF and to better understand their effects on ignition and combustion behaviors. The insight from this project may guide the design of new flame-retardant systems and improved fire safety for 3D-printed biopolymer products, which could reduce the frequency and severity of fires. This proposed research is a multidisciplinary project that integrates research and educational activities to enhance the pool of multidisciplinary engineers and professionals in local communities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is understand the heat transfer and mass transfer associated with the ignition and combustion of 3D-printed biopolymer nanocomposites. Literature is scarce on the use of polymer nanocomposites for 3D-printing applications to reduce their flammability hazards, although this technique is effective in bulk polymers manufactured using thermocompression.  Samples manufactured using thermocompression show a uniform dispersion of nanoparticles, leading to a homogeneous and isotropic material structure. By comparison, samples manufactured using 3D printing show different structural characteristics. Besides the anisotropic properties and the presence of voids, 3D-printed parts often are not uniformly filled; instead, they have internal infill patterns that provide structural support while minimizing material usage. The choice of infill density can affect the heat transfer and mass transfer in the anisotropic condensed phase of burning polymers. However, few studies have been performed to investigate these effects and gain a fundamental understanding. The project will fill this knowledge gap with three main objectives: (i) synthesize biopolymer nanocomposites-based filaments for 3D printing, (ii) manufacture samples using FFF and determine structural characterization, and (iii) study ignition and combustion behaviors of 3D-printed PLA nanocomposite samples under well-controlled fire conditions. This project is expected to promote the development of performance-efficient and cost effective flame retardant biopolymer nanocomposites for sustainable 3D printing applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Opsin is well known for its role in vision ? it is commonly located in the retina, the light-sensing tissue in the eye, where it detects light and transmits a signal to the brain enabling animals to 'see'. However, the protein appears to have another, more ancient function that is independent of its light-sensing ability. This function is evident in cells in certain organs other than the retina. The research outlined in this project will probe this other function of opsin with the goal of  understanding its biological importance and the molecular mechanism of its action. In so doing, the project addresses a fundamental problem in molecular cell biology. Trainees who work on this project will delve deeply into protein science and the cell biology of different sensory cells, and learn that proteins can moonlight, i.e., perform more than one cellular function.<br/><br/>The opsin protein in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) is called NINAE and it is found in both photo- and mechano-receptor cells. In photoreceptors opsin binds retinal, a light-sensitive chromophore, enabling visual transduction, whereas in mechanoreceptors opsin is retinal-free. In flies without NINAE, both cell-types degenerate. Photoreceptor degeneration results from retinal toxicity, but mechanoreceptor degeneration is unexpected, implying a critical chromophore-independent function for opsin. Precedent for such a function comes from bovine rod opsin that, when reconstituted into lipid vesicles, scrambles phospholipids between opposing membrane leaflets, independently of retinal. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest a mechanism for opsin-mediated scrambling, but this remains to be tested experimentally. Also, the biological importance of opsin-mediated scrambling is unclear because elucidating it would necessitate genetic manipulations in animals. Pilot studies revealed that NINAE has phospholipid scramblase activity, laying the foundation for determining how scrambling occurs and how it impacts cell homeostasis and animal behavior. Firstly, NINAE will be extracted from fly eyes and reconstituted into liposomes to (i) characterize its scramblase activity. Secondly, protein residues along the lipid transport pathway predicted by MD will be mutagenized in the fly to test for effects on (ii) phospholipid scrambling in vitro, and (iii) the structure and function of NINAE-expressing photo- and mechanoreceptors and sensory behaviors, using electrophysiology, immunohistology, electron microscopy, and behavioral assays. In addition to establishing a novel function for Drosophila opsin, the completion of this project will provide a molecular understanding of how unconjugated opsins scramble phospholipids, how scrambling dynamics impact opsin-expressing sensory receptors and the viability of sensory cells, and how that ultimately affects sensory behaviors. Addressing these questions is important for a general understanding of opsins as phospholipid scrambling might be the ancestral primary function of these light sensor proteins.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/German project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) where NSF funds the US investigator and DFG funds the German partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These capabilities are enabled by innovations in microfabricated shape-memory alloy (SMA) actuators, with integrated force and shape sensors, and including thermal management layers for minimizing actuator crosstalk and speeding response times. New data-driven feedback control schemes will be formulated to close the loop between sensors and actuators. The resulting robot end-effectors will be capable of assuming intricate shapes and applying precise tip forces, suitable for performing complex procedures in hard-to-reach areas, without damage to delicate surrounding tissue. The overarching goal of this project is a new class of soft robots for minimally invasive surgery (MIS), with better outcomes and faster recovery as the associated benefits for an aging society. The project themes will be integrated into university robotics classes and project-based high school subject modules. Outreach efforts will engage students from universities, community colleges, and high schools directly in the research process, with specific attention to groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. <br/><br/>This project will create a new class of microfabricated mesoscale shape-memory alloy SMA devices, and systematically integrate actuation, sensing, modeling, and control techniques to enable dexterous and dynamic control for challenging MIS tasks. The project is built upon the following three research thrusts: 1) fabricating soft SMA bimorphs, 2) implementing data-driven control and model-based estimation, and 3) creating multi-degree-of-freedom mesoscale SMA robots. The first thrust leverages microfabrication technologies to pattern SMA on soft substrates, resulting in multi-layered active SMA structures. The second thrust embeds shape and force sensors with the SMA actuators and adds complementary model-based estimation and data-driven control algorithms for shape and force control. The third thrust specializes, extends, and refines the new surgical robots for the task of MIS. The robots? new capabilities will be demonstrated in navigation tasks using 3D-printed heart and vasculature phantoms, and in ablation tasks using pig hearts.

A generative model is an abstraction, and often a simplification, of a data generating mechanism using probabilistic tools, where specific features of interest regarding the generating mechanism are encapsulated into parameters of the generative model. Bayesian statistical inference is a popular statistical paradigm for combining such generative models for data with prior information about model parameters in a principled fashion to perform statistical inference on the unknown parameters. Some of the salient aspects behind the tremendous growth in popularity of Bayesian inference  include principled incorporation of domain information, an in-built penalty for model complexity allowing automatic model selection, and facilitating borrowing of information across different domains via hierarchical modeling. However, being inherently model-based, Bayesian statistics is intrinsically susceptible to departures from the postulated generative model.  Through this project, the investigators will explore and develop new statistical methodology for performing Bayesian inference allowing flexible departures from the generative model under consideration. A major focus will be the user-friendliness of the proposed approaches, circumventing the need for a user to explicitly build probabilistic models of increasing richness. The research will be disseminated through articles at prominent avenues and research presentations. Additionally, software packages for the methods developed will be made available publicly. The investigators are committed to enhancing the pedagogical component of the proposal through advising students and developing graduate and undergraduate topic courses.<br/><br/>Flexible nonparametric Bayesian methods have gained in popularity to address perceived issues of traditional Bayesian modeling regarding model-misspecification. The last thirty years have seen a proliferation of such methods, both in mainstream statistics as well as the machine learning community, as we continue to encounter increasing levels of complexities in modern datasets. However, nonparametric Bayesian methods can be challenging to implement as well as interpret. Furthermore, in many applications, the targets of interest are quite simple and it is essentially futile to model all aspects of the data. The fundamental aim of the proposed research is to develop a flexible Bayesian non-parametric approach that retains the generative modeling aspect of traditional parametric Bayesian modeling while avoiding a complete probabilistic specification of the data generating mechanism as typically performed in nonparametric Bayesian modeling. This will be performed by defining a modified likelihood function, leveraging ideas from the empirical likelihood literature as well as optimal transport theory, that centers around a user-specified parametric family of densities. An automated calibration procedure will be developed to control the extent of centering around the parametric model. The investigators will offer a firm theoretical underpinning of the proposed procedure and develop computationally efficient algorithms to carry out inferential tasks. The developed methods will be applied to scientific learning problems in neuroscience and nuclear physics to allow departures from existing scientific models in situations where their operating characteristics are less understood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The precision of this effect is so remarkable (accurate to one part in a billion) that it underpins the modern metrological definitions of the kilogram and the ampere. The project aims to bridge a crucial gap in the current understanding of the QHE, specifically the lack of microscopic mathematical theory explaining 'anyons' in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Developing such a theory could advance efforts to construct and operate topological quantum computers. Furthermore, the investigator commits to training a new generation of scientists by involving graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in quantum information and engineering, promoting educational advancement and diversity in STEM fields. Through these efforts, the project not only advances scientific knowledge but also helps maintain a skilled workforce. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the theory of integer and fractional QHE. While our understanding of integer QHE is quite robust, there remain several profound mathematical problems that have yet to be answered. Conversely, our comprehension of fractional QHE is limited, and there is no microscopic theory of anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect - such a theory is highly relevant for applications in topological quantum computation. This project aims to advance our understanding of the fractional case and address open problems in the integer case. The project comprises two parts: (A) fractions in QHE and (B) frustration-free models of QHE. A significant problem in the theory of fractional QHE is explaining which fractions are admissible. Notably, a fractional Hall conductance of one half is not experimentally observed (is not admissible), while one third is. Numerous competing theories attempt to explain admissible fractions, but even within the realm of theoretical physics, there is no definitive answer to this problem. At a mathematical level of rigor, nothing is known. The investigator will study a new, symmetry-based explanation and further aims to make this explanation mathematically rigorous. The idea is to relate admissible fractions to symmetry constraints on a modular tensor category that describes anyonic excitations of the system. All exactly solvable models of anyons are frustration-free; however, none of these models describe the QHE. In (B), the goal is to demonstrate that this is not a coincidence and that all frustration-free models have zero Hall conductance. The investigator aims to establish a connection to the theory of frames and use this connection to prove the conjecture. The investigator will employ a diverse combination of mentoring activities to guide mentees' individual research processes and provide them with opportunities to participate in more advanced work.

These noble metal nanoparticles and their assemblies are central components in wide-ranging chemical, biological, and environmental technologies.  Critically, these nanoparticles do not work alone and in almost all cases, their function arises from the molecules adsorbed to the noble-metal surface.  In the last decade, N-heterocyclic carbenes have emerged as an exciting alternative functionalization platform to sulfur ligands for noble metal nanoparticles.  NHC-functionalized nanoparticles are now being studied for many applications including electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide  Despite this substantial success, current NHC ligands for nanoparticle applications are all structurally similar.  For this proposal, the Camden and Jenkins research teams will rationally design new NHC ligands for nanoparticles to improve their robustness and expand their applicability.  Finally, Professors Camden and Jenkins will support two positions in a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) Teaching Fellows Residency program that will take place during the summer.<br/><br/>This collaborative project between the Camden research team at the University of Notre Dame and the Jenkins research team of the University of Tennessee will address three outstanding fundamental scientific questions and challenges for use of N-heterocyclic (NHC) ligands in nanoparticle research.  First, the collaborative team will perform a series of isotope labeling experiments to study the NHC transfer process and exchange dynamics on nanoparticle (NP) surfaces.  Second, the researchers will synthesize new macrocyclic and hemispherical bidentate NHC ligands for gold nanoparticles to increase electrochemical and chemical resistance.  Third, the team will design NHC ligands with chemically addressable functional groups that are capable of stabilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in aqueous or organic environments, respectively, to establish their potential for post-synthetic modifications with model analytes.  These studies will focus on a top-down approach wherein the AuNPs are prepared and then functionalized NHCs transferred from isolated coinage metal NHC complexes.  A top-down approach is beneficial because multiple sizes and shapes of AuNPs can be prepared and the NHC transfer reactions are more universal compared to a bottom-up approach where each individual reaction must be optimized to form AuNPs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systematic reviews of the STEM education research literature have repeatedly shown that the results of impact evaluations can vary widely depending on how student outcomes are measured. For example, if student outcomes are measured using assessments developed by the primary researchers involved with the intervention or its evaluation, the results tend to be more favorable (i.e., show bigger impact) than when the outcomes are measured using independently-developed assessments (e.g., standardized tests). This discrepancy between researcher-developed and independently-developed assessments has fueled wider concerns about transparency and replicability in STEM education research, and in the social sciences more generally. The current project addresses this issue by developing statistical procedures for ensuring that the results of impact evaluations are not unduly dependent on the specific outcome measures used. In addition to improving the internal validity of STEM education impact evaluations, the proposed statistical methods can also be used to investigate sources of heterogeneity that may explain the discrepant results, thereby informing STEM education theory.<br/><br/>In this project, the choice of outcome measure is conceptualized as a pervasive but understudied source of treatment effect heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is quantified in terms of the variability of treatment effects over the individual questions or ?items? that make up an assessment. Intuitively, when treatment effects vary over items, this is a clear indication that different assessments of the same construct (i.e., assessments with different items) will lead to different research conclusions. This project builds on this intuitive idea by developing statistical methodology for evaluating the extent to which observed treatment effects are dependent upon item-level treatment effect heterogeneity that would not be expected to generalize to other assessments of the same construct. This is achieved by combining methods from robust statistics with item response theory to develop new procedures for evaluating differential item functioning with respect to treatment status. These new procedures (a) provide treatment effect estimates that are highly robust to item-level heterogeneity, (b) lead to a general-purpose specification test of whether naive estimates of treatment effects are biased by item-level heterogeneity, and (c) can be used to partition the bias in naive estimates into sources explained by item-level covariates and idiosyncratic sources specific to a given outcome measure. The performance of the proposed methodology is studied using sample sizes and research designs typical of STEM education research, and empirical results will be synthesized over a sample of STEM education impact evaluations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

Chemists commonly neglect spin coherence in molecules and describe multi-electron reactions by a series of incoherent, one electron steps. Waldeck, Paltiel, Naaman, and their students will build chiral electrodes to create electron pairs with the specific spin coherence properties for converting a chemical reactant to a particular product state in a simultaneous two electron transfer reaction, rather than two discrete one electron reactions.

Nanoscopic chiral electrode interfaces will be used to create currents of entangled electron spins and they will be characterized as a function of temperature and interface thickness through interferometry, weak localization, and spin-polarized transport methods.  The effect of spin coherence (entangled spins) as compared to spin-correlation of the electrons will be studied for two-electron reactions (the oxygen reduction reaction, reduction of aromatic molecules, and metal ion reduction).

Experimental progress in the last few years have made this regime accessible, with the discovery of new quantum materials and devices, producing a veritable avalanche of yet-unexplained experimental data. In the next three years, the PI will develop novel theoretical approaches that will provide the necessary tools to understand these phenomena, which are being realized in systems ranging from molecular organic materials to various devices made from stacking two-dimensional sheets of materials. Here, the electron-electron interactions in presence of materials disorder dramatically modify the energy landscape in which the electrons travel, sometimes disrupting their ability to move within the conductor.

These fluorophores have the potential to transform how we use and interact with light in technological applications, leading to faster and more efficient optical devices. The broader impacts of this initiative will include educational outreach programs that expose students to cutting-edge science, efforts to increase diversity within the scientific community, and the promotion of industrial collaborations. These efforts have the potential to not only push technological boundaries but also will ensure that the benefits of scientific research are shared widely and inclusively.<br/><br/>Supramolecular assemblies of organic molecules known as J-aggregates are exceptional fluorophores because of their high brightness, color purity, and fast emission (short emissive lifetimes). However, despite their obvious merits, J-aggregates suffer from several limitations that have hindered their potential use in device development and other applications. These limitations include low photoluminescence quantum yields and poor stability. This research project is structured around three primary objectives. The first objective is to develop silica-J-aggregate hybrid nanostructures and assess how the silica matrix influences various characteristics like brightness, photostability, structural robustness, and excitonic behaviour. The photo-physics of these new constructs will be explored including studying the properties of individual J-aggregates using advanced single-molecule techniques.  The solvent tunability of these encapsulated J-aggregates will be explored through surface functionalization. The second objective is to create a new class of robust, bright, and fast fluorophores with a significant Stokes shift by combined two J-aggregate systems coupled through Frster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). This involves employing electrostatic interactions and surface reactions to link donor and acceptor J-aggregates. FRET efficiencies will be investigated, and layer-by-layer deposition will be explored to assemble these structures as a thin film, optimizing their photonic interactions and utility in practical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before traveling to Utqia?vik, participants will discuss sea-ice conditions using local observations, weather reports, and satellite data in virtual seminars.

The initiative aligns with a recent California Executive Order (N-79-20) and Clean Cars II Regulations that requires a shift from internal combustion engines (ICE) to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) for cars and passenger trucks by 2035 and for medium and heavy-duty vehicles by 2045. Over the three-year project, approximately 50 students will be recruited to complete credit-bearing courses, resulting in industry validated certificates and degrees that will provide a path to high-demand and family sustaining jobs in the electric vehicle (EV) service field.  This will be accomplished through curriculum development and improvement projects with the input of regional employers, coupled with enhanced professional development for automotive faculty at the college.  To recruit additional students, Miramar College will establish a summer EV exploratory program for high school students interested in pursuing career opportunities in this field.<br/><br/>The motivating rationale stems from the significant growth in alternative-fueled vehicles in California, particularly plug-in electric vehicles, which has been accelerated by government led support. California leads the nation in ZEV adoption, with increased consumer interest in electric vehicles over the past five years.  This rapid adoption of ZEVs has created a need for a qualified skilled technical workforce with appropriate experience in EV technology.  In this project, Miramar College will (1) develop an accessible high-voltage safety curriculum, (2) establish a pathway for high school recruitment, (3) develop a strategy to engage current and incumbent automotive workers, (4) implement a professional development strategy to support Miramar faculty, and (5) strengthen partnerships with regional employers that will validate the new curriculum and serve as a destination for Miramar College students.  Through this project, historically underserved students in the San Diego area will have increased opportunities to enter the ZEV workforce.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typical examples are coupling of free fluid and porous media flows, fluid-structure interaction, and fluid-poroelastic structure interaction (FPSI). The developed methods will be employed for several biomedical and geoscience applications. Biomedical applications include investigation of non-Newtonian and poroelastic effects in arterial flows on important clinical markers such as wall shear stress and relative residence time, modeling LDL transport and drug delivery in blood flows, as well as flows in the eye and the brain. Geoscience applications include tracing organic and inorganic contaminants in coupled surface-subsurface hydrological systems, predicting hydrocarbon extraction in hydraulic fracturing, geothermal energy production, and modeling the effect of proppant particles in injected polymers on the fracture width and flow patterns. While focused on FPSI, the developments in this project will be applicable to modeling and computation of a wide class of multiphysics problems with a broad range of applications.<br/><br/>The project consists of a comprehensive program for mathematical and computational modeling of multiphysics problems that includes 1) development and analysis of new mathematical models, 2) design and analysis of stable, accurate, and robust structure-preserving numerical methods, 3) development and analysis of efficient time-splitting and multiscale domain decomposition algorithms for the solution of the resulting algebraic problems, and 4) applications to the geosciences and biomedicine. Variational formulations of new fluid--poroelastic structure interaction (FPSI) models based on Navier-Stokes - Biot couplings will be developed, extending current model capabilities to flows with higher Reynolds numbers. Fully coupled nonlinear FPSI-transport models, including miscible displacement models with concentration-dependent fluid viscosity, stress-dependent diffusion, and non-isothermal models will also be studied. Novel discretization techniques will be investigated for the numerical approximation of the FPSI models. The focus will be on dual mixed and total pressure discretizations with local conservation of mass and momentum, accurate approximations with continuous normal components for velocities and stresses, and robustness with respect to physical parameters. These include multipoint stress-flux mixed finite element methods and local-stress mimetic finite difference methods that can be reduced to positive definite cell-centered schemes. Efficient multiscale domain decomposition and time-splitting algorithms will be developed for the solution of the resulting algebraic systems. The domain decomposition methodology will be based on space-time variational formulations and will allow for multiple subdomains within each region with non-matching grids along subdomain interfaces and local time-stepping. The convergence of the space-time coarse-scale mortar interface iteration will be studied by analyzing the spectrum of the interface operator. Iterative and non-iterative time-splitting methods will also be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When combined, these knowledges can give a more complete picture of sea ice as an essential part of the Arctic system. But, there are few opportunities for different knowledge practitioners to come together. This project creates an opportunity through the Sikumiut Field School: a field-based experience designed to bring together Indigenous Knowledge holders, numerical modelers, remote sensing experts, and field observers to learn and share sea-ice knowledge in Utqia?vik, Alaska. The school will create a collaborative environment to learn different perspectives of sea-ice knowledge. All participants will have the opportunity to be students and gain exposure to different interpretations of sea ice. The project aims to build and strengthen relationships across diverse communities.

This project aims to push the reliability, resiliency, and efficiency of distributed computing platforms to their fundamental limits, in the presence of slow, faulty, or adversarial servers. Recent studies have shown that incorporating dependency and redundancy in computing, using coding theoretic techniques, is a promising approach to mitigate the impact of unreliable machines. Existing solutions, however, are built on a foundation that is inconsistent with the computational requirements of machine learning, limiting their effectiveness. This project seeks to redefine coded computing from its core principles, establishing a unified and concise foundation that is deeply connected and naturally applicable to large-scale, distributed machine learning algorithms. In addition to the technological novelty, the project features curricular development, graduate student mentoring, and dissemination of results through tutorials and summer courses.<br/><br/>Inspired by the success of error correction codes in dealing with missing and corrupted symbols in communication channels, researchers have been adapting and extending those concepts, methods, and tools to introduce coded redundancy in computing.  Traditional error correction codes, however, are designed for exact recovery of messages, often embedded in a finite field. Those designs do not align with the requirements of machine learning computations and impose unnecessarily stringent constraints on the application of coded computing.  This research seeks to shift the foundational principles of the coded computing from a coding theory-centric approach to a multidisciplinary framework, incorporating approximation theory, non-parametric regression, and manifold learning. This new approach seamlessly integrates with machine learning applications, offering a more natural and effective solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process of electricity generation using wind turbines emits 10-100 times less CO2 per kWh over its lifetime compared to electricity from fossil fuels. While wind energy offers tremendous environmental benefits, it also poses challenges in terms of solid waste management. Wind turbine blades are primarily made of glass fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPC) to provide durability and operational lifetimes beyond 20 years.  However, this durability also makes them difficult to recycle.  With 5 million tons of blades to be retired in the coming decades, ?Wind Energy Tech Recycling Research & Development? was identified as a critical area in the recent US Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This project aims to address this challenge by exploring various end-of-life (EOL) management options for wind turbine blades, focusing particularly on recovering the glass from the blades. The approach involves a combination of experiments and modeling to understand the overall environmental footprint and cost-effectiveness of different recycling methods. Options will include recovery of clean glass fibers that can either be downcycled or remelted in cullet to form high-strength fibers, as well as existing options of landfilling, cement co-processing, and mechanical recycling.  Project outcomes will inform the development of collection and recycling infrastructure in the United States.<br/><br/>This project encompasses aspects of both Industrial Ecology and Green Engineering. The team will combine experiments and modeling to quantify relationships between pyrolysis/calcination conditions and glass fiber properties, environmental impacts, and cost.  This information will be incorporated into an integrated framework for assessment and trade-off analysis of EOL pathways at the regional and national scale.  The team will (1) quantify relationships between thermal recycling process conditions, recovered glass properties, and energy required/recovered by experimental analysis of real-world field samples of blade waste; (2) quantify the life cycle environmental and economic impacts of near-horizon glass recycling and downcycling EOL options for wind turbine blades using life cycle assessment (LCA) and technoeconomic analysis (TEA); and (3) quantify supply chain and circular economy impacts of near-horizon EOL options by analyzing prospective scenarios with an integrated discrete event simulation model combining dynamic material flow analysis, LCA, and TEA. This project has the potential to significantly impact recycling approaches and infrastructure for composite materials across many sectors including energy, construction, automotive, maritime, and defense. Wind turbine blades are a useful model system because they comprise a large and concentrated waste stream, and this work will help guide their EOL management. The project will also result in education and training of multiple PhD and undergraduate students. Outreach will include an annual renewable energy series at a West Philadelphia middle school and Philly Materials Day, designed for K-6 students from the School District of Philadelphia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the ensuing debate over correctional reform, the ?Nordic Model? of incarceration is routinely positioned as a less punitive, more humane alternative. With human dignity as a guiding value, Nordic Model prisons are designed less to punish incarcerated people than to facilitate their reintegration into society after release. The stark contrast between the Nordic model and more punitive approaches explains the former?s appeal in the correctional reform debate yet also prompts caution about the challenges to its adoption in contexts outside the Nordic sphere. The application of the Nordic Model in U.S. correctional settings, for instance, may require creative methods of translating seemingly incompatible values, policies, and practices. This research sheds light on how and to what degree the Nordic Model contributes to correctional reform in new contexts, particularly those grounded in a punitive approach. More broadly, it increases understanding of the potential for correctional innovations that endeavor to change the status quo. Attention to the values that underpin incarceration, and how these are negotiated, experienced, merged, and changed, adds nuance to a debate that all too often resorts to irreconcilable binaries, such as prison as usual or prison abolition. <br/><br/>This research examines how correctional systems negotiate potentially conflicting principles and values in the course of policy development and implementation and how prison staff and incarcerated people experience these efforts toward reform. The following questions guide the inquiry: 1) How have Nordic principles of incarceration, such as dignity, normalization, and resocialization, among others, been translated for implementation in U.S. corrections, in both policy and practice? 2) What are the short-term and long-term goals of the adoption of the Nordic model of incarceration? 3) What factors facilitate or constrain the achievement of these goals? 4) How is the implementation of these principles experienced by correctional staff and incarcerated people? The research methods include observation, interviews, and analysis of archival documents and focus on several sites in the United States where the Nordic model is being implemented. Variation across the study sites allows for the analysis of multiple pathways of innovation in correctional policy and practice. This variegated comparative analysis contributes to the scientific understanding of how change is accomplished in carceral institutions and how that change is experienced. This understanding lends insight into the potential for sustainability of initiatives that adopt the Nordic Model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Department of Justice guidelines tell officers to construct lineups with fillers similar enough that the suspect won?t stand out--but not so similar as to reduce positive eyewitness identifications. At present police ?eyeball? arrays to gauge whether they are fair enough.  In appellate court cases judges also ?eyeball? lineups and consider two ?fairness? comparisons:  They compare members to witness descriptions to assure that everyone is consistent with the description and compare members of arrays to assure they are generally similar in appearance.  Some eyewitness researchers argue that assuring all lineup members are consistent with witness descriptions is sufficient to assure fairness.  They argue that other variations in lineup members? appearance will aid witnesses in distinguishing the guilty from the innocent?whereas increasing the similarity of suspects and innocent ?fillers? will undermine witness performance.   Among the questions addressed in the proposed research are does matching to description alone produce optimal witness performance or does additional suspect-filler similarity further enhance performance?  The project will also test whether recently-developed face-similarity software enables us to quickly and reliably construct fair arrays which produce high levels of performance and does it improve on ?eyeball? judgments?  The primary objective of the research is to improve police lineup selection procedures and judicial evaluations of lineup fairness.<br/><br/>Although there are indications from the prior research that it is possible to construct lineups that are unfair, fair, and too fair, we do not have a very clear picture of the levels of suspect-filler similarity that produce those outcomes. At present there are no methodologically sound studies with reliable similarity measures that directly compare strategies that at least some theorists and researchers believe will produce optimal levels of witness performance (using measures such as d?). To bring order to these findings we will experimentally pit theoretically- and empirically-driven selection strategies against one another under controlled conditions--using match-to-description vs match-to-suspect strategies employing varying degrees of suspect-filler similarity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is indeed remarkable that raindrops can form in around 30-60 minutes by the processes of coalescence and further by collisions between raindrops and cloud. There are many other processes that occur, with the final result being raindrops of different sizes and number densities. The mathematical equations governing the different processes are not known precisely so many approximations are needed. The term ?warm? rain generally refers to clouds whose temperature is warmer than 0 degree centigrade but such warm rain clouds can also be embedded in ?cold? clouds, the combination of which produces prolific amounts of rain, the most being from hurricanes and tornadic storms. The measurement of rainfall amounts is made by sophisticated instruments that fundamentally derive the number density and sizes of drops. The research objectives of this project are related to the latter objectives of a field program which will be conducted in the summer of 2024-2025 at Incheon, Republic pf Korea under the auspices of the Korean Meteorological Agency. Rainfall in these regions have many warm clouds embedded in deep cold clouds yielding large rainfall. <br/><br/>The specific goals are: (i) to characterize the underlying shapes of the drop size distributions (DSDs) in terms of the generalized gamma model and to evaluate its stability, taking into consideration rain-types and/or climatological dependence, if any; (ii) to retrieve DSD moments (0th to 7th) from two X-band polarimetric radar observations, focusing on the height profiles of the lower order moments especially over a heavily instrumented supersite, and cell-tracking thereafter; (iii) to determine how turbulent intensity affects the drop fall speeds; (iv) for events with significant turbulent intensity, to reconstruct the rain drop shapes from ground measurements and perform scattering calculations. The findings from this project will have direct impact on assessing accuracies of warm rain microphysical schemes. Cell tracking using 2 polarimetric X-band radars will enable more comprehensive understanding of the microphysical processes in a Lagrangian sense. Further, the concepts of the methods developed for retrieving DSD moments can be adapted to satellite-borne dual-frequency radar measurements. Another important area where the work will have direct relevance is radiowave propagation, specifically relating to co-polar and cross-polar effects for communications systems operating at millimeter waves. The effect of turbulence intensity on drop-fall velocities will undoubtedly have significant implications for hydrology and soil erosion related research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sterilization of harmful insects with safe bacteria is a revolutionary approach to pest control which can reduce and mitigate harmful effects of pesticide over usage. The bacteria and this sterilization mechanism are currently being used to sterilize and reduce mosquito populations which thereby reduces transmission of mosquito borne disease. This study delves into the underlying chemical mechanisms by which these bacteria sterilize insect sperm. By exploring this biological interaction, the project aims to enhance agricultural productivity and public health by controlling pests that damage crops and spread disease. It also provides an environmentally friendly and species specific alternative to traditional pest management methods. Additionally, this research incorporates and explores the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) in biotechnological applications. Researching and developing educational curriculum at the intersection of AI and biotech will facilitate the creation of new tools and contribute to a highly advanced biotechnological workforce. The developed curricula described by this proposal will be within the public domain, thereby democratizing access to the most cutting-edge scientific knowledge. The project directly contributes to societal well-being by improving food security and public health while reducing environmental impact.<br/><br/>This research project aims to dissect the mechanisms and evolutionary origins of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in insects. Specifically, the study seeks to delineate the molecular targets of CI and the role of mobile genetic elements, such as transposons, in the transfer and mobilization of CI genes. Utilizing a combination of experimental models across various Wolbachia strains and insect hosts, the research will test hypotheses related to the conservation of CI targets in embryonic development, the mobility of CI genes facilitated by transposons, and the evolution of CI from ancestral prokaryotic selfish elements to eukaryotic expression systems. The experimental approach encompasses cutting-edge techniques including liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for protein analysis, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for gene function studies, and the application of artificial intelligence algorithms to model evolutionary processes. These methodologies will enable precise mapping of interactions between CI factors and host proteins, and assess the evolutionary dynamics of gene transfer mechanisms contributing to CI. By integrating computational and biotechnological sciences, the project aims to uncover new insights into host-symbiont interactions and develop novel biocontrol strategies for insect management, thereby addressing critical gaps in our understanding of reproductive manipulation by endosymbionts. This project not only advances the fundamental science of microbial-host interactions but also provides a framework for the application of AI tools in evolutionary biology and genomics.

This one day event will take place in Bari, Italy, in October 2024, in conjunction with the ACM 2024 ACM Recommender System Conference (RecSys). RecSys is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems, and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems.  Recommender systems represent a vibrant and interdisciplinary field at the intersection of decision making, human-computer interaction, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. At their core, recommender systems aim to predict user preferences or interests and suggest items or actions that are likely to be relevant or desirable to them. These items could be anything from movies and music to products, news articles, or even potential connections in a social network. As RecSys brings  together the main international research groups working on recommender systems, along with many of the world?s leading companies, it has become the most important annual conference for the presentation and discussion of recommender system research.  Providing travel funding to support active participation of young researchers in this conference is very important for the health of the field and for the researchers themselves. <br/><br/>The goals of the symposium are 1) provide a supportive setting for feedback on students? current research and guidance on future research directions; 2) offer each student feedback and fresh perspectives on their work from faculty and students outside their own institution; 3) promote the development of a supportive community of researchers and a spirit of collaborative research; and 4) contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and conference events.  Students will apply through a widely advertised recruitment process and be selected by a program committee of faculty mentors who will consider their connection to the conference, their financial need, their representation of a diverse set of topics, institutions, and backgrounds, and their ability to benefit from and give back to the doctoral consortium.  The consortium will be structure both to provide close 1-on-1 mentoring as well as broad opportunities to connect to the wider RecSys community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that offers a path to a carbon-neutral economy. However, the most useful form of hydrogen, H2, is not abundant and instead hydrogen atoms are mostly found bonded to other elements, such as to carbon in hydrocarbons or to oxygen in water. Currently, 95% of the global H2 supply is produced by transforming methane from natural gas via the steam-methane reforming reaction that produces 5.5 tons CO2 per ton of H2. Electron-driven chemical reactions harnessing renewable electricity to produce H2 would be transformative for clean energy technology in the 21st century. While water electrolysis can leverage renewable energy for H2 production, producing H2 directly from methane is much less energy intensive and can lead to the co-production of high-value carbon materials, which would significantly decrease the cost of hydrogen. This research effort examines the scientific principles underlying a new approach to produce H2 as a carbon-free energy carrier from methane?a distributed and economically-essential asset in the U.S.?with no CO2 emissions. The process concurrently produces carbon fibers, versatile structural materials with applications ranging from civil infrastructure to consumer products. The project will involve interdisciplinary education and training of a post-doctoral researcher, and doctoral and undergraduate students.

This project will evaluate the hypothesis that interfacing microwave plasma with catalysts enables the suppression of unselective gas phase recombination and nucleation in favor of selective surface recombination reactions towards carbon fibers. This means controlling recombination chemistry on timescales of radical lifetimes which are likely in the order of 100 microseconds or less. The activation of strong C-H bonds in methane will significantly enhance the rate and conversion of methane pyrolysis at a volumetric scale in the gas phase but these short-lived plasma-derived intermediates must be transported to the two-dimensional catalytic surface. Thus, the interaction of plasmas with catalytic surfaces for methane pyrolysis involves time and length-scales that span orders of magnitudes and involve flux and reactivity of both short-lived intermediates as well as solid state nucleation and growth phenomena. This research will integrate in-situ diagnostics, catalyst science, and computational modeling to identify and understand physical phenomena at reaction and transport time and length scales appropriate to describe and facilitate plasma-catalyst interactions for methane pyrolysis to produce H2 and carbon fibers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is often assumed that chorus and hiss are well-separated by a sharp density gradient boundary called the plasmapause, with all hiss occurring on one side of the plasmapause and all chorus occurring on the other.  This assumption has a problem: around half of the time, the plasmapause boundary is ill-defined, and is observed as less of a boundary, but more of a transition region. When this occurs, chorus and hiss can co-occur and overlap spatially, meaning particles may feel the combined effect of both wave types simultaneously.

This project will also support students and researchers from a teaching-focused college to actively participate in geospace science research.<br/><br/>The investigation will first focus on cases where the plasmapause density gradient is not sharp (e.g., spans up to several L-shell), seeking to determine whistler-mode wave properties in the plasmasphere-plasmatrough transition region when a well-defined plasmapause may not exist (i.e., soft plasmapause). Data collected during these intervals are often excluded from statistical studies, which has led to wave property databases being built only from time periods when the plasmapause is a sharp, well-defined density gradient (i.e., hard plasmapause). This usually occurs during elevated geomagnetic activity, when waves are more intense, thus biasing predictive radiation belt models towards stronger wave-particle interaction processes.

Conventional wisdom suggests that they arise from the existence of size-dependent, band edge exciton fine structure. However, predicted bright/dark exciton fine structure splittings are much too small to account for experimentally-observed, 20-100 meV Stokes shifts. Professor Kuno and coworkers have recently put forward a model that attributes the origin of perovskite absorption/emission Stokes shifts to a polaron emitting state. This model rationalizes perovskite nanocrystal Stokes shifts in terms of size-dependent, polaron binding energies and simultaneously sheds new light on their band edge absorbing and emitting states.

In the ensuing debate over correctional reform, the ?Nordic Model? of incarceration is routinely positioned as a less punitive, more humane alternative. With human dignity as a guiding value, Nordic Model prisons are designed less to punish incarcerated people than to facilitate their reintegration into society after release. The stark contrast between the Nordic model and more punitive approaches explains the former?s appeal in the correctional reform debate yet also prompts caution about the challenges to its adoption in contexts outside the Nordic sphere. The application of the Nordic Model in U.S. correctional settings, for instance, may require creative methods of translating seemingly incompatible values, policies, and practices. This research sheds light on how and to what degree the Nordic Model contributes to correctional reform in new contexts, particularly those grounded in a punitive approach. More broadly, it increases understanding of the potential for correctional innovations that endeavor to change the status quo. Attention to the values that underpin incarceration, and how these are negotiated, experienced, merged, and changed, adds nuance to a debate that all too often resorts to irreconcilable binaries, such as prison as usual or prison abolition. <br/><br/>This research examines how correctional systems negotiate potentially conflicting principles and values in the course of policy development and implementation and how prison staff and incarcerated people experience these efforts toward reform. The following questions guide the inquiry: 1) How have Nordic principles of incarceration, such as dignity, normalization, and resocialization, among others, been translated for implementation in U.S. corrections, in both policy and practice? 2) What are the short-term and long-term goals of the adoption of the Nordic model of incarceration? 3) What factors facilitate or constrain the achievement of these goals? 4) How is the implementation of these principles experienced by correctional staff and incarcerated people? The research methods include observation, interviews, and analysis of archival documents and focus on several sites in the United States where the Nordic model is being implemented. Variation across the study sites allows for the analysis of multiple pathways of innovation in correctional policy and practice. This variegated comparative analysis contributes to the scientific understanding of how change is accomplished in carceral institutions and how that change is experienced. This understanding lends insight into the potential for sustainability of initiatives that adopt the Nordic Model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One major impact of wildfires in forests is the release of carbon when forest vegetation and soils burn. This increases atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, which in turn drives climate change. However, not all carbon in forest vegetation and soils is released to the atmosphere during wildfires. A large proportion is left in the forest, with part of this carbon being chemically and physically altered to ash and charcoal (called pyrogenic carbon). Pyrogenic carbon can be a large proportion of the carbon that is affected by a wildfire and can have important effects on how forests regrow. Despite this, researchers have never studied pyrogenic carbon formation in the highly productive temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest region, where wildfires are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity. This RAPID project will examine pyrogenic carbon production during wildfires in Pacific Northwest forests, as well as how newly formed pyrogenic carbon affects soil carbon cycling during ecosystem regeneration. This is critical for improving our ability to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and understand the vulnerability of forests to wildfires across the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>Despite the potential importance of pyrogenic carbon for post-wildfire forest recovery and accurate estimations of wildfire emissions, no research on the topic has been done in the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. From August-October of 2023, the mixed-severity Lookout Fire burned the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western cascades of Oregon?including forest stands with old growth characteristics?presenting a unique opportunity to close this research gap. This study will build on a unique dataset of fire behavior and pre- and post-fire vegetation conditions collected by the U.S. Forest Service?s Fire Behavior Assessment Team (FBAT) to (i) quantify pyrogenic carbon stocks as a function of total wildfire-affected carbon, and (ii) evaluate the influence of pyrogenic carbon on pathways of soil carbon loss and accumulation. The research will integrate existing datasets with field sampling of pyrogenic carbon stocks, tracking total soil and heterotrophic respiration in addition to water extractable organic carbon throughout the growing season, and laboratory analyses of soil carbon, soil nitrogen, and microbial dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electronic and vibrational motion play key roles in determining energy flow in matter and as a result, plays a critical role in many emerging technologies. Direct correlations between structure and energy conversion are difficult to obtain because of the structural inhomogeneity typical of most materials. The research team will address this challenge by isolating atomically precise nanoclusters that can be studied with experimental and computational methods that have both electronic and vibrational state-specific resolution. These fundamental studies could impact many important technologies based on photon-to-thermal energy conversion, such as photodynamic therapy, photocatalysis, integrated circuits, mass sensing, and materials manufacturing. The knowledge gained from this work could also impact the advancement of quantum-based technologies. The project will educate graduate and undergraduate students in advanced research methods, as well as impact undergraduate and graduate students by providing research opportunities and career development activities.<br/><br/>Structurally-precise monolayer-protected nanoclusters allow the synthesis of well defined metals that exhibit broadly tunable optical, electronic, and vibrational properties. This project is developing novel synthetic strategies to control many aspects of nanocluster structure, which include metal lattice, ligand, and valence electronic structure, particle morphology and composition. One aim of this research is to understand if electronic state lifetimes can be used to control the excitation mechanism of nanocluster acoustic modes. Success in this area could lead to high-precision nanomechanical resonators. A second aim focuses on using lattice packing structure and nanocluster shape to control vibrationally mediated photon-to-thermal energy transfer.

It is often assumed that chorus and hiss are well-separated by a sharp density gradient boundary called the plasmapause, with all hiss occurring on one side of the plasmapause and all chorus occurring on the other.  This assumption has a problem: around half of the time, the plasmapause boundary is ill-defined, and is observed as less of a boundary, but more of a transition region. When this occurs, chorus and hiss can co-occur and overlap spatially, meaning particles may feel the combined effect of both wave types simultaneously. This project will characterize wave properties in these transition regions and establish the impact of the transition region on radiation belt simulations. This project will also support students and researchers from a teaching-focused college to actively participate in geospace science research.<br/><br/>The investigation will first focus on cases where the plasmapause density gradient is not sharp (e.g., spans up to several L-shell), seeking to determine whistler-mode wave properties in the plasmasphere-plasmatrough transition region when a well-defined plasmapause may not exist (i.e., soft plasmapause). Data collected during these intervals are often excluded from statistical studies, which has led to wave property databases being built only from time periods when the plasmapause is a sharp, well-defined density gradient (i.e., hard plasmapause). This usually occurs during elevated geomagnetic activity, when waves are more intense, thus biasing predictive radiation belt models towards stronger wave-particle interaction processes. The team will construct full statistical hiss and chorus wave models for both the ?hard? and ?soft? plasmapause cases. This will be the first time that the characteristics and role of whistler-mode waves in spatially broad plasmasphere-plasmatrough transition regions has been directly investigated. The results will supply radiation belt modelers with the critical information of wave properties in the often-excluded case of ?soft? plasmapause transition regions (which account for ~50% of occurrences).

Globally transpiration accounts for perhaps 60% of continental evapotranspiration (ET, the sum of evaporation and transpiration), thus vegetation plays a central role in the release of water from the land.  The prominence of the ""T"" in ET gives plants an active role in climate change, as changes in vegetation could have as much influence on ET by regulating the land's supply of moisture to the atmosphere as changes in temperature have by regulating the atmosphere's demand for moisture from the land.<br/><br/>Research conducted here examines the regulation of moisture supply by vegetation change under increasing CO2.  The focus is specifically on two mechanisms through which CO2 directly influences plants, as opposed to the plant response to higher temperatures caused by the warming effect of CO2 in the atmosphere.  The first mechanism is CO2 fertilization, which happens because plants grow by photosynthesis, combining CO2 from the atmosphere with water from the soil, so that higher CO2 levels promote plant growth.  The result is an increase in transpiration due to an increase in leaf area, which provides a larger surface through which transpiration can occur. The second mechanism is a reduction in transpiration because plants absorb CO2 through their stomates and (roughly speaking) they close their stomates when they have enough CO2 for photosynthesis.  Thus more CO2 in the air means that fewer stomates are open at any given time, reducing transpiration.  The competing effects of fertilization and stomatal closure create a challenge for understanding how CO2-induced vegetation change affects the moisture supply for ET, since the net effect could depend sensitively on the details of plant physiology and the answer could differ substantially from one biome to another.<br/><br/>The primary activity of the project is an examination of fertilization and stomatal closure in simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which uses the Community Land Model (CLM) as its land surface component model.  Models used in climate change assessments show a wide range in both ET change and the contribution of transpiration to ET change.  The CESM experiments are designed to determine what aspects of vegetation physiology account for the large model-to-model differences.  The question is addressed through a perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) in which parameters controlling plant physiology are varied to determine the dependence of the transpiration response to CO2 on various physiological controls.  Additional simulations are performed using a version of CESM in which CLM is replaced by SLIM, the Simple Land Interface Model, in which relevant processes are represented in less detail for the sake of generating results which are easier to interpret and understand.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given concerns about future aridification due to CO2 increase. Recent studies suggest that changes in the moisture supply for ET due to vegetation effects can be comparable to the increase in atmospheric moisture demand that comes with warming temperatures.  These changes matter for the dryness of the surface air, the amount of moisture retained in the soil, and the amount of runoff produced by rainstorms.  They also matter for the intensity of heat waves and droughts and the likelihood of wildfires.  Beyond its societal value the work has broader impacts through outreach conducted with the Burke Museum's Girls in Science program, in which middle school girls interact directly with female scientists to learn about careers in science and how science research is conducted.  The project also provides support and training to a graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will have a direct impact on Tribal communities in the areas of food, energy, and water resources. UTTC is inherently intertribal and is uniquely positioned to serve many Tribes through its development and operation of an Intertribal Research and Resource Center (IRRC). Moreover, given that these factors are amplified in the Northern Plains where natural and anthropogenic changes to the environment, extreme and variable weather fluctuations, and stressed food systems are becoming more common and apparent, this work could serve as an international model for similar communities. <br/><br/>The IRRC has expanded and continues to expand UTTC's record of serving the Northern Plains as a research and training center and continues to operate on the four core activities of Research, Outreach, Training, and Education (ROTE). To meet the needs of the communities, the following goals are being met: 1) advancing the Intertribal Research & Resource Center at UTTC, (2) developing the institutional and regional capacity for applying science to address community needs, (3) enhancing Tribal natural resource and agricultural sustainability, and (4) increasing the Center?s capacity to utilize and promote local knowledge and research methods.  The IRRC continues to be transformative for the institution, which has allowed research faculty positions a place of prominence, a sustainable STEM research and outreach model, and a coordinated interdisciplinary approach to research, outreach, training, and education. The IRRC continues to conduct and expand research, training, and assistance to Tribes in planning and managing multiple resources. A cohesive structure, strong institutional commitment, focus on communication and community resilience, and tiered oversight, including a full-time center director, continue to expand the IRRC?s ability to operate efficiently and effectively.

The Carbon Connect Expedition is a multi-institutional, five-year research initiative that builds the foundations for sustainable computing. This shift towards sustainability could spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed, leading to a more responsible and sustainable approach to advancing computing technologies. By redefining the way computer scientists consider environmental sustainability, Carbon Connect will establish new standards for carbon accounting in the computing industry, thereby influencing future energy policy and legislation. By fostering an interdisciplinary community of researchers dedicated to sustainable computing, Carbon Connect will train the next generation of innovators in the combined fields of computer science, electrical engineering, environmental science, and energy policy. By creating an academic-industry consortium, Carbon Connect will accelerate the adoption of sustainable computing practices. Finally, by organizing workshops and curricula, Carbon Connect will educate future leaders in computer science and engineering.<br/> <br/><br/>The Carbon Connect Expedition re-thinks computing?s infrastructure, from semiconductor chips to hyperscale datacenters. Embodied carbon arises from a hardware component?s entire lifecycle, including its manufacture, transportation, and eventual disposal. This aspect of the Expedition seeks to minimize the environmental impact of producing semiconductor chips, which are fundamental to all electronic devices but come with a high carbon cost. Operational carbon, on the other hand, arises from energy consumed during a hardware component?s operational life. Given rapidly increasing energy demands from global datacenters that power the Internet, cloud services, and the emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence, addressing operational emissions at datacenter scale is particularly important. The Carbon Connect Expedition seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of information and communication technology by pursuing three main objectives. First, the Expedition will create transparent and accurate carbon accounting methods, which will include standardized protocols for measuring and reporting carbon as well as techniques for overcoming inconsistent estimates and broad error margins. Second, it will develop innovative tools and strategies for reducing computing?s carbon footprint by 45% within the next decade. These innovations will include the exploration of energy-efficient hardware design, advanced hardware recycling and disposal strategies to minimize embodied carbon, and the intelligent use of renewable energy to reduce operational carbon from datacenters. Third, the Carbon Connect Expedition will coordinate the design and management of future computer systems to sustainability deliver performance for artificial intelligence and virtual reality systems. This coordination will allow computer scientists and engineers to balance embodied and operational carbon, which cannot often be reduced simultaneously and require intelligent compromises. Together, these technical objectives will ensure continued advances in computational performance and capability yet ensure environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Costs to the insurance and reinsurance industry is many tens of billions of dollars, annually, with the number of storms and costs  escalating each year. In response to the looming crisis of the insurance sector insolvency, planning activities have been initiated to create an IUCRC to improve our understanding and better prediction of damaging convective storms. The proposed Center is anchored at two Sites: Northern Illinois University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Center will target the needs of the insurance and finance sector as well as other parts of the value chain to devise a compelling set of Center research thrusts and projects for a proposed, industry-supported IUCRC to be called The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Convective Storms (CIRCS). Planning activities will culminate in an in-person planning meeting attended by dozens of interested commercial entities with similar and/or overlapping needs. At the meeting the university faculty, committed to joining the Center, will provide a vision and mission for the Center, its value proposition, and examples of research projects the Center will undertake. If successful in attracting companies and other interested parties to join and pay a membership fee, all of which are pooled and used to fund high priority sector projects, a full Center proposal will be submitted to the National Science Foundation. If successful, the Center will focus on use-inspired, pre-competitive research to understand and provide tools and utilities to better understand and asses the risks of, and community/landscape/infrastructure vulnerability to, convective storm perils. Projects will involve advanced modeling and new observational capabilities designed to improve storm prediction. Broader impacts of the Center will include enhancing preparedness and response to convective storm-driven natural disasters to reduce their impact on loss of life and property, improving public safety and community resilience. It will also engage in public outreach and have strong student/workforce training elements in AI, machine learning, and big data analytics, improved early storm warnings, and the creation of more effective and accurate means of forecasting and assessing the risks of these dangerous storms and the damage they cause. <br/><br/>If realized, the IUCRC Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Convective Storms (CIRCS) will employ interdisciplinary faculty and sophisticated high performance computing analytical and modeling methods, machine learning, satellite information and AI to develop more accurate forecasts for convective storm predication.

It will develop improved and more efficient and effective models and algorithms to improve storm prediction as well as pioneer novel use of satellite remote sensing in addition to new methodologies for enable dynamical downscaling to the local scale for improving and extending to longer time scale estimates of storm arrival, damage, and economic loss. Results can be used by the insurance and actuarial sectors to improve convective storm risk assessment to make better decisions as well as influence public policy for adaption to climate change.

In a choice between an apple and a banana, both of which many people have eaten many times before, one can simply retrieve the values of these items?formed by averaging the enjoyment of eating each across past events?and choosing the higher-value option. However, many of the decisions people face are novel (e.g., a choice between dragon fruit and lychee, both exotic fruits the individual has never eaten before). For these novel decisions, there is no value associated with either option as there is no direct experience with them and instead one must infer their values to guide one?s choice. To make this value inference, one must rely on one?s memory. There are two main memory systems that could guide value inference during novel decisions. The first is a rigid memory system that learns slowly through repetition and relies on a brain structure called the striatum. The second is a flexible memory system that learns quicky?even after a single exposure?and relies critically on a brain structure called the hippocampus. The current project aims to uncover whether and how these two memory systems provide the building blocks for the construction of value during novel decisions. The outcomes from this research have the potential to advance the understanding of the role different memory systems play in decision-making and the functional role of memory.  The project also includes many community outreach activities and mentorship for trainees at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level.<br/><br/>To achieve the project goals, the research team plans to leverage a new theoretical framework which places different types of memory at the input of a decision process that guides choice in novel contexts. The research team intends to characterize the conditions under which one memory system or the other guides novel decisions using eyetracking. The team will also test the way in which these two memory systems contribute to choice using computational models, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and patient populations with specific brain damage to the hippocampus. Researchers also plan to test a manipulation that may bias the way value is constructed during novel choices as a potential avenue to enact behavioral change. Better understanding the role that different memory systems play during novel decisions has practical relevance to society at large. For example, findings from the project may inform educators to develop new approaches that target different value-forming mechanisms to optimize students? decision-making in different novel contexts. Furthermore, results from the proposed experiments can help mental health professionals identify new strategies to help nudge the choices people make to increase their well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This shift towards sustainability could spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed, leading to a more responsible and sustainable approach to advancing computing technologies. By redefining the way computer scientists consider environmental sustainability, Carbon Connect will establish new standards for carbon accounting in the computing industry, thereby influencing future energy policy and legislation. By fostering an interdisciplinary community of researchers dedicated to sustainable computing, Carbon Connect will train the next generation of innovators in the combined fields of computer science, electrical engineering, environmental science, and energy policy. By creating an academic-industry consortium, Carbon Connect will accelerate the adoption of sustainable computing practices. Finally, by organizing workshops and curricula, Carbon Connect will educate future leaders in computer science and engineering.<br/> <br/><br/>The Carbon Connect Expedition re-thinks computing?s infrastructure, from semiconductor chips to hyperscale datacenters. Embodied carbon arises from a hardware component?s entire lifecycle, including its manufacture, transportation, and eventual disposal. This aspect of the Expedition seeks to minimize the environmental impact of producing semiconductor chips, which are fundamental to all electronic devices but come with a high carbon cost. Operational carbon, on the other hand, arises from energy consumed during a hardware component?s operational life. Given rapidly increasing energy demands from global datacenters that power the Internet, cloud services, and the emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence, addressing operational emissions at datacenter scale is particularly important. The Carbon Connect Expedition seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of information and communication technology by pursuing three main objectives. First, the Expedition will create transparent and accurate carbon accounting methods, which will include standardized protocols for measuring and reporting carbon as well as techniques for overcoming inconsistent estimates and broad error margins. Second, it will develop innovative tools and strategies for reducing computing?s carbon footprint by 45% within the next decade. These innovations will include the exploration of energy-efficient hardware design, advanced hardware recycling and disposal strategies to minimize embodied carbon, and the intelligent use of renewable energy to reduce operational carbon from datacenters. Third, the Carbon Connect Expedition will coordinate the design and management of future computer systems to sustainability deliver performance for artificial intelligence and virtual reality systems. This coordination will allow computer scientists and engineers to balance embodied and operational carbon, which cannot often be reduced simultaneously and require intelligent compromises. Together, these technical objectives will ensure continued advances in computational performance and capability yet ensure environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Host body mass should shape immune defenses because it likely affects aspects of pathogen exposure, detection, and defense activation. Neutrophils are innate antimicrobial cells critical to the outcome of infections in mammals. Although elephants have disproportionately more neutrophils than mice given their relative body masses, it is unknown whether an elephant?s neutrophil provides the same defenses as a mouse?s during a bacterial challenge. How neutrophil antibacterial responses and associated gene expression and energetics are related to an animal?s body mass will be investigated in terrestrial mammals with body masses spanning a range from a few grams (such as a mouse) to several hundred kilograms (such as an elephant). Such a broad understanding of mammalian neutrophil functions can enhance disease-spread models by providing predictions about the level of immune defense expected in species never before studied. Participants will develop museum displays for a local museum of science and technology in Syracuse, NY, that collaborates in educational activities for every 8th-grader in the diverse Syracuse City school district, exposing students from groups underrepresented in STEM to science at a critical age. The team will also teach local middle-school students to use microscopes in scientific inquiry. These activities will demonstrate how comparative research is important for understanding human and animal physiology and health.<br/><br/>This research project tests specific hypotheses about how neutrophil antibacterial responses vary with body mass. Previous studies raise the question whether a disproportionately greater neutrophil concentration in large mammals conveys additional immune protection or compensates for less effective killing by a single neutrophil. Specifically, the team will assess how neutrophil antibacterial functions change with body mass in 20 species of terrestrial mammals spanning 7 orders of magnitude in size. The neutrophil activities to be characterized include direct killing, phagocytosis, metabolic changes and reactive oxygen species generation, and neutrophil extracellular traps and associated changes in gene expression. How the metabolic rates of neutrophil extracellular traps change with body mass in neutrophils from 11 species of primates spanning 5 orders of magnitude in size will also be measured. Immune defenses will be quantified against a strain of Escherichia coli, a ubiquitous, zoonotic pathogen that poses a serious threat to industrial agriculture and human and non-human animals, including wildlife, proximal to these production sites. The team?s work addresses two Grand Challenges in Organismal Biology ? how genomes become phenomes and how organisms maintain stability through change ? and will advance understanding how body size constrains the evolution of innate immune defense processes in vertebrates. Through an unprecedented comparative approach, the research promises to transform how scientists think about host-parasite interactions. The project will make available transcriptomic data and a database of images of neutrophil defenses that could be valuable for other systems biology and immune defense studies.

This unpredictability has resulted in an increase in the number, intensity, and migration to new locations of perils like tornados, devastating hail, extreme precipitation, and flooding. Costs to the insurance and reinsurance industry is many tens of billions of dollars, annually, with the number of storms and costs escalating each year. In response to the looming crisis of the insurance sector insolvency, planning activities have been initiated to create an IUCRC to improve our understanding and better prediction of damaging convective storms. The proposed Center is anchored at two Sites: the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Northern Illinois University. The Center will target the needs of the insurance and finance sector as well as other parts of the value chain to devise a compelling set of Center research thrusts and projects for a proposed, industry-supported IUCRC to be called The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Convective Storms (CIRCS). Planning activities will culminate in an in-person planning meeting attended by dozens of interested commercial entities with similar and/or overlapping needs. At the meeting the university faculty, committed to joining the Center, will provide a vision and mission for the Center, its value proposition, and examples of research projects the Center will undertake. If successful in attracting companies and other interested parties to join and pay a membership fee, all of which are pooled and used to fund high priority sector projects, a full Center proposal will be submitted to the National Science Foundation. If successful, the Center will focus on use-inspired, pre-competitive research to understand and provide tools and utilities to better understand and asses the risks of, and community/landscape/infrastructure vulnerability to, convective storm perils. Projects will involve advanced modeling and new observational capabilities designed to improve storm prediction. Broader impacts of the Center will include enhancing preparedness and response to convective storm-driven natural disasters to reduce their impact on loss of life and property, improving public safety and community resilience. It will also engage in public outreach and have strong student/workforce training elements in AI, machine learning, and big data analytics, improved early storm warnings, and the creation of more effective and accurate means of forecasting and assessing the risks of these dangerous storms and the damage they cause.<br/><br/>If realized, the IUCRC Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Convective Storms (CIRCS) will employ interdisciplinary faculty and sophisticated high performance computing analytical and modeling methods, machine learning, satellite information and AI to develop more accurate forecasts for convective storm predication. It will be populated by teams of faculty from two institutions (the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Northern Illinois University) with faculty that span the disciplines of meteorology, computer science, statistics, and engineering. It will develop improved and more efficient and effective models and algorithms to improve storm prediction as well as pioneer novel use of satellite remote sensing in addition to new methodologies for enable dynamical downscaling to the local scale for improving and extending to longer time scale estimates of storm arrival, damage, and economic loss. Results can be used by the insurance and actuarial sectors to improve convective storm risk assessment to make better decisions as well as influence public policy for adaption to climate change. Impacts of the work will be valuable to increasing stability and solvency of the insurance sector and provide valuable insights that can also be used in the agriculture and installed infrastructure sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These meetings will take place at the Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico in Mexico City in June 2024 and at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in August 2025. Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that studies symmetries of physical theories and mathematical objects. Often, the main objects in representation theory are only the shadows of richer structures that are recovered through deeper study. Noncommutative algebra is a related branch of mathematics that studies deformations of commutative objects found in quantum theories, representation theory, and geometry. The foci of the conferences will be on recent advances at the interface of representation theory, categorification, and noncommutative algebra; on fostering an environment for the establishment of international collaborations between Canada, Mexico, and the USA in these research areas; and on exposing graduate students, post-docs, and early-career faculty in the three countries to current developments in the field. A poster session will run through the full meeting where early-career attendees will present their research.<br/><br/>The main scientific topics for the sixth meeting in Mexico City will be geometric, algebraic, and homological methods in representation theory, representation theoretic and homological properties of noncommutative algebras, and the investigation of those problems using categorical methods. The talks will cover some of the most recent trends, including the following: cluster algebras, monoidal and additive categorifications, quantum symmetries, finite tensor categories, representations of quantized affine Kac-Moody algebras, Calabi-Yau algebras and triangulated categories, Hopfological algebra, web approaches to modular representation theory, and representation theoretic aspects of Heegaard-Floer homology.

While different structures are often studied on a case-by-case basis, this project aims to develop general mathematical tools to explain the interplay between randomness and the underlying structure. The focus of the project is on two distinct areas, random matrix theory and metric geometry, where recent advances provide powerful new tools to understand essentially arbitrarily structured models. Such technology makes it possible to study a range of problems that are outside the reach of traditional methods, with applications both in pure mathematics and in areas such as data science and computer science. Graduate and undergraduate student researchers will participate in the project, there will be outreach to schools including middle-school math festivals,  and substantial pedagogical materials will be developed and disseminated. <br/><br/>Concretely, the project has two main themes. The first theme aims to develop a broadly applicable toolbox to investigate arbitrarily structured random matrices. The guiding principle behind this toolbox is that the behavior of structured random matrices can be modelled by the behavior of deterministic operators whose spectra are explicitly computable, building on recent advances in this area. The second theme aims to develop probabilistic methods that are motivated by the study of embeddings of metric spaces in normed spaces. Both topics leverage connections between probability theory, operator theory, functional analysis, and metric geometry. While the two themes are independent and involve different mathematical ideas, what they have in common is that they aim to develop general principles and tools to study structured problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Immersed filaments play an essential role in biological phenomena such as sperm motility, blood perfusion, and so-called bacterial turbulence. Many important mathematical models have been developed over the past 70 years to describe fluid-filament interaction across multiple scales, but most of our understanding of these models has come from numerical simulation and formal asymptotics. Often, trying to justify or understand these models from the perspective of rigorous PDEs gives rise to fascinating new analysis questions and potentially new biophysical insights. The goal of this project is to address some of the fundamental PDE questions inspired by these models of immersed fibers. The broader impacts of this project include course development and research mentoring. The PI plans to develop a new graduate-level course covering aspects of both the computational methods and PDE analysis of the models appearing in this project. In addition, this project involves training opportunities for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will address PDE questions inspired by immersed filament models at two scales: (1) dynamics of a single filament, and (2) collective dynamics of many filaments. At scale (1), the PI aims to make mathematical sense of a curve evolution model that is popular in numerics yet remains difficult to justify analytically. To address this, the PI will develop the PDE theory for a novel type of free boundary problem coupling quasi-1D filament dynamics with a 3D fluid background. Analysis of this free boundary problem will provide a more complete mathematical foundation for the many computational results on immersed filament dynamics based on slender body theory. The analytical framework developed to study this problem can be applied more broadly to tackle questions for models of swimming and blood flow. At scale (2), the PI aims to develop a detailed understanding of the dynamics of a kinetic model of a suspension of motile filaments that is fundamental in the active matter community. A particular focus is on quantifying how motility affects mixing and transport in the suspension both near and far from equilibrium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, we?ve seen a dramatic rise in the role of data and learning in robotics. However, the vast majority of existing work focuses on vision and ignores the sense of touch. Touch provides robots with a wealth of knowledge from physical interactions and in many tasks it is crucial for success (e.g., reaching into a pocket or rummaging in through a grocery bag). Integrating touch with the rapid progress in vision will accelerate the deployment of skilled and reliable robots from research settings into the real-world. It will make fundamental contributions to transformative robotics technologies in practical applications, including manufacturing, healthcare, and home assistance ? all tasks in which robots will need to interact with the world in some way. In this project, the researchers focus on tool-use as an application (e.g., in the kitchen for assistive care) and intend to develop methods that enable the robot to sense the tool it is grasping and adeptly manipulate it to perform a variety of skills. As part of the project, the education plan will integrate this research into undergraduate and graduate education through course development, the writing of a textbook, and research mentorship. The outreach activities will include an open-source software initiative and K-12 educational programs for high school students. <br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to develop sensory-motor perception and control algorithms for dexterous object manipulation with visual and high-resolution tactile feedback. Central to this dexterity is the robot?s ability to reason over tactile signatures from sensors mounted at the mechanical interface between the robot and the grasped object (e.g., fingertips and palms). However, there are several fundamental challenges to overcome in high-resolution tactile sensing and touch-centric manipulation including how to interpret complex and high-dimensional tactile signals for state-estimation and how to leverage compliant sensor mechanics for contact-rich tasks. To address these challenges, this project will develop: i) a physics informed tactile representation that addresses ""Tactile Shadows"" -- an unstudied form of aliasing that affects contact patch estimation and can corrupt perception/state-estimation algorithms; ii) algorithmic tools for object pose and extrinsic contact estimation from active vision and touch that accounts for each modalities particular uncertainty; and iii) a control paradigm that exploits complex and compliant sensor mechanics for contact-rich and forceful tool-use. The union of these three aims intends to enable robust closed-loop object manipulation. These approaches will be evaluated in the context of three practical tasks for accuracy, robustness, sample-complexity, and task success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus of this research program is the study of knotted objects in dimension four and the connections that arise between the topology and geometry of the ambient four dimensional manifold and the knotted objects found within. This grant will allow the PI to carry out a robust program of undergraduate research, training, and mentoring; organize conferences, seminars, and an undergraduate math club; and implement student-centered teaching pedagogies. All of these activities help to create a new generation of researchers who will grapple with the challenging problem of understanding four-dimensional topology.<br/> <br/>The four-dimensional sphere is the simplest closed, four-dimensional manifold, yet it remains little understood in several important ways. First, it is unknown whether the four-sphere admits an exotic smooth structure, a question that has been settled in all other dimensions. Second, it is unknown whether a smoothly knotted two-sphere in the four-sphere with the same knot group as the unknotted two-sphere must itself be unknotted. Finally, it is unknown which four-manifolds arise as irregular three-fold covers of the four-sphere. This research program aims to make progress on these and important related problems through the study of knotted disks in homotopy four-balls; the diagrams of knotted surfaces in the four-sphere; and the topology, geometry, and symmetries of the four-manifolds obtained as branched covers over these surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much like supply chains in the context of open source software, the complexity of ML networks allows for rapid and effective development of new ML systems. But also like open source software, this supply chain creates risks: a malicious actor who can attack any step of the process may be able to impact the safety, quality, and privacy of ML models, and of the people and organizations who use them.  This project aims to create holistic systems to define and quantify trust in machine learning supply chains and develop tools to verify and audit specifications and requirements across those supply chains. The research will also support the development of a diverse next generation of computer scientists by incorporating outcomes in coursework and research opportunities.<br/><br/>The project is divided into three main tasks. The first task investigates different pillars of trustworthy machine learning (such as privacy, robustness, or fairness) as a whole. The main goal for this task is to empirically understand the interactions between different pillars and their trade-offs. The second task constructs system auditing mechanisms to verify the security of the machine learning supply chain as described by trustworthy machine learning requirements identified in the previous task. Finally, the third task creates a comprehensive and universal framework as the scaffolding for other researchers and developers to integrate, test, validate, and evaluate new mitigations into the framework. In particular, the tools developed in this task will allow for quantitative measures of the effect of new techniques on all pillars of trustworthy machine learning, and the system as a whole.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sustaining this growth while also reducing society?s carbon emissions will require us to undertake a rapid, large-scale transition to low- and zero-carbon energy sources. Enabling this change will necessitate a shift beyond our long-standing focus on improving energy-efficiency to optimizing carbon-efficiency. The goal of this Expedition is to develop new computational techniques to unify, transform, and accelerate societal decarbonization across multiple use domains. To this end, the Expedition will develop the new field of Computational Decarbonization (CoDec), which focuses on optimizing and reducing the lifecycle carbon emissions of complex computing and societal infrastructure systems. Specifically, the CoDec Expedition will address an important class of decarbonization problems that arise from interdependencies across multiple infrastructure domains, including computing, transportation, the built environment, and the electric power grid.  Over five years, the Expedition will develop novel computational techniques, algorithms, systems, and AI methods that sense, optimize, and reduce the operational, embodied, and lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of societal infrastructure over long temporal and spatial scales. This work will enable new scientific discoveries in addressing decarbonization challenges while ensuring the sustainable growth of our energy consumption that is necessary for advancing technology, growing our economy, and strengthening national security. To prepare our nation?s workforce in this emerging field, the Expedition will develop new educational programs and design new teaching curricula that elevates computational decarbonization to a core topic in computing. CoDec will establish an industry consortium to share its research results and transition them to practice. It will also undertake a range of activities to broaden participation in computing through undergraduate research and K-12 outreach. <br/><br/>Since the decarbonization of complex systems can be viewed as a sense-optimize-reduce problem that operates over long times scales of years or decades and over large geographical scales, it will require new types of optimization techniques and algorithms that are designed for these mesoscales.  To address the problem, CoDec will develop novel (i) sensing approaches to provide visibility into systems' operational and embodied carbon over their lifetime, (ii) optimization methods grounded in theory and AI to exploit new dimensions of energy flexibility, which are emerging in modern infrastructure, for optimizing carbon-efficiency, and (iii) software-defined interfaces and systems for programmatically deploying these optimizations to reduce carbon emissions.  These techniques will be verifiable, robust to uncertainties in energy's supply and demand, and transferable across multiple domains and economic sectors through intuitive interfaces, while also resolving human-in-the-loop concerns of privacy, fairness, equity, incentives, and user preference. In addressing these issues, CoDec will leverage the unique role computing can play in decarbonizing society both as a means to automate and coordinate carbon-efficiency optimizations across time, space, and sectors and as an essential activity that consumes increasingly significant amounts of energy but also has substantial temporal, spatial, and performance flexibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This significant improvement in heat transfer is attributed to the fluctuations in the liquid velocity caused by the bubble motion, leading to a phenomenon called bubble-induced pseudoturbulence. While there is substantial experimental evidence of this phenomenon, and physical models for pseudoturbulence have been developed for homogeneous flows without walls, there is a knowledge gap concerning pseudoturbulence in gas-liquid flows involving walls, as those encountered in many practical applications like chemical reactors, fermenters and heat exchangers. The main aim of this project is to gain an improved understanding of the physics of pseudoturbulence in gas-liquid flows in the presence of solid walls with a combination of detailed numerical simulations and experiments, and to formulate models usable by engineers to more accurately predict heat transfer in gas-liquid systems. The project will also contribute to the development of specialized workforce by training two graduate students, one in Aerospace Engineering and one in Mechanical Engineering, who will be fully supported for the three years of the project. Workshops to educate students about the importance of diversity and team science will be organized and offered to the engineering students at ISU.<br/><br/>A canonical natural convection problem of a gas-liquid flow between two walls, subject to a temperature gradient will be taken as reference to investigate pseudoturbulence in wall-bounded gas-liquid flows. Particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) of such a canonical problem will be performed using the  immersed boundary method, previously developed by one of the investigators. Results from the PR-DNS simulations will be used to formulate algebraic closures for the pseudoturbulent velocity fluctuations and heat flux that appear in the phase-averaged Euler-Euler equations to enable the application of the PR-DNS results when simulating devices of practical interest. Experiments will be performed in a bubble column subject to a temperature gradient in the wall-normal direction in the presence of buoyant particles or bubbles. The collected experimental data will then be leveraged to validate the PR-DNS predictions, and the closures for the Euler-Euler model. The insights gained from the project will be disseminated to the scientific and engineering community through publication in the scientific literature and participation in relevant conferences. The implementation of the model closures formulated during the project into a computational fluid dynamic code will be published in an openly accessible code repository with test cases and documentation to facilitate their use by the engineering community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These threats are rooted in discrimination, land dispossession, and colonization. The convergence and interaction of these stresses that affect health and well-being are primarily through the nexus with Indigenous food systems. Government policies often overlook and undermine Indigenous knowledge and practices, which underpin resilience across the nexus of food systems, health, and well-being. The Indigenous Peoples? Observatory Network (IPON) transforms and rethinks our understanding of this nexus from the bottom up. It builds on multiple ways of knowing, including Indigenous knowledge and science, to strengthen community resilience to multiple stresses and support actions that benefit Indigenous Peoples. The project promotes the progress of science through transdisciplinary approaches that investigate the links among food, climate, and health. <br/><br/>This project will establish Indigenous observatories that include community leaders, Elders, and youth, along with decision makers and researchers from Indigenous communities worldwide, covering the United Nation's seven social cultural regions. The observatories will document, monitor, and examine how climate stressors interact with food systems, health, and well-being across partner regions and communities as they play out in real-time and across seasons. This will be done by recording the lived experiences, stories, responses, and observations of the affected people. The teams will work together to create knowledge and capacity that can be used to develop policies and actions that build on community strengths and address potential vulnerabilities. The observatories strengthen the capacity of Indigenous communities to document their knowledge about the links between climate, food, and health, and provide a space for dialogue with decision makers at regional, national, and global levels to determine necessary actions to build resilience. IPON's global scope provides a foundation for developing scalable insights that inform decision making and advocacy for our partners in United Nations and Indigenous organizations.<br/><br/>This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as funding agencies from Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition. This Competition allowed a single joint international proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by Canada. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This funding will support attendees from academic institutions and nonprofit groups whose work touches accessibility and XR (collectively mixed, augmented, virtual, and extended reality, and 360 video).  This year's event, to be held at Cornell Tech's Verizon Executive Education Center in New York City on June 6-7, 2024  builds on work begun at the 2019 Symposium that brought together over 120 researchers, advocates, and industry leaders to discuss the state of XR accessibility and plan for a more accessible future, and is the sixth in the series.  The scope of the 2024 Symposium spans the content creation, software development, and hardware aspects of the XR industry, and it is a key aspect of the XR Access Initiative which aims to address the needs of users with speech, motor, vision, hearing and age-related impairments, with cognitive limitations, and with emotional and learning disabilities.  There are currently 27 million Americans with low vision, 41 million who are Deaf or hard of hearing, and 18 million with limited mobility.  For many of these people, using XR devices and consuming XR content is not possible.  The research, design, and advocacy needed to include these users in the 18-billion-dollar XR market is still nascent.  This Symposium will have broad impact by catalyzing new research into the specific mechanisms for improving XR accessibility.  It will also serve to connect scientists to advocates, educators, and business leaders to ensure that advances in the science of accessibility are implemented with input from people with disabilities and are viable at scale.  Persons with disabilities from academia and nonprofits will be encouraged to attend, because no conversation about increasing accessibility in technology can go forward in a meaningful manner without including disability advocates and users with disabilities at the table from the beginning.<br/><br/>XR technologies are on the cusp of becoming mainstream. They will soon reshape the way we work, learn and play.  However, today XR technologies are not accessible to the millions of people with disabilities around the world.  By their nature, they introduce a completely new set of challenges for people whose abilities are not typically considered in the technology design process.  The Symposium will stimulate discussion and collaborative research to address questions such as: How can people with different perceptual abilities experience XR applications? How should XR hardware be designed to consider the needs of people with different abilities? What accessibility features can enhance immersion, enjoyment, and learning through XR for all users? The Symposium will also address deeper questions about the nature and future of accessibility for emerging technologies more broadly.  Unlike prior work that develops assistive technology in XR to support people with disabilities, the Symposium aims to foster research that makes XR technologies themselves accessible.  To ensure the impact of the research begun at the Symposium, the event's agenda will include meetings of cross-industry working groups, each focusing on increasing the XR Access Initiative's impact in a specific area. The Guidelines and Practices group will synthesize existing accessibility policies and practices in the XR space, and create new ones that are applicable to other emerging technologies.  Similarly, the Outreach group will focus on creating strategies for bringing awareness of the need for XR accessibility to key corporate stakeholders and to the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their host-virus interactions can alter community structure, preserve genetic diversity, and impact nutrient cycling. Up to a third of the bacteria that dominate marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are infected with phages, yet the consequences of the host-virus interactions are unknown. Environmental DNA sequence data suggest that a dominant lineage of OMZ bacteria (SUP05) is comprised of species and subspecies that carry out different steps in marine nitrogen cycling and that these cells are often infected by viruses. The nitrogen cycling capacity of diverse SUP05 cells can drive the accumulation of nitrogen cycle intermediates in the oceans or lead directly to significant nitrogen loss. The outcome may be driven in part by phages, by causing cell death, metabolic rewiring of infected cells (virocells), or through the expression of phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). This project is testing the overarching hypothesis that SUP05 populations are comprised of diverse nitrogen respiring cell types and that their interactions with phages can determine the fate of fixed nitrogen. The investigators are studying SUP05 cells and viruses from OMZs to detail their combined effects on nitrogen cycling and loss processes in OMZs. The project is providing graduate and undergraduate students with hands-on collaborative field and laboratory research experiences, with a focus on broadening participation in oceanography. Through local science festivals, open houses, and interactive classroom lessons, K-12 students are learning about OMZs, nitrogen cycling, and viral infection. Results are being presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and all sequence and biogeochemical data, as well as new cultures of SUP05 and phage isolates are being made available to the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>Up to 25% of the fixed nitrogen in the ocean is lost as gaseous products through denitrification and other microbial processes in OMZs. These regions are also hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission to the atmosphere. While sulfur oxidizing chemoautotrophs from the SUP05 clade of marine bacteria and their viruses are abundant in marine OMZs, the roles of host-virus interactions in biogeochemical processes are largely unknown. This interdisciplinary study is evaluating SUP05 cells and phages in stable OMZ fjord systems using a combination of in situ measurements, DNA and RNA sequencing, and laboratory experiments to link the metabolic activities of SUP05 with the underlying nitrogen transformations they mediate in the ocean. The collective expertise of team members using field approaches to study microbial and viral diversity in nature, cultivation studies to test genomic predictions under controlled laboratory conditions, and isotope analyses to identify the rates and mechanisms underlying microbial nitrogen cycling and loss are being combined to provide new information about the conditions and activities that regulate SUP05 nitrogen cycling and loss in marine OMZs. Ultimately, this multi-faceted approach is filling critical gaps in our understanding of SUP05 cells and phages and how they collectively influence the marine nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rural schools in southwestern New York State are typically under-resourced and understaffed; most serve low-income student populations, and many underperform in assessments of student learning. Further, recruiting and retaining STEM teachers is a persistent challenge in rural schools. Federal funding will enable the university to build upon its strong record of preparing graduates for secondary STEM teaching by focusing on high-need schools. Selected high-achieving STEM students will receive scholarships, co-curricular support, and mentorship from current teachers in rural high-need K-12 schools. The project aims to produce 18 new STEM teachers who will teach in high-need schools over the five-year grant period.<br/><br/>This project at St. Bonaventure University (SBU) includes partnerships with a local community college and five educational agencies.  The project goal is to provide rural school districts in the southwestern region of New York with diverse, highly qualified STEM teachers by recruiting more STEM majors to careers in secondary STEM education and to reduce attrition by maximizing the career satisfaction and effectiveness of these new STEM teachers. SBU proposes the following objectives over the five-year grant period to achieve this goal: (1) Recruit and select 18 community college and SBU students majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and computer science who are interested in secondary education; (2) Retain at least 90% of selected scholars through completion of the STEM degree and secondary teaching certification; (3) Prepare scholars to teach in high-need schools through curricular and co-curricular activities that emphasize place-based learning, cultural competency and hands-on research experience; and (4) Place 100% of project graduates in high-need schools and track and support their persistence for at least four years of teaching through structured mentorship programs. Intellectual merit will include generating  knowledge related to the impacts of curricular innovations and co-curricular activities. An independent evaluator will assess the following evaluation questions: (1) To what extent have the project's aims and intended outcomes been accomplished?; (2) What project elements most impact scholar retention as a new teacher in a high-need school?; and (3) What was the impact of the project in placing and retaining graduates in high-need schools? Findings from these assessments will be disseminated through academic and professional networks, including a project website, professional conferences, and publications. Broader impacts include having new STEM expertise in rural schools and the ability to prepare students with high potential from diverse backgrounds to pursue STEM teaching in rural New York. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

This Designing and Testing Innovations project addresses the need for diverse approaches to render computing accessible and developmentally appropriate for young children, while actively integrating their linguistic, cultural, and communal identities. Targeting young, rural, and indigenous students, this initiative aims to develop and research the effectiveness of portable maker carts equipped with developmentally appropriate computational activities. These carts are designed to foster computational thinking skills and cultivate interest in STEM among participants. The design of the carts combines hands-on making activities commonly found in early childhood classrooms with tangible computing tasks, ensuring cultural relevance and developmental appropriateness (for instance, incorporating e-textiles and squishy circuits for weaving patterns, interactive play, and storytelling). Students will engage in projects to create their own interactive, culturally linked weaving patterns using conductive playdough, electronic textiles materials, LED lights, and micro-controllers. Simultaneously, they will be introduced to the types of jobs that require computing knowledge. Through this approach, young children will learn about cause and effect, patterns, and sequencing in a manner that is connected to culturally significant practices, such as Navajo rug weaving, while also being exposed to computing and engineering professions. The project will be collaboratively undertaken by the Red Mesa Unified School District on the Navajo Nation in Arizona's Four Corners area, along with learning scientists from Utah State University and Boston College. <br/><br/>The proposed maker carts, coupled with associated computing curriculum and teacher professional development, will serve as a model for designing tangible, developmentally and culturally appropriate computing experiences for young children. Project research will use quantitative and qualitative approaches rooted in community-based and design-based research paradigms. The research will investigate: (1) how to foster school and community partnerships with university researchers, early childhood educators, children, and parents that support co-design of education programs and (2) how culturally responsive making practices using innovative technologies can foster computational thinking and career concepts among young Navajo and rural participants using Maker carts with computer science activities. In its research phase, the project will reach 9 early childhood educators and 100 Navajo children in the rural Red Mesa Unified School District.

The first part of this project concerns changes in salinity or chlorofluorocarbon on the surface of the ocean. Oceanic vortices may dramatically change mixing rates of various chemical compounds. The aim of this project is to estimate these rates using simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full system. The second goal of this project is related to speeding up Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms.

Better understanding how to exploit flowing fluids and flow-structure interactions is necessary in applications that extract energy from clean and sustainable sources such as wind, water currents, and waves. Improvements and optimizations to these systems require deeper knowledge of the physics of fluids, better models of their effects on structures, and more accurate simulations that solve for flow-induced forces and motions. Applied and computational mathematics combined with mathematical modeling can provide the necessary tools to accomplish these goals and to uncover knowledge that will be generally useful for hydromechanical applications. This project will significantly advance the relevant methods and understanding by focusing on an unsolved problem in the physics of fluids. The investigations will also educate students and train researchers, thereby contributing to a workforce that is well prepared to tackle these and related problems.<br/><br/>This project combines experiments, simulations, mathematical modeling, and analysis to investigate the coupled dynamics of fluid-solid systems with mass and momentum flux. The work will be conducted in the context of auto-rotating devices that respond to the injection or withdrawal of fluid, notably the Feynman sprinkler problem and related applications. The efforts will aim to develop appropriate methods for determining how forces and motions can be generated and controlled for open structures whose complex geometries interact with the flows produced by sources and sinks. The research will progress from targeted investigations of the sprinkler problem to more general inquiries into flux-based forces and the roles played by geometry and the driving strength. Experiments will involve the development and application of laboratory systems capable of sensitively resolving motions, forces, and flow fields. Simulations based on the immersed boundary method will address fluid-structure-interactions driven by source/sink flows. Mathematical analyses based on control volume methods and hydrodynamic modeling will be used to interpret the findings and identify mechanisms. By interactively combining all methods to address a long-standing open problem in flow physics, this work will provide fundamental knowledge and generalizable techniques for motion control and force generation, and which may inform engineering applications.

The STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS) project is a partnership between the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, University of California Berkeley, Morgan State University and the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) aimed at addressing three priorities: (1) increasing the number of students pursuing degrees and careers in geosciences; (2) preparing students for many career trajectories in the geosciences and beyond; and, (3) contributing to the evidence base for effective student engagement, learning and retention in STEM. The STEMSEAS project will achieve these goals by taking advantage of unused berthing capacity available on UNOLS and other oceanographic research vessels as they transit between ports in preparation for their next scientific expedition. These short (~6-10 day) transits offer a unique mobile classroom setting where undergraduate students can be exposed to geoscience professional practice and career exploration. While at sea, students engage in a variety of hands-on activities that incorporate science content, lab exercises, data collection/analysis, and career exploration. The project will organize four expeditions per year for students selected from across the US and for faculty at US two-year colleges (2YC) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).<br/><br/>STEMSEAS has demonstrated that it is a robust mechanism for geoscience discovery and STEM ecosystem development. This project aims to expand this progress while improving its reach and effectiveness through a combination of an expereinced leadership team, integrated professional development for HBCU and 2YC faculty, research in transformative learning, and leadership opportunities for student alumni. STEMSEAS will add to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of immersive at-sea experiences to students? inspiration and retention in the geosciences, their comfort level with geoscience knowledge, and their familiarity with geoscience career pathways. It will also contribute to the body of knowledge about the components of real transformative learning experiences. The project assists the academic fleet in its mission to cultivate the next generation of geoscience researchers and workforce. By taking students on mentored transits aboard these state-of-the-art vessels, the project stands to have profound impact on individual students. By establishing the partnerships and process by which students have access to ship time, this project sets the stage for increasing numbers of students and universities over time. Moreover, by carefully designing programming that includes post-transit reflection and in-class reporting, the project is poised to transform the way STEMSEAS students conceptualize their futures ? i.e., what is possible for them. In addition, STEMSEAS has established several channels for broader impacts in the science research and 2YC community through inviting ?pocket? science projects at targets of opportunity along ship tracks and increasing research capacity at smaller institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology enables dynamic re-shaping of membrane reflectors for satellite applications on-orbit. This capability has the potential to expand flexibility in commercial satellite communications from geostationary orbit to cover different geographic areas, by allowing repurposing of existing satellites. The ability to reshape the reflector on-orbit allows for large reflectors with unprecedented surface precision to be used for innovative atmospheric radar instruments and improved weather monitoring from space. This technology could enable longer-range and more precise forecasting of tropical cyclones, helping protect coastal communities from storms.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of electrostatic actuation of membrane reflectors for satellite applications. The research builds on a concept originally proposed in the 1980s for membrane reflectors, where a command surface of electrodes parallel to the controlled reflector surface is used to apply a bias voltage across the gap. The coulomb force is used to pull the flexible membrane into a dished reflector shape, and the voltage applied to each electrode can be controlled to change the focal length or steer and shape the reflector beam. Current versions of membrane reflectors for satellite applications are largely passive, and thus limited in flexibility. However, electrostatic actuation allows active beam steering and focal length shifting as well as surface control. This innovation enables electrostatic actuation integration into existing designs to expand the capabilities of membrane reflectors for satellites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The general linear groups encapsulate the symmetries of linear spaces. Group cohomology encodes important information about these symmetries and the linear spaces themselves using a conceptual version of ""counting holes"". There are deep mathematical connections to many areas of mathematics and physics, including number theory, geometry, K-theory, and quantum field theory. The research will reveal patterns emerging in the cohomology of linear groups. The grant will also support conferences organized by the PI that bring together researchers of various backgrounds as well as outreach programs in Oklahoma exposing students to engaging mathematics.<br/><br/>The group cohomology of linear groups has multiple parameters: The cohomological dimension, the size of the matrices, the precise group and ring. Different patterns emerge when varying one or multiple of theses parameters. For example, cohomological stability for the general linear groups means that for fixed cohomological dimension, the cohomology groups stay the same for large sizes of matrices. Principal congruence subgroups defined by a congruence condition on the matrices satisfy a more complicated pattern called representation stability. For fixed cohomological codimension, Church-Farb-Putman conjecture that the cohomology groups of the special linear groups of the integers vanish for large matrix sizes. For congruence subgroups in fixed cohomological codimension, one can ask about stability patterns akin to representation stability. The PI proposes to study a variety of those patterns with specific applications in mind: The Conrey?Farmer?Keating?Rubinstein?Snaith Conjecture on the asymptotics of moments of quadratic L-functions for function fields follows from uniform twisted homological stability for braid groups, which in turn are closely related to homological stability for certain congruence subgroups of odd-dimensional symplectic groups. Part of the Kummer-Vandiver Conjecture is to proof that twelfth K-group of the integers is zero. This would follow from Church-Farb-Putman Conjecture for all codimensions up to 4.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Topology and Geometric Analysis program (TGA) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems are comprised of multiple components that are all subject to adversarial interference. The scale of these systems and limited defensive resources simply do not allow for complete security coverage at all times. Moreover, adequate security is increasingly reliant on a defender?s informational capabilities. Knowledge about an adversary?s abilities, objectives, and actions are essential pieces of information that can be used to mitigate the harm from potential attacks. This project investigates how the security of these systems can be maximized through the strategic management and control of informational advantages. Key questions to be addressed in this project are: What type of information is most valuable given costs for acquisition? How much more secure does the system become with critical pieces of information? Can obfuscating the system?s capabilities from an adversary render their attacks less effective? The research will develop a theoretical framework on which to address these questions and to inform effective and information-aware security policies that may be applied across domains. In particular, the project is well-positioned to interface with the highly active cybersecurity community in the Colorado Springs area. The research will also be leveraged to enhance curriculum and research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project seeks to analyze strategic decision-making in adversarial environments, with an emphasis on the role that informational capabilities play. These scenarios are most readily studied using tools from game theory and optimization. The research will leverage and adapt popular models of competitive resource allocation, known as ?Colonel Blotto? and ?General Lotto? games. The central goal of the project is to incorporate various elements of asymmetric information, and to investigate their impacts on the players? optimal allocation strategies. This enables a principled approach to study the interplay between information and performance, as well as to guide the design of effective information-gathering and manipulation policies. The findings from this project will advance fundamental knowledge along two directions. First, they will provide new analyses regarding the strategic control of information in adversarial settings. Standard game-theoretic analyses primarily consider the informational environment to be static, i.e., unable to be altered through the efforts of the agents that it affects. Second, the project will develop principled approaches for system planners to implement security policies in a variety of environmental and adverse conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This material and its cousins, called the ?III-Vs,? are made of inexpensive elements, but they are very difficult and expensive to produce by current technologies. However, if III-Vs could be turned into quantum dots (particles around one ten-millionth of an inch across that were at the core of the  2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), then they could be produced on a large scale. Early attempts at this failed because ordinary solvents are not compatible with the high temperatures required. The Talapin research group will be using molten salts, including sodium chloride (table salt) as solvents to grow III-V quantum dots either from scratch or by converting more readily accessible quantum dots into GaAs and other more challenging III-V-type nanostructures. This program will  train scientists in state-of-the-art techniques in both chemistry and physics and also support outreach to Chicago?s South Side to enrich public understanding of the materials that illuminate our surroundings.<br/><br/>Semiconductors of the III-V variety are more engineerable than other compound semiconductors and have generally superior optical and electronic characteristics. The research program seeks to expand the fundamental boundaries for solution synthesis of nanoscale III-V semiconductors by investigating key aspects of the chemistry and physics of colloidal synthesis in molten inorganic salts, from examining the stability of nanoscale III V phases in molten salts with different Lewis acidity and redox potentials, to developing new syntheses of binary, ternary and quaternary III-V nanocrystals. State-of-the-art spectroscopic, electrochemical, and X-ray scattering techniques will be implemented for mechanistic studies of III-V nanocrystal synthesis in high-temperature molten salts. These studies have the potential to advance the development of new functional materials, to help uncover their electronic and optical properties, and to potentially open up important new avenues for the synthesis  of III-V semiconductors by solution methods. The ultimate goal is to control the morphology, defects, doping, surface and other characteristics of colloidal III-V nanostructures on a  level comparable to III-V nanostructures grown by high-temperature physical epitaxial deposition methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To collect narratives of neurodivergent physics students, the researchers will conduct semi-structured interviews with undergraduate neurodivergent physics students and translate findings into narratives. To develop a theory of neurodivergent physics performance, the researchers will also  engage neurodivergent students in think-aloud interviews, in which they will be asked to solve introductory, undergraduate physics problems and share their thought processes. The researchers aim to code interviews, leverage multiple relevant conceptual frameworks, and use grounded theory method to generate new theory about how neurodivergent students navigate undergraduate physics. Results from this study, will be disseminated through developed workshops and seminars to support educators and physics departments in understanding and serving neurodivergent learners.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Superatomic solids use atomically precise nanoclusters as building blocks. These materials exhibit widely tunable properties and are promising for optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications. However, the complex chemical compositions of these materials have posed a challenge for understanding the fundamental intra- and inter-molecular interactions within them. To address this challenge, the Liu group uses ultrashort extreme ultraviolet light pulses to observe the real-time electronic and atomic motions in superatomic materials. This technique allows detection of electronic and structural dynamics occurring at individual elements within the superatomic materials and can reveal how macroscopic properties arise from the microscopic molecular interactions. Their discoveries could give insight into the design principles for superatomic solids to be deployed for optoelectronic, catalytic, and thermoelectric applications. This project combines physical chemistry, materials science, and laser technology, offering diverse training opportunities for students participating in this research. Beyond in-lab training, the Liu group is designing lab demonstrations for K-12 communities and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The properties of superatomic crystals can be widely tuned by varying the geometry and chemical composition of the nanoclusters. To understand the chemical origins of macroscopic properties, the Liu group at Purdue University uses ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy to study the coupled electronic and structural dynamics in superatomic crystals. Ultrafast XUV spectroscopy offers elemental specificity and femtosecond resolution, allowing the decomposition of complex dynamics into the electronic and structural responses occurring at different elements. Through measurements of a series of metal chalcogenide clusters and their assembled superatomic solids with different geometry and chemical compositions, Hanzhe Liu and his group aim to understand the interplay between localized molecular dynamics and long-range collective responses, and how they are responsible for macroscopic material properties. These studies aim to help establish structure-function correlations in superatomic crystals and provide insights into  chemical design principles that might be used to develop superatomic materials for optoelectronic applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research on climate migration has traditionally focused on the factors that attract or force individuals to relocate such as better opportunities for education and jobs and the impact of violence and poverty. One particularly understudied aspect of climate-driven migration is how the influx of people might affect communities in receiving cities already at-risk due to climate change impacts. The Climate Adaptation and Resilience Strategies (CLARS) project aims to address this through a community engagement, urban models and decision support tools that involves stakeholders from diverse sectors in the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) in Africa and the Great Lakes Region (GLR) in North America. CLARS will test and refine adaptive strategies that build resilience among both migrants and host communities in urban settings across these areas.<br/><br/>The project?s approach to tackle these challenges is using advanced tools like the Participatory Public Geographical Information System (PPGIS) to encourage a wide range of community members to: 1) express their preferences about, for example, where to promote new housing developments and where to place green infrastructure given the potential of more severe flooding in the future, and 2) how to communicate these preferences to city officials. This effort not only aims to reflect the real needs and aspirations of the communities involved but also to facilitate dialogue amongst local stakeholders to better understand the impacts of migration on their environments and economies. By comparing across several cities in the GLR and the LVB, the project will offer insights into how these tools can be scaled and adapted elsewhere, potentially transforming how cities worldwide approach the complexities of climate-driven migration and fostering more resilient and inclusive communities. This initiative will also facilitate the communication among cities of best practices to prepare, respond and adapt to climate migrants. This recognizes that the experiences of cities in the LVB are incredibly valuable for those in the GLR, which may soon face similar challenges due to climate migration. Simultaneously, this project will facilitate the sharing of strategies and insights from the Great Lakes cities, which have valuable experience in planning for and anticipating the complexities of these migration challenges.<br/><br/>This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and funding agencies from Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition. This Competition allowed a single joint international proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by Canada.

This research project will develop and make use of technological advances to give an unprecedented view of the hierarchy of these molecular motions. The success of this project will impact basic research, enhance protein engineering efforts, and provide insight that will lead to better therapeutics. Moreover, this project will involve training of graduate students in state-of-the-art biophysical techniques that will enable them to pursue independent scientific careers. In addition, this project will contribute to reinforce the synergies between the French and American scientific communities in biological magnetic resonance and computational biophysics, andparticularly, the investigation of protein dynamics and its role in protein function.  <br/><br/>Allostery is a fundamental method by which enzymatic activity is regulated. Allostery links effector binding sites and enzyme active sites via a matrix of flexible residues in the protein structure. A better understanding of the timescale of motions than enable this linkage will have significant impact on fundamental protein biophysics. This project focuses on obtaining a better understanding of allostery in the enzyme imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) using field cycling nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to better understand the timescale range of molecular motions that occur as part of the allosteric activation of IGPS. Field cycling makes use of a rapid shuttling device mounted to a standard high field NMR instrument. The key advantage of this technique is that the high-resolution and signal-to-noise garnered from standard high field NMR is maintained but NMR spin-relaxation, which reports on molecular motions, is allowed to occur over a large range of magnetic fields due to the shuttling of the enzyme sample outside the main field of the superconducting magnet. The field shuttling device allows access to over two orders of magnitude variation in magnetic field thus allowing this technique to probe molecular motions over a similarly large timescale. This proposal will couple these experimental measurements with computational techniques to not only describe the timescale of motions but importantly, the mechanism of motions as well. This approach will compare effects in IGPS between its unactivated state and its allosterically enhanced state to provide unprecedented insight into the role of motions in this physiologically critical process.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/France project is jointly supported by the (name of MCB cluster) program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics at the US National Science Foundation and the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, where NSF funds the US investigator and ANR funds the partners in France.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its mission is to reimagine natural disaster/catastrophe insurance and develop it as a tool to protect vulnerable populations and ensure solvency of the insurance/re-insurance sector. Center outcomes will incentivize community disaster mitigation and promote climate change adaptation. It will shape the way engineers, scientists, land use managers, and governments model post-disaster recovery. Catastrophe models are an essential tool used by the insurance and finance sectors to assess risk and financial exposure. They are used to tune policies and portfolios in order for companies to remain solvent in the face of extreme events and the costs incurred. This Center will provide research and ideas that allow the insurance sector to continue providing policies and supporting the recovery of disaster affected communities and regions. University-faculty-driven ideas and research projects that address the insurance sector's collective needs are the focus of any IUCRC. The proposed Center will also include in its consideration critical elements that affect rate payers like social and environmental equity, community resilience, and planning and investment across multiple temporal scales. A Center, such as that proposed will deliver climate risk mitigation and possible means of community adaptation. Broader impacts of the Center include development of sustainable solutions to climate change that are paired with novel modeling techniques, insurance products, and technical approaches. It will also be an engine for catastrophe model workforce development as well as a much needed research engine from which insurance companies and their decision on policies and portfolios can be used to stimulate, incentivize, and help better determine risk and financial implications of natural disasters. The Center will formalize the catastrophe modeling field into a distinct academic discipline and create and provide its first formal, coherent educational program and curriculum. This addresses a serious industry need in terms of development of a skilled catastrophe modeling workforce.<br/><br/>Catastrophe modeling exists as a key discipline in the insurance and finance industries. It focuses on rare events and combines physics-based models with the limited data available for some natural disasters. The approach can be applied beyond natural disaster crises, however, to those in the financial sector, to political unrest, and to pandemics. The proposed Center for Climate, Equity, and Resilience in CatModeling (CERCat) will pursue a convergent educational and research agenda that generates new knowledge so the insurance and finance sectors of the economy can use Center project results to overcome hurdles in the sector's inability to adequately asses risk and the economic implications of climate-driven disasters brought on by rapidly changing and unexpected weather patterns. The Center will adopt a probabilistic approach to study natural disasters, with the purpose of computing expected losses, risk, and premiums. Faculty from a variety of disciplines at the two universities forming the Center (Rice University and Lehigh University) have coalesced with the purpose of addressing the impacts of climate and weather uncertainty on insurance and re-insurance companies and these sectors' abilities to provide a stable economic environment in which risk is sufficiently distributed and disaster outcomes can be reasonably well predicted to provide essential financial coverage for those needing to insure against catastrophic loss. Center research thrusts include examining feedback loops among the various models being used and using multidisciplinary investigations to tackle challenges of high impact and importance to the insurance/risk assessment sectors so they can create new and improved products and services. Center faculty and research draw expertise and insights from engineering, social science, data science, climate science, and economics. The Center's goal is to create and translate new concepts, tools, utilities, and algorithms from academia to private sector enterprises and government.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Host body mass should shape immune defenses because it likely affects aspects of pathogen exposure, detection, and defense activation. Neutrophils are innate antimicrobial cells critical to the outcome of infections in mammals. Although elephants have disproportionately more neutrophils than mice given their relative body masses, it is unknown whether an elephant?s neutrophil provides the same defenses as a mouse?s during a bacterial challenge. How neutrophil antibacterial responses and associated gene expression and energetics are related to an animal?s body mass will be investigated in terrestrial mammals with body masses spanning a range from a few grams (such as a mouse) to several hundred kilograms (such as an elephant). Such a broad understanding of mammalian neutrophil functions can enhance disease-spread models by providing predictions about the level of immune defense expected in species never before studied. Participants will develop museum displays for a local museum of science and technology in Syracuse, NY, that collaborates in educational activities for every 8th-grader in the diverse Syracuse City school district, exposing students from groups underrepresented in STEM to science at a critical age. The team will also teach local middle-school students to use microscopes in scientific inquiry. These activities will demonstrate how comparative research is important for understanding human and animal physiology and health.<br/><br/>This research project tests specific hypotheses about how neutrophil antibacterial responses vary with body mass. Previous studies raise the question whether a disproportionately greater neutrophil concentration in large mammals conveys additional immune protection or compensates for less effective killing by a single neutrophil. Specifically, the team will assess how neutrophil antibacterial functions change with body mass in 20 species of terrestrial mammals spanning 7 orders of magnitude in size. The neutrophil activities to be characterized include direct killing, phagocytosis, metabolic changes and reactive oxygen species generation, and neutrophil extracellular traps and associated changes in gene expression. How the metabolic rates of neutrophil extracellular traps change with body mass in neutrophils from 11 species of primates spanning 5 orders of magnitude in size will also be measured. Immune defenses will be quantified against a strain of Escherichia coli, a ubiquitous, zoonotic pathogen that poses a serious threat to industrial agriculture and human and non-human animals, including wildlife, proximal to these production sites. The team?s work addresses two Grand Challenges in Organismal Biology ? how genomes become phenomes and how organisms maintain stability through change ? and will advance understanding how body size constrains the evolution of innate immune defense processes in vertebrates. Through an unprecedented comparative approach, the research promises to transform how scientists think about host-parasite interactions. The project will make available transcriptomic data and a database of images of neutrophil defenses that could be valuable for other systems biology and immune defense studies. In addition, training of postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate and graduate students across the three collaborating institutions will contribute to workforce development.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the BIO-IOS-Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program and the Symbiosis, Infection, and Immunity Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A charged particle-probe set up will be developed and characterized for the National Science Foundation ZEUS laser user facility to make measurements of the dynamic magnetic fields.

High-intensity laser pulses interacting with low density targets can create a plasma channel, and accelerate forward directed electron beams that self-generate large azimuthal magnetic fields within the channel. These magnetic fields are understood to be crucial for direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons, for the generation of bright, directional x-rays and gamma beams, and for the promising ion acceleration mechanism of magnetic vortex acceleration. Measuring the electric or magnetic fields inside a plasma is challenging, particularly when the fields are dynamic and rapidly evolving. However, significant advances have been made in both charged particle probing techniques and the unfolding algorithms, so it is now possible to measure extremely transient fields with femtosecond temporal and micrometer spatial resolutions.

Emerging applications ? such as capable artificial intelligence, immersive virtual realities, and pervasive sensor systems ? drive unprecedented demand for computer systems that offer scalable performance and environmental sustainability. Despite recent advances to achieve net zero carbon emissions, the computing industry?s gross energy usage continues to rise at an alarming rate, outpacing the growth of new energy installations and renewable energy deployments. The Carbon Connect Expedition is a multi-institutional, five-year research initiative that builds the foundations for sustainable computing. This shift towards sustainability could spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed, leading to a more responsible and sustainable approach to advancing computing technologies. By redefining the way computer scientists consider environmental sustainability, Carbon Connect will establish new standards for carbon accounting in the computing industry, thereby influencing future energy policy and legislation. By fostering an interdisciplinary community of researchers dedicated to sustainable computing, Carbon Connect will train the next generation of innovators in the combined fields of computer science, electrical engineering, environmental science, and energy policy. By creating an academic-industry consortium, Carbon Connect will accelerate the adoption of sustainable computing practices. Finally, by organizing workshops and curricula, Carbon Connect will educate future leaders in computer science and engineering.<br/> <br/><br/>The Carbon Connect Expedition re-thinks computing?s infrastructure, from semiconductor chips to hyperscale datacenters. Embodied carbon arises from a hardware component?s entire lifecycle, including its manufacture, transportation, and eventual disposal. This aspect of the Expedition seeks to minimize the environmental impact of producing semiconductor chips, which are fundamental to all electronic devices but come with a high carbon cost. Operational carbon, on the other hand, arises from energy consumed during a hardware component?s operational life. Given rapidly increasing energy demands from global datacenters that power the Internet, cloud services, and the emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence, addressing operational emissions at datacenter scale is particularly important. The Carbon Connect Expedition seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of information and communication technology by pursuing three main objectives. First, the Expedition will create transparent and accurate carbon accounting methods, which will include standardized protocols for measuring and reporting carbon as well as techniques for overcoming inconsistent estimates and broad error margins. Second, it will develop innovative tools and strategies for reducing computing?s carbon footprint by 45% within the next decade. These innovations will include the exploration of energy-efficient hardware design, advanced hardware recycling and disposal strategies to minimize embodied carbon, and the intelligent use of renewable energy to reduce operational carbon from datacenters. Third, the Carbon Connect Expedition will coordinate the design and management of future computer systems to sustainability deliver performance for artificial intelligence and virtual reality systems. This coordination will allow computer scientists and engineers to balance embodied and operational carbon, which cannot often be reduced simultaneously and require intelligent compromises. Together, these technical objectives will ensure continued advances in computational performance and capability yet ensure environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project would augment the landscape of knowledge, by developing new computable quasi-isometry invariants such as hypergraph index, and  by studying these phenomena in two very different subclasses: graphs of pseudomanifold (PM) type Coxeter groups at the hyperbolic end of the spectrum, and thick Coxeter groups on the higher rank side. Graphical discreteness, a form of rigidity of great current interest will also be studied for PM type Coxeter groups.   While the geometry of hyperbolic groups is extremely well-understood, their subgroups remain rather mysterious.

While all forms of mercury are toxic, monomethyl mercury (MMHg) is especially problematic because it becomes highly concentrated in fish consumed by humans. Given the health implications for people it is critically important to understand MMHg cycling in the ocean, but the fundamental processes that govern MMHg entrainment from seawater to the base of the food web are not yet sufficiently understood. This project will study MMHg in natural phytoplankton and test hypotheses about the mechanisms and controls on MMHg uptake. The study will occur on the shelf of the Western North Atlantic Ocean and in its estuaries, a region of productive fisheries. Seasonal and geographical changes in biological productivity and plankton community structure will serve as a ?natural laboratory? for testing hypotheses on the factors that control MMHg uptake. The project will provide training and research opportunities through paid internships and summer programs for undergraduate students. Two graduate students, one at the University of Connecticut and one at the University of Rhode Island, will be trained. The team will conduct outreach activities in collaboration with the Yale Peabody Museum to share marine MMHg science with a variety of museum audiences. <br/><br/>Researchers from the University of Connecticut, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Rhode Island, and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will collaborate on this study with the overarching goal of studying MMHg in natural phytoplankton and testing current assertions that cell size and dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] act as major controls over MMHg uptake in phytoplankton and investigate other mechanisms. Additional hypotheses that will be tested include: 1) phytoplankton that employ heterotrophy take up more MMHg, and 2) faster plankton growth lowers cellular MMHg. Novel data such as cellular quota, biomass-based concentrations, and volume concentration factors for MMHg in pico, nano, and microplankton will be obtained through MMHg analysis of sequentially filtered plankton, characterized for their size and taxonomic properties by flow cytometry and image analyses and machine learning algorithms. Through year-round sampling in estuaries, the team will also investigate how MMHg concentrations that should be representative of the phytoplankton are influenced by MMHg bound to nonplanktonic particles. The project research will leverage spring and fall research cruises and data collection of the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) and NOAA?s Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) programs. MMHg data will be synthesized statistically and graphically. Some spatial patterns in MMHg of the plankton will be shared as surface maps.

Gene editing offers significant promise for a wide variety of difficult to treat and currently untreatable conditions. Examples include cancers such as leukemia and multiple myeloma, muscular dystrophy, and cystic fibrosis. Last year, the FDA approved the first gene editing treatment for sickle cell anemia. Progress in gene editing has been slow due to unwanted side effects, which can delete the incorrect gene, insert a gene in the wrong location, etc., leading to undesirable impacts and ineffective treatment. The innovation is a platform technology that significantly reduces the potential inaccuracy of current gene editing technology. This leap forward in gene editing targets the desired gene, increasing the safety of gene editing, which is critical to the success of the technology. The innovation is a platform that could be used to advance promising therapies that are, in their current form, unsafe for patients and develop new therapies for disease unmet treatment needs.  <br/><br/>The proposed project will examine the feasibility of the platform technology by targeting the use of the technology in myotonic dystrophy type 1. The disease affects skeletal and smooth muscle, heart, endocrine system, and central nervous system in a progressive, age-dependent manner, with death resulting from pulmonary or cardiac complications. There are no current treatments for this disease. A potential cause for the disease is misfiring by genes that repair DNA. When this gene is not present, there is no known associated loss of function in the biological species. This project will deploy the innovation to: 1) Optimize the formulation in vitro to target the problem gene. This task requires using the formulations in the target cell, sequencing the cells after editing to determine editing efficiency and understand if there are unwanted effects; 2) Determine the delivery dose required for testing in a mouse model using the optimized formulation from first task; 3) Use an in vivo study to determine the feasibility of using the innovation in a mouse model. This study will use the optimal formulation and dose to study the impact on the target genes and potential effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Responding to chemical stimuli such as odors is a fundamental behavior of all organisms. This project will utilize biophysical and biochemical experiments to discover the basic mechanism of odor communication in an invasive agricultural pest. Structure-based computationally designed molecules will be synthesized in collaboration with Professor Frank Foss of University of Texas at Arlington and tested in the Mohanty laboratory for their ability to competitively bind to the odor-binding protein molecules to inhibit the sensing of female-secreted scent by the male to disrupt the mating process.  Knowledge gained from this research could potentially bridge the fundamental gap in the understanding of the mechanism of sense of smell in voracious agricultural pests, as well as pave the way for the development of novel, species-specific, and environmentally friendly odor mimetics as alternatives to harmful pesticides, for bio-rational insect control. Students at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be trained in state-of-the-art synthesis and instrumentation including a newly acquired 800 MHz NMR statewide resource, thus preparing the future generation of teachers, researchers, and innovators.<br/><br/>Insects use insoluble fatty acid (FA) derivatives as highly specific signaling molecules. Pheromone binding proteins (PBP) ferry the fatty acid odor to the odorant receptor across the aqueous sensillar lymph that surrounds the dendrites of odor-sensitive olfactory neurons. This project will employ an integrated approach involving techniques used in molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, computational chemistry, and synthetic organic chemistry to identify the chemical signatures in the PBP sequence that dictates the mechanism of odor binding and release in an invasive agricultural pest. Biophysical data collected on Ostrinia furnacalis PBP2 (OfurPBP2) suggests that this protein binds lipids and releases them through a distinct mechanism involving a molten globule state. Mutation of functionally important residues will be carried out to unravel the mechanistic details to gain insight into the novel mechanism of lipid binding and release.  Using computational methods, a structure-based design of pheromone mimetics will be performed.  These mimetics will be synthesized to develop a competitive inhibitor that will be tested using a competitive binding assay.  Results of this study could help unravel the distinct mechanisms of chemical sensing in Ostrinia species and will provide a foundation for the rational design of eco-friendly biomimetic inhibitors for insect control.

It examines whether mineralogical weathering products that develop from volcanic rock are the cause of podoconiosis, a skin disease that manifests like elephantitus, and is found in agricultural workers who labor barefoot in volcanic soils without adequate clothing and footwear. Human exposure to these mineral particles is limited by organic carbon in soil, which binds the particles into aggregates, as opposed to being free particles. Climate change and drought reduce the amount of organic carbon in soil, hence increases human exposure to the podoconiosis which is a debilitating condition. This project focuses on rural, subsistance, farm workers in Rwanda where podoconiosis is a common ailment. In addition to the mineralogical and toxicological work, the project includes assessment of agricultural practices that can prevent organic carbon loss as the climate changes. It also involves mineralogical sampling and high-resolution analysis to determine whether a specific mineral species, such as imogolite - a fiberous mineral with the same size and shape as asbestos can puncture and invade skin tissue, is responsible for the condition. Broader impacts of the work include reduction of a serious and debilitating health condition that has serious economic impacts for rural families in developing countries. In addition, by examinimg the crystaline structure and dimensions of volcanic soil minerals and by studying how organic matter stabilizes mineral particles in soils, this project will contribute to understanding soil properties not only in Africa and Rwanda, but across all nations as the climate changes. The project establishes a new international partnership between soil scientists and toxicologists in the US, Europe and Africa Rift countries. It will support a female graduate student and educate undergraduate graduate scholars in Africa and the US that come from populations underrepresented in Earth science. <br/><br/>This project will collect and study soils from agricultural regions of Rwanda where there is significant podoconiosis prevalence. Nanoscale minerals in soils will be extracted using chemical and mechanical methods. They will be characterized using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and other high-resolution imaging and analytical methods. The toxicity of the extracted minerals will be quantified using toxicological and gene expression methods by collaborators in the UK and France. Our collaborators, one of which is from the Unviersity of Swansea Faculty of Medicine and who has a history of podoconoisis work and is funded under other auspices, will use mammalian immune cells that will be exposed to particles extracted from volcanic soils to assess effects on cell viability and non-lethal signatures of immune response. Next-generation DNA sequencing will identify up- or down-regulation of inflammatory pathways. The strength of the binding of mineral particles to soil, which will be done in the US part of the study, will be quantified using a torsional rheometry method. This shears soil samples and quantifies particles transferred to a surrogate of human skin. The US part of the study will develop methods to mitigate anticipated climate change effects on particle exposure by exploring and manipulating organic carbon and its type and quantity in soils to enhance soil particle aggregation which can mitigate the occurrence of podoconiosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first part of the project addresses fundamental challenges of ray optics and mathematical billiards that model mechanical systems with elastic collision, such as the ideal gas. Geometrical optics provide a good approximation for many applications, such as trapping rays of light and storing solar energy, invisibility, and laser beam shaping. The second part addresses vehicle kinematics, studied both theoretically and via computer experiments.  Applications include control of tractors with many trailers, preventing driving hazard, motion planning for robots, flotation theory, such as the stability of floating bodies, and modeling of the Josephson effect that plays an essential role in constructing quantum-mechanical circuits. This project will also contribute to the training of graduate researchers.<br/><br/>The mathematical scope of this project is closely related with the theory of completely integrable systems. The billiard (optical) reflection is a symplectic transformation of the space of oriented lines (rays of light), making it possible to use methods of Hamiltonian dynamics and symplectic topology in the study of billiards. For example, the known designs of optical traps for parallel beams of light make use of the complete integrability of the billiard systems inside quadratic surfaces. The second part of the project concerning models of vehicle motion involves methods of sub-Riemannian geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics. A relation with the theory of completely integrable systems is manifested in the fact that the optimal vehicle trajectories, and also the sections of the cylindrical bodies that float in equilibrium in all positions, have the shape of solitons of the filament equation, a well-studied completely integrable system that models the motion of fluid and gas vortices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project will develop an innovative technology to monitor and control the electrical, chemical, and optical activity of intact neural circuits with unprecedented precision. By integrating novel materials, designs, fabrication, and testing methods, this multimodal neural interface will help unveiling the fundamental processes underlying brain disorders, as well as testing targeted stimulation and pharmacological interventions. The knowledge and methodological advances generated in this project will also enable the development of new neuroprosthetic and neuromodulation devices with long-term stability, safety, and functionality. The research objectives of this project are integrated with educational and outreach activities including establishing a teaching and research curriculum in bioelectronics for undergraduate students; outreach, training, and hands-on experiences in engineering research for K-12 students from disadvantaged local communities.<br/><br/>The brain function relies on the perfectly orchestrated interplay between neurotransmission and electrophysiological activity. Understanding the dynamics governing neurotransmitter release/uptake and electrophysiology is critical to reveal the fundamental mechanisms behind function, behavior, and neurological disorders, and to inform the design of effective therapeutic interventions. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of brain function and disease, which results from the lack of bioelectronic technologies and materials for safely and effectively interfacing with neural circuits across modalities and scales. To goal of this CAREER project is to develop novel multimodal devices for simultaneous electrophysiology, neurochemistry, and optical mapping of neuronal circuits in vivo and at multiple scales. To achieve this goal the investigator will adopt a multidisciplinary approach combining novel bioelectronic materials and fabrication methods with custom wireless controllers and surgical preparations for in vivo closed-loop recording, imaging, and control of neural activity. The research activities of the project are organized in three main objectives: 1) design, fabrication, and characterization of a multimodal neural interface based on nanoscale soft conductors and custom fabrication processes; 2) establish in vivo safety and long-term functionality of the multimodal devices; 3) investigate and control the dynamics of neural circuits in vivo with multimodal mapping and responsive stimulation. This project builds on the investigator expertise and multidisciplinary research program on engineered materials and bioelectronics for basic and translational neuroscience. By developing a novel tool to map and modulating neural circuits across multiple domains and scales simultaneously, this project will address the fundamental functionality and stability challenges in implantable interfaces. Furthermore, it will establish a platform for biomarker discovery and testing of novel therapies for neurological disorders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging applications ? such as capable artificial intelligence, immersive virtual realities, and pervasive sensor systems ? drive unprecedented demand for computer systems that offer scalable performance and environmental sustainability. Despite recent advances to achieve net zero carbon emissions, the computing industry?s gross energy usage continues to rise at an alarming rate, outpacing the growth of new energy installations and renewable energy deployments. The Carbon Connect Expedition is a multi-institutional, five-year research initiative that builds the foundations for sustainable computing. This shift towards sustainability could spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed, leading to a more responsible and sustainable approach to advancing computing technologies. By redefining the way computer scientists consider environmental sustainability, Carbon Connect will establish new standards for carbon accounting in the computing industry, thereby influencing future energy policy and legislation. By fostering an interdisciplinary community of researchers dedicated to sustainable computing, Carbon Connect will train the next generation of innovators in the combined fields of computer science, electrical engineering, environmental science, and energy policy. By creating an academic-industry consortium, Carbon Connect will accelerate the adoption of sustainable computing practices. Finally, by organizing workshops and curricula, Carbon Connect will educate future leaders in computer science and engineering.<br/> <br/><br/>The Carbon Connect Expedition re-thinks computing?s infrastructure, from semiconductor chips to hyperscale datacenters. Embodied carbon arises from a hardware component?s entire lifecycle, including its manufacture, transportation, and eventual disposal. This aspect of the Expedition seeks to minimize the environmental impact of producing semiconductor chips, which are fundamental to all electronic devices but come with a high carbon cost. Operational carbon, on the other hand, arises from energy consumed during a hardware component?s operational life. Given rapidly increasing energy demands from global datacenters that power the Internet, cloud services, and the emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence, addressing operational emissions at datacenter scale is particularly important. The Carbon Connect Expedition seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of information and communication technology by pursuing three main objectives. First, the Expedition will create transparent and accurate carbon accounting methods, which will include standardized protocols for measuring and reporting carbon as well as techniques for overcoming inconsistent estimates and broad error margins. Second, it will develop innovative tools and strategies for reducing computing?s carbon footprint by 45% within the next decade. These innovations will include the exploration of energy-efficient hardware design, advanced hardware recycling and disposal strategies to minimize embodied carbon, and the intelligent use of renewable energy to reduce operational carbon from datacenters. Third, the Carbon Connect Expedition will coordinate the design and management of future computer systems to sustainability deliver performance for artificial intelligence and virtual reality systems. This coordination will allow computer scientists and engineers to balance embodied and operational carbon, which cannot often be reduced simultaneously and require intelligent compromises. Together, these technical objectives will ensure continued advances in computational performance and capability yet ensure environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this challenge, a novel thermal diode that is based on the concept of capillary filling and emptying is proposed. The objectives of this project are to examine two hypotheses (1) the capillary filling/emptying in structural- and material-wise heterogeneous nanostructures (< 1,000 nm) enables control of the effective thermal conductivity using water as a working fluid at ambient conditions; (2) the capillary-controlled effective thermal conductivity changes under fast, cyclic switching of the temperature gradients (thermal diode cycle time, tcyc < 0.05 s) to realize highly-efficient (rectification ratio, R > 100) nanoscale thermal diode without significant hysteresis at ambient conditions.This collaborative multidisciplinary research will involve high-quality students for STEM education, with particular emphasis on underrepresented and K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past research in education, psychology, and marketing has shown that the addition of visuospatial information alongside verbal information can lead to overall memory retention benefits. This project will examine underlying mechanisms and explore the differential impacts of visuospatial versus verbal presentations of information and how to optimize memory consolidation of learned material. Despite some exploration of the role of visuospatial summaries in learning, the mechanisms and scope of these effects - especially in STEM concept learning - is less understood. To address this knowledge gap, the investigators will assess the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of visuospatial summaries on STEM concept learning, leveraging empirical work (largely spearheaded by this lab) on the important of rest and consolidation, thereby bridging gaps between cognitive neuroscience and educational research. The team will directly test novel hypotheses about these mechanisms by leveraging insights from the cognitive neuroscience literature showing the neural structure critical for memory consolidation (the hippocampus) is also uniquely sensitive to visuospatial information. The team therefore asks whether visuospatial explanations may gain preferential access to hippocampal operations, thereby leading to the observed memory benefits. They will investigate this question by concluding an undergraduate lecture presentation with a visuospatial summary of the key concepts or with a verbal summary of the same concepts, looking both at the potential long-term memory benefits using behavioral tests as well as using neuroimaging methods. The outcomes have the potential to influence the design of STEM educational materials and the structure of classroom and remote learning. These findings could also advance our fundamental understanding of memory processes, with the potential to elucidate strategies that boost memory and cognition across all age groups.<br/><br/>The investigators will conduct a large neuroimaging study examining immediate post-encoding replay and later retrieval of STEM content (lecture style slide-based materials) that ends with either verbal or visuospatial summaries. Three hypotheses will be tested. First, the researchers predict that offline neural replay, a key neural mechanism supporting long-term memory consolidation, will be enhanced following learning that ends with a visuospatial as compared to a verbal summary. Second, they predict that detailed concept memory and transfer of these concepts to novel contexts will benefit from visuospatial endings. They will examine the relationship between post-encoding hippocampal-cortical replay of these summaries and long-term (one week) memory retention and transfer performance. Finally, they predict that visuospatial summaries will be reinstated with more episodic detail, allowing it to serve as a more robust knowledge representation with which to add new learning content. The work is unique in many ways, including (1) its detailed examination of the effects of STEM-content summaries on long-term retention; (2) potential insights into real-world triggers for memory consolidation; and (3) the use of fMRI to analyze the mechanisms underlying different learning phases to shed light on memory processes previously unexplored in the STEM learning domain. The proposed work is designed as a foundational precursor to a broader project in real classrooms, aiming to transform STEM teaching methods. This project is supported by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These compounds mainly come from aromatic amino acids (AAAs), which are produced from atmospheric carbon fixed by photosynthesis in plants. Normally, plants direct a small percentage of total fixed carbon towards AAAs, however, the principal investigator?s group has recently re-engineered the AAA synthesis pathway to use a much larger percentage of carbon from the Calvin-Benson cycle. This project investigates how carbon fixed by the Calvin-Benson cycle in photosynthesis flows through plant metabolic networks to produce AAAs and how plants adjust these carbon fluxes under different environmental conditions. The foundational knowledge gained about the system-level properties of plant metabolism allows the use of plants as an alternative platform to produce various aromatic compounds sustainably. The project recruits and trains students from diverse backgrounds and engages them directly in discovery-based systems biology research. In this way the next generation scientists acquire a broader understanding of complex plant metabolic systems.<br/><br/>The shikimate pathway in plants is a central gateway directing carbon flux from the Calvin-Benson Cycle (CBC) of photosynthesis to biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (AAAs). The principal investigator?s lab recently discovered novel genetic mutations that drastically enhance carbon flux to AAA biosynthesis via the shikimate and novel ?non-shikimate? pathways. These mutants also elevate carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation at the CBC. This project quantifies systems-wide carbon fluxes from the CBC to AAA biosynthesis and elucidates how the metabolic network of the CBC and parallel AAA pathways can flexibly produce AAAs under genetic and environmental perturbations. The project utilizes novel genetic mutants with integrated short to mid-term carbon-13 labeled CO2 feeding and metabolic flux modeling, together with biochemical and genetic analyses. The study re-defines the critical metabolic network connecting CO2 fixation and diverse aromatic production in plants. Quantitative understanding of this integrated metabolic system will enable sustainable production of diverse aromatic compounds, while efficiently capturing and sequestering CO2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For billions of people throughout the world, water is delivered, pumped, or precipitated intermittently into structure-level water storage, with the storage then enabling the water supply to be on-premises and available when needed. With increasing outages to water supplies due to aging infrastructure and/or climate change induced extreme weather events such drought or flooding, household or building water storage has become an essential component of premise plumbing systems. Despite the important role of storage in household/building water supply, there are critical challenges in maintaining safe water through storage as many studies have established that microbial water quality degrades between distribution system mains or source water and storage, evidenced by higher concentrations of indicator bacteria or pathogens. This degradation of the quality of stored water is often associated with water age (the time water spends in distribution or plumbing system infrastructure) and the accompanying loss of disinfectant residual and elevated temperatures that foster microbial growth. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to test the hypothesis that local water storage can be designed to preserve or even improve water quality following contamination events while achieving resiliency through interruptions. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge about microbial persistence and growth in water storage systems while providing valuable insight into the efficacy of interventions to improve stored water quality. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one post-doctoral research fellow, one graduate student, and one undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.<br/><br/>Local household/building cold water storage is an essential yet often neglected component of premise plumbing systems. This CAREER project will advance the fundamental understanding of the dynamics of water quality while it is in storage with the goal of enabling the design of premise plumbing systems that are resilient in the face of water supply interruptions while maintaining the integrity of water quality. The specific objectives of this research are to: 1) Quantify the effects of a contamination event on the accumulation, persistence, and release of indicator bacteria and opportunistic pathogens in home water storage tanks that are supplied with municipal tap water; 2) Investigate the efficacy of interventions to minimize microbial persistence and growth in home water storage while minimizing water consumption, supply interruption, and cost; and 3) Develop a framework for optimizing water storage volumes to meet water safety, supply, and reliability goals. By integrating experiments and modeling, the Principal Investigator (PI) hopes to uncover the critical design and operational parameters that control the tradeoffs between water quality and water storage capacity in household and building premise plumbing systems. To implement the educational goals of this CAREER project, the PI proposes to leverage existing programs and resources at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to advance the development and implementation of a new pedagogy to train students in use-inspired design thinking to facilitate innovation in water systems. The proposed educational and outreach activities will include 1) the organization of a hands-on design competition, adapted for K-12 through undergraduate student levels, that challenges students to brainstorm and design resilient home water storage systems; 2) the design and implementation of a new graduate course on intermittent water delivery and home water storage; and 3) the design and implementation of a water supply outage monitoring map accessible to the public that will track outages across the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, it is critical to understand the processes that govern soil carbon formation to accurately predict future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Human activities have increased the amount of biologically-active nitrogen in the environment, a nutrient that often constrains plant and microbial activity in terrestrial ecosystems, and can influence their ability to store soil carbon. This research will leverage a field experiment to determine how nitrogen enrichment influences the formation and stabilization of soil carbon, and how those processes are influenced by soil chemical properties such as pH. The researchers will track the movement of decomposing plant material into different soil carbon fractions. The results will expand scientific understanding of the biological and biogeochemical mechanisms underlying the soil carbon responses to nitrogen fertilization across different types of ecosystems. The project will provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate student teams. The researchers will also develop elementary education and public outreach curricula related to forests & global change to engage the local community in project objectives and results. <br/><br/>The microbially-mediated process of plant litter decomposition sits at the interface between plant primary production and soil carbon formation, and therefore functions as a critical hinge for soil carbon cycling and accumulation. Nitrogen fertilization increases the initial rate of plant litter decomposition while reducing the rate and extent of longer-term decomposition, but the effect of anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment on soil carbon pool size and cycling is highly variable, often decoupled from plant production responses, and can diverge across functional soil carbon fractions. The proposed research will leverage a full-factorial nitrogen fertilization and plant litter substrate addition experiment replicated at two sites with differing soil chemistry and mineral parent material at Hopkins Memorial Forest in northwestern Massachusetts. Using a 13C-labeled litter tracing approach, the researchers will evaluate the effect of nitrogen and litter substrate inputs on soil chemistry, physical structure, and fraction distribution. The approach will enable the researchers to test the central hypothesis that nitrogen fertilization increases mineral-associated organic carbon in low pH soils, while nitrogen decreases mineral-associated organic carbon in higher pH soils in which mineral protection is dominated by base cation bridging. In contrast, changes in soil particulate organic carbon pools are likely to be defined by the soil aggregation response to nitrogen, mediated by changes in root and mycorrhizal production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It builds on multiple ways of knowing, including Indigenous knowledge and science, to strengthen community resilience to multiple stresses and support actions that benefit Indigenous Peoples. The project promotes the progress of science through transdisciplinary approaches that investigate the links among food, climate, and health. <br/><br/>This project will establish Indigenous observatories that include community leaders, Elders, and youth, along with decision makers and researchers from Indigenous communities worldwide, covering the United Nation's seven social cultural regions. The observatories will document, monitor, and examine how climate stressors interact with food systems, health, and well-being across partner regions and communities as they play out in real-time and across seasons. This will be done by recording the lived experiences, stories, responses, and observations of the affected people. The teams will work together to create knowledge and capacity that can be used to develop policies and actions that build on community strengths and address potential vulnerabilities. The observatories strengthen the capacity of Indigenous communities to document their knowledge about the links between climate, food, and health, and provide a space for dialogue with decision makers at regional, national, and global levels to determine necessary actions to build resilience. IPON's global scope provides a foundation for developing scalable insights that inform decision making and advocacy for our partners in United Nations and Indigenous organizations.<br/><br/>This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as funding agencies from Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition. This Competition allowed a single joint international proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by Canada. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is caused by bacteria that are spread through the bite of ticks. Research shows that the immune response to Lyme disease is highly variable and depends on many factors. Lyme antigens have been shown to produce a protective immune response in certain situations. In other situations or forms, these same antigens have been shown to produce a large immune response but no protection. Due to this lack of consistency, this project aims to study the impact of specific Lyme disease antigens on the immune response using a novel carrier system. The immune system response will be tested using outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMVs are ultra-small pieces of bacteria that will be used to carry multiple Lyme proteins. The immune response generated by these OMVs will first be measured. Then, it will be compared to the response generated by OMVs carrying only one Lyme protein. This research will help identify which proteins are required to create a strong and protective immune response. In the long-term, this will lead to improved vaccination strategies against Lyme disease. Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to develop biomedical engineering research skills through participation in this project. Additional students will be introduced to this research through its inclusion in a new course. Lastly, Lyme disease is a prevalent problem that impacts New York residents. Results from this work will be of great interest to the general public. In response to this interest, undergraduate students will prepare and lead a publicly accessible presentation and discussion of this research. This will increase the public?s science literacy and help students gain skills communicating science to a general audience.<br/><br/>Lyme disease is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), spread to humans by the black-legged tick. Research indicates that there is wide variation in the immune response to Bb antigens due to a variety of factors, often resulting in incomplete protection. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), spherical lipid bilayers naturally derived from bacteria, have been shown to induce a strong and protective immune response in animal models, even when used in combination with poorly immunogenic antigens. This project aims to increase fundamental understanding of the immune response to various Lyme antigens using the OMV background and determine if the immune response to a physical mixture of single-antigen OMVs is equal to the immune response of multivalent OMVs. These objectives will be accomplished by: 1) exploring fusion proteins as a proof of concept to present full Bb antigens on OMVs; 2) determining the potential to express multiple Bb antigen epitopes on the OMV surface simultaneously; and 3) evaluating the effect of these single and multi-antigenic particles on the adaptive immune response of two animal models. These studies will help inform more effective tailoring strategies for modulating the host immune response to Bb infection, potentially shaping a new paradigm around the study of Lyme disease immunology and effective vaccination techniques required to prevent Bb infection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also provides a unique opportunity for exchanging ideas between fluid dynamics, soft matter, and machine learning communities, since members of these communities are not necessarily in contact with one another through the normal dissemination venues such as conferences and publications. The participants are from a diverse group of researchers including those from underrepresented groups, early career scientists, and faculty from non-R1 institutions. The structure of the workshop as a small, highly interactive forum with explicit time set aside for discussion will promote cross-fertilization and development of new relationships and collaborations.  <br/><br/>Recent years have seen an explosion in the use of machine learning and data science tools in Newtonian fluid dynamics, in part due to the availability of software environments for implementing these tools as well as because of improvements in algorithms and computing speed.  Relevant applications of machine learning and data science include data-driven closures for RANS models, nonlinear dimension reduction and data-driven time evolution modeling for control applications and combining velocimetry and machine learning to improve velocity field measurements. In soft-matter dynamics, especially non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, machine learning and data science have begun to aid in development of effective constitutive models for very complex soft materials and efficient representations of complex data sets as arise for example in X-ray scattering measurements of complex-fluid microstructure. The workshop will provide a unique forum for researchers across a spectrum of applications, but with common goals and overlapping tools, to learn from one another, and thereby more effectively use machine learning and data science ideas and tools to advance fluid and soft-matter dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water scarcity is one of the most significant challenges facing the world today. An estimated 4.0 billion people currently experience severe water scarcity during at least 1 month a year. Measures to alleviate water shortages, such as water conservation and improved catchment and distribution systems, are important, but do not increase existing freshwater resources. Alone these methods are insufficient in coping with rising water demand which is further intensified by increasing population, agricultural needs, and industrialization. The only methods to increase freshwater supply are limited to water reuse and desalination, with the latter offering a seemingly unlimited supply. In addition to water scarcity, access to clean drinking water is a global challenge. Unfortunately, waterborne diseases persist in developing countries and are one of the leading causes of death. Continued research into technologies that can simultaneously desalinate and disinfect water is a vital area of research, which has led to the emergence of capacitive deionization (CDI). CDI systems desalinate salty feed solutions by electrostatically adsorbing ionic species to a pair of oppositely charged electrodes. CDI systems can also disinfect contaminated water sources if harmful microorganisms possess a net surface charge. For long-term full-scale CDI systems, the electrodes can be one of the largest expenses in terms of capital costs and operating costs. This project will investigate a sustainable approach to fabricating ultra-low-cost CDI electrodes by utilizing wasted food (i.e. ? bread). The broader impact of the project may enhance the development of sustainable freshwater drinking supplies. Furthermore, the project will enable the building of a sustainable education and training system for undergraduate researchers at Saint Vincent College and for high school students from underserved groups.<br/><br/>The vast majority of CDI research has focused on tailoring the nanostructure of the electrode material to generate high surface area. This was primarily done to maximize the amount of ionic species that can be adsorbed to the electrode surfaces during the desalination process. Preliminary work has discovered that intact natural materials (e.g. mangrove roots and wasted bread) can serve as excellent precursors to generating freestanding CDI electrodes. The micro-features (100?s of microns) of these natural materials can be preserved through pyrolysis and offer major advantages when integrated into CDI systems, such as low-resistance pathways for water transport. The project?s objective is to study the potential effects micro-features may have on the performance of CDI electrodes in desalination systems and disinfection systems. The project?s objectives are to: (1) Demonstrate that carbon electrodes can be fabricated with controlled surface topology on the order of 100?s of microns using natural materials as feedstocks and (2) Understand the dependence of desalination performance and disinfection performance on electrode surface topology in a CDI system. The intellectual merit of the work will lead to new techniques for generating carbon electrodes with controlled microstructures. Importantly, the nature of these techniques will be inexpensive and realizable in primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the interface between EVs and the ETN, the EV charging station (EVCS) demands precise and long-term planning to meet the versatile power, transportation, and communication demands of the ETN. However, the limited availability of EV data impedes accurate demand forecasting for EVCS planning. Further, overlooking the impacts of socio-economic factors (such as the growth of urban and rural areas and population distribution) will degrade the long-term EVCS planning. This project will develop a scalable EV data generation model that only needs publicly available data to generate EV data at the individual vehicle level and system level. The project team will use the data for EV demand forecasting to shed light on ETN planning, including EVCS deployment, potential network hotspot installation, and road expansion. The project will use land use and land cover change analysis to explore the impact of urban area and population growth on long-term ETN planning. The project contributes to the sustainable planning and efficient operation of the ETN and the project results will serve as the guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, promoting net-zero transportation in the United States in the long run.<br/><br/>The project will advance the research of EV infrastructure expansion profoundly from three aspects. First, a scalable travel motif-based EV generation model will be developed to generate close-to-real EV travelling data using open-access data. Then, a recurrent-graph convolutional network-based learning model for EV demand forecasting will be developed for spatiotemporal multi-system resource forecasting. Finally, a land use land change analysis model will be developed and integrated into the multi-stage ETN expansion strategy by predicting the land change and correspondingly the population growth and EV distribution change over time. The ETN expansion strategy will guarantee the quality of service during the multi-stage planning horizon with inter-system infrastructure investment. The inter-disciplinary project will provide a powerful range of interdisciplinary tools for data-driven EV operation, and EV-related infrastructure planning and operation, therefore enhancing scientific and technological understanding in the related field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their host-virus interactions can alter community structure, preserve genetic diversity, and impact nutrient cycling. Up to a third of the bacteria that dominate marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are infected with phages, yet the consequences of the host-virus interactions are unknown. Environmental DNA sequence data suggest that a dominant lineage of OMZ bacteria (SUP05) is comprised of species and subspecies that carry out different steps in marine nitrogen cycling and that these cells are often infected by viruses. The nitrogen cycling capacity of diverse SUP05 cells can drive the accumulation of nitrogen cycle intermediates in the oceans or lead directly to significant nitrogen loss. The outcome may be driven in part by phages, by causing cell death, metabolic rewiring of infected cells (virocells), or through the expression of phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). This project is testing the overarching hypothesis that SUP05 populations are comprised of diverse nitrogen respiring cell types and that their interactions with phages can determine the fate of fixed nitrogen. The investigators are studying SUP05 cells and viruses from OMZs to detail their combined effects on nitrogen cycling and loss processes in OMZs. The project is providing graduate and undergraduate students with hands-on collaborative field and laboratory research experiences, with a focus on broadening participation in oceanography. Through local science festivals, open houses, and interactive classroom lessons, K-12 students are learning about OMZs, nitrogen cycling, and viral infection. Results are being presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and all sequence and biogeochemical data, as well as new cultures of SUP05 and phage isolates are being made available to the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>Up to 25% of the fixed nitrogen in the ocean is lost as gaseous products through denitrification and other microbial processes in OMZs. These regions are also hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission to the atmosphere. While sulfur oxidizing chemoautotrophs from the SUP05 clade of marine bacteria and their viruses are abundant in marine OMZs, the roles of host-virus interactions in biogeochemical processes are largely unknown. This interdisciplinary study is evaluating SUP05 cells and phages in stable OMZ fjord systems using a combination of in situ measurements, DNA and RNA sequencing, and laboratory experiments to link the metabolic activities of SUP05 with the underlying nitrogen transformations they mediate in the ocean. The collective expertise of team members using field approaches to study microbial and viral diversity in nature, cultivation studies to test genomic predictions under controlled laboratory conditions, and isotope analyses to identify the rates and mechanisms underlying microbial nitrogen cycling and loss are being combined to provide new information about the conditions and activities that regulate SUP05 nitrogen cycling and loss in marine OMZs. Ultimately, this multi-faceted approach is filling critical gaps in our understanding of SUP05 cells and phages and how they collectively influence the marine nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At least 54 species of toothed whales are consumed across 86 countries worldwide and the practice is increasing. Yet, toothed whale harvest often occurs in remote and understudied regions, leaving a large gap in knowledge of whale populations, their contamination and nutritional value, and their socioeconomic importance to communities, particularly in the context of accelerating climate change. WhaleAdapt is an international collaboration of researchers and local organizations from Canada, the U.S., Denmark (Greenland, Faroe Islands), and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Windward Islands, eastern Caribbean) that uses cutting-edge approaches combined with local ecological knowledge to address the overarching question ? how can vulnerable communities reliant on whale consumption adapt successfully to shifting marine resources due to climate change? WhaleAdapt is engaged and integrated with the most vulnerable groups from the tropics to the Arctic to address key risks through novel interdisciplinary approaches and will contribute to better understanding how climate change is impacting the spatial and trophic ecology of cetaceans as marine predators in the North Atlantic, and to help whaling communities across three countries to make a sustainable, healthy, and socioeconomically viable adaptation to shifting marine resources. Results have broad implications for national agencies and international agreements on climate change, biodiversity, and pollution.<br/><br/>WhaleAdapt has five major objectives: 1. Investigate past, present, and future distribution and relative abundance of North Atlantic toothed whales using local ecological knowledge (LEK) and habitat suitability modelling; 2. Use chemical tracers to evaluate the trophic roles of toothed whales across the North Atlantic and study climate-driven changes; 3. Assess concentrations of key contaminants and nutrients in whales consumed as foods, and improve knowledge on their sources and pathways using isotopic tracers; 4. Inform the sustainability of harvest based on population size, structure, and demographic history; 5. Co-develop knowledge on the economic and cultural value of whales as foods relative to newly available cetaceans and other wild (e.g., fish) and imported foods. This project will use cutting-edge approaches across disciplines in habitat and distribution modeling, dietary tracers (stable isotopes, fatty acid analysis), genomics, ecotoxicology, and social science, particularly using LEK. Results will engage the academic community and policy makers. Results will be disseminated to researchers through conference presentations, invited seminars, peer?reviewed papers, and contributions to national and international assessment reports.<br/><br/>This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and funding agencies from Canada via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition.

Each of these modalities has its own timing characteristics. When studying the neurobiology of language, researchers often choose a specific modality, which hinders the ability to distinguish between language properties and modality-specific dynamics. Understanding how the neural pathways of language interact with different modalities is crucial for developing comprehensive models of language in the brain. This project examines how the language system organizes itself when the input lacks temporal sequencing because this should be a useful window into the brain?s inherent way to travel from form to meaning. The internal timing aspect of sentences is removed by using short written stimuli, flashed rapidly all at once, similarly to quick notifications on a phone. Prior research has shown that this type of flashing stimulus can be understood quickly, but only if the stimulus is a grammatical sentence. This project uses noninvasive brain measurements to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of syntactic and semantic computations for a stimulus that contains no internal timing dynamics of its own. In addition to advancing the neurobiology of language, this project sheds light on how human brains swiftly grasp meaning from a single glance ? an ability critical in today's visually saturated world. The project involves mentorship of a diverse set of undergraduate students, graduate students, and a post-baccalaureate research assistant. Two high school students are integrated into the project as lead investigators of their own studies. Multiple languages are examined, and some studies include outreach to relevant speaker communities.<br/><br/>In this project, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are used to examine two fundamental questions: (1) what is the inherent spatiotemporal organization of syntactic and semantic computations in the brain, and (2) how does the brain map input to linguistic knowledge in the absence of predictions from a temporally preceding context? Each study elicits a neural Sentence Superiority Effect (SSE), manifested as increased neural activity for sentences as compared to unstructured stimuli. The underlying function of each neural SSE is investigated by introducing errors and representational complexity to the stimuli to determine what ?counts? as a sentence for those neural signals. The degree of serial processing within each neural SSE is also assessed by examining the effects of transition probabilities between words in a left-to-right fashion across the entire stimulus. If language processing is inherently serial, then serial processing should manifest itself even for a parallel stimulus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is the largest and most constant spur of the global Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) covering a large area of the tropical and subtropical South Pacific. The SPCZ and ITCZ are important parts of the global water cycle. These regions contribute around 30% of total global precipitation and serve as source regions for atmospheric moisture transfer to higher latitudes. In addition, the SPCZ is the main feature controlling Southern Hemisphere hydroclimate and South Pacific tropical cyclones. Despite the importance of the SPCZ, there are questions about whether the SPCZ is intensifying and the factors that control its position. The researchers have previously generated oxygen isotope data from coral cores collected from four sites in the SPCZ (American Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, and Rarotonga). These data record ocean-atmosphere conditions from the present back several centuries.  A key question is if the observed coral oxygen isotope trend in the SPCZ is due to surface ocean warming, greater rainfall, or both. This project will analyze temperature sensitive elements preserved in these same coral cores to reconstruct multi-year and long-term trends in ocean temperature and rainfall. This work will allow for a better understanding of the influence global warming, El Nio events, and volcanic eruptions have on the SPCZ. The results may also help in predicting future SPCZ behavior as the climate changes. Further, this project will support a PhD student, undergraduate students, and high school students.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to better understand variability in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) size and position over the last several hundred years. The project will address the question of how did the SPCZ respond to global climate change and western Pacific warming in the 1700s and 1800s compared to the late 20th century? Important climate uncertainties include what ocean-atmosphere parameters control the long-term position of the SPCZ and whether the SPCZ is currently intensifying. Coral oxygen isotope (d18O) time series extending back to the 1500s and 1600s CE from American Samoa, Fiji, Tonga and Rarotonga in the SPCZ region all contain a long-term secular trend towards lower (more negative) d18O, but the ocean-atmosphere significance is unclear. Given the importance of the SPCZ to southern Hemisphere hydroclimate and the combined ITCZ+SPCZ to global hydroclimate, understanding the significance of these coral d18O trends is a high priority paleoclimate objective with implications for future SPCZ changes. The amplitude of the d18O trend at American Samoa, Fiji, and Rarotonga is ~ 0.6? which is ~ 4X greater than expected if the forcing is the 0.5C sea surface temperature (SST) warming since the 1850s suggested by instrumental sea surface temperature. Recent work interpreted the trends towards lower d18O in Fiji and Rarotonga corals to be evidence of an expansion and/or intensification of the SPCZ to the southeast since the 1800s. But gridded instrumental SST products are known to be based on sparse data before the mid-1900s, and nothing is known about SST annual means prior to the 1850s. To address the past SST uncertainty in the SPCZ region the researchers have demonstrated the potential of using coral skeletal Li/Mg and Sr/Ca measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as SST proxies in this region. The goals of this project are to generate replicated d18O, Li/Mg and Sr/Ca time-series on six Porites lutea coral cores from American Samoa, Fiji and Tonga. Work on this project will allow both the reconstruction of SST, but also seawater salinity and rainfall. Replication will provide chronology checks and also additional error estimation. Analysis of this unique collection of long coral cores and replication approach will lead to a better understanding of SPCZ long-term dynamics and will facilitate modeling efforts to predict future changes as the Earth warms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An efficient, fast, and robust thermal diode is needed to substantially increase the efficiency of advanced thermal management, energy harvesting, and to develop novel applications such as thermal logic gate. This project studies a new class of thermal diodes by tailoring condensation/evaporation heat transport mechanisms through heterogeneous nanostructures under different temperature gradients. The working mechanisms will be studied using a combination of multiphysics-multiscale simulation approaches and experiments.

Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical components in renewable energy technologies like wind turbines and electric vehicles. However, REEs are difficult to separate and purify due to their chemical similarity. Membrane filtration is an energy-efficient, low-carbon, scalable, and additive-free alternative to solvent extraction for industrial-scale separations; however, today?s commercial membranes cannot separate REE ions from each other. This project aims to design novel membrane materials featuring nano-scale structures, inspired by biological pores such as ion channels and formed through scalable self-assembly processes, that can selectively enrich and separate REEs. For this purpose, the interdisciplinary research team will use their expertise in chemistry to synthesize new membranes with < 3 nm channels and chemical functionality for selective interactions with REEs. The membranes, which will be able to separate and enrich REEs by filtration, would replace much less scalable and more energy intensive processes, and will support the development of a robust and sustainable national supply chain for REEs. Further, the strategies underlying such ?chemical structure based? separations would revolutionize not only the selective enrichment of REEs, but also the separation and recycling of other critical materials (e.g. lithium) and organic compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals). The project will also enable, promote, and expand outreach activities to enhance and support broadening participation in STEM through all three collaborating institutions. Further, outreach efforts will be undertaken to train students to responsibly engage with mining companies, indigenous populations, and the environment. <br/><br/>This research focuses on the limited ability of membranes to separate solutes and ions of similar size and charge, with a specific target of developing membranes capable of REE separations. Membrane filtration, when applicable, offers high energy efficiency, easy scalability, simple operation. Unlike extraction, it does not require the use of solvents. However, the selectivity of today?s commercial membranes is insufficient for many separations, including separating REE ions from each other due to their comparable ionic radii, formal charge, and charge density. The objective of this project is to design membranes with functional nanopores, inspired by biological pores that combine nanoconfinement with selective interactions. This is based on the core premise that selective separation of aqueous solutions of REEs can be achieved in a membrane filtration system if 1) the nanoscale pores are slightly larger than the solute REE molecules; and 2) the pores are lined with zwitterionic (ZI) ligands that exhibit selective and reversible binding to the desired ion. The membranes will be constructed using the self-assembly of copolymers with ZI ligands that can selectively enrich and thus separate REEs. Using this system, selected for its tunability and easy scalability to roll-to-roll systems, the project will aim to link molecular-level insights to experimental thermodynamic, transport, and permeation data?laying the groundwork for the development of new models based on fundamental phenomena. To achieve these objectives, the team will (1) use polymer self-assembly to synthesize new membranes with < 3 nm tunable nanochannels with functional pore chemistries designed for selective interactions with REEs, (2) quantify the effect of nanoconfinement on ligand-REE thermodynamics using computations and experiments, and (3) interrogate REE transport mechanisms in bench scale experiments and simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Free-living, non-pathogenic protists that eat other cells and have a flagellum (or two), are especially understudied. In fact, new phyla and even ?kingdoms? of protists are still being discovered at a surprising rate. Thus, approaches must be developed to speed the rate of discovery and bridge this gap in our understanding. In this work, the researchers will develop and use state-of-the-art methods to discover, characterize, and sequence, previously unknown, orders, classes, phyla, and maybe even kingdoms of protists. These data will not only provide insight into the diversity of eukaryotic microbes that currently inhabit our planet but will also help to understand the nature of eukaryotes and the cells that existed over a billion years ago. Because there is so much still to discover, new species lurk in nearly any pond. Therefore, with the goal of including the public in the naming, discovery, and description of new protist species, researchers will also bring this world of discovery to community college and underserved junior-high students in Phoenix AZ.<br/><br/>Heterotrophic flagellates are a guild of protists that span the tree of eukaryotes and play important roles in biogeochemical processes, especially aquatic carbon cycling. They are also important for understanding deep eukaryotic evolution. However, very little is known about the biology of heterotrophic flagellates. Molecular data are particularly limited for heterotrophic flagellates that inhabit freshwater environments. Given the diversity of heterotrophic flagellates known or predicted to exist, higher throughput methods are required to ensure broad sampling. Here, the researchers will use medium-throughput methods to generate over 500 single-cell genomes or transcriptomes of freshwater heterotrophic flagellates. They will also develop high-throughput approaches to sequence tens to hundreds of thousands of single cell transcriptomes. These data will be used to phylogenetically place newly discovered heterotrophic flagellate lineages at the order- and class- or even phylum- and kingdom-levels. This knowledge would help refine the eukaryotic tree of life and transform our current understanding of eukaryote evolution and diversification over the last 2 billion years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, satisfactory personalized user experience in such wireless immersive services demands stringent performance requirements, including: (1) high-speed and high-resolution panoramic image rendering; (2) extremely low delay guarantees; and (3) seamless user experience. Besides the aforementioned requirements, collaborative user experience requires both scalability and fairness of VR service. Existing VR systems heavily rely on various heuristic designs and do not efficiently exploit VR content commonality and its predictability, which impede their large-scale deployment. This project aims to develop the theoretical foundations and complete implementation of a system for providing both personalized and scalable collaborative VR experience over wireless networks. This project will integrate machine learning, wireless networking, and mobile computing to enable high-quality and scalable wireless immersive applications on commodity mobile devices. The theory and practical implementations to be developed in this project will be integrated into both undergraduate and graduate curriculum, as well as exposing K-12 students to state-of-the-art wireless and VR technologies.<br/><br/>The proposed designs are motivated by a number of insights that we have developed from our preliminary work, including (1) viewport-adaptive rendering; (2) commonality among VR content for multiple users to enable multicasting; and (3) predictability of VR content to enable prefetching.

Their host-virus interactions can alter community structure, preserve genetic diversity, and impact nutrient cycling. Up to a third of the bacteria that dominate marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are infected with phages, yet the consequences of the host-virus interactions are unknown. Environmental DNA sequence data suggest that a dominant lineage of OMZ bacteria (SUP05) is comprised of species and subspecies that carry out different steps in marine nitrogen cycling and that these cells are often infected by viruses. The nitrogen cycling capacity of diverse SUP05 cells can drive the accumulation of nitrogen cycle intermediates in the oceans or lead directly to significant nitrogen loss. The outcome may be driven in part by phages, by causing cell death, metabolic rewiring of infected cells (virocells), or through the expression of phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). This project is testing the overarching hypothesis that SUP05 populations are comprised of diverse nitrogen respiring cell types and that their interactions with phages can determine the fate of fixed nitrogen. The investigators are studying SUP05 cells and viruses from OMZs to detail their combined effects on nitrogen cycling and loss processes in OMZs. The project is providing graduate and undergraduate students with hands-on collaborative field and laboratory research experiences, with a focus on broadening participation in oceanography. Through local science festivals, open houses, and interactive classroom lessons, K-12 students are learning about OMZs, nitrogen cycling, and viral infection. Results are being presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and all sequence and biogeochemical data, as well as new cultures of SUP05 and phage isolates are being made available to the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>Up to 25% of the fixed nitrogen in the ocean is lost as gaseous products through denitrification and other microbial processes in OMZs. These regions are also hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission to the atmosphere. While sulfur oxidizing chemoautotrophs from the SUP05 clade of marine bacteria and their viruses are abundant in marine OMZs, the roles of host-virus interactions in biogeochemical processes are largely unknown. This interdisciplinary study is evaluating SUP05 cells and phages in stable OMZ fjord systems using a combination of in situ measurements, DNA and RNA sequencing, and laboratory experiments to link the metabolic activities of SUP05 with the underlying nitrogen transformations they mediate in the ocean. The collective expertise of team members using field approaches to study microbial and viral diversity in nature, cultivation studies to test genomic predictions under controlled laboratory conditions, and isotope analyses to identify the rates and mechanisms underlying microbial nitrogen cycling and loss are being combined to provide new information about the conditions and activities that regulate SUP05 nitrogen cycling and loss in marine OMZs. Ultimately, this multi-faceted approach is filling critical gaps in our understanding of SUP05 cells and phages and how they collectively influence the marine nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The answer to this question can often be better understood through the lens of mechanical reliability. Whether studying semiconductor microelectronics, renewable energy harvesting and storage technologies, other optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), detectors, lasers, or even biodevices, reliability is often governed by the interaction of environmental and mechanical stress parameters. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are the premier next-generation photovoltaic (PV) technology based on low-cost and high-performance applications in PV, LEDs, and photo/X-ray detectors. The problem is that MHPs have been identified as among the most mechanically fragile of any optoelectronic device, but the mechanical properties of MHPs have been largely overlooked. The integrated research and educational resources explore the link between mechanical properties and operational stability in PV devices to enable manufacturability of MHP technology through involvement of underserved populations. The ""Perovskite Solar Cell 101"" outreach effort to local community colleges and tribal schools will include women and Indigenous students. The addition of free online resources on PVEducation, the world's largest online and free semiconductor textbook, is aimed at reaching a worldwide audience. A graduate peer mentoring program is designed to welcome individuals of all backgrounds, particularly first-generation students who may have less familiarity with PhD program expectations.  One key outcome that will be pursued is the development of a culture of inclusion through increasing support for Indigenous and women as well as their access to resources and opportunities in the solar and semiconductor industries. This culture of inclusion is defined as the pursuit of values promoting a sense of belonging for all individuals, recruiting people from a diversity of cultural backgrounds, and advancing inclusion initiatives toward systemic and institutional change.<br/><br/>According to the International Energy Agency, the common failures observed in all PV modules are delamination, adhesion loss, junction box failure, and frame breakage. To this end, the thermomechanical measurements leveraged in this work were selected because they directly measure delamination and adhesion loss. There is a lack of understanding on the relationship of mechanical properties with degradation and how these properties evolve during operation. The central research objective is to answer the following question: ""How can MHPs be designed for thermomechanical reliability that address the key failure mechanisms observed in the lab and the field?"" The research objective will be studied through the following scientific questions: (1) What are the predominant thermomechanical-based failure mechanisms in the lab? (2) How can failures in the field be predicted by experiments in the lab? (3) How can more stable and reliable MHP devices be produced based on design criteria developed through the research? The central hypothesis is that in situ lab test data (through fracture, film stress, and ionic measurements) along with finite element modeling combined with analysis of field failures can elucidate the failure mechanisms and determine criteria for robust MHP device and module designs. When combined with the accelerated aging conditions enabled through control of humidity, heat, temperature, illumination, and bias during testing, these lab measurements that probe the synergistic effect of environmental and mechanical stressors aim to enable the development of accelerated test sequences that verify and validate MHP PV durability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Basin-wide warming is expected due to the ""Bjerknes feedback"", a self-reinforcing interaction between the equatorial surface winds and the sea surface temperature (SST) contrast between the ""warm pool"" of the western Pacific and the ""cold tongue"" along the equatorial eastern Pacific.  But recent work by the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this award and others has identified another kind of El Nino event in which the warming is in fact largely confined near the coast, with neutral conditions or even a weak La Nina, with cooler than normal SST, over most of the equatorial Pacific. These coastal El Nino events are of scientific interest because of what they tell us about the dynamics of El Nino and the diversity of its possible manifestations.  They are also of practical interest because they cause heavy rainfall and flooding, in part because they peak during the March-to-May rainy season of equatorial South America.<br/><br/>Research conducted here explores the underlying dynamics of coastal El Nino events, their relationship to basin-scale El Nino events, and the extent to which they can be predicted at lead times of several months or longer.  The research builds on earlier work in which the PIs examined the sensitivity of coastal SST to subsurface ocean waves (Kelvin waves) produced by wind bursts occurring at various locations along the equatorial Pacific, finding that some locations are particularly effective at generating coastal warming.  Research on predictability is conducted in part using a Machine Learning (ML) model trained on maps of SST, ocean heat content, and surface winds.  The model can be used to identify the regions and variables which contribute the most to forecast skill.  The predictors identified by the ML model are further explored using simulations conducted with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which is used to identify the dynamical mechanisms through which the ML-derived predictors influence coastal SSTs.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest due to the impacts of coastal El Nino events on the adjacent countries of South America. The work on predictability is particularly relevant as it involves the development of an ML model that can be used for operational prediction.  More generally, the exploration of El Nino dynamics in the project is relevant to the prediction of basin-wide El Nino events, which affect weather and climate in the US and other parts of the world.  In addition, the PIs are working with an undergraduate student to create an online educational version of the ML model in which users can explore the sensitivity of coastal events to various forecast inputs, and are also developing ML-based predictions for local precipitation impacts. Outreach is also conducted through the Open House of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST).  In addition, project provides support and training to a graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rapid development of these technologies has led to rapid adoption across a variety of domains, particularly in speech processing, computer vision, and natural language processing. At the same time, the theoretical underpinnings of these statistical models are not yet fully understood. The question of how and why neural networks ?work"" can be approached from a variety of mathematical perspectives. One of the most promising mathematical tools for analysis of neural networks is random matrix theory, a field that has recently reached mathematical maturity and whose relevance and applicability to modeling, understanding, and characterizing a vast array of science and technology problems keeps growing every day. From principle component analysis and random growth processes to particle interactions and community detection in large networks, random matrices are now used to investigate and explain high-dimensional phenomena like concentration (the so- called ""blessing of dimensionality"" as opposed to the ""curse of dimensionality""). Recent results in universality allow for usage of more complex, non-Gaussian models, sometimes even allowing for limited dependencies. This prompts the question: what can probability theory in general---and random matrix theory (RMT) in particular---tell us about neural networks, modern machine learning, and AI? Such fundamental insights could lead to novel approaches that simplify or improve the efficiency of neural network design and training.<br/><br/>The DIMACS Center at Rutgers University will hold the Workshop on Modeling Randomness in Neural Network Training: Mathematical, Statistical, and Numerical Guarantees at Rutgers University on June 5?7, 2024. This is a multidisciplinary workshop to create bridges between the different mathematical and computational communities by bringing together researchers with a diverse set of perspectives on neural networks. Random matrix theory can be used to understand different phenomena in neural network training. The workshop will center around the following themes: understanding matrix-valued random processes that arise during neural network training, modeling/measuring uncertainty and designing estimators for training processes, and applications to these designs within optimization algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At least 54 species of toothed whales are consumed across 86 countries worldwide and the practice is increasing. Yet, toothed whale harvest often occurs in remote and understudied regions, leaving a large gap in knowledge of whale populations, their contamination and nutritional value, and their socioeconomic importance to communities, particularly in the context of accelerating climate change. WhaleAdapt is an international collaboration of researchers and local organizations from Canada, the U.S., Denmark (Greenland, Faroe Islands), and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Windward Islands, eastern Caribbean) that uses cutting-edge approaches combined with local ecological knowledge to address the overarching question ? how can vulnerable communities reliant on whale consumption adapt successfully to shifting marine resources due to climate change? WhaleAdapt is engaged and integrated with the most vulnerable groups from the tropics to the Arctic to address key risks through novel interdisciplinary approaches and will contribute to better understanding how climate change is impacting the spatial and trophic ecology of cetaceans as marine predators in the North Atlantic, and to help whaling communities across three countries to make a sustainable, healthy, and socioeconomically viable adaptation to shifting marine resources. Results have broad implications for national agencies and international agreements on climate change, biodiversity, and pollution.<br/><br/>WhaleAdapt has five major objectives: 1. Investigate past, present, and future distribution and relative abundance of North Atlantic toothed whales using local ecological knowledge (LEK) and habitat suitability modelling; 2. Use chemical tracers to evaluate the trophic roles of toothed whales across the North Atlantic and study climate-driven changes; 3. Assess concentrations of key contaminants and nutrients in whales consumed as foods, and improve knowledge on their sources and pathways using isotopic tracers; 4. Inform the sustainability of harvest based on population size, structure, and demographic history; 5. Co-develop knowledge on the economic and cultural value of whales as foods relative to newly available cetaceans and other wild (e.g., fish) and imported foods. This project will use cutting-edge approaches across disciplines in habitat and distribution modeling, dietary tracers (stable isotopes, fatty acid analysis), genomics, ecotoxicology, and social science, particularly using LEK. Results will engage the academic community and policy makers. Results will be disseminated to researchers through conference presentations, invited seminars, peer?reviewed papers, and contributions to national and international assessment reports.<br/><br/>This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and funding agencies from Canada via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition.

Individuals who can read efficiently enjoy better employment opportunities and therefore increased upward economic mobility, easier access to public information and therefore improved health outcomes, and greater social connectedness and civic engagement and therefore better mental wellbeing. Students and workplace employees often resort to ?skimming? a text to move through it quickly rather than carefully reading, and this increased speed often comes with a cost to comprehension. With a better understanding of the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying reading, and how these mechanisms change under different reading goals (e.g., casual reading, skimming, reading to learn), teachers and education policy-makers will be in a better position to suggest scientifically validated ways to help every reader meet their full potential. Our current understanding of the cognitive processes involved in reading is based on tools such as eye tracking (ET) technology or event-related brain potentials (ERPs) via electroencephalography (EEG). A major gap in understanding reading grows out of a theoretical and empirical gap between the use of these two tools. ET provides a measure of when and where the eyes move, but does not provide the continuous measure of cognitive activity that occurs before, during, and after word perception that ERPs do. ERPs, in contrast, largely ignore reading behavior by traditionally using unnatural reading paradigms that limit and alter normal reading behavior. Emerging technologies allow for the combination of both of these tools via simultaneous measurement of eye tracking and ERP data, allowing for an expanded understanding of the relationship between brain activity and behavior in natural and goal-directed reading.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project investigates whether eye movements during reading are initiated prior to a word being fully recognized and whether readers use different sources of information to maintain reading speed under different kinds of reading tasks. Continuous measures of ongoing language processing directly link them to eye movements using behavior-contingent analysis techniques ? that is directly examining how brain activity changes as a function of different reading behaviors, such as whether a reader decides to skip a particular word or look back to an earlier part of the text (Objective 1), relying on well-established ERP components, such as the N400 and LPC (Late Positive Component), which have been associated with post-eye-fixation language processes such as expectation and semantic integration, respectively. In addition, the project includes exploratory analyses of saccade-related potentials in order to investigate the brain activity leading up to the movements of the eye. The project also tests the hypothesis that, relative to casual reading, different task goals will alter the relationship between brain activity and behavior so that the alignment between these processes becomes either weaker (e.g., skimming) or stronger (e.g., proofreading, reading to learn). Therefore, this project applies the novel analysis approaches from objective 1 to gain a direct view into how cognitive processes change in response to reading goals independently from, or in coordination with, changes in eye movement behavior (Objective 2). The broader impacts of the project involve cross-training researchers with expertise in both ET and ERP approaches to reading, and an understanding of how reading works under different task goals, like when STEM students skim texts vs. reading for memorization.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Perception, Action and Cognition Program (PAC) and EDU Core Research (ECR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project involves a STEM-dominant technological university, a primarily undergraduate institution known for expertise in teacher education, and high-need school districts in Michigan. Through this collaboration the project will recruit, train, and retain high-quality STEM teacher leaders that can serve as effective mentors and address a systemic shortage of science teachers. Due to chronic understaffing and low retention rates, increasing proportions of STEM teachers are inexperienced and/or underprepared; a problem that most affects high-need school districts. This problem is important because students' learning is negatively impacted when effective teachers are not available. This project provides a proven, effective pathway to train practicing teachers to serve as effective mentors and leaders in their schools through collaboration with other teacher leaders around the State. The expected outcomes of this project are: development of 30 practicing science teacher leaders in diverse, high-need schools in grades 5-9; and development of an online master's degree designed for STEM teachers offered by two partnering universities. The role of teacher leaders is critical for improving the performance of students in STEM courses and increasing students? interest in pursuing future STEM courses and careers.<br/><br/>This project at Michigan Technological University includes partnerships with Northern Michigan University, Copper Country Intermediate School District, Kalamazoo Public Schools, Kentwood Public Schools, Marquette-Alger Regional Education Service Agency, Menominee County Intermediate School District, Midland Public Schools, and the Upper Peninsula Center for Educational Development. Project goals include the recruitment and preparation of 30 new STEM teacher leaders over six years for service in grades 5-9 in diverse, high-need schools within Michigan, and provide an accessible track to earn their master's degree. Despite a need for teacher leaders, most high-need schools lack the resources needed to transform practicing teachers into teacher leaders. This project addresses that need by preparing teacher leaders to employ evidence-based methods to continually enhance their own effectiveness and help less experienced and novice teachers do the same. Teachers will receive the training necessary to deliver long-term benefits to their schools by providing mentoring and professional learning to their colleagues. This project intends to ultimately improve the performance of students in STEM courses, increase students' interest in pursuing future STEM courses and careers, and serve as a model for partnering efforts in other states. Western Michigan University will perform external evaluation. The evaluators will collect and review quantitative and qualitative data related to program implementation and the effect of project programming on instructional practices and leadership skills. Project findings and materials will be disseminated through publications, presentations, and workshops. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

A breakthrough in the 1980s showed that this theory holds for a certain type of four-dimensional manifolds. One of the goals of this project is to examine its validity in full generality. The project also aims to study symmetries of four-dimensional spaces, and to develop new tools for distinguishing them.

While all forms of mercury are toxic, monomethyl mercury (MMHg) is especially problematic because it becomes highly concentrated in fish consumed by humans. Given the health implications for people it is critically important to understand MMHg cycling in the ocean, but the fundamental processes that govern MMHg entrainment from seawater to the base of the food web are not yet sufficiently understood. This project will study MMHg in natural phytoplankton and test hypotheses about the mechanisms and controls on MMHg uptake. The study will occur on the shelf of the Western North Atlantic Ocean and in its estuaries, a region of productive fisheries. Seasonal and geographical changes in biological productivity and plankton community structure will serve as a ?natural laboratory? for testing hypotheses on the factors that control MMHg uptake. The project will provide training and research opportunities through paid internships and summer programs for undergraduate students. Two graduate students, one at the University of Connecticut and one at the University of Rhode Island, will be trained. The team will conduct outreach activities in collaboration with the Yale Peabody Museum to share marine MMHg science with a variety of museum audiences. <br/><br/>Researchers from the University of Connecticut, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Rhode Island, and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will collaborate on this study with the overarching goal of studying MMHg in natural phytoplankton and testing current assertions that cell size and dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] act as major controls over MMHg uptake in phytoplankton and investigate other mechanisms. Additional hypotheses that will be tested include: 1) phytoplankton that employ heterotrophy take up more MMHg, and 2) faster plankton growth lowers cellular MMHg. Novel data such as cellular quota, biomass-based concentrations, and volume concentration factors for MMHg in pico, nano, and microplankton will be obtained through MMHg analysis of sequentially filtered plankton, characterized for their size and taxonomic properties by flow cytometry and image analyses and machine learning algorithms. Through year-round sampling in estuaries, the team will also investigate how MMHg concentrations that should be representative of the phytoplankton are influenced by MMHg bound to nonplanktonic particles. The project research will leverage spring and fall research cruises and data collection of the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) and NOAA?s Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) programs. MMHg data will be synthesized statistically and graphically. Some spatial patterns in MMHg of the plankton will be shared as surface maps. Depth profiles of unfiltered MMHg and total Hg concentrations will also be studied. The data gained through this research will be useful for comparing laboratory-derived concentration factors and model-generated predictions in the study region. Results generated in this research will be helpful for MMHg modeling efforts, and the approach may be adapted to studies in other ecosystems or for other metals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Higher yields of bioproducts for each batch manufactured results in lower costs, which is currently the number one problem throughout the biotechnology industry. For example, the cost of a cultured meat burger is $100, orders of magnitude higher than the traditional alternatives. The cost of a gene therapy cure is $2.2 million, which is too high for the average person to afford. By bringing this new technology to market to engineer higher yielding cells, costs will be dramatically reduced for these bioproducts, allowing growth of the biotechnology industry.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a high-throughput cell screening technology designed to isolate cells based on their ability to produce higher yields of a desired bioproduct. Using this technology, cells are placed into hollow microparticles that are replacements for test tubes to measure the yields that cells produce. The outer shell is composed of a synthetic, porous hydrogel called poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG) that allows for continuous solution exchange between the inner compartment and the external environment. This allows for nutrients to be rapidly replenished, enabling long-term growth and production assays that were not possible with previous microfluidic screening technologies. The microparticles can be sorted via fluorescent activated cell sorters (FACS) at a rate of 75,000 cells/colonies per hour, orders of magnitude higher than the alternatives. Cells can be released post-sort by allowing the cells to grow out of the particles or by adding chemical reagents to the particles to break down the outer shell.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these conversations have focused on the ?what? and ?why? of diversification; that a skilled, creative, and diverse STEM workforce is essential for driving the scientific and technological innovation necessary for addressing the growing and changing demands of society. Due to the ways they must alter everyday products, systems, and spaces to access the world, people with disabilities possess these skills but continue to be underrepresented in the STEM fields. While it is estimated that approximately 25 percent of US adults have a disability, only eight percent of employed scientists and engineers belong to this group. Prior research has identified systems of education as perpetuators of the access barriers experienced by students with disabilities. However, much of this work has utilized approaches that focus on ways to accommodate students based on a particular disability type. Such approaches have resulted in the identification of context-specific causes and reactionary practices that temporarily address access barriers at an individual level. Due to the inconsistent and temporary nature of supporting students with disabilities, current accommodation practices require additional education and management on behalf of the student or fall short of meeting students? needs altogether. This project aligns with the goal of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program to develop a STEM workforce that reflects the nation?s population by focusing on ?how? to encourage and promote the recruitment and participation of people with disabilities in these fields. <br/><br/>This project will transform the ways students with disabilities are supported in engineering by gathering the perspectives of engineering students with disabilities, faculty, and administrators to identify access issues, their impacts across university campuses, and ways to address them. In this project, engineering higher education is reconceptualized as an ecosystem that is both a source and an outcome of inequities located at different institutional levels. This concept repositions the attitudes, behaviors, and practices of individual actors not as discrete events and objects, but as a network of collective opportunity toward improved support. The integrated research and education plan is guided by four objectives: (1) Explore and identity systemic access for engineering undergraduates with disabilities across university levels; (2) quantify and characterize systemic access across universities; (3) develop an engineering community of practice toward anti-ableist praxis; and (4) build capacity for sustainable systemic accessibility and inclusion in STEM. To meet these objectives, this project will employ an explanatory mixed method design to form the Innovation for Inclusion (I2) framework, a scalable institutional framework that integrates advocacy and policy to guide engineering faculty, departments, and colleges toward a system of sustained universal accessibility and inclusion. Qualitative methods will include a content analysis and interviews with 60 engineering students with disabilities, faculty, and administrators to provide foundational insights into the ways systemic access is experienced, managed, and enacted in engineering education. Quantitative survey methods will shed light on the prevalent influencers of systemic access. Mixed methods findings will be used to identify and prioritize viable avenues for system improvement and to create resources that guide engineering students with disabilities, faculty, and administrators toward forming, implementing, and sustaining anti-ableist practices and policies to ensure that all individuals have equitable access to career opportunities in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their fundamental role in reproduction, postmating traits are often dramatically different between closely related species and can prevent species from successfully interbreeding. This suggests that postmating traits may play a special role in the evolution of new species and the diversity of life on earth. This project will identify the underlying genes and gene interactions that contribute to postmating trait differences between two closely related species. The research will provide greater understanding of critical reproductive traits and the evolution of gene networks. The project will provide quantitative training for undergraduate STEM majors at the University of Denver. Students will gain classroom experience analyzing biological data, improving their problem-solving skills, basic programming, and interrogation of biological complexity, which will better prepare students for increasingly data-driven careers in STEM. These educational resources and tools will be disseminated widely, contributing to improved quantitative biology curriculum.<br/><br/>Some of the most intricate intergenomic interactions occur after mating, when gametes, reproductive tract tissues, and their secretions battle and coordinate for fertilization. These postmating traits and their underlying genes are some of the most rapidly evolving in the genome. The rapid divergence in postmating traits suggests that they may play an important role in speciation, but an outstanding question is whether the evolution of postmating prezygotic barriers differs from other types of reproductive barriers. The project will investigate the evolution of postmating barriers between two species by pairing in-depth characterization of gene regulatory network divergence with gene expression mapping of postmating barrier traits. These analyses will be compared to variation found in a natural hybrid zone to evaluate the effects of selection on recombinant gene regulatory networks. The project will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of gene expression and provide insight into the evolution and diversity of postmating traits. Students will analyze data generated through this project in the classroom, providing experiential-learning and building students' quantitative training.

In soils, many bacterial strains carry genes that encode for antibiotic resistance (AR). The use of treated wastewater for irrigation has emerged as an important source of antibiotics in soils.  In agriculture fields irrigated with treated wastewater, previous studies have found that antibiotics are frequently detected in soils. In addition, some studies have reported that irrigation intensity and the occurrence of AR markers in irrigation water are correlated to the abundance of those markers in soils. However, a fundamental understanding of the fate, transport, and reactivity of antibiotics in agricultural soils during irrigation with treated/polluted wastewater has remained elusive. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to advance the fundamental understanding of the reactive transport processes that occur during the infiltration of antibiotic-polluted water and their impact on the levels of AR bacteria in agricultural soils. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator proposes to test the hypothesis that changes in the abundance and persistence of AR bacteria in agricultural soils are directly linked to the physicochemical interactions between soils and antibiotics during the infiltration of treated/polluted irrigation wastewater. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge on how soils function as natural filters that accumulate and/or degrade antibiotic pollutants and control their availability to soil micro-organisms. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two graduate students and one undergraduate student at Texas A&M University.<br/><br/>Antibiotic pollutants are a group of chemicals that infiltrate through soils during irrigation when treated wastewater is used as alternative to address water scarcity in agriculture. Despite the importance of soils in assimilating antibiotic pollution, little is known about how the flow of antibiotic-polluted water impacts the spread and persistence of antibiotic resistance (AR) in soils during irrigation. This CAREER project will address these critical knowledge gaps through the integration of field investigations, bench scale lab experiments, and process-based modeling. The specific objectives of the research are to (1) identify the factors that control the persistence of antibiotics and the amplification of AR markers in soils irrigated with treated wastewater, (2) identify and quantify the soil-antibiotic interactions that induce persistence and horizontal transfer of AR genes among soil bacteria, and (3) elucidate key reactive processes controlling the amplification of AR in soils that receive a mix of antibiotics and AR bacteria in polluted water. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge about the AR attenuation capacity of soil ecosystems under the continuous infiltration of antibiotic polluted wastewater. To implement the educational and mentoring goals of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator proposes (PI) to leverage existing programs and resources at Texas A&M University to (i) engage students in the design, implementation, and deployment of a human-like dynamic conversation interface (educational chatbot), and (ii) use the educational chatbot to promote interactive communication between virtual STEM scholars and K-12 student audiences. The PI plans to build upon these educational activities to design and implement new pedagogical frameworks that foster equal participation and a sense of belonging among all students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People, however, often misunderstand or remain unmotivated to change behavior. This project investigates best methods to present quantifiable health risks to increase comprehension and healthy behaviors. Doing so is important to the nation?s health given growing efforts to discuss statistical risks with patients and patients? greater access to statistical information about diseases, treatments, and preventives. How statistics are presented can matter as much as what statistics are presented. A theory-based taxonomy of effective risk formats is developed to better communicate risks and improve decisions, potentially improving societal well being by increasing patient autonomy, avoiding harms of aggressive treatments, improving quality of life, and saving money and lives. The research team integrates this knowledge into ongoing science-communication trainings in the Center for Science Communication Research. They also will increase public science literacy and engagement through lay-friendly pieces and by training physicians and policymakers in evidence-based communication methods.<br/><br/>Five studies increase understanding of psychological mechanisms underlying health decisions involving numeric information. Novel tests of formats to communicate numeric health risks are designed to alter psychological mechanisms through affective meaning (i.e., feelings of goodness or badness about risk numbers); 2) focusing attention; or 3) changing cognitive effort. Systematically varying risk formats allows for tests of dual-process theories and development of a theory-based taxonomy of risk formats in low- and high-affect settings. Good decisions are identified primarily through increased risk comprehension and sensitivity to risk numbers where sensitivity is defined either as distinguishing sensibly between numeric levels?e.g., perceiving more risk from a 22% than 7% chance?or weighting statistics more in the presence of narrative content. Findings illuminate how people integrate affect to health outcomes and to risk statistics. The research has theoretical and pragmatic implications in medical decisions and science communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fundamental ideas and concepts such as information, entropy, chaos and fractals have had a profound impact on our understanding of the world. Dynamical systems and ergodic theory have developed superb tools with applications to sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics, for example, has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is a highly developed, ancient yet superbly active field in mathematics. It studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogs, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces. Surveying the land for his principality, Gauss developed the fundamental notions of geodesics and curvature, laying the groundwork for modern differential geometry. It has close links with physics and applied areas like computer vision or the more current geometric and topological data analysis. Geometry and dynamics are closely connected. Indeed, important dynamical systems such as the geodesic flow come from geometry, and conversely one can use geometric tools to study dynamics. One main goal of this project is to study symmetries of dynamical systems, especially when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. The quest is to study these systems via unexpected symmetries. Important examples arise from geometry when the space contains many flat subspaces.  Under additional assumptions, one can classify such spaces. Finally, group theory is introduced in both dynamics and geometry via the group of symmetries of a geometry or dynamical system. The principal investigator will continue training a new generation of researchers in mathematics, and students at all levels in their mathematical endeavors. This project includes support for research training opportunities for graduate students and summer research experiences for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This project will investigate rigidity phenomena in geometry and dynamics, especially actions of higher rank abelian and semi-simple Lie groups and their lattices. The latter is part of the Zimmer program. Particular emphasis will be put on hyperbolic actions of such groups. As higher-rank semisimple Lie groups and their lattices contain higher-rank abelian groups, the classification and rigidity problems for the abelian and semi-simple cases are closely related, with abundant cross-fertilization. The goal is the classification of such actions. Closely related are the study of automorphism groups of geometric structures.  A further goal is to understand topological joinings of lattice actions on Furstenberg boundaries and the related problem of classifying discrete subgroups in semisimple ie groups with higher Prasad-Rapinchuk rank. Investigations in geometry will address higher-rank Riemannian manifolds and their classification, introducing novel methods. The dynamics of geodesic and frame flows will also be studied, with investigations of discrete subgroups of Lie groups for rank rigidity and measure properties. Besides establishing new results, the principal investigator also strives to find and introduce novel methods for investigating these problems which will lend themselves to applications in other areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These compounds mainly come from aromatic amino acids (AAAs), which are produced from atmospheric carbon fixed by photosynthesis in plants. Normally, plants direct a small percentage of total fixed carbon towards AAAs, however, the principal investigator?s group has recently re-engineered the AAA synthesis pathway to use a much larger percentage of carbon from the Calvin-Benson cycle. This project investigates how carbon fixed by the Calvin-Benson cycle in photosynthesis flows through plant metabolic networks to produce AAAs and how plants adjust these carbon fluxes under different environmental conditions. The foundational knowledge gained about the system-level properties of plant metabolism allows the use of plants as an alternative platform to produce various aromatic compounds sustainably. The project recruits and trains students from diverse backgrounds and engages them directly in discovery-based systems biology research. In this way the next generation scientists acquire a broader understanding of complex plant metabolic systems.<br/><br/>The shikimate pathway in plants is a central gateway directing carbon flux from the Calvin-Benson Cycle (CBC) of photosynthesis to biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (AAAs). The principal investigator?s lab recently discovered novel genetic mutations that drastically enhance carbon flux to AAA biosynthesis via the shikimate and novel ?non-shikimate? pathways. These mutants also elevate carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation at the CBC. This project quantifies systems-wide carbon fluxes from the CBC to AAA biosynthesis and elucidates how the metabolic network of the CBC and parallel AAA pathways can flexibly produce AAAs under genetic and environmental perturbations. The project utilizes novel genetic mutants with integrated short to mid-term carbon-13 labeled CO2 feeding and metabolic flux modeling, together with biochemical and genetic analyses. The study re-defines the critical metabolic network connecting CO2 fixation and diverse aromatic production in plants. Quantitative understanding of this integrated metabolic system will enable sustainable production of diverse aromatic compounds, while efficiently capturing and sequestering CO2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is an urgent need for adaptation responses that positively impact the food security of physically and socioeconomically marginalized families. Yet, there remains a significant gap in the integration of community knowledges with climate science to mobilize climate change adaptation responses. This project will consider how interdisciplinary community-based design for climate literacy can enact sustainable climate change adaptation extending beyond schools. This research work aims to create impacts on climate smart gardening, child health and well-being, and intergenerational climate literacy in a collaborative, sustainable, systems-focused process guided by contributions from multiple stakeholders working alongside the research team. Project outcomes will bring together ecoregional climate forecasting, climate-smart localized practices, and climate-smart extra-local literacies to impact the health and wellbeing of children from marginalized communities in South Africa.<br/><br/>This project centers community-based and culturally responsive solutions integrating Indigenous and Local Ecological Knowledges (ILEK). This project will develop climate smart Indigenous food gardens in primary schools in three South African ecoregions located in the KwaZulu/Natal, Gauteng, and Limpopo provinces. The research design integrates four co-designed thematic research activities: 1) interventions on child health and well-being in the nutritional, climate literacy and land relations areas, 2) development of climate-smart Indigenous food gardens that integrate ILEK and climate modeling, 3) interventions on intergenerational climate literacy, and 4) development of a scalable model for trans-sectoral, community-based climate anticipatory responses through small scale gardening. By situating participation in gardening practices within community-embedded schools, this project fosters climate responsive communities while building intergenerational climate literacy that brings interdisciplinary agricultural and climate science knowledge together with ILEK. Stakeholders contributing to co-design, implementation and knowledge mobilization at each site include children and caregivers, ILEK keepers, school partners, NPO and NGO collaborators, traditional leaders, and provincial and national South African governmental partners. A key goal of this design-based project is an adaptable model for scalable ILEK-integrated climate-smart food gardening for social protection. <br/><br/>This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and funding agencies from Canada and South Africa via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition.

A major concern associated with climate change is the rapid change in salinity in both marine and freshwater habitats throughout the globe. In high latitude coastal environments, salinity is declining rapidly due to increases in precipitation and the melting of polar ice caps. These coastal environments harbor planktonic copepods, which serve as the food source for many commercial fisheries around the globe, such as herring and anchovy. As these copepods are vital for supporting fisheries and the health of ecosystems, it is crucial to determine how copepod populations evolve in response to climate change, including climate change-related salinity decline. This NSF funded research project combines the expertise of evolutionary biologists and animal physiologists to determine how the copepods evolve in response to drastic salinity changes. This study will examine how osmoregulatory (ion regulatory) functions evolve in response to salinity change and which mutations in the ion transporter genes are causing those changes. The results of this project will be used to develop models that can forecast changes in populations of copepods based on their capacity to evolve in response to salinity decline. The impacts of copepod population dynamics on the health of commercial fisheries will also be modeled. This project will also develop outreach programs to educate K-12 students and the broader public about the potential impacts of climate change on copepods, as well as help train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Climate change drives drastic changes in the global water cycle, causing the freshening of high latitude coastal habitats, especially estuaries.

Our previous studies revealed surprisingly parallel responses to rapid changes in salinity in populations of the copepod Eurytemora affinis complex, with natural selection favoring the same loci and same SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), especially ion transporter genes. This project integrates physiological and evolutionary approaches to accomplish five goals: 1) determine how the functions of ion transporter alleles are evolving and 2) discover allelic combinations that enhance ion transport function and 3) maximize fitness (survival, reproduction) in response to salinity and temperature change.

This study will broaden our understanding of understudied ion transport mechanisms, such as Na+/H+ antiporters (SLC9B), and link physiological functions of ion transporter alleles with fitness effects, revealing how selection on beneficial alleles will impact population demography. Moreover, this study will yield novel insights into how selection acts on polygenic traits, particularly on how selection on cooperating alleles and their epistatic interactions could help drive rates of adaptation in the face of rapid habitat change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To manage a device?s hardware resources (such as CPUs, GPUs, memory, and networking) in the presence of multiple running programs, OSes have so far relied on manually crafted heuristic policies that make broad assumptions about the applications that are likely to run and the environment in which they operate. Recently, there have been shifts in computer hardware technology and usage such as new CPU types, heterogeneous accelerators, and novel applications with complex changing needs running on the cloud and emerging platforms such as robots, autonomous vehicles, and edge computing. Unfortunately, heuristic policies, lacking complex and rich reasoning, work poorly with these advancements and result in poor performance and inefficient use. This has led to degraded user experience and higher costs. Manually customizing heuristic policies to meet the needs brought to the fore by each advancement is time-consuming, expensive, and ultimately untenable given rapid innovation. The Learning Directed Operating System Expedition (LDOS) aims to usher in a principled and sustainable solution to these challenges. LDOS is a next-generation OS that offers: (1) intrinsic intelligence?where advanced machine learning (ML) makes resource management decisions that maximize performance and efficiency, and (2) auto-adaptation?where the OS adapts to different settings with minimal human intervention.  LDOS seeks a transformative impact on society by improving performance and decreasing inefficiencies and costs associated with new technologies. It could enable the creation of innovative and affordable computing devices, such as consumer-grade robots that assist humans in their day-to-day activities akin to smartphones today. LDOS could significantly improve the energy efficiency of large-scale cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. LDOS can pave the way for smart cities and factories by enabling novel real-time edge computing applications. LDOS?s auto-adaptation enables future devices to gracefully cope with unexpected changes (e.g., robots deployed in more crowded environments) without requiring extensive re-engineering.<br/><br/>The LDOS Expedition, involving and fundamentally advancing multiple disciplines in computer science,  rethinks OS design with ML-driven resource management at its center.  LDOS offers a new class of ML-based policies driven by rich run-time data and trained using diverse synthetic data, building on fundamental advances in generative AI and ML algorithms. To ensure LDOS meets a wide range of application and system-level needs, ML model training will leverage verified learning, a novel integration of ML with formal verification techniques. LDOS?s ML-centric OS interfaces and abstractions will enable easy integration and automatic adaptation of ML policies, low-overhead ML-based decisions, and security and manageability. The project involves close collaboration with industry partners to create the open-source LDOS implementation and demonstrate compelling use cases such as autonomous personal robots, efficient and dependable cloud computing, and real-time cellular access edge computing. In addition to building an LDOS, the Expedition will leverage the popularity of ML to reboot excitement in computer systems and create a new curriculum around the interplay of computer systems and ML. The project?s initiatives for broadening participation are designed to cultivate leadership among underrepresented groups in ML and computer systems by offering tailored programs at different educational levels from middle school to higher education. This ensures participants are well-prepared for ML and computer systems technology and research careers, benefiting hundreds to thousands of students each year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Host body mass should shape immune defenses because it likely affects aspects of pathogen exposure, detection, and defense activation. Neutrophils are innate antimicrobial cells critical to the outcome of infections in mammals. Although elephants have disproportionately more neutrophils than mice given their relative body masses, it is unknown whether an elephant?s neutrophil provides the same defenses as a mouse?s during a bacterial challenge. How neutrophil antibacterial responses and associated gene expression and energetics are related to an animal?s body mass will be investigated in terrestrial mammals with body masses spanning a range from a few grams (such as a mouse) to several hundred kilograms (such as an elephant). Such a broad understanding of mammalian neutrophil functions can enhance disease-spread models by providing predictions about the level of immune defense expected in species never before studied. Participants will develop museum displays for a local museum of science and technology in Syracuse, NY, that collaborates in educational activities for every 8th-grader in the diverse Syracuse City school district, exposing students from groups underrepresented in STEM to science at a critical age. The team will also teach local middle-school students to use microscopes in scientific inquiry. These activities will demonstrate how comparative research is important for understanding human and animal physiology and health.<br/><br/>This research project tests specific hypotheses about how neutrophil antibacterial responses vary with body mass. Previous studies raise the question whether a disproportionately greater neutrophil concentration in large mammals conveys additional immune protection or compensates for less effective killing by a single neutrophil. Specifically, the team will assess how neutrophil antibacterial functions change with body mass in 20 species of terrestrial mammals spanning 7 orders of magnitude in size. The neutrophil activities to be characterized include direct killing, phagocytosis, metabolic changes and reactive oxygen species generation, and neutrophil extracellular traps and associated changes in gene expression. How the metabolic rates of neutrophil extracellular traps change with body mass in neutrophils from 11 species of primates spanning 5 orders of magnitude in size will also be measured. Immune defenses will be quantified against a strain of Escherichia coli, a ubiquitous, zoonotic pathogen that poses a serious threat to industrial agriculture and human and non-human animals, including wildlife, proximal to these production sites. The team?s work addresses two Grand Challenges in Organismal Biology ? how genomes become phenomes and how organisms maintain stability through change ? and will advance understanding how body size constrains the evolution of innate immune defense processes in vertebrates. Through an unprecedented comparative approach, the research promises to transform how scientists think about host-parasite interactions. The project will make available transcriptomic data and a database of images of neutrophil defenses that could be valuable for other systems biology and immune defense studies. In addition, training of postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate and graduate students across the three collaborating institutions will contribute to workforce development.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the BIO-IOS-Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program and the Symbiosis, Infection, and Immunity Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Selected from urban settings, the intent of this project is to inspire and support high school students and matriculating STEM undergraduate majors to return to their communities as teachers. Urban settings are characterized by poorly equipped school leaders, underachieving students, students from low-income families, high concentrations of unlicensed teachers, and dismal teacher retention rates. A potentially sustainable solution is to create a circuit of prospective teachers who are familiar with these challenges, intrinsically motivated, and ""fit"" by their conscious decision to teach. When ""fit"" is the focus of teacher recruitment, teacher shortages are likely to decrease. Additionally, without the support of a STEM teacher workforce, promises for the Nation?s future economic prosperity may be threatened. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to use early field experiences, self-assessments, reflection, and high-quality mentoring to shape positive interest in teaching by highlighting personal and social benefits, building confidence, diminishing misconceptions, and providing tutorial and financial support to teacher candidates from admission to early career stages. <br/><br/>This project at Norfolk State University includes partnerships with two historically Black high schools within different urban districts. Project goals include a measurable increase in program completers and an executable plan to reduce program barriers. In addition, this project will provide scholarships to enable 15 high-achieving students to complete Bachelor of Science degrees in areas such as math, physics, biology, and chemistry and a state-issued teaching license over 5 years. This graduation rate will help position the University to be one of the top producers of STEM teachers in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Furthermore, the project aims to use qualitative techniques to answer questions such as: What is the efficacy of the integration of AI-enhanced applications for proficiency exam preparation? Overall, the research will extend the literature on teacher-job fit (i.e., the degree to which a teacher possesses job satisfaction, habits of mind, knowledge, and skills needed to persist in the profession). Formative and summative evaluations with feedback loops will be conducted by MN Associates, Inc. and used to make programmatic improvements. Results will be disseminated to participating districts, the Virginia Department of Education, the Council for the Accreditation of Education, and University councils. On a wider scale, conference presentations will be made regionally and/or nationally/internationally (e.g., UTeach Summer Conferences, Noyce Annual Conferences, Regional NSF Meetings, Virginia Association of Science Teachers Conferences, Virginia Council of Teacher Educators Conferences, and the Association of Teacher Educators Conference). This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

The same holds true for birds; when deciding where to place a nest, both the characteristics of the tree, and the surrounding area are important. However, these characteristics ? including neighborhood size and its environmental features ? are unknown for the majority of bird species. And yet, our ability to predict where species are currently found and where they are likely to be in the future depends on understanding why birds use the places they do. The project proposed here seeks to understand the characteristics of the environmental neighborhoods that shape where birds occur across North America, then test hypotheses as to why birds are found in their respective neighborhoods. Results from this work will be valuable to society because understanding how species respond to their surroundings can help us use wildlife management resources more effectively, and improve our predictions of how species may respond to future environmental change. This CAREER project will also train the next generation of ecologists in ecological data science. The overarching goal of this work is to deepen our understanding of the relationships between birds and their environments and enable improved decision-making to ensure the survival of species for future generations.<br/><br/>Scale-dependence, where patterns observed at one scale may be different when observed at another scale, has long been acknowledged but largely omitted from investigations of species-environment relationships. The study of scale-dependence in species? response to the environment has only recently become feasible with advances in remote sensing and specialized analytics. This project aims to describe and understand the basis of variation in species? scales of effect (SoE), the spatial scales at which species respond to facets of the environment, using a massive, citizen science bird observation database. The research objectives of this proposal are to: 1) characterize SoE for hundreds of North American breeding birds; 2) test prevailing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms generating SoE; and 3) define a scaling algorithm to predict species? SoE. Objectives of this project will be accomplished through multi-scale analyses, graduate-level ecological data science learning experiences, and undergraduate research. We will compile project results on species-specific SoE within an interactive dashboard to provide wildlife managers with information on the optimal scales at which species respond to the environment. This dashboard of results will also serve as a dataset to begin fundamental research into the selective pressures shaping SoE, and how variation in SoE may constrain species? response to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond their use in observing the environment, underwater robots can be used in marine resource exploration or maintenance and construction of marine engineering structures, through the integration of underwater vehicles with robotic manipulators. Lightweight underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS) are characterized by small-sized vehicles and electric manipulators, with the weight of the manipulator comparable with the weight of the vehicle. These types of underwater robots are essential to lowering the barriers of entry to ocean exploration and science, representing a radical change from the current marine research and intervention practices. The main challenges of lightweight UVMS that hinder their widespread applicability are: 1) the stability issues encountered due to the interaction (coupling) effects between the manipulator and vehicle, and also due to the contact with the environment; 2) the uncertainties in the hydrodynamics; and 3) their lack of robustness due to low underwater visibility or unforeseen events caused by environmental conditions. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to design autonomous UVMS capabilities robust and reliable to unforeseen events observed by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), advancing the autonomy capabilities of lightweight UVMS and proving their value for ocean exploration.<br/><br/><br/>The work proposed in this project aims to showcase that: 1) marine multi-body robotic systems, like lightweight underwater-vehicle manipulator systems that operate in uncertain environments, are robust, reliable, and efficient in the context of unforeseen events if event- and model-based reactive control strategies are created; and 2) marine robotics concepts can be used to build self-esteem of students from low-income socio-economic backgrounds. To achieve these, the project will: (O.1) Create novel physics-based and data-driven dynamic models with uncertainty quantification using DVS to analyze lightweight multi-body systems in multi-scale ocean flows under uncertain conditions; (O.2) Establish new probabilistic model-based control theories for lightweight UVMS governed by non-vanishing uncertainties, unknown disturbances, and multi-physics characteristics; and (O.3) Develop education and outreach activities, centered around underwater robotics and specifically UVMS, for college students, low-income K-12 students, and the general public to demonstrate the impact marine robotics can have in their lives.

Viral pathogens face the challenge of having to replicate and transmit within host populations that have immunity developed through prior infections or, in some cases, vaccination. Understanding how viruses respond to this challenge gives insight into how best to design and implement vaccination strategies. Some viruses, including influenza viruses, have developed the ability to rapidly evolve their targets of host immunity as a means to overcome the problem. This evolution in the face of host immunity is unpredictable and superficially understood. The research will include a combination of laboratory and mathematical approaches to explore the interplay between influenza virus evolution and vaccination done by a team of international researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. This research will provide training of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, and important insights for policymakers in the fields of avian health, public health, and veterinary management.<br/><br/>The recent emergence of clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5N1) influenza viruses across Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America is unprecedented in terms of the scope of hosts and countries impacted. Birds that carry virus-neutralizing antibodies induced through vaccination or natural exposure are believed to be the key drivers of avian influenza virus evolution. The investigators propose to elucidate the repercussions of vaccine-driven evolutionary changes of A(H5N1) viruses to encompass virus epidemiology, antigenic landscape, transmission dynamics, host-range and pathogenesis. The main objectives will: (1) measure the antigenic diversity of recent A(H5) viruses, (2) identify A(H5) viruses evolved from vaccine protection, and (3) assess the transmission, host-range, and pathogenesis of the evolved A(H5) viruses.

SPEEDI<br/>would be able to provide 1P imaging at depth with cellular precision without surgical removal, and it would<br/>enable depth-resolved use of 1P-optimized indicators, including the next generation voltage indicators. As<br/>SPEEDI is based on utilizing a new type of optical field, all of the advantages afforded from using twophoton<br/>and three-photon sources would also apply, e.g., further enhancement of penetration depth and<br/>signal-to-background ratio.

This level of<br/>exquisite control of the spatiotemporal properties will permit the introduction of ultra-high group-velocity<br/>dispersion (GVD) into the space-time wave packets (STWP), which will broaden rapidly on a controllable<br/>length scale even in free space or a low-GVD medium. Therefore, by first introducing group-delay<br/>dispersion (GDD) into the initial generic pulse used to synthesize the STWP, the GVD enables the temporal<br/>focusing of the pulse at a prescribed depth.

This study explores the evolution of bellflowers (in the plant family Campanulaceae) as a model to understand the processes that have shaped the biodiversity of this region. The bellflowers are particularly diverse in the Mediterranean, where there are over 350 species. About half of the species are unique to the region and some are threatened with extinction. Biologists and anthropologists will work together to determine the role of human impact as one of the potential factors leading to current bellflower species distribution patterns.

This Designing and Testing Innovations project addresses the need for diverse approaches to render computing accessible and developmentally appropriate for young children, while actively integrating their linguistic, cultural, and communal identities. Targeting young, rural, and indigenous students, this initiative aims to develop and research the effectiveness of portable maker carts equipped with developmentally appropriate computational activities. These carts are designed to foster computational thinking skills and cultivate interest in STEM among participants. The design of the carts combines hands-on making activities commonly found in early childhood classrooms with tangible computing tasks, ensuring cultural relevance and developmental appropriateness (for instance, incorporating e-textiles and squishy circuits for weaving patterns, interactive play, and storytelling). Students will engage in projects to create their own interactive, culturally linked weaving patterns using conductive playdough, electronic textiles materials, LED lights, and micro-controllers. Simultaneously, they will be introduced to the types of jobs that require computing knowledge. Through this approach, young children will learn about cause and effect, patterns, and sequencing in a manner that is connected to culturally significant practices, such as Navajo rug weaving, while also being exposed to computing and engineering professions. The project will be collaboratively undertaken by the Red Mesa Unified School District on the Navajo Nation in Arizona's Four Corners area, along with learning scientists from Utah State University and Boston College. <br/><br/>The proposed maker carts, coupled with associated computing curriculum and teacher professional development, will serve as a model for designing tangible, developmentally and culturally appropriate computing experiences for young children. Project research will use quantitative and qualitative approaches rooted in community-based and design-based research paradigms. The research will investigate: (1) how to foster school and community partnerships with university researchers, early childhood educators, children, and parents that support co-design of education programs and (2) how culturally responsive making practices using innovative technologies can foster computational thinking and career concepts among young Navajo and rural participants using Maker carts with computer science activities. In its research phase, the project will reach 9 early childhood educators and 100 Navajo children in the rural Red Mesa Unified School District.

The research team will use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) in combination with hyperpolarization of the nuclear spins of the water molecules, to provide strong signals highlighting the molecular interactions of proteins and their environs. The discoveries obtained with these methods are anticipated to further the understanding of protein dynamics and of folding pathways related to chaperone function. The project will provide a venue for researchers, including students and postdocs, to exchange the research results through joint international meetings on NMR, nuclear spin hyperpolarization, and protein biophysics, organized by the collaborating institutions.<br/><br/>The transfer of nuclear spin polarization from hyperpolarized water is highly dependent on solvent accessibility and molecular motions of the hydration shell and the macromolecule. The roles played by conformational flexibility and binding interactions in the transfer of water hyperpolarization through the backbones and side chains of folded and unfolded proteins will be characterized. The measurement of polarization transfer dynamics using selective NMR experiments will reveal elusive aspects about the roles of NH, OH, and SH-based inter-residue bonds, on the hydrogen bonding of structural waters, and the exclusion of water molecules in rapid folding phenomena. The exchangeable protons involved in these interactions are frequently NMR invisible but play an important role in protein folding and dynamics. Their properties will be accessed through the measurement of exchange and cross-relaxation phenomena as highlighted by the hyperpolarization transfer. In parallel, NMR methods will be developed to enable the use of spin hyperpolarization transferred from water to study large macromolecules. These approaches include the application of relaxation-optimized spectroscopy with ultrafast gradient-encoded 2D NMR methods employing water hyperpolarization. On this basis, the folding-induced dynamic and structural changes imparted by chaperones in large complexes with guest proteins will be characterized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging applications ? such as capable artificial intelligence, immersive virtual realities, and pervasive sensor systems ? drive unprecedented demand for computer systems that offer scalable performance and environmental sustainability. Despite recent advances to achieve net zero carbon emissions, the computing industry?s gross energy usage continues to rise at an alarming rate, outpacing the growth of new energy installations and renewable energy deployments. The Carbon Connect Expedition is a multi-institutional, five-year research initiative that builds the foundations for sustainable computing. This shift towards sustainability could spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed, leading to a more responsible and sustainable approach to advancing computing technologies. By redefining the way computer scientists consider environmental sustainability, Carbon Connect will establish new standards for carbon accounting in the computing industry, thereby influencing future energy policy and legislation. By fostering an interdisciplinary community of researchers dedicated to sustainable computing, Carbon Connect will train the next generation of innovators in the combined fields of computer science, electrical engineering, environmental science, and energy policy. By creating an academic-industry consortium, Carbon Connect will accelerate the adoption of sustainable computing practices. Finally, by organizing workshops and curricula, Carbon Connect will educate future leaders in computer science and engineering.<br/> <br/><br/>The Carbon Connect Expedition re-thinks computing?s infrastructure, from semiconductor chips to hyperscale datacenters. Embodied carbon arises from a hardware component?s entire lifecycle, including its manufacture, transportation, and eventual disposal. This aspect of the Expedition seeks to minimize the environmental impact of producing semiconductor chips, which are fundamental to all electronic devices but come with a high carbon cost. Operational carbon, on the other hand, arises from energy consumed during a hardware component?s operational life. Given rapidly increasing energy demands from global datacenters that power the Internet, cloud services, and the emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence, addressing operational emissions at datacenter scale is particularly important. The Carbon Connect Expedition seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of information and communication technology by pursuing three main objectives. First, the Expedition will create transparent and accurate carbon accounting methods, which will include standardized protocols for measuring and reporting carbon as well as techniques for overcoming inconsistent estimates and broad error margins. Second, it will develop innovative tools and strategies for reducing computing?s carbon footprint by 45% within the next decade. These innovations will include the exploration of energy-efficient hardware design, advanced hardware recycling and disposal strategies to minimize embodied carbon, and the intelligent use of renewable energy to reduce operational carbon from datacenters. Third, the Carbon Connect Expedition will coordinate the design and management of future computer systems to sustainability deliver performance for artificial intelligence and virtual reality systems. This coordination will allow computer scientists and engineers to balance embodied and operational carbon, which cannot often be reduced simultaneously and require intelligent compromises. Together, these technical objectives will ensure continued advances in computational performance and capability yet ensure environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Allosteric modulation, also known as allosteric control, involves regulating protein function by binding an effector molecule to a site that is distinct from the active site. Allostery represents a fundamental phenomenon crucial to understanding protein function and regulation. Given the central role of allosteric proteins in many diseases, the exploitation of allosteric modulation holds tremendous potential in drug discovery, particularly in targeting allosteric proteins, which remains a significant challenge. The proposed research promises to have a significant impact not only on computational chemistry, but also on related disciplines such as biochemistry, biophysics, and medicinal chemistry. Moreover, this research will contribute to training members of the next generation of and there will also be undergraduate engagement in research and outreach to local high schools.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish a theoretical framework for the quantitative evaluation of how an allosteric modulator impacts its target protein through the utilization of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Grounded in fundamental thermodynamics and equilibrium theories, Cheng and his research group will first elucidate the intricate relationships between ligand binding, affinity, conformational transitions and allosteric potency and efficacy. Based on the derived theoretical framework, the research team will subsequently develop two practical computational schemes, enabling the rigorous assessment of allosteric potency and efficacy in three exemplar allosteric proteins using alchemical free energy and geometry-based potential of mean force calculations. By bridging gaps in the current understanding of allosteric regulation, the proposed research will not only advance our understanding of allosteric modulation but also potentially establish a foundation for the rational engineering of allosteric proteins and the design of allosteric drugs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the increased demand for energy storage in various fields from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles, batteries have attracted more attention in the past decades. Solid-state batteries, which use non-flammable solid-state electrolytes to replace the flammable liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries, are intrinsically safe and can achieve higher energy densities with reduced manufacturing cost. The manufacturing of solid-state batteries requires electrolytes with desired properties such as high ionic conductivity, good stability against electrodes, and sufficient mechanical strength. With multiple substituting elements on the same site in the ceramic crystal, the configurational entropy is high, and these high-entropy ceramics exhibit unique and useful properties. This award supports fundamental research to process high-entropy lithium-garnet electrolytes by mixing micron-size particles and consolidating them. The availability of solid-state batteries with improved properties benefits the U.S. economy, environment, and society. This multidisciplinary project involves materials engineering, electrochemistry, and manufacturing. It broadly impacts engineering education and the community by supporting women and underrepresented minorities in research, outreach to diverse audiences, and collaboration with industrial partners.<br/><br/>Ceramic solid-state electrolyte-based solid-state batteries can fundamentally address the safety and energy density concerns in Li-ion batteries. One of the key issues in solid-state batteries is to fabricate solid-state electrolytes with desired electrochemical properties. With the concept of high-entropy which includes multiple substituting elements on the same crystal site, the project designs and fabricates high-entropy lithium (Li)-garnet ceramic electrolytes with the goal to improve the ionic conductivity. Due to the complexity of the chemical formula of high-entropy Li-garnet, principles to incorporate appropriate elements are planned to be developed. With the hypothesis that proper multiple substituting elements can influence the crystallographic structures and microstructures, samples based on these design principles are experimentally fabricated by ball-milling stoichiometric amounts of the materials. These materials are then calcinated, comminuted to reduce the particle size, compacted into pellets, and sintered to near full density. The high entropy Li-garnet ceramic solid-state electrolyte materials are characterized for microstructure and electrochemical behavior to fundamentally correlate the design-processing-structure-property relationship. This research plans to fill the knowledge gap in the chemical formula designing principles of high-entropy ceramic electrolytes for desired electrochemical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While all forms of mercury are toxic, monomethyl mercury (MMHg) is especially problematic because it becomes highly concentrated in fish consumed by humans. Given the health implications for people it is critically important to understand MMHg cycling in the ocean, but the fundamental processes that govern MMHg entrainment from seawater to the base of the food web are not yet sufficiently understood. This project will study MMHg in natural phytoplankton and test hypotheses about the mechanisms and controls on MMHg uptake. The study will occur on the shelf of the Western North Atlantic Ocean and in its estuaries, a region of productive fisheries. Seasonal and geographical changes in biological productivity and plankton community structure will serve as a ?natural laboratory? for testing hypotheses on the factors that control MMHg uptake. The project will provide training and research opportunities through paid internships and summer programs for undergraduate students. Two graduate students, one at the University of Connecticut and one at the University of Rhode Island, will be trained. The team will conduct outreach activities in collaboration with the Yale Peabody Museum to share marine MMHg science with a variety of museum audiences. <br/><br/>Researchers from the University of Connecticut, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Rhode Island, and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will collaborate on this study with the overarching goal of studying MMHg in natural phytoplankton and testing current assertions that cell size and dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] act as major controls over MMHg uptake in phytoplankton and investigate other mechanisms. Additional hypotheses that will be tested include: 1) phytoplankton that employ heterotrophy take up more MMHg, and 2) faster plankton growth lowers cellular MMHg. Novel data such as cellular quota, biomass-based concentrations, and volume concentration factors for MMHg in pico, nano, and microplankton will be obtained through MMHg analysis of sequentially filtered plankton, characterized for their size and taxonomic properties by flow cytometry and image analyses and machine learning algorithms. Through year-round sampling in estuaries, the team will also investigate how MMHg concentrations that should be representative of the phytoplankton are influenced by MMHg bound to nonplanktonic particles. The project research will leverage spring and fall research cruises and data collection of the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) and NOAA?s Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) programs. MMHg data will be synthesized statistically and graphically. Some spatial patterns in MMHg of the plankton will be shared as surface maps. Depth profiles of unfiltered MMHg and total Hg concentrations will also be studied. The data gained through this research will be useful for comparing laboratory-derived concentration factors and model-generated predictions in the study region. Results generated in this research will be helpful for MMHg modeling efforts, and the approach may be adapted to studies in other ecosystems or for other metals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While even heuristic connections can be fruitful, mirror symmetry provides a fascinating direct connection, originating from modern physics, between algebraic geometry and symplectic topology that has led to major advances in both areas. Algebraic geometry is a rich and classical field of mathematics that explores shapes called algebraic varieties described by polynomial equations. Symplectic topology is a younger area that studies shapes built from a geometric formalism for classical mechanics by packaging solutions to certain partial differential equations into algebraic invariants. This project aims to deepen our understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomenon by building on new insights in a special case where the algebraic varieties are particularly symmetric. This will be done with the aim of verifying new cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture, exploring structural aspects of a symplectic invariant known as the Fukaya category, and investigating arithmetic aspects of mirror symmetry. The project will also involve undergraduate research projects on combinatorial problems coming from mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The first technical goal of the project is to further develop functorial aspects of the toric homological mirror symmetry equivalence by enlarging the list of sheaves and functors that can be provably described in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds and geometric operations on them. These geometric functors will give a better understanding of homological mirror symmetry for singular varieties obtained by gluing toric varieties along toric strata, which can then be deformed to obtain new cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture. In the other direction, the project will seek to leverage the geometric flexibility of the Fukaya category to construct new group actions on derived categories of toric varieties. The project will also aim to determine when symplectic fibrations can be described in terms of cornered Liouville sectors resulting in a gluing formula for their Fukaya categories. Finally, the project will explore the extent to which the toric Frobenius morphism and its simple geometric description on the mirror can be extended to other classes of varieties with an eye towards generation time in the derived category.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Topology and Geometric Analysis program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tsunamis are among the most significant ways in which the ocean impacts human civilization. With the increasing population density along coastlines and the global rise in sea levels, the potential for tsunamis to cause unprecedented harm is higher than ever. The proposed product providing enhanced wave height and arrival time maps to its customers could provide significantly more timely alerts to at-risk populations, providing them with essential evacuation information and crucial hours to prepare for approaching waves. This could herald a major shift in tsunami preparedness and resilience. This technology offers wide-ranging benefits for various groups and industries such as small island economies, defense operations, and commercial port operators.<br/><br/><br/>To develop these capabilities, this project proposes a buoy-deployable software product that takes advantage of new generations of Global Positioning System (GPS) to detect tsunamis at sea, hours before they make landfall. It will use revolutionary advancements in GPS technology, particularly in vertical accuracy, to detect, prepare for, and mitigate the formidable threat of tsunamis. For the first time, new generations of GPS provide sufficient resolution to detect the subtle vertical displacement of the ocean surface caused by passing tsunami waves with a single receiver even in open ocean.  The project will focus on the development of novel methods of signal classification using Dense Neural Network (DNN) and optimize them with rapid Machine Learning (ML) methods.

Synthetic and engineering biology approaches have huge potential to deliver on this challenge. A major opportunity for increasing the yields and resilience of major global crops such as rice and wheat lies in enhancing their ability to assimilate carbon dioxide, from which plants make sugars and starch for growth. This project enhances carbon dioxide assimilation in crops by endowing them with a specialized cellular compartment called the pyrenoid that has naturally evolved in eukaryotic algae and some lower land plants but is not present in crops. Here, as a key step towards this goal, this project advances the basic understanding of the principles that underlie the assembly and architecture of pyrenoids and leverages this understanding to build a functional synthetic pyrenoid-based carbon dioxide-concentrating mechanism into the model land plant Arabidopsis. The basic knowledge gained from this project has the potential to enable crops with greater yields, nitrogen-use efficiency, water-use efficiency and climate resilience. Additionally, the project is providing learning experiences for trainees and serves as a stepping stone toward the next stage of their careers. Trainees from the laboratories are participating in multiple outreach efforts.<br/><br/>The project is focused on dissecting key aspects of the pyrenoid-based CO2-concentrating mechanisms in vitro and in silico. Specifically, this project combines cutting-edge synthetic biology approaches using proteoliposome assemblies, liquid-like phase separated condensates, plant engineering, and modelling to advance the mechanistic understanding of CO2 uptake in organisms with pyrenoid-based CO2-concentrating mechanisms. These approaches are also used to enhance the capacity to modify plants to improve photosynthesis. Aim 1 is focused on reconstituting and characterizing tubule biogenesis in vitro and in silico. Aim 2 is focused on reconstituting a functional pyrenoid-based CO2-concentrating mechanism in vitro. Aim 3 is focused on developing synthetic approaches for establishing a CO2-leakage barrier.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), where NSF funds the US investigator and BBSRC funds the partners in the UK.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The emergence of such devices promises to revolutionize biotechnology in areas as diverse as health care and biomanufacturing. Concomitantly, these devices could provide opportunities to address fundamental scientific questions through a ""learning by building"" approach, including the search for the origins of life. One of the defining characteristics of biological systems is their ability to grow and divide. Previous attempts to construct self-replicating synthetic systems have demonstrated either the duplication of genetic information or the growth and division of cell-like compartments. Using the toolkit of biological nanotechnology, this project builds a new type of engineered self-replicating system that can grow, divide, and replicate their genetic information. Bottom-up construction of synthetic cells with these capabilities would bring us a step closer to applications to problems requiring prolonged, self-sustaining operation. In addition to its scientific goal, this project catalyzes long-term synergies between the UK and US research teams, and more generally between the synthetic biology, nanotechnology and biophysics communities operating in the two countries.<br/><br/>Toward the goal of recapitulating cell replication in a minimal system of molecular components, the UK-US team is constructing a new type of synthetic cell in which nucleic acids are used as both the primary structural element and the carrier of genetic information. These synthetic cells form and grow from RNA building blocks, which in turn are transcribed from a DNA ""genome"". Division and genome segregation result from phase separation, while genome replication is supported by reverse transcription. Because the nucleic acid nanostructures play both structural and genetic roles, the desired synergy between genetic replication, segregation, compartment growth, and division naturally occur, making these potential devices capable of supporting all key stages of cell replication. Through the construction of these nucleic acid-based, self-replicating synthetic cells, the project investigates the thermodynamic and kinetic principles that allow the nucleic acid condensates to support primitive cell cycles. Examples are the interplay between reaction and diffusion rates and the strength and selectivity of molecular interactions that underlie condensation and phase separation. The technical expertise acquired through this project is broadly disseminated to diverse research communities through student exchanges, summer school instructions, and research symposia.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), where NSF funds the US investigator and BBSRC funds the partners in the UK.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of people?s curiosity include artistic creativity, technological progress, and scientific discovery.  Despite the importance of curiosity, there have, until recently, been relatively few advances in our scientific understanding of the nature of curiosity itself, of its theoretical characterization, of the conditions that promote or thwart it, and of its direct consequences.  Current theories of curiosity embrace two different and seemingly incompatible ideas. On the one hand, curiosity is strongly goal directed and reward oriented; it beckons individuals toward the tantalizing goal of the almost-known solution. On the other hand, curiosity is goal averse; it lures individuals away from the beaten path, spurning nearer rewards, and tempting individuals to explore novel territory. Both of these views about curiosity are compelling, yet they also seem irreconcilable.  This project tests an alternative characterization, which is compatible with both views, that curiosity is an attentional state that highlights and is selectively sensitive to discrepancies. A person in such a state would be more likely to detect errors (including their own errors), and to embrace new information.  Hence, curiosity puts people in a perfect position to learn. This research tests the hypothesis that curiosity is associated with an attentional state that amplifies error detection and promotes learning.  In addition to the planned research, there are complementary activities related to providing rigorous research opportunities for trainees and outreach through school partnerships.<br/><br/>A series of planned experiments tests the hypothesis that when people are curious they are particularly sensitive to errors and that their curiosity-based detection of errors can be used to allow them to correct those errors.  Two planned experiments are directed at determining neural correlates of error-related curiosity. Other planned experiments test how curiosity-based detection and correction of errors may be leveraged to enhance learning and memory.  In past research, curiosity seemed to provide a marker that people both 'knew' that they were wrong, and that they were eager to find the correct answer.  A series of experiments, based on the finding that people are especially curious about their high confidence errors, aim to both isolate those errors and help overcome them.  The plan is to compare the effects of different methods of feedback on learning, specifically for factual questions about which people express both high knowledge and high curiosity (but on which they are wrong).  One type of planned feedback is direct correction, in which people are given the correct answer and told to learn it.  There are also plans to test both scaffolded feedback, in which people are given hints until they come up with the answers themselves, and self-sought feedback, in which people are given the opportunity to look up the answers online.  It is hypothesized that these latter, more active, kinds of feedback will produce larger and more lasting effects on learning.  Furthermore, it is hypothesized that because of people's high curiosity, they will enjoy these highly interactive methods of obtaining feedback, and the process may stimulate further curiosity and eagerness to learn.  Overall, the experiments in this project test how people's curiosity about their own errors may improve their learning and memory in a proactive, lasting, and enjoyable manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaborations are widespread amongst our nation?s top research institutions, this project focuses on better understanding the challenges and opportunities that come from inter-institutional collaboration between institutions that are very different from one another, varying with respect to infrastructure, capacity, mission, size, location, populations served, and public/private status. The project posits that widespread change and growth in the nation?s research enterprise can be accelerated via mixed-type, complementary, inter-institutional collaboration, a model that has the potential to amplify existing resources and capacity at all participating institutions. <br/><br/><br/>The Equity in Architectural Education Consortium (EAEC, est. 2018) is an eight-member, inter-institutional network that spans R1, R2, D/PU, M2, MSI, HBCU, HSI, PWI, public, private, small, medium, large, rural, suburban, and urban institution types. The EAEC?s principal initiative, the Stacked Mentorship Program cultivates a meta-mentorship community among students, faculty, staff, and professionals of color, and other underrepresented minorities in architecture, creating a framework for inter-institutional collaboration. This planning project will design a national EAEC Fellowship Program that leverages the capacities of each consortium partner while serving as an agile model for building research capacity. Each of the eight institutional leads will gather insights from across their institution, clarify, and collectively design fellowship program initiatives and projects that address the goals and functional research infrastructure needs of EAEC partners across the eight sectors in the NSF GRANTED wheel. The projected impacts include: 1) intra- and inter-institutional capacity building; 2) research on the research enterprise; and 3) improvement of research infrastructure, especially regarding emerging and minority serving institutions. This model amplifies existing resources at all participating institutions because ?plugging? gaps at one institution with complementary resources from another can protect human capital at historically under-resourced partners and allow for access to research opportunities out of the reach of a single institution. The planning project?s design process will result in a matrix of fellowship projects and initiatives that model approaches for a spectrum of research institutions to address various pathways to broadening and increasing research. This planning project spans organizations with very different resource bases (both strengths and gaps) and a broad diversity of priorities (overlapping and distinct). The project?s long-term objective is to create lasting effects by increasing the participation of historically underrepresented and under-resourced institutions and individuals in STEM, while developing a more equitable, globally competitive STEM workforce that better reflects the diverse and pluralistic composition of our nation?s research enterprise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While all forms of mercury are toxic, monomethyl mercury (MMHg) is especially problematic because it becomes highly concentrated in fish consumed by humans. Given the health implications for people it is critically important to understand MMHg cycling in the ocean, but the fundamental processes that govern MMHg entrainment from seawater to the base of the food web are not yet sufficiently understood. This project will study MMHg in natural phytoplankton and test hypotheses about the mechanisms and controls on MMHg uptake. The study will occur on the shelf of the Western North Atlantic Ocean and in its estuaries, a region of productive fisheries. Seasonal and geographical changes in biological productivity and plankton community structure will serve as a ?natural laboratory? for testing hypotheses on the factors that control MMHg uptake. The project will provide training and research opportunities through paid internships and summer programs for undergraduate students. Two graduate students, one at the University of Connecticut and one at the University of Rhode Island, will be trained. The team will conduct outreach activities in collaboration with the Yale Peabody Museum to share marine MMHg science with a variety of museum audiences. <br/><br/>Researchers from the University of Connecticut, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Rhode Island, and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will collaborate on this study with the overarching goal of studying MMHg in natural phytoplankton and testing current assertions that cell size and dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] act as major controls over MMHg uptake in phytoplankton and investigate other mechanisms. Additional hypotheses that will be tested include: 1) phytoplankton that employ heterotrophy take up more MMHg, and 2) faster plankton growth lowers cellular MMHg. Novel data such as cellular quota, biomass-based concentrations, and volume concentration factors for MMHg in pico, nano, and microplankton will be obtained through MMHg analysis of sequentially filtered plankton, characterized for their size and taxonomic properties by flow cytometry and image analyses and machine learning algorithms. Through year-round sampling in estuaries, the team will also investigate how MMHg concentrations that should be representative of the phytoplankton are influenced by MMHg bound to nonplanktonic particles. The project research will leverage spring and fall research cruises and data collection of the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) and NOAA?s Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) programs. MMHg data will be synthesized statistically and graphically. Some spatial patterns in MMHg of the plankton will be shared as surface maps. Depth profiles of unfiltered MMHg and total Hg concentrations will also be studied.

The risks to the environment and people that may be exposed to lubabegron from its use in beef production will also be determined. The research team will explore how lubabegron, which is applied as an animal feed, is broken down by beef cattle, helping to better understand the forms of the chemical that are released to the environment in animal waste. Common pathways by which lubabegron breaks down in the environment will be established and additional studies will assess the toxicity of lubabegron and its major break down products that are identified through experimental investigations. In addition to training of graduate and undergraduate students, the research team will engage in several activities that will promote awareness of lubabegron and its use among the research and environmental policy community, promote additional study of its environmental occurrence, and help to ensure a safe food system for humans and the environment.<br/> <br/>This highly collaborative project aims to produce fundamental chemical insights into the application of lubabegron in animals through microsomal metabolism studies. These studies will also probe the environmental fate of lubabegron in surface waters and soils through photolysis and soil partitioning studies. The team will conduct bioeffects assays to assess the ecological and human health hazards associated with exposure to lubabegron, its metabolites, and environmental transformation products. The project will use advanced analytical chemical tools (e.g., liquid chromatography with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, preparatory column separations, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) to isolate and characterize lubabegron metabolites and transformation products. Analytical methods development for the separation and detection of lubabegron in complex mixtures will allow a subset of experiments to be conducted at environmentally relevant concentrations in authentic environmental matrices. Bioactivity testing will use commercially available, high throughput transcription factor, nuclear receptor, and G-protein coupled receptor assays, complemented by targeted characterization of select biological endpoints using traditional in vitro approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the invaders arrived in a world already made, and they were dependent on indigenous labor to transform that world. In the early years following the invasion, Spanish clergy and administrators thus reused and adapted present settlements and buildings built under other rule. In one case colonial magistrates forcibly resettled over a million present residents into over a thousand planned colonial towns.  The production sequence and social relations of the colonial-era built environment are not well understood, as current studies have tended to focus on the varied social effects of these resettlement projects or the relative characterization of specific stylistic and structural attributes. This project places archaeometric, geospatial, ethnohistorical, and art historical approaches and data in conversation with one another to address this gap and elucidate the diversity of the lived experience under colonialism. Through local student collaboration this project provides a unique opportunity to document building construction practices, materials, and architectural forms as well as co-produce built heritage knowledge in the field, in workshops, and at outreach events. The documentation of structures required by this project is also an important step in heritage conservation, as the buildings in question face a variety of threats from development projects currently underway and may not remain undisturbed in the years to come. <br/><br/>This project focuses on one valley in which this process played out. The valley was an influential agricultural region before and after the Spanish invasion, and it boasts both a well-preserved historical documentary record and corpus of extant structures. The project collects data on change and continuity in the materials, building sequences, and contexts of construction from the Late Horizon and middle (colonial periods using a mixed methods survey approach. The targeted construction material sampling at six sites with well-preserved standing architecture complements previous seasons of fieldwork devoted to pedestrian survey, 3D modeling, and architectural attribute registry. Laboratory chemical analysis of collected building material samples such as plasters, mortars, and ceramic roof tiles reveal the raw materials, recipes, and techniques implicated in construction processes through the colonial occupational sequence. Understanding these changes reveals how colonial-era buildings, through processes of construction and maintenance, played a role in the mediation of Spanish colonialism on the local level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many regimes of interest, fluids and plasmas exhibit extremely small scales; two key examples, which are relevant to this project, are the eddies which comprise a turbulent flow and the shock wave created by an aircraft as it breaks the sound barrier. This tendency toward small scales makes both theoretical and computational questions about fluids, plasmas, and the PDEs which model them highly challenging. In particular, traditional expectations about the predictive power of the standard PDEs can be violated in these regimes: In fluids, the most standard equations support significant non-uniqueness, while in gases and plasmas, they are not strictly valid inside a shock. This project will develop a mathematical theory to understand and overcome these challenges. This project will also provide opportunities for the integration of students into the research.<br/><br/>This project will carry out two programs in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs): (1) understanding non-uniqueness phenomena as an extreme form of instability in nonlinear PDEs, especially those arising in incompressible fluid mechanics, and (2) a rigorous PDE investigation of shock structure based on collisional kinetic theory. Regarding (1), the current non-uniqueness theory comes with caveats, e.g., the non-unique Navier-Stokes solutions are either forced or conjectural with supporting numerical evidence. The project will study problems of non-uniqueness and selection principle, without these caveats, in the Allen-Cahn and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Concerning (2), the project will investigate weak kinetic shock profiles for fundamental PDEs of plasma dynamics and advance the topological approach to constructing strong kinetic shock profiles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists and engineers apply these equations to model various phenomena, including weather patterns, ocean currents, flows around vehicles, aircraft, and ships, as well as blood flow. Mathematicians and physicists believe that understanding the solutions to these equations can lead to an explanation for turbulence. Despite their wide range of applications, there is no theoretical guarantee that smooth solutions to these equations can exist for all time. Mathematically, proving whether smooth solutions to these equations without external forces exist for all time or can break down in finite time has been a longstanding open problem. The potential breakdown mechanism also remains elusive for several related equations with a wide range of applications. The goal of this research is to investigate the potential breakdown mechanism for various equations and develop analytic and numeric tools that provide a theoretical understanding of these mechanisms. This award will also provide opportunities for students to be involved in the latest developments from this research through topics courses and research projects.<br/><br/>The project aims to understand whether the incompressible 3D Euler equations and related equations could develop a finite time singularity from a smooth initial condition with finite energy. Our approach builds on PI's recent works on singularity formation in incompressible fluids and the self-similar method for finite time blowup, which consists of the following three steps. Firstly, we construct an approximate blowup profile, which can be obtained either analytically or numerically. Secondly, we impose suitable normalization conditions and prove the nonlinear stability of the approximate blowup profile. Thirdly, we choose a suitable perturbation to construct initial data with desired property and obtain finite time blowup using a rescaling relation. Additionally, the project seeks to develop a novel approach for the stability analysis in the self-similar variables that is robust enough to be applied to study a larger class of nonlinear partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The LHVCCUC LSAMP project is an extension of the LHVCCUC, an consortium comprising ten private Catholic colleges and universities across New York State (NYS). The LHVCCUC LSAMP project encompasses seven institutions: Molloy University, Manhattan College, Mount Saint Mary College, St. Francis College, St. John's University, St. Joseph's University New York, and St. Thomas Aquinas College. New York State data indicate that high school students are graduating without adequate preparation in STEM and the total number of NYS high school students is declining. This combined with a national shortage of qualified individuals to meet the demand for STEM professionals, underscores the critical need to strengthen the state's STEM pipeline. Fortifying the STEM pathway is especially crucial given NYS is home to the New York metropolitan area, recognized as one of the most racially and ethnically diverse geographic regions and the most populated metro area in the United States.<br/><br/>The LHVCCUC LSAMP project adopts intersectionality and a sense of belonging as overarching frameworks. Intersectionality provides an opportunity to understand the multi-layered identities of the students served by the LHVCCUC alliance and to design project activities that address unique marginalizing experiences for individuals facing multiple oppressions simultaneously (e.g., Women of Color in STEM dealing with racism and sexism concurrently). In higher education, a sense of belonging can refer to students' perceptions of social support within the campus environment. It encompasses feelings of connectedness, being valued, cared for, respected, and important to the campus community including faculty, staff, and peers. The LHVCCUC LSAMP project outlines four main goals: 1) Increase the enrollment of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in STEM majors; 2) Improve first-to-second-year retention; 3) Cultivate strong STEM/scientist identities through STEM enrichment activities; and 4) Support successful entry into graduate study and STEM careers. To achieve these goals, alliance-wide activities include faculty-led research experiences, peer mentoring, individual and group tutoring, workshops and seminars, and internships, among other initiatives. Given the alliance's inclusion of private Catholic Minority Serving Institutions and emerging Minority Serving Institutions in a geographically diverse region, the LHVCCUC LSAMP project uniquely adds to the knowledge base on doing this type of work and could serve as an exemplar for institutions with similar characteristics aiming to strengthen STEM pipelines for URM students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These studies are working toward improved approaches to gaining mechanistic insight into chemical transformations by probing the effects of pressure and temperature. These methods will be applied to better understand diverse systems, including liquid water from its boiling point down to supercooled conditions, aqueous solutions of electrolytes and osmolytes, and hydrogen-bonded supramolecular assemblies. The goal is to provide new insight into the driving forces of the dynamical processes in these systems by revealing the energetic and entropic barriers and enabling more intuitive and global descriptions of their behavior.  The Thompson group will generate computer codes, to be made publicly available, that will make it easier for other researchers to use these methods.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Thompson group will develop and apply theoretical methods for directly calculating activation energies and entropies for dynamical processes important in chemistry. These approaches seek to enable (i) global descriptions of dynamical timescales as a function of temperature and pressure; (ii) accelerated calculations by exploiting the connection between activation energies and timescales as a function of system energy; and (iii) rigorous, direct calculation of the activation entropy with new molecular-level insight. These approaches are based on evaluating derivatives with respect to temperature (or pressure) of the time correlation functions from which dynamical timescales, such as rate constants or diffusion coefficients, can be obtained. These derivatives are themselves time correlation functions and can be evaluated straightforwardly from the same molecular dynamics simulations. In this way, an activation energy, volume, or entropy that is normally obtained from calculations at multiple temperatures through an Arrhenius analysis can be determined from simulations at a single temperature or pressure. A key advantage is that this approach enables a rigorous decomposition of the activation energy or entropy into contributions from the interactions and motions present in the system, providing otherwise unavailable physical insight.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the large data centers that serve ML workloads are facing tremendous challenges in keeping pace with demand. Additionally, the surge in ML workload demands has positioned data centers as major contributors to annual energy consumption. This project?s goal is to develop a transformative technology to substantially improve the energy efficiency of ML systems allowing for a corresponding reduction in their carbon emissions. Existing computing platforms are fundamentally limited by the memory wall and power wall and incremental technological improvements are proving inadequate to satisfy future demand. Transformative improvements in platform technology, such as in-memory analog computing, offer a potential solution, but it faces several practical challenges to overcome before becoming commercially viable. This project aims to address several of these challenges by developing a novel computer architecture and a corresponding framework for deploying ML workloads to it. The project is aligned with established national priorities seeking to sustain economic leadership goals in artificial intelligence, computing, and nanotechnology disciplines by bringing emerging technologies and computing architectures into wide use, providing a practical alternative to current high-energy ML systems.<br/><br/>The project spans various layers of design abstraction, encompassing circuit, architecture, and computer-aided design tools. It addresses several critical aspects, including (1) the development of a novel in-memory analog computing (IMAC) architecture that realizes both matrix multiplication and nonlinear vector operations in the analog domain, (2) the design of a hierarchical analog network-on-chip to support the deployment of large ML workloads on IMAC architecture with minimal need for signal conversion from the analog domain to digital and vice versa, (3) heterogeneous integration of IMAC with existing ML hardware platforms enabling fine-grained function mapping of targeted applications on the developed heterogeneous systems, and (4) development of a fast and accurate simulation framework, incorporating lightweight solvers specifically designed to solve the nodal conductance matrices of memristive crossbars in IMAC architecture. To evaluate the end-to-end scalability and efficiency of the presented heterogeneous system in terms of performance, energy, and accuracy, the research team will use standard ML benchmark suites providing a wide range of ML models, realistic end-user scenarios, and standardized evaluation metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex manifolds are ubiquitous objects in mathematics, and have wide-ranging applications in physics and engineering. A notable class of complex manifolds is known as Calabi-Yau manifolds, which are a fundamental tool in theoretical high-energy physics, and one of the PI's main lines of research will enhance our understanding of these manifolds and their properties. Another major direction of research revolves around the study of an evolution equation for geometric spaces known as Ricci flow, which evolves a given shape in a continuous fashion aiming to make it as round as possible. In this process, singularities may develop, and understanding their nature is a central problem in the field. This project will investigate the nature of singularities that form as time goes to infinity, in the case when the geometric evolution exists for all positive time. For broader impacts, the PI will continue mentoring and advising graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, co-organize weekly seminars, organize conferences, workshops and summer schools, and disseminate their work at conferences, meetings, and seminars, as well as via scientific publications.<br/><br/>The PI will use techniques from geometric analysis, nonlinear partial differential equations and holomorphic dynamics to investigate fundamental questions about the geometry of complex manifolds and symplectic 4-manifolds. The first project aims to obtain a rather complete picture of the long-time behavior of immortal solutions of Ricci flow on compact Kahler manifolds. The main difficulty is that in the cases which are not already understood, the evolving metrics are volume-collapsed as time approaches infinity, and the expected limiting space is lower-dimensional. The second project is about understanding (1,1) cohomology classes on the boundary of the Kahler cone of a Calabi-Yau manifold, and the singularities of the closed positive currents that these classes contain. The third project will attack a conjecture of Donaldson program which aims to to extend Yau's solution of the Calabi Conjecture in Kahler geometry to symplectic 4-manifolds, and explore its applications in symplectic topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main societal impact of the project is the potential of improved forecasting and nowcasting of tornadic events.  The project also contributes to an early-career researcher?s career development.<br/><br/>The development of rotation within squall lines, otherwise referred to as Quasi-Linear Convective Systems (QLCSs), is a complex physical problem.  Many theories have been put forth to describe how the genesis of rotation in QLCSs begins, but the scientific community has not consolidated around any singular mechanism.  The research under this award will use idealized numerical simulations, analysis of field campaign measurements, and a synthesis of recent advances on this topic to answer three critical research questions:  1) How do variations in the low level near-storm wind profile influence the ways in which squall lines produce intense, long-lived rotation close to the surface, 2) How do variations in Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) modulate the mesovortexgenesis process across the low-level shear spectrum, and 3) How does this near-storm environmental evolution impact the maintenance and rotation of QLCSs, and does the relative importance of vortexgenesis mechanisms evolve in time?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The New Jersey Pine Barrens is a 1.1-million-acre forest with sandy, nutrient-poor soil and acidic waters that are rich in iron. Iron moves from underground waters to the surface and collects in rust-colored bogs that were historically used in the iron industry. Although humans have long since abandoned the iron forges, bog iron seeps are hubs of activity for bacteria that use dissolved iron for energy. The unique abilities of iron bacteria could be used in practical applications such as removing toxic metals from drinking water or developing green energy. Despite their potential to benefit humans, little is known about how these bacteria cycle iron. The project will identify the species of bacteria that live in iron bogs and will study how these bacteria chemically change iron. Additionally, the research will support paid research opportunities for undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups. The PI will also have public outreach events that educate the public on bog iron seeps and their micobes.<br/><br/>This study will establish biogeochemical observatories at three historic iron forge locations, which represent the largest and most historically important bog iron deposits across three watersheds in the Pinelands: Harrisville Furnace (Oswego/Wading River), Batsto Village (Mullica River), and Weymouth Furnace (Great Egg Harbor River). Each site contains iron (III) oxyhydroxide-bearing seeps and springs where the diversity and activity of iron-cycling bacteria can be tracked over time under varying geochemical and hydrological conditions. Iron-cycling mechanisms at these locations will be examined using a multi-pronged approach, including continuous geochemical data logging and subsurface hydrology, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing techniques, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. Enrichment culturing under selective conditions will be used to test the rates and relative contributions of iron oxidation by different clades of bacteria using cyclic voltammetry, stable isotope probing, and metatranscriptomics. The resulting hydrological, geochemical, and meta-omic datasets will be used to generate a functional model of iron biogeochemistry in Pine Barrens bog iron seeps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Restoration is important for biodiversity and ensuring that humans have equal access to natural resources. This project will focus on restoration of tropical trees. Many tropical trees have edible fruit that are moved around by animals such as birds, bats, and monkeys. This movement of fruit and the seeds within them is a critical process that can affect tree diversity. This project will look at fruit characteristics and animal behavior to determine the best methods for restoration. The project will also provide student research and training opportunities in environmental science and restoration.<br/><br/>This project uses an experimental forest restoration landscape to test the central hypotheses that the functional traits, diversity, and spatial structure of early-establishing vegetation strongly influence the assembly of local fruit-frugivore networks, and through them, seed dispersal and tree establishment. The experimental landscape has independent manipulations of early-establishing tree composition (to produce variable fruit availability for seed-dispersing animals), tree diversity, and spatial arrangement (tree planting patch density) at a large spatial scale that allows studies of animal-mediated seed dispersal. The research will also test a novel DNA metabarcoding approach to better resolve tree species composition from diverse seed rain collections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Women, members of Indigenous communities, and people with disabilities in particular face high risks and vulnerabilities due to their lack of adaptive capacity, resources, and skills. The research takes a novel approach to evidence generation within the field of climate change adaptation and mitigation by utilizing a gender-transformative and participatory approach to identify risks and create transformational mitigation/adaptation strategies for climate change risks. In the past, approaches for addressing climate change and its risk and vulnerability assessment focused mainly on the scientific and technical aspects of the problems while ignoring social, institutional, and gender issues. This research project overcomes this gap and promotes the progress of science by prioritizing partnerships with local vulnerable communities to co-create knowledge and communication strategies, and to plan and implement objectives that are devised and owned by communities and local governments to build climate change resilience. The broader scientific impact of the research is anticipated to be a demonstration that groups that are most at risk of the negative impacts of climate change are in a unique position to lead adaptation and mitigation efforts ? which both can decrease their risk of experiencing negative consequences from climate change as well as can help empower them to provide ongoing leadership on this complex and ever-evolving issue within their own communities.<br/><br/>The objective of the research is to reduce risks associated with climate change affecting vulnerable coastal communities in the Cox?s Bazar and Chittagong regions of Bangladesh, while contributing to gender transformative change. This will be achieved in three phases. First, working together with community-based women, representatives of Indigenous populations and persons with disabilities who reside in highly climate insecure communities in coastal areas of Bangladesh, the research team and a women-led, community-based organization will use innovative and participatory visual and arts-based methodologies, such as storytelling, photovoice, incomplete stories, mapping and drawing, to collaboratively identify risks that these groups encounter due to climate change. In phase 2, the research team will support community representatives to analyze data collected in phase 1 and to create feasible, locally-led, community-based action plans that can be piloted in their own communities to adapt to / mitigate the impacts of climate change. In phase 3, the research will focus on analyzing the data collected throughout the implementation of the locally-developed community-action plans, synthesizing learning, and developing dissemination products.<br/><br/>This is a project jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as funding agencies from Canada via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition. This Competition allowed a single joint international proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by Canada.

Being a responsive partner requires the ability to have empathic responsiveness in intimate relationships (i.e., being aware of what one's partner is feeling), especially when relationships encounter difficulties and when one's own feelings may be clouded in moments of relationship conflict. This project explores conditions that impair partner responsiveness, focusing on a novel physiological factor, physical pain sensitivity, which may affect responsiveness to perceiving the feelings of one's partner. Because one's ability to perceive a partner's feelings is guided in part by one's own affective experiences (i.e., ability to empathize with them), conditions that reduce (e.g., taking an analgesic) or magnify (e.g., experiencing interpersonal conflict) one's own experience of pain could impair this process.<br/><br/>In this project, two experiments focus on the role of physical pain sensitivity within romantic relationships, in which partners can experience conflict and social pain that makes understanding others? thoughts and feelings more difficult. In these studies, administration of acetaminophen is expected to reduce physical pain sensitivity, which in turn should weaken responsiveness to others' feelings. The first experiment tests the role of reduced physical pain sensitivity on responsiveness for romantic partners during a conflict discussion, as well as conflict-induced distress, physiological reactivity, and aggressive behaviors. The second experiment extends the research to day-to-day use of pain relievers and couple conflict by having partners consume acetaminophen at home and measure the effects on real-life conflict-related perceptions of responsiveness, empathy, and aggressive behavior.  Individuals who ingest acetaminophen should show less empathy and perceive their partners as less responsive, leading them to report more conflict-related distress, to be more physiologically reactive, and to be more aggressive. This work highlights the interpersonal consequences when pharmacologically reducing physical pain sensitivity. Overall, this project should improve our understanding of the role of physical pain when regulating empathy and responsiveness in intimate relationships, and these processes are vital in many interpersonal settings such as the classroom, workplace, and broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study explores the evolution of bellflowers (in the plant family Campanulaceae) as a model to understand the processes that have shaped the biodiversity of this region. The bellflowers are particularly diverse in the Mediterranean, where there are over 350 species. About half of the species are unique to the region and some are threatened with extinction. Biologists and anthropologists will work together to determine the role of human impact as one of the potential factors leading to current bellflower species distribution patterns. This research will improve our understanding of the processes that drive plant diversification. Numerous trainees will be mentored, including students at two universities. Researchers will also conduct outreach to public schools in Florida. A workshop for public school teachers will result in development of instructional modules focused on evolution of the Mediterranean biome. Additionally, the research team will showcase research findings through a public exhibit including videos and interactive activities at the Florida Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>This project will integrate extensive field- and herbarium-based research with a variety of molecular techniques and cutting-edge analytical approaches to provide a comprehensive systematic and evolutionary study of Mediterranean bellflowers. The resulting data will elucidate biodiversity and quantify the relative roles of geological history, hybridization, genome duplication, and drastic human pressure in shaping the evolutionary history and distribution of Mediterranean plants, especially endemic taxa. This research will investigate the nature of endemism in the Mediterranean by highlighting the interplay of these complex processes. Human activities may have significantly contributed to gene pool fragmentation and range contraction of endemics. The long-term effects of such human activities have never been analyzed within an evolutionary context and modeled as parameters to help explain changes, or any potential impacts, on available ecological niches. This region presents an ideal opportunity for synthesizing and integrating anthropological and evolutionary hypotheses. This study will generate: 1) a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolutionary history of bellflowers that will provide critical clarification on the nature of Mediterranean endemism; 2) population level studies of endemic species that may reveal cryptic diversity and will generate a detailed assessment of the processes that cause species fragmentation; 3) a cutting-edge approach using spatial data modeling that will integrate bioclimatic variables with available data on the impact of human migrations and land use changes on the ecosystem across time in order to reconstruct past, present, and future ecological niches of endemics; and 4) an update of Campanulaceae ambiguous generic classification and a new clade-based classification with the ability to visualize clade distributions through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) portal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology empowers consumers with an immediate and powerful preventative approach that will disrupt the current standard of care and move consumers and the healthcare community toward a proactive approach for treating tick bites. If widely adopted, this product could prevent approximately 200,000 cases of acute Lyme Disease and 20,000 cases of post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome per year in the United States alone. The current practice of treating tick bites either prophylactically or after the appearance of a bullseye rash with high oral doses of antibiotics has risks including drug allergy, intestinal dysbiosis, sun sensitivity, and dental issues that could be avoided with locally acting, low-dose microneedle bandages. Efficacy has been demonstrated in microneedle patches targeting other dermal bacterial infections, providing a solid rationale for this approach. As no product like this has been marketed to date, there is considerable opportunity for preventing Lyme Disease and potentially for other dermal infections prone to systemic dissemination. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a therapeutic bandage comprising of highly innovative biodegradable microneedles in conjunction with a novel bandage matrix. Several innovations make this possible. First, the microneedles penetrate the dermal tissue surrounding the tick bite for highly localized dermal drug delivery. Upon contact with interstitial fluid, the microneedle tips dissolve rapidly and delivers doxycycline. Secondly, the microneedle bases dissolve slowly, releasing a host-directed therapeutic agent which recruits and activates immune cells to kill any bacteria that survive the initial antibiotics. After the microneedle tips dissolve, a bidirectional microchannel is exposed, facilitating drainage. Four prototyping rounds have occurred, and testing has begun in two animal models, plus explanted (living) human skin. The structural integrity, dissolution characteristics, and doxycycline stability throughout the microneedle formulation and molding process have been assessed. Using two fluorescent dyes, the kinetics of drug release and neutrophil migration to the site of microneedle application in mice and pigs has been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oftentimes, people incur significant costs for the sake of achieving their goals, even when the direct, objective benefits of attaining them are limited ? demonstrating people?s extraordinary ability to set and pursue their own challenges. This project investigates the cognitive mechanisms that allow individuals to leverage the brain?s motivation system for arbitrary goals. In particular, the project investigates how learning and decision-making differ when people attempt to obtain familiar, objective rewards, such as points, compared to novel, otherwise neutral goals. Discovering how differences between the two modalities arise should help clarify how people attribute value to otherwise neutral or even negative outcomes (such as a growling stomach) for the sake of reaching their objectives (for example, losing weight). By understanding the extent to which humans can use goals to direct their own learning and the factors that make it less efficient to do so, this research helps to develop novel techniques to support goal achievement in settings ranging from education and the workplace to public policy and personal development.  <br/><br/>Human learning through experience is typically understood as being driven by the expectation of outcomes that either are directly rewarding (such as water and food) or have been associated with primary rewards over time (such as money or numeric points). However, humans have a demonstrated ability to pursue even complex and effortful activities in hopes of attaining abstract, arbitrary, and often self-imposed goals. This project aims to uncover some of the cognitive machinery that enables human-level flexibility in goal-driven behavior. More specifically, this work focuses on understanding the potentially joint, yet distinct contributions of executive function and internal simulation processes on goal-congruent value attribution. To this end, the investigators use novel experimental designs to test people?s learning and decision-making under more or less abstract incentives. Paired with computational modeling, this approach enables the identification of key cognitive contributors to efficient goal achievement. The project also broadens participation in computational cognitive science, through the advanced technical training afforded by this project. The broader impacts of this proposal also include how the insights from this research may enable the development of tools supporting people in the achievement of important goals ? from quotidian tasks to ambitious missions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monument construction has long been associated with the rise of early civilizations and states. However, recent archaeological investigations have also identified the crucial role of monuments in processes of social integration among small, mobile populations who have traditionally been excluded from discourse surrounding monumentality. A detailed archaeological study of these important social dynamics, focused on the transition to early forms of mobile pastoralism, provides a new understanding of how monument construction and use reflected changing patterns of social organization, territoriality, and social integration among small scale, dispersed communities. This research will contribute importantly to comparative studies of monument use among early pastoralists. Regional early stone monuments have been significantly impacted by looting and are endangered due to mining and increasingly intensive agricultural practices. This research will provide a comprehensive investigation of such sites and an important contribution to cultural heritage efforts. Furthermore, it creates a valuable opportunity for training archaeology students in advanced field techniques, including archaeological geophysical and geochemical surveys.<br/><br/>The student and collaborators investigate how the construction and use of monuments by small, dispersed communities may reflect those changing patterns of social and political organization. Researchers have been conducting studies in the region for over a decade, working to create a better understanding of early pastoralism. Building on this previous research, investigators will employ a new, innovative multi-methods approach to monument study utilizing: (1) targeted near surface multi-method geophysical surveys (fluxgate gradiometry, soil magnetic susceptibility, and electrical conductivity), (2) soil chemistry analysis using portable XRF technology, (3) targeted stratigraphic excavation, (4) artifact and ecofact analysis, and (5) radiocarbon dating. These methods provide a comprehensive approach to understanding the construction and long-term use of these monuments, as well as how associated community activities may have changed over time. Researchers therefore contribute an important new case study and multi-method approach to the investigation and interpretation of monument use by small-scale, dispersed communities that underwent significant shifts in social organization, economic subsistence patterns, and wider community interaction during the transition to mobile pastoralism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such examples are abundant in biology, dynamics of human crowds, social networking, and even in technology (coordinated fight of an escort of UAVs or satellite navigation). Although the laws that describe the average may not be given explicitly, most adhere to a few basic principles. First, agents react more to the closest neighbors, and second, the density of the swarm plays a constructive role in defining particular communication rules. Such rules give rise to what is called ""environmental averaging"".   Large swarms regulated by environmental averaging are governed by models similar to those we use to study motion of a liquid like water or gas.  Thanks to this connection a new trend emerged in the studies of collective behavior which looks at these phenomena from the point of view of hydrodynamic modeling. This project proposes to analyze hydrodynamic collective models aiming at understanding their fundamental mathematical properties and with a view towards their applications to collective phenomena. In parallel with the research effort, the project will involve students and researchers through a working group seminar on the mathematics of collective behavior at the University of Illinois at Chicago. <br/><br/>Central to the project will be the development of a general methodology that unifies numerous models. Focus will be placed on justification of a class hydrodynamic models called Euler Alignment System and its kinetic counterpart the Fokker-Planck-Alignment model.  We aim to provide a justification for such systems going from particle dynamics through the mean-field limit and into macroscopic description through various hydrodynamic limits. It will be possible to obtain new barotropic pressure laws which have proved to be useful in real life modeling. Exploiting parallels with the classical theory of fluids we plan to study collective outcomes described by natural thermodynamic equilibria of the system, and to bring the regularity theory of such systems to the level usable in the studies of long-time behavior of the system.  Applications of this research are numerous including opinion mean-field games, segregation modeling, and modeling of turbulent phenomena in 2D inviscid fluids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their host-virus interactions can alter community structure, preserve genetic diversity, and impact nutrient cycling. Up to a third of the bacteria that dominate marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are infected with phages, yet the consequences of the host-virus interactions are unknown. Environmental DNA sequence data suggest that a dominant lineage of OMZ bacteria (SUP05) is comprised of species and subspecies that carry out different steps in marine nitrogen cycling and that these cells are often infected by viruses. The nitrogen cycling capacity of diverse SUP05 cells can drive the accumulation of nitrogen cycle intermediates in the oceans or lead directly to significant nitrogen loss. The outcome may be driven in part by phages, by causing cell death, metabolic rewiring of infected cells (virocells), or through the expression of phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). This project is testing the overarching hypothesis that SUP05 populations are comprised of diverse nitrogen respiring cell types and that their interactions with phages can determine the fate of fixed nitrogen. The investigators are studying SUP05 cells and viruses from OMZs to detail their combined effects on nitrogen cycling and loss processes in OMZs. The project is providing graduate and undergraduate students with hands-on collaborative field and laboratory research experiences, with a focus on broadening participation in oceanography. Through local science festivals, open houses, and interactive classroom lessons, K-12 students are learning about OMZs, nitrogen cycling, and viral infection. Results are being presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and all sequence and biogeochemical data, as well as new cultures of SUP05 and phage isolates are being made available to the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>Up to 25% of the fixed nitrogen in the ocean is lost as gaseous products through denitrification and other microbial processes in OMZs. These regions are also hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission to the atmosphere. While sulfur oxidizing chemoautotrophs from the SUP05 clade of marine bacteria and their viruses are abundant in marine OMZs, the roles of host-virus interactions in biogeochemical processes are largely unknown. This interdisciplinary study is evaluating SUP05 cells and phages in stable OMZ fjord systems using a combination of in situ measurements, DNA and RNA sequencing, and laboratory experiments to link the metabolic activities of SUP05 with the underlying nitrogen transformations they mediate in the ocean. The collective expertise of team members using field approaches to study microbial and viral diversity in nature, cultivation studies to test genomic predictions under controlled laboratory conditions, and isotope analyses to identify the rates and mechanisms underlying microbial nitrogen cycling and loss are being combined to provide new information about the conditions and activities that regulate SUP05 nitrogen cycling and loss in marine OMZs. Ultimately, this multi-faceted approach is filling critical gaps in our understanding of SUP05 cells and phages and how they collectively influence the marine nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individuals who can read efficiently enjoy better employment opportunities and therefore increased upward economic mobility, easier access to public information and therefore improved health outcomes, and greater social connectedness and civic engagement and therefore better mental wellbeing. Students and workplace employees often resort to ?skimming? a text to move through it quickly rather than carefully reading, and this increased speed often comes with a cost to comprehension. With a better understanding of the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying reading, and how these mechanisms change under different reading goals (e.g., casual reading, skimming, reading to learn), teachers and education policy-makers will be in a better position to suggest scientifically validated ways to help every reader meet their full potential. Our current understanding of the cognitive processes involved in reading is based on tools such as eye tracking (ET) technology or event-related brain potentials (ERPs) via electroencephalography (EEG). A major gap in understanding reading grows out of a theoretical and empirical gap between the use of these two tools. ET provides a measure of when and where the eyes move, but does not provide the continuous measure of cognitive activity that occurs before, during, and after word perception that ERPs do. ERPs, in contrast, largely ignore reading behavior by traditionally using unnatural reading paradigms that limit and alter normal reading behavior. Emerging technologies allow for the combination of both of these tools via simultaneous measurement of eye tracking and ERP data, allowing for an expanded understanding of the relationship between brain activity and behavior in natural and goal-directed reading.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project investigates whether eye movements during reading are initiated prior to a word being fully recognized and whether readers use different sources of information to maintain reading speed under different kinds of reading tasks. Continuous measures of ongoing language processing directly link them to eye movements using behavior-contingent analysis techniques ? that is directly examining how brain activity changes as a function of different reading behaviors, such as whether a reader decides to skip a particular word or look back to an earlier part of the text (Objective 1), relying on well-established ERP components, such as the N400 and LPC (Late Positive Component), which have been associated with post-eye-fixation language processes such as expectation and semantic integration, respectively. In addition, the project includes exploratory analyses of saccade-related potentials in order to investigate the brain activity leading up to the movements of the eye. The project also tests the hypothesis that, relative to casual reading, different task goals will alter the relationship between brain activity and behavior so that the alignment between these processes becomes either weaker (e.g., skimming) or stronger (e.g., proofreading, reading to learn). Therefore, this project applies the novel analysis approaches from objective 1 to gain a direct view into how cognitive processes change in response to reading goals independently from, or in coordination with, changes in eye movement behavior (Objective 2). The broader impacts of the project involve cross-training researchers with expertise in both ET and ERP approaches to reading, and an understanding of how reading works under different task goals, like when STEM students skim texts vs. reading for memorization.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Perception, Action and Cognition Program (PAC) and EDU Core Research (ECR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project examines how local communities managed turkeys as components of a broader political and ideological frameworks. Societies went to great lengths to raise these birds in a hot and humid environment, a challenging feat even today. Despite the abundance of other native birds, why did such societies incorporate this ill-suited geographically foreign species? How did social and ideological decisions shape the introduction of turkeys along the frontier? How were turkeys managed in a demanding tropical environment? Archaeology is well-situated to address these questions by examining human-environment interactions through time using multiple lines of evidence, including osteological, molecular, and chemical datasets. In addition to testing theoretical models of interregional interaction and animal management, the results of this investigation hold significant academic and practical implications for studies on animal domestication. The genetic data generated in this project can inform current research on turkey genetic diversity. This research also highlights the importance of evaluating management practices, which can inform studies on resilience and food sovereignty in tropical regions. Broadly, this investigation fosters collaborative ties with multiple institutions and supports the participation of underrepresented groups in science. The researchers disseminate the results through various channels, including a PhD dissertation, and by engaging with descendant communities. Furthermore, the use of 3D scanning and printing technology ensures that countries of origin remain the rightful custodians while permitting informative destructive analyses.<br/><br/>By shifting the focus to societies along borderlands, this investigation will produce a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of interregional interactions beyond state societies. Researchers employ ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses, stable isotope data, and radiocarbon dating of turkey bones recovered from multiple relevant archaeological sites. The geographic origins of turkeys are evaluated through aDNA to understand trade dynamics. Radiocarbon dating is used to create a local translocation chronology and examine how it relates to regional political events. A combination of stable isotope, genetic data, and osteological evidence are used to reconstruct management practices. By drawing on multiple lines of evidence, this work addresses relevant anthropological issues of interregional cultural and political dynamics, as well as animal management strategies. In a broader context, this research provides new insight into human-animal interactions and contributes to further documenting the complex sociopolitical history of animal management and domestication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While meticulous modeling and ingenious engineering have enabled robots to revolutionize the factory floor, the ability to effectively manipulate everyday objects in common environments remains an elusive challenge. A fundamental reason for this challenge lies in their limited sensing capabilities. Consider the problem of unlocking a door lock. To accomplish this, humans utilize a range of senses including sound to locate the pocket with keys, vision to identify the correct key, tactile feedback to insert the key precisely, and proprioception to coordinate movements. These rich sensory modalities compensate for each other's deficiencies (e.g. visual occlusion), facilitate recall of past strategies (e.g. the click of unlocking) and ensure robustness against sensor failure (e.g. numb hands). Developing a robotic system that can synergistically utilize a wide range of sensors requires creating new algorithms capable of reasoning about high-dimensional, uncalibrated and noisy inputs. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project funds research that aims to develop Synesthetic Teaching, a new framework for teaching dexterous manipulation to multifingered robots using rich, multi-modal sensory observations.<br/><br/>This research project is divided into four broad topics to advance the state of the art in robotics by integrating new sensing modalities for multi-fingered robots: (1) combining multi-camera streams with multi-fingered proprioception; (2) incorporating uncalibrated tactile feedback for enhanced offline imitation; (3) utilizing vibration feedback for adapting to dynamic manipulation; (4) developing multi-fingered robot systems capable of contact-rich manipulation in real-world scenarios created in the PI's lab.

The researchers aim to understand the changes in stream ecosystem structure and function, focusing on microbial decomposition, aquatic vertebrates, and riparian wildlife. This research will advance scientific knowledge because it sheds light on how wildfires impact ecosystems, particularly in forested watersheds like Lookout Creek. By testing alternative hypotheses, researchers gain insights into how both the stream and wildlife in the surrounding forest might change after a major wildfire. The study will help scientists predict and manage the aftermath of similar wildfires in the future, informing land management practices and conservation efforts to understand post-fire ecosystem recovery. This project will provide experiential learning opportunities for a wide range of graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from diverse backgrounds who are underrepresented in STEM. The inclusion of students from diverse backgrounds will contribute to a more diverse workforce that will ultimately strengthen innovation and problem-solving on issues related to wildfires and freshwaters. Studying post-fire changes in biodiversity has broader societal impacts as wildfires have significant economic and social implications affecting clean water, air quality regulation, and recreational opportunities. <br/><br/>Three hypotheses will be tested by examining the stream and riparian zone after this extreme fire, compared to prior conditions. The cumulative effect suggests the effects of the fire will accumulate downstream whereas the diluted effect hypothesis posits that downstream sites will buffer the effects from the fire. The stream resilience hypothesis proposes faster recovery in areas with high fire severity due to habitat heterogeneity. The researchers will assess microbial decomposition rates in riparian soils and streams using similar pre- and post-fire methodologies. A cotton strip assay placed in different locations will measure decomposition rates, with strips deployed for two to three weeks and analyzed for changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations. Electrofishing will be conducted during low streamflow conditions to capture the abundance and size of fish and salamanders. Gastric lavage will be used to assess diet composition, prey richness and diet overlap between fish and salamanders pre- and post-fire. Motion-sensor camera traps will monitor terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity, recording behavior and species identification. This project will provide experiential learning opportunities for a wide range of graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from diverse backgrounds who are underrepresented in STEM.

North Central College (NC) will help ameliorate this problem by partnering with both a two-year Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) to leverage a transfer pipeline and a highly diverse high school to recruit prospective STEM teacher candidates. By the end of their time at NC, these future teachers will be trained in data-supported, culturally sustaining STEM pedagogy while earning bachelor's degrees in STEM and Secondary Education. The expected outcomes of this project are to recruit and prepare 20 diverse STEM teachers and support them through their induction years to meet the needs of highly diverse schools and influence more underrepresented students to pursue STEM teaching. This project is of interest to the public in that it will be demonstrative of how communities may address this problem through recruiting STEM teachers from within, through cross-institution partnerships.<br/><br/>This project at North Central College includes partnerships with high-need School District U-46 (Elgin) and Elgin Community College, an HSI. CREATE will prepare 20 STEM teachers in biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, and mathematics over the five-year project. Each scholar will receive three years of induction support in the field; therefore, the project will provide services for eight total years. Project goals are to: (1) Recruit and award scholarships to 20 students in four cohorts; 25% of scholars will be community college transfer students. (2) Educate teacher candidates in research-based equitable teaching practices and strong content pedagogy. (3) Place, support, and retain 75% of scholar alumni during their four-year high-need school teaching induction service commitment. The project's theoretical basis is that through the implementation and fostering of STEM teacher recruitment from within the community along with culturally responsive preparation, more persons from underrepresented groups in STEM will be attracted to STEM high school teaching, gain expertise in culturally responsive STEM pedagogy, and persist as STEM educators. The project evaluation will measure the impact of high-impact practices on students in STEM teaching pathways. The project's intellectual merit includes a contribution to the knowledge base on which project aspects yield continued integration of culturally responsive teaching and teacher retention. The cohort and mentorship models from the scholars' first years of teaching may contribute to the knowledge base of how these activities influence STEM teacher persistence. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both vessels are operated by the University of Washington as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. This award will enable the acquisition of Keyboard-Video-Monitor (KVM) system controls for both the R/V Thompson and R/V Carson and multiple video monitors for R/V Thompson's computer lab for science and shipboard data systems. KVM systems have become standard on global class vessels in the fleet and valuable for situational awareness on any research vessel. R/V Thompson currently has an IP-based CCTV system that was an item flagged for replacement during a recent ship inspection and will be replaced with an up-to-date reliable system with this request. Finally, CTD operations on R/V Thompson will be improved by acquiring a sled on a track to replace the current accordion system to stage the ship's CTD package. The new system will allow deployment in much higher sea states with a greater margin of safety.<br/><br/>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research.

Person factors refer to attributes of the actor, such as personality, learning history, goals, and desires. Situation factors refer to forces outside the person, such as the presence of others, the immediate environment, physical forces, and broader cultural forces. Past research has tried to understand the relative contribution of, and interaction between, person factors and situation factors in accounting for a person's behavior. Both are clearly important, but it is less clear how the two are integrated. This project goes beyond previous work by allowing the relative contribution of person and situation factors to differ across people, situations, and time. Rather than assuming models for human behavior are the same across people, this research tests whether behavior prediction needs to be unique (personalized) to an individual. Understanding when, where, and for whom person and situation factors matter most has critical implications for healthcare, behavior change, education, and more.<br/><br/>This project tests three competing conceptual models of how persons and situations impact behavior. Each of these three conceptual models differ in how general versus unique the model is for any one individual and in how person and situation factors are incorporated. One important innovation in this project is recognizing that most previously used methodology involves a series of short questions that are common among everyone. That approach carries numerous benefits but may sacrifice a great deal of accuracy in capturing differences among people. This project considers the value of tailoring such questions to an individual. This approach may be more complex, costly, and time consuming to implement but may achieve greater accuracy in its forecasts. The three conceptual models advanced in this project have not been previously compared to one another. As a result, it is not known whether the tradeoff in simplicity versus complexity is important. To test this, a more nuanced and sophisticated methodology is developed based on individualized and more frequent assessments. Rather than finding a single correct conceptual model that applies to all people in the same way, this approach is expected to demonstrate that more complex and personalized models will work better for some people but that simpler models will work better for others. This refinement in understanding and assessing personality can inform the development of tailored interventions relating to outcomes in many spheres of life, including educational achievement, health, and productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It fills an important gap in understanding the emergence of the lifeways of early modern humans. Research demonstrates that Homo sapiens became the first human species to populate the entire globe. This is a popular story because it shows the ingenuity and adaptability of the human species. However, the story has primarily been told through a narrative of conquest and replacement. In contrast, a more complicated picture is emerging that emphasizes interaction and coexistence two different species types of local populations. Along with the training of a doctoral student, this research furthers an ongoing collaboration between multiple universities.<br/><br/>The project focuses on an archaeological site to examine interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans.  It asks how technological strategies changed over time and what these differences can reveal about cultural transmission. The researchers analyze thousands of stone tools to understand how technologies changed, where these technologies may have originated, and what these similarities and differences can reveal about what happened when Neanderthals and modern humans met. Stone tools also serve as proxies for hunter-gatherer land use, resource use, and mobility strategies, allowing researchers to better understand differences between species lifeways. By combining the stone tool data generated by this project with genetic, geoarchaeological, and paleoclimate data, this project will greatly improve understanding of this important period in human evolution. Finally, the researchers compare these results with neighboring regions to better understand how the behaviors documented in this region compare to other areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because antibodies are generated by random processes coupled to positive selection, the ability to induce certain rare but desirable antibodies can be limited by the inherent probability of occurrence.  This project uses computational modeling to estimate the probability of antibody occurrence, and to infer pathways for the generation of desired antibodies, in order to help  design vaccine regimens that maximize the probability of inducing broadly protective antibodies.  In order to do so, it addresses several key technical challenges in computational modeling of the stochastic immune system.<br/><br/>This project aims to address substantial shortcomings in current B-cell receptor sequence analysis models and software tools by incorporating sequence context-dependent models of somatic hypermutation to develop or improve methods for (1) computing the probability of induction of a mature antibody sequence from its unmutated ancestor, (2) clustering sequences into clones that share evolutionary descent from an unmutated common ancestor, and (3) reconstructing the evolutionary history of the maturation within a B cell clone and inferring the unmutated common ancestor. In each case, the advances will come from the addition of context-dependence to stochastic evolutionary models of maturation, and the development of new efficient approximation algorithms for computation of probabilities under dependent-site models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metadata contains information about a dataset, which may include what kind of data it is, how it was created, and technical information about the data relevant to how it can be used. Effective community-required metadata enables the data products of individual research efforts to be used by other investigators beyond those that created the data and the public as well. This project comes in response to the memorandum issued on August 25, 2022, by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The OSTP memo tasks federal funding agencies to ?develop strategies to make federally funded publications, data, and other such research outputs and their metadata findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable, to the American public and the scientific community in an equitable and secure manner.? A good CMS metadata standard also enables meaningful data sharing that can advance materials research generally and supports the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). MGI seeks to accelerate and sustain the process from materials discovery to deployment in products, so that the process takes place in half the time and a fraction of the cost. This would be enabled in part by developing advanced infrastructure for computation, experiment, and data, and innovative ways to combine computation, experiment, and data-centric approaches including machine learning. A second goal is to promote reproducibility in CMS by enabling others to regenerate datasets. The MatCore Standard includes a required minimal set of metadata that would accompany all CMS datasets, and additional optional metadata specific to particular CMS techniques.<br/><br/>Development of the MatCore Standard involves the determination of what information regarding a CMS dataset must be recorded, and in what form, to make it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), and ideally reproducible. This requires a careful assessment within each CMS domain regarding the nature of the scientific computation that was performed to generate the data. Understanding of this type lies at the heart of the fundamental principle of the scientific method that scientific research must be repeatable. An extensive review will be carried out to identify previous work on characterizing CMS datasets with the intent to build on existing approaches and standards wherever possible.<br/><br/>This project will stimulate discussion in the materials community. Conference and town hall style activities are included for community input to be incorporated into the released MatCore standard. If the result of this project is broadly adopted, it will affect virtually all aspects of CMS, which can contribute to a wide range of technologically and socially important domains.

This workshop will be an opportunity for graduate<br/>students and postdocs from a wide variety of institutions and<br/>backgrounds to learn about the interplay between algebraic<br/>quantum mechanics, topology, and condensed matter theory. There will be<br/>problem sessions to help participants better learn the topics<br/>presented. Materials from the conference will be disseminated broadly:<br/>The talks will be filmed and posted on the Rocky Mountain Mathematical<br/>Physics Seminar YouTube Channel. Problem sets and course notes will be<br/>made available on the summer school webpage. This will create a<br/>permanent resource for all those seeking to learn the topics of the summer<br/>school. Another goal is to give some early-career researchers an opportunity to disseminate their<br/>work. This will be done through contributed talks by junior<br/>participants. The event will also create opportunities for junior<br/>participants to interact with the speakers and more established<br/>researchers.

More information about the summer school can be found at https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/caqm.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of the summer school is to explore how C*-algebras<br/>are used to study topological phases of matter in the thermodynamic<br/>limit, and how methods from topology can be applied in this setting to<br/>study phases of quantum systems. Topics will cover background on<br/>C*-algebras and the topology of state spaces, lattice spin systems,<br/>Lieb-Robinson bounds, automorphic equivalence and symmetry protected<br/>phases. In the study of quantum many-body systems with infinitely many<br/>degrees of freedom, the thermodynamic limit is often of practical and<br/>conceptual importance. A precise mathematical description of such<br/>systems requires the use of a C*-algebraic formulation of quantum<br/>mechanics, a formalism that comes with deep insights and technical<br/>challenges in equal measure. C*-algebraic quantum mechanics has a long<br/>history, with notable discoveries in the seventies, including Lieb-<br/>Robinson bounds and the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts description of<br/>superselection sectors which continue to spur modern research in<br/>mathematical physics and condensed matter physics. In just the past<br/>five years, C*-algebraic quantum mechanics has provided the basis for<br/>cutting edge research on the rigorous classification of topological<br/>phases of matter. This summer school will bring some of the foremost<br/>experts in the field to teach the next generation of mathematical<br/>physics, providing students with both a strong foundation in the<br/>C*-algebraic formalism and a broad view of active frontiers of<br/>research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discovery rate of optical transients already outpaces traditional spectroscopic classification methods, and with future surveys only a tiny fraction of their discoveries can be observed spectroscopically.  Photometric classification is therefore essential, for identifying rare transients in real time, for classifying transients to allow population studies, and for discovering new classes of transient.  Each of these goals requires different ML and algorithmic approaches.  Now that appropriate data are in hand and usable for initial classification tests, this is the right time to test the pipelines to be used for the real-time discovery of rare transients, in preparation for future much larger data volumes.  Students and postdocs will gain experience developing and implementing ML algorithms, carrying out spectroscopic and multi-wavelength studies of astronomical transients.  This experience will feed into undergraduate education, connecting classroom learning and hands-on research and involving non-computer science majors, including student observing with large-aperture telescopes, and science fair experiences for K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project builds on recent successes by this team in creating initial classification pipelines using a range of ML algorithms, which were trained on, and then applied to, real data.

The overall goal of the research plan is to devise strategies that enable the synthesis of a new class of advanced porous materials composed of charge-separated molecular building blocks. These charges can perform a desired function to attract specific guest molecules within the material's pores. In one line of research, the ability of light to interact with these charges will be explored to trigger the release of guest molecules to determine if the material can be regenerated to its original state. This feature would be particularly useful for a multitude of environmental applications that seek the adsorption or separation of gases, such as hydrogen storage and carbon capture respectively with the general objective to counteract global warming.  Leveraging the research activities is the educational plan that will allow Clarkson University to offer a stronger, ACS-approved chemistry program, the foundation for a broad, rigorous chemistry education that provides students with the intellectual, experimental, and communication skills to become effective professionals. The outreach program is hands-on and incorporates state-of-the-art crystallography instrumentation to significantly strengthen and expand the high school to college pipeline for students from the rural North Country of New York State by increasing their exposure to and interest in STEM fields and careers. An X-ray diffraction workshop will provide participants with the training to understand and appropriately utilize the most precise method of determining crystal structures, thus allowing the analysis of fundamental structure-property relationship.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The proposed research plan addresses fundamental questions essential to the advancement of functional porous materials with multi-stimulus-responsive adsorption properties and rapid controllable release of guest molecules. Proposed is the use of zwitterionic metal-organic framework (ZW MOF) building blocks whose molecular surfaces show well-separated intramolecular charges with tunable electric field gradients. These gradients present potential multi-point adsorption sites that can be designed at a molecular level within the zwitterionic ligands prior to MOF self-assembly. Once zwitterions are incorporated into MOFs, their electric field gradients yield charged organic surfaces (COSs) within the pores, which in turn polarize guest molecules, resulting in defined adsorption properties. The most important feature of zwitterions is their sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g. light or electrochemical), resulting in switchable COSs that enable significant control and tunability of adsorption properties. Specific approaches are to: (1) Design and investigate ZW ligands as a new, simple, and controllable means to introduce COSs into pore linings to create MOFs with defined host-guest interactions; (2) Explore post-synthetic modification reactions as alternative routes for introducing ZW functionalities into MOFs; and (3) Demonstrate and optimize the multi-stimulus-responsive tunability of COSs by controllable release of guest molecules from MOF pores. These experiments will ultimately provide a powerful tool to tailor MOFs with tunable host-guest interactions and will generate fundamental knowledge on a novel type of multi-stimulus-responsive material with distinct adsorption and desorption properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How organisms respond to these changes remains an important question in environmental biology. Two types of biological change are likely in response to environmental change. First, individual organisms may undergo changes in behavior, physiology, or morphology, which will allow a rapid response.

By exposing populations of a microbe to two environmental pollutants in the lab and studying the short-term and long-term responses, this research will test how the two types of biological response interact to determine the fate of organisms experiencing rapid changes in their environment. This research will add to our understanding of biological responses to environmental change, while contributing to the training and education of a diverse student population.

Mistakes in this process can have detrimental consequences. In eukaryotic organisms, from simple unicellular yeast to humans, DNA is stored as chromatin, which consists of a DNA strand wrapped around proteins called histones. Many proteins that regulate transcription can ?read? chromatin through specific modifications on histones, and this activity helps guide their function. Proteins from the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family are chromatin readers that regulate the transcription of most genes in eukaryotes. Despite the importance of BET proteins in transcription, the specific roles of these proteins are not fully understood. The project will address this gap in knowledge by investigating the roles of BET proteins in baker?s yeast, which is an excellent model for understanding processes in human cells. The project will have important societal impacts by providing experience in original, hypothesis-driven research for a broadly diverse group of young scientists, from different backgrounds and at different levels of education, from high school to college students. <br/><br/>There are important gaps in understanding the major steps of gene transcription due to limited insight into the biology of BET proteins. For example, other than the bromodomains, which target BET proteins to acetylated chromatin, the functions of conserved domains of BET proteins are largely unknown. Further, recent findings indicate that there are mechanisms of BET protein recruitment that do not involve bromodomains. The overall objective of the project is to determine the contributions of all conserved domains of BET proteins to transcription in yeast. The objective will be accomplished by defining the contributions of conserved BET protein domains to mRNA synthesis, BET protein recruitment to chromatin, and formation of the transcription pre-initiation complex at gene promoters. The project will leverage powerful yeast genetic tools and modern genomic technologies to facilitate high-throughput investigation. The outcome of the project will be the first systematic characterization of the mechanisms by which BET proteins regulate transcription in a single model system. Thus, the project will expand the model of transcriptional regulation in yeast, and due to the conservation of BET proteins, it will direct future studies in diverse eukaryotes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global change is a complex issue involving many interacting drivers. As carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere, this will increase temperatures, which will influence precipitation patterns. However, most experiments simulating global change scenarios in forest ecosystems manipulate only one or two factors at a time, limiting our ability to predict whether rising CO2, warming, and precipitation changes will have interacting or exacerbating effects on tree growth and forest function. This project establishes the Forest Responses to Warming, Atmospheric CO2 and Drought (FORWARD) experiment, which simulates future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warmed temperatures, and increased drought exposure on temperate forest species that represent a diversity of growth strategies. The project examines how each global change factor and their combined effects impact tree physiology, growth, carbon capture, and the strategies that different tree species use to obtain soil resources. This work improves efforts to predict how temperate forest species will respond to more realistic future global change scenarios. <br/><br/>Despite strong mechanistic evidence that CO2, warming, and drought will have compounding effects on forest function, relatively few attempts have been made to experimentally assess the interactions between these climate change factors. Further complicating how forests will respond to climate change is the fact that symbiotic relationships between trees and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM), ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM), and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (N-fixers) represent different strategies for obtaining water and nutrients that could lead to fundamentally different responses to climatic change. Given these differences, assessing the responses of these major tree-microbe symbioses to interacting components of climate change is critical to making realistic predictions of how forests will respond to future climate conditions. The FORWARD experiment manipulates atmospheric CO2 using Free-Air CO2 Enrichment, warming temperatures using aboveground heat lamps and belowground heating cables, and increased drought using throughfall shelters. Responses of trees and their associated microbes to these factorial manipulations demonstrate 1) the interacting and compounding effects of CO2, warming, and drought on temperate forest trees, 2) differences in physiological and growth responses of AM, EM, and N-fixing species to global change, and 3) how different responses of symbiotic groups influence future tree and soil carbon storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mergers of neutron stars in binary systems observed through multiple messengers offer a unique opportunity to answer key open questions in a variety of fields, including gravitational and nuclear physics, relativistic astrophysics, and cosmology. Studying how neutron stars and black holes form and evolve, when isolated or paired in binaries, can shed light on the yet-to-be-understood diverse paths that bring massive stars toward their violent deaths, enriching the universe with its heaviest elements. Characterizing the properties of powerful blasts and ejecta from binary neutron star mergers and massive star collapses can give us invaluable information on particle acceleration mechanisms, magnetic field amplification, and the nature of the central engines powering the most relativistic cosmic jets. Unveiling the remnants of binary neutron star coalescences can constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter, providing a fundamental physics test.

These phases, such as ""high temperature"" superconductivity, hold exciting potential for technological applications such as creating a scalable quantum computer. Recently discovered ""moir"" materials, formed by stacking 2D materials with a relative twist, hold unique promise as platforms for investigation of such phases. The investigator is tackling open mathematical problems with direct relevance to understanding the emergence and properties of strongly correlated electronic phases in moir materials. By tackling these problems, the investigator is helping to advance novel technologies and strengthening connections between mathematics, physics and engineering. The investigator is training University of Minnesota graduate students in core techniques in applied mathematics and expanding awareness of exciting modern topics in applied mathematics through outreach to middle and high school students in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.<br/><br/>In preliminary work, the investigator justified the Bistritzer-MacDonald continuum PDE model for the wave-function of an electron in twisted bilayer graphene. The importance of this model is that, even though the underlying atomic-scale model is aperiodic, the continuum model has moir-periodic coefficients, allowing the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene to be studied using Bloch theory. The research project is building on this work, with the ultimate goal of developing mathematical methods for predicting moir materials' strongly correlated electronic phases. In the near term, the project will build directly on the investigator's preliminary work. First, generalizing it to more realistic models incorporating atomic relaxation, and to models of other moir materials. Second, analytically investigating important properties of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model such as Dirac point degeneracies and band topology. Over the medium term, the project will build on the insights gained from earlier work to develop and justify more accurate models of mechanical properties of moir materials such as atomic relaxation and vibration (phonons). Two approaches will be investigated: a phenomenological continuum approach, and an atomic-scale approach where ions interact through interatomic potentials. Over the long term, the project will again build on earlier insights to develop models of electrons interacting in moir materials. In the first of these, electrons will interact directly through the Coulomb force. In the second, the electron-electron interaction will be mediated by a phonon. Mathematically, the project involves rigorous asymptotic analysis and perturbation theory, PDE theory, spectral theory, calculus of variations, and ergodic theory. The project draws new connections between these areas and the application area in materials science. The research will develop these areas by introducing new problems and insights. While accomplishing the research goals of the project, the investigator is training University of Minnesota graduate students in core techniques in applied mathematics. The investigator is also expanding awareness of exciting modern topics in applied mathematics through outreach to middle and high school students in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, especially through the University of Minnesota's UMTYMP program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite crucial applications in aerospace, civil, and marine engineering, a systematic approach to determine geometry modifications that may control the vibrations does not exist because of the challenges of obtaining space/time-resolved flow data over a moving body and the difficulty of isolating the contributions from various flow structures to the induced forces/moments. This project aims to apply a novel numerical methodology to address those challenges and examine the three-dimensional geometry effects on the flow-induced vibration dynamics targeted toward controlling the vibrations. The high-fidelity simulation data generated in the work will help uncover the fundamental flow-structure interactions that trigger and drive the vibrations and provide well-resolved datasets for physics-based reduced-order modeling. The research tasks will be accompanied by teaching plans to help train the engineering students on the immense potential of computational tools for design and analysis. In addition, undergraduate research will be promoted by offering summer research opportunities on flow visualization tools and algorithms.<br/><br/>The flow-induced vibrations are driven by complex feedback between the body?s motion and the fluid flow that comprises interactions of boundary layers, separated free shear layers, recirculation zones, and vortical wake flows. Depending on the vibration dynamics (amplitude/frequency response with flow velocity), the vibrations of simple cylindrical (two-dimensional) geometries have traditionally been classified into vortex-induced vibration and galloping. However, three-dimensional geometries can exhibit complex vibration dynamics that have proven challenging to explain, classify, and control. This project aims to (1) conduct high-fidelity numerical simulations to correlate the vibration dynamics with the 3-D (forebody and afterbody) geometry, (2) use the well-resolved flow and force distribution data to determine the underlying mechanism(s) that initiate and sustain the one and two degree-of-freedom vibrations, and (3) develop physics-based models to identify the geometry modifications that may mitigate/enhance the vibrations. A high-order, theoretically stable embedded-boundary approach will be applied to obtain the high-resolution flow and force data over 3-D geometries. An innovative geometry parametrization will enable precise quantification of the effects of the body?s size (aspect ratio) and shape (surface curvatures) in various flow regimes. The high-resolution three-dimensional flow data will facilitate robust predictive models for the design of next-generation civil/marine engineering structures.

Better understanding how to exploit flowing fluids and flow-structure interactions is necessary in applications that extract energy from clean and sustainable sources such as wind, water currents, and waves. Improvements and optimizations to these systems require deeper knowledge of the physics of fluids, better models of their effects on structures, and more accurate simulations that solve for flow-induced forces and motions. Applied and computational mathematics combined with mathematical modeling can provide the necessary tools to accomplish these goals and to uncover knowledge that will be generally useful for hydromechanical applications. This project will significantly advance the relevant methods and understanding by focusing on an unsolved problem in the physics of fluids. The investigations will also educate students and train researchers, thereby contributing to a workforce that is well prepared to tackle these and related problems.<br/><br/>This project combines experiments, simulations, mathematical modeling, and analysis to investigate the coupled dynamics of fluid-solid systems with mass and momentum flux. The work will be conducted in the context of auto-rotating devices that respond to the injection or withdrawal of fluid, notably the Feynman sprinkler problem and related applications. The efforts will aim to develop appropriate methods for determining how forces and motions can be generated and controlled for open structures whose complex geometries interact with the flows produced by sources and sinks. The research will progress from targeted investigations of the sprinkler problem to more general inquiries into flux-based forces and the roles played by geometry and the driving strength. Experiments will involve the development and application of laboratory systems capable of sensitively resolving motions, forces, and flow fields. Simulations based on the immersed boundary method will address fluid-structure-interactions driven by source/sink flows. Mathematical analyses based on control volume methods and hydrodynamic modeling will be used to interpret the findings and identify mechanisms. By interactively combining all methods to address a long-standing open problem in flow physics, this work will provide fundamental knowledge and generalizable techniques for motion control and force generation, and which may inform engineering applications.

Research has demonstrated that proximity to interfaces can alter the local properties of the material.  This has strong implications for predicting the material's performance influencing everything from ion conduction in batteries to a material's overall strength and long-term stability.  This project will map the extent, magnitude, and range of local property changes between hard glassy polymer components and soft rubbery polymer components across glassy-rubbery polymer-polymer interfaces testing different interpretations put forward to explain long range coupling of local dynamics across these different polymer domains.  Experiments using different techniques will be conducted on simple model systems specifically designed to address which factors impact the observed behavior.  The fundamental understanding gained from these studies would have broad implications across a range of different glass-forming systems.

However new insight is needed to explain outstanding experimental observations of longer-range 100-200 nm perturbations to local dynamics, especially near polymer-polymer interfaces to address the cause of broad, approximately 200 nm, asymmetric local glass-transition temperature gradients that have been observed to emerge upon glassy-rubbery polymer-polymer interface formation.  Building on work that identified the glassy-rubbery polymer interfacial width and modulus of the neighboring domain as key parameters controlling this phenomenon, this project will measure the shear wave propagation across glassy-rubbery bilayer samples using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to study how the difference in acoustic impedance between the domains is altered upon polymer interface formation.  Information about the depth-dependent gradient in local modulus will be determined using continuum physics layer model analysis.  The work aims to test recently proposed mechanisms for the long-range gradients in local dynamics.  In addition, efforts will work towards developing perylene dye into a temperature-dependent localized fluorescent probe of polymer vibrational dynamics and so-called dynamic glass transition.  <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seashells, our teeth and bone are good examples of biominerals. While we are often amazed by geological minerals? various specific crystal geometries, biominerals are usually characterized by their arbitrary yet often complex three-dimensional (3D) morphologies. Moreover, the internal microscopic structures of many biomineral-based structures are also extremely intricate and carefully organized in 3D. This hierarchical structural complexity leads to biomineralized structures? remarkable mechanical strength and durability, despite the fact that the minerals themselves are intrinsically brittle. Currently we have limited knowledge in explaining how biominerals? complex 3D microstructures and morphologies are emerged and regulated. This award, by using the biomineralized skeleton in a starfish as a model system, aims to characterize its complex 3D microstructure as well as the underlying formation mechanisms. The skeleton of starfish consists of hundreds of millimeter-sized biomineralized elements, known as ossicles, which are embedded within its soft body. This unique skeletal design allows the starfish to be flexible during locomotion but also to become stiff when required. The ossicles are characterized by their lattice-like porous microstructure based on the single-crystalline calcite, which makes them lightweight, strong, and damage tolerant. The new knowledge gained from this study on the biomineralization mechanisms in starfish will provide us a better understanding of the 3D structural evolution processes for echinoderms, or possibly, even other invertebrate and vertebrate biomineralized tissues. The insights on the multiscale structure, formation mechanisms and mechanical properties obtained in this study for starfish? biomineralized skeletons will provide important lessons for the design and fabrication of synthetic low-density materials and thus benefit the U.S. economy and society. Aligned with the research goal in generating new knowledge of biomineralized materials, the proposed education and outreach programs will improve the quality of STEM education both locally and national-wide. <br/><br/>Abstract (technical)<br/>Starfish form biomineralized millimeter-sized skeletal elements, known as ossicles, for protection, locomotion and other purposes. Like other echinoderms? skeletons, these ossicles consist of magnesium-bearing calcite with a small amount of organic materials embedded in the mineral matrix. Intriguingly, despite their single-crystal nature, ossicles are characterized by their complex bicontinuous network-like microstructure, known as stereom. The goal of this proposed CAREER program is to understand how these biominerals? complex morphology is formed and controlled in 3D and how such structural control impacts their mechanical performance. We carefully select the periodic, lattice-like stereom structure, termed as biomineralized architected metamaterial (BAM), from a model starfish system. The PI will first quantify the multiscale 3D morphology of the fully formed BAM structure in terms of its 3D lattice network, surface curvature, and spatial distribution of organic materials within minerals and then investigate the 3D structural evolution, mineral crystallography, and distribution of mineral precursors at the growth front of forming ossicles through novel tomography imaging techniques. Finally, the mechanical effects of multiscale 3D structural control will be established via combined experimental testing and computational modeling. The subject of this study is an attractive topic for students and the broader public, and the proposed education and outreach programs will integrate material science, biology, and engineering to align with the research goal in better understanding biological materials<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nickel-based alloys are of immense technological importance in a variety of high-temperature applications, including aircraft engines and power plants. Despite their importance, nickel-based alloys have limited machinability, which has stimulated the development of fusion-based techniques to additively manufacture them. However, this manufacturing technique can introduce structural defects, which can detrimentally impact the reliability of the formed structures. There is a great need to eliminate or reduce these defects to increase material reliability and optimize performance. This project is developing an electric-pulsing-based technique to eliminate or reduce structural defects formed during fusion-based additive manufacturing to improve the mechanical durability of printed parts. Results from this research are helping to strengthen U.S. standing and influence in additive manufacturing, increase the safety and reliability in the aerospace and power industries, as well as help the American workforce become more competitive in these industries through the training of graduate and undergraduate students. The PI is also actively recruiting and mentoring women and minorities to foster their interest in the fields of additive manufacturing and defect healing.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Fusion-based techniques open an avenue for the additively manufacturing of mechanical structures of large scale including nickel-based alloys for applications in the aerospace and power industries. However, structural defects such as pores and cracks and new phases (e.g., the Nb-rich, laves phase) formed during additive manufacturing can introduce deleterious effects to the structural integrity of the printed parts. Developing advanced techniques to heal structural defects in additively manufactured parts can help to improve material integrity and increase the reliability of these structures in vital applications such as aircraft engines and power plants. This research project is investigating electric-pulsing-assisted healing of structural defects in nickel-based alloys as well as the mechanical response of these materials following healing with a closely coupled experimental and modeling approach. This research project is also establishing correlations between the mechanical behavior of nickel-based alloys and the processing parameters used in electric pulsing (voltage, pulse width, frequency, and duration) while also developing numerical models that can quantitatively analyze crack healing under electric pulsing. These relationships can provide a fundamental understanding of the electric-pulsing-assisted healing of structural defects and provide guidelines to eliminate or reduce structural defects. Students are being trained in the development of techniques to improve structural integrity while workshops on the building and testing of 3-D structures via fusion-based additive manufacturing are being developed and offered to local high school students. With these activities, students are learning both the technical and nontechnical requirements associated with additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures (MMN) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, Black women comprise less than 1% of the workforce at the most popular U.S. software companies. Low participation of Black students in CS areas is often attributed to a lack of ?preparatory privilege,? encompassing the unavailability of resources and experiences that build content knowledge and associated skills, and few role models. This Scaling, Expanding, and Iterating Innovations project will scale up a successful project that engaged Black young women in high schools throughout the state of Alabama in a year-long peer-learning community to prepare them for the College Board?s Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course. Called LEGACY++, the project will expand the focus to 500 students, adding two other states - Mississippi and Ohio. To do so, it will create a partnership among (1) post-secondary institutions in diverse cultural settings (urban and rural); (2) collaborators that specialize in analyzing programmatic outcomes and identifying factors that promote student success in CS; and (3) industry partners to connect students with new learning experiences from the automotive, wireless, and health sector domains. Eighteen Black CS Teacher Leaders will receive training across the tri-State partnership to facilitate an immersive summer institute experience to initiate the preparation of students for the AP CSP course at their school. Interactions will continue during the school year to promote students? AP exam readiness through curriculum workshops focused on AP CSP topics and interactions with multiple mentors who are all Black women. Students will also be provided with resources to mitigate the barriers to CS access often faced by low-income families, such as access to a peer learning community with scheduled meetings over the academic year. <br/><br/>The LEGACY++ Scholars will represent Black young women from three states to imbue CS content knowledge and an awareness of opportunities in CS-related occupations. LEGACY++ Scholars will learn AP CSP concepts through culturally responsive instruction and project-based learning facilitated by tools to support remote student collaborations to highlight the nature of virtual work, while connecting with new learning experiences from industry partners, their own life situations, and career aspirations. The synergy among these strategies is a promising approach to stimulate the learning of CS for this population; thus, the project?s activities will explore creative and transformative approaches targeted at enabling the participation of groups historically underrepresented in CS careers. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this project include investigating how LEGACY++ activities foster a perception of CS as a communal endeavor, how creating a community of learners can strengthen participants? identity with CS/technical careers and reduce the effects of stereotype threat, and whether LEGACY++ participation can increase awareness and understanding of CS careers. The LEGACY++ evaluation plan will continuously assess activities and provide quantitative and qualitative feedback by identifying promising practices and evidence of success that stimulate CS interest among Black young women. Data collection and evaluation of the implementation of the program activities will include observations of the Summer Institutes, semi-annual interviews of teacher leaders, annual interviews of program leaders and mentoring board members, and student projects. These data will be analyzed qualitatively in terms of pre-defined program success criteria. Measurable program outcomes will include changes in Scholars? content knowledge and attitudes towards CS, and Scholars? career plans. The knowledge-generation component will investigate how creating a community of learners increases identification, belonging, and persistence in CS among Black women. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students entering science classrooms are not blank slates. Rather, they bring intuitive frameworks that help them to understand, explain, and predict the world around them. These frameworks can be beneficial for navigating a complex world, but they can also create obstacles to learning or lead to misconceptions when they clash with formal science concepts. The interplay of intuitive conceptual frameworks and formal science learning has been investigated in physics, chemistry, and biology. This project will explore how intuitive thinking plays a role in shaping student understanding of human-nature relationships within environmental science education. Researchers will explore a specific intuitive conceptual framework ? the belief that humans are separate from the natural world, called human exceptionalism,  ? and examine its impact upon the learning of formal environmental science, especially given that it clashes with the formal understanding that human social systems are part of natural ecosystems. The study will include lower, middle, and high school students as well as undergraduates. The project should further elaborate a theoretical framework on the cognitive underpinnings of science learning and teaching and inform the development of pedagogical best practices in the environmental sciences and related fields.<br/><br/>Investigators will examine the impact of a powerful intuitive conceptual framework?human exceptionalism ?on how students learn the formal environmental science conceptual framework of Social Ecological Systems. The research will address four specific aims. (1) Explore the relations between human exceptionalist thinking and how entering and graduating undergraduate environmental science majors and non-major mental reason about marine Social Ecological Systems, as assessed with survey-based measures. (2) Chart the trajectory of how Human Exceptionalism and Social Ecological Systems thinking changes over time through a pilot longitudinal study of a cohort of undergraduate students as they progress through a degree program in environmental science. (3) Design interventions to impact Human Exceptionalism and measure changes in Social Ecological Systems thinking about marine habitats and intervene on changes in Social Ecological Systems thinking and see how that affects Human Exceptionalism. And (4) investigate the developmental trajectory of the relationship between Human Exceptionalism and Social Ecological Systems studying lower school, middle school, and high school students in coastal and inland communities using a mix of survey instruments and concept mapping.

Current theories and models ignore the unique language and learning experiences of Deaf signers. To address this need, the current project will investigate the role of language experience and provide the blueprints of the neurocognitive model for arithmetic reasoning in Deaf signers. The research team will investigate the neurocognitive basis of arithmetic processing in adult deaf ASL signers and non-signing English speaking adults. They compare the neurocognitive basis of subtraction and multiplication in early signers (acquired ASL before age 2) and non-signers; and investigate the neurocognitive basis of subtraction and multiplication in a group of late learners of sign (acquired ASL later than age 2). This work will provide a novel understanding of the impact of sign language, or variations in language accessibility, on the processes supporting arithmetical reasoning and, more broadly, contribute to the long-standing question of the role of language in shaping human cognition. It will expand our understanding of the uniquely human ability to calculate. It will also provide novel insight into the plasticity and resilience of the human brain, setting the foundations for future work investigating math learning disability in deaf signers or alternative educational approaches for children with different learning abilities. The results from this project are poised to influence the fields of education, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics. This project will also help to increase diversity in STEM by tackling an under-investigated area of human cognition, with an under-researched population, while providing research opportunities to deaf trainees.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the cognitive processes and underlying brain activations of adult deaf early and late signers and hearing non-signers solving single-digit problems. Arithmetic reasoning relies in part on language, providing the opportunity to investigate the impact of language experience. The investigators will test the two operations most distinctly represented in the brain, multiplication and subtraction problems, as they provide the greatest opportunity to identify differences across linguistic groups. To test and expand the neurocognitive model of arithmetic reasoning, the project will rely on theoretically supported brain regions of interest. Using behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the project will specifically investigate activations within independently identified phonological, spatial-numerical, and novel sensorimotor processing areas. These areas will allow a comparison between signers and non-signers. Further, after establishing the neurocognitive model for arithmetic processing in early signers, the team will investigate the impact of delayed exposure to language in deaf late signers. Studying deaf signers offers a unique window into understanding the role of language in the development of arithmetic proficiency and in cognition more broadly. This project is supported by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

The need for pathways for young learners to develop interest and confidence in STEM and to become motivated to work in STEM fields is recognized by SD?s Science & Technology (S&T) Plan, which identifies the importance of ""Ideas, Talent, and Companies."" This collaborative project incorporates three public and one private primarily undergraduate institutions, three Tribal Colleges & Universities (TCUs), and three PhD-granting institutions. Additional partners include a specialty school for students with disabilities, SD Board of Regents, SD Department of Education, and a US Department of Energy-funded research facility. An informal science education center across the jurisdiction focuses on ""talent"" and on the S&T plan's two related strategies to strengthen the SD research ecosystem. These two strategies are (i) increasing the diversity, inclusion, and equity of the SD STEM workforce; and (ii) cultivating a workforce pipeline by promoting STEM careers with SD K-12 students. The project will build a strong network of educators and researchers and strengthen the STEM education landscape across South Dakota, including within the most rural and remote regions and Tribal communities. K-12 students, their teachers, teacher preparation programs, families, post-secondary faculty, and STEM researchers will all benefit. The citizenry will be better informed about STEM research underway within SD, and a broader array of students will see that they are welcome to a seat at the table and are supported to succeed in STEM. Inspiring more underrepresented students to pursue careers in STEM has the potential to strengthen the research enterprise in the state and nationwide.<br/><br/>This project is led by Black Hills State University, a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) within the SD Board of Regents system. The project?s 35-member leadership team represents a collaboration across a breadth of SD organizations and institutions (i.e., Oglala Lakota College, University of South Dakota Main Campus, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Dakota State University, South Dakota State University, Augustana University Association, Northern State University, Sinte Gleska University, Sisseton Wahpeton College, Sanford Underground Research Facility/SD Science and Technology Authority, South Dakota Discovery Center). In service to the SD S&T plan, this project includes an Administrative Core focused specifically on STEM education, both in-school and out-of-school, and on three additional cores in STEM Education (K-16), Broadening Participation, and Community Engagement & Outreach. Through these cores, the project will build a jurisdiction-wide network with 6 project goals. The project seeks to: (i) enhance the ability of STEM researchers to engage effectively with K-12 educators and students, the general public, and other audiences outside their disciplines; (ii) identify and nurture STEM teacher leaders, equipping them to strengthen STEM education within their school buildings and districts and to advance STEM education across the state; (iii) enhance the ability of all K-12 teachers to deliver high-quality STEM instruction, especially those who serve rural and Native American populations; (iv) strengthen the level of interest, sense of belonging, and academic preparation in STEM of SD's full array of students ? from kindergarten through high school and into post-secondary; (v) generate and share research findings relevant beyond SD about STEM teacher leadership, building student identity in STEM, and factors important in supporting Native American students in STEM; and (vi) provide STEM education guidance and support to the SD Jurisdictional Steering Committee in strengthening collaboration among researchers, educators, and STEM education programs across SD, and to catalyze yet-to-be envisioned efforts related to STEM education.

In this project, the investigators plan to create a unified and systematic framework for variational inference methods, making two key contributions. First, the investigators will establish the theoretical foundations for the proposed framework, which will support and justify using existing and new variational inference algorithms in machine learning applications. Second, the investigators will provide a systemic procedure to create new variational inference algorithms and apply them to emerging machine learning problems. In addition to these new scientific developments, the investigators will create new courses and workshops on machine learning, recruit both undergraduate and graduate students for summer, project-based research programs, and provide mentorship to local high school students through hands-on machine learning training programs. Collaborations are planned with industrial data science partners to apply these new algorithms in practice and to train the workforce with the start-of-the-art machine learning tools.<br/><br/>The proposed ""Energetic Variational Inference"" framework is based on an energetic variational approach, which has been successfully used to study complicated non-equilibrium systems in physics and biology.  The investigators will provide a blueprint for generating new algorithms by introducing various options for the four essential components of the proposed framework: the divergence functional, the dissipation functional, the representation of the probability density, and the temporal discretization. The investigators will study convergence in the continuous formulation as well as estimate the error bounds after temporal discretization of the underlying continuous dynamic system. More importantly, these theoretical results can be applied or extended to other flow-based variational inference approaches. These methods will be applied to problems in supervised learning, density estimation, and generative learning. Additional novel applications in machine learning, statistics, and statistical physics will also be developed.

This includes computer programs that can take a general design for a computer chip and change different aspects of the design to find the best combination of component factors to meet the desired performance. These tools have been an entire field of study backed by enormous resources and decades of advancement and optimization. This project seeks to take advantage of the huge investment that was and is being made in these tools that can find the best combination of component factors incredibly quickly and apply them to applications outside of microelectronics. An implantable biomechanical valve will be used for this demonstration. The biomechanical valve has a huge number of design factors that can be explored in the program to find a few of the best designs. Those designs will be made and tested. Then, the way the computer program makes decisions will be changed, so the prediction matches the actual valve behavior. After this process is repeated, the program will be able to select from many general designs the best design along with the best component factors. The program can then be used to help design other devices or systems beyond microelectronics. This approach could replace guess and check methods of designing devices or systems from medical to household goods to building structures to transportation and beyond with highly efficient and accurate automated methods. The project will not only benefit automated methods for biomechanical  designs, but will also educate students including those from from underrepresented groups, thus potentially enlarging the workforce in microelectronics as well as bioengineering.<br/><br/>The project uses the well-established concept of an equivalent circuit model along with more complex finite element modeling approaches to explore complex design spaces for devices and systems. A biomechanical valve will be examined as an example to demonstrate this concept. While it is possible to perform similar modeling using a finite element approach, it is much more computationally intense. An equivalent circuit simulation will quickly scan through the high-dimensionality design space to determine specific designs with predicted high performance. Finite element modeling, benchtop testing, and in situ testing will be used to iteratively refine the approach to improve accuracy of behavior and degradation prediction. The project aims to increase the bandwidth of designers to explore more architectures and variations on design enabled by quickly scanning for promising options to move forward with more time-intensive fabrication and empirical testing. This approach could impact designing devices or systems from medical to household goods to building structures to transportation and beyond with highly efficient and accurate automated methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the technology addresses the demand for data-driven solutions and enhances environmental transparency in the agricultural supply chain without disclosing farmer data.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a measurement, reporting, and verification tool (MRV) that addresses the challenges associated with monitoring and verifying management practices in agriculture. This technology harnesses the power of geospatial analytics and machine learning algorithms to create a method for collecting, analyzing, and validating data on agricultural practices. In addition, the platform integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and field data, which allows the generation of comprehensive and precise assessments of land management practices and support carbon accounting. This multi-dimensional approach may enhance the reliability and depth of the information provided to stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.  Machine learning algorithms and cloud-based computing techniques also are used to detect patterns, trends, and anomalies in climate smart practices. The algorithms enable decision-makers to access more precise and timely insights, facilitating proactive measures to address emerging challenges and opportunities. Both public and private sector organizations may use the technology to track landscapes, identify areas for improvement, and pinpoint potential prospects for future conservation and restoration actions remotely and efficiently. By facilitating data-driven decision-making, the technology may empower stakeholders to enhance sustainability practices and achieve environmental conservation goals effectively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to mitigate risks by producing a closed-loop aileron control method that promotes symmetric deployment while simultaneously ensuring that even an asymmetric deployment does not induce aircraft instability. Wind tunnel data will be generated for a number of static and dynamic fold conditions. Methods for governing when and how fast reconfiguration takes place will be tested to bridge the control gap between motorized and aerodynamic actuation. Implementation of these methods will allow for operations resembling motorized actuation, without the associated weight penalties and disadvantages. Wind tunnel data will be used to produce the closed-loop aileron control method which will then be tested in the wind tunnel to verify that the level of expected roll torque variance is observed throughout asymmetric reconfiguration. Success will show a marked decrease in roll torque variance compared to reconfiguration where no closed-loop corrective action is taken. Together these methods and risk mitigation techniques will overcome the need for a mechanical actuation device, reducing the complexity and barriers to entry of reconfigurable designs.

However, Black women comprise less than 1% of the workforce at the most popular U.S. software companies. Low participation of Black students in CS areas is often attributed to a lack of ?preparatory privilege,? encompassing the unavailability of resources and experiences that build content knowledge and associated skills, and few role models. This Scaling, Expanding, and Iterating Innovations project will scale up a successful project that engaged Black young women in high schools throughout the state of Alabama in a year-long peer-learning community to prepare them for the College Board?s Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course. Called LEGACY++, the project will expand the focus to 500 students, adding two other states - Mississippi and Ohio. To do so, it will create a partnership among (1) post-secondary institutions in diverse cultural settings (urban and rural); (2) collaborators that specialize in analyzing programmatic outcomes and identifying factors that promote student success in CS; and (3) industry partners to connect students with new learning experiences from the automotive, wireless, and health sector domains. Eighteen Black CS Teacher Leaders will receive training across the tri-State partnership to facilitate an immersive summer institute experience to initiate the preparation of students for the AP CSP course at their school. Interactions will continue during the school year to promote students? AP exam readiness through curriculum workshops focused on AP CSP topics and interactions with multiple mentors who are all Black women. Students will also be provided with resources to mitigate the barriers to CS access often faced by low-income families, such as access to a peer learning community with scheduled meetings over the academic year. <br/><br/>The LEGACY++ Scholars will represent Black young women from three states to imbue CS content knowledge and an awareness of opportunities in CS-related occupations. LEGACY++ Scholars will learn AP CSP concepts through culturally responsive instruction and project-based learning facilitated by tools to support remote student collaborations to highlight the nature of virtual work, while connecting with new learning experiences from industry partners, their own life situations, and career aspirations. The synergy among these strategies is a promising approach to stimulate the learning of CS for this population; thus, the project?s activities will explore creative and transformative approaches targeted at enabling the participation of groups historically underrepresented in CS careers. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this project include investigating how LEGACY++ activities foster a perception of CS as a communal endeavor, how creating a community of learners can strengthen participants? identity with CS/technical careers and reduce the effects of stereotype threat, and whether LEGACY++ participation can increase awareness and understanding of CS careers. The LEGACY++ evaluation plan will continuously assess activities and provide quantitative and qualitative feedback by identifying promising practices and evidence of success that stimulate CS interest among Black young women. Data collection and evaluation of the implementation of the program activities will include observations of the Summer Institutes, semi-annual interviews of teacher leaders, annual interviews of program leaders and mentoring board members, and student projects. These data will be analyzed qualitatively in terms of pre-defined program success criteria. Measurable program outcomes will include changes in Scholars? content knowledge and attitudes towards CS, and Scholars? career plans. The knowledge-generation component will investigate how creating a community of learners increases identification, belonging, and persistence in CS among Black women. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, due to their small-size, high energy density, and good scalability, electrostatic actuators are used in vibrotactile feedback for sense-of-touch human interfaces such as cellphones, tablets, gaming controllers, surgical devices, machine controllers, and other applications. However, the required high voltage driving signals pose significant challenges for electronic actuator drive systems, which limits the size, cost, and overall adoption of these technologies. This technology uses a new class of piezoelectric drive circuit that may enable next-generation micro-mechanical actuators. These actuators have commercial potential in applications spanning small-scale and soft robotics, haptics systems in consumer, medical, military, and automotive electronics, and other applications that require small or scalable mechanical actuation.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. the solution is based on the development of integrated switched capacitor drive circuits for electrostatic actuators. The technology uses a high-voltage, bidirectional boost direct current-direct current converter that can deliver and recover reactive power efficiently. In addition, the approach uses high energy density capacitors as energy storage components to step the voltage across the load with small voltage steps. This helps to supply the reactive energy needed to actuate the transducer with less real power loss and allows a large fraction of the reactive energy to be recovered when the actuator is discharged. Compared to existing methods, the switched capacitor driver may reduce power loss (increase battery life) by over an order of magnitude while reducing overall solution size and cost. The effectiveness of the switched capacitor driver has >5x higher energy density and >10x lower power consumption than current technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To provide high-quality and interactive experiences, XR apps on mobile devices need to offload heavy computational tasks such as object detection and frame rendering to edge servers at low latency and high data rates, which places high bandwidth demands on the wireless network. While 5G millimeter wave networks promise unprecedented data rates and ultra-low latency, their performance is not optimized for dynamic networks involving blockage and mobility. Additionally, today's edge servers are attached to the mobile packet core network, resulting in long round trip times unsuitable for high frame rate XR applications. To address these shortcomings of today?s 5G millimeter wave network and edge infrastructure, this project proposes an enhanced edge architecture for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks featuring (i) dense base station deployment, (ii) caching of XR contents to eliminate long processing latency of heavy computational tasks, and (iii) a distributed infrastructure with computational and storage units attached to each base station and mobile packet core router to reduce the round trip times between mobile devices and edge servers. Using this new architecture, the project develops TARGET, a novel algorithmic framework for latency-aware edge computing for XR in B5G networks. TARGET establishes the theoretical foundations for enabling seamless mobile high-quality XR applications, enabled by the anticipated wide deployment of 5G and B5G networks. The proposed research activities also offer new materials for integration in classes taught by the PIs and help extend the PIs? excellent track record of involving undergraduate students and recruiting students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The TARGET framework consists of algorithms that (i) jointly optimize base station association/handover and beamforming directions for both uplink and downlink to minimize wireless latency by maximizing a weighted sum rate; (ii) jointly optimize caching and routing over general multi-hop edge computing networks to meet end-to-end latency constraints; and (iii) optimally trade off the computation and storage resources of a distributed hierarchical computing/storage infrastructure, through joint routing, computation placement and caching, to minimize end-to-end latency. The project examines both traditional optimization approaches and complementary machine learning approaches in designing and integrating these algorithms. The algorithms and protocols are evaluated via extensive network simulations along with experimental validation on two Northeastern University testbeds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cold end-member of AABW is formed over various sectors of the continental shelf of Antarctica, notable in the Weddell and Ross Seas.  The governing processes producing the dense shelf waters involve small scale spatial and temporal factors associated with ocean/sea ice interaction, often related to coastal polynyas and katabatic winds, along with further modification by ocean-glacial ice interaction. There have been studies of the formation of dense shelf water, of export of shelf water over the shelf/slope, the descent of gravity currents into the AABW realm, and of flow paths of AABW spreading across the deep ocean well into the northern hemisphere. What is lacking is a coordinated, synchronous observational study of the seaward spreading, from formation of the dense shelf water to its spreading to the shelf/slope break and descent into the deep ocean. This program fills the gap, by investigating the characteristics of dense shelf water formed within Terra Nova Bay (TNB), Ross Sea, its transformation, modification and northward spreading within the Drygalski Trough in the western Ross Sea, feeding into the spill-over at the continental slope and the deep boundary current adjacent to Cape Adare. The team will deploy a series of moorings ? two heavily instrumented full water column moorings within TNB to capture high-salinity shelf water (HSSW) production and a series of bottom-focused moorings to evaluate the transformation and northward spreading of the dense saline water.  The broad science goals of the project will be addressed by this program through a coordinated analysis of these mooring measurements.  The project is an international collaboration that involves the USA (this proposal), S. Korea, New Zealand and Italy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will enhance scientific and technological understanding by providing unprecedented insights into the movement of goods, thereby optimizing transport methods and materials. The market opportunity addressed by the proposed technology is vast, with a value proposition centered around real-time tracking, digital control empowerment, and reduced tracking costs. By leveraging precise on- and off-premise technology with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), the solution promises to provide a durable competitive advantage. The technology will be offered at a reasonable monthly pricing per unit, unlocking commercial opportunities both domestically and globally. This novel approach is projected to capture a significant portion of the market currently underserved by existing methods. Initially targeting pallets, containers, and commercial vehicles, potential annual revenues of $10M+ are projected in the third year of production, paving the way for expansion into wider domestic and global markets. Ultimately, the technology is poised to be a key factor in enabling commercial success while offering societal benefits such as minimized disruption of production and improved food quality.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to provide technology for tracking reusable transports (e.g., pallets, containers, trailers, trucks) to reduce disruptions for manufacturers, movers, and package receivers by over 50%. Logistics operation inefficiencies in manufacturing, food distribution, and pharmaceutical delivery could be eliminated, reducing item journey monitoring costs and wasted time. The proposed devices will attach to pallets/containers, read passive RFIDs attached to serial numbered items, and communicate their location/state to a cloud based digital twin for each serial number. This will allow users to monitor products during shipping, updating product whereabouts, condition, and expected delivery timeline, boosting operational efficiency and product safety and creating the potential for circular logistics chains and goods that deliver themselves. This project will de-risk the device using evaluation hardware and demonstrate blink rate optimization feasibility, producing a prototype capable of transmitting and connecting to the monitoring software across various transportation types. The R&D will include reference design-based device testing focusing on battery longevity, chip power usage evaluation, and deployable antenna design for multi-item reads. The result will be an early prototype capable of being tested in an industrial pallet configuration for modular battery implementation in post-Phase I efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for pathways for young learners to develop interest and confidence in STEM and to become motivated to work in STEM fields is recognized by SD?s Science & Technology (S&T) Plan, which identifies the importance of ""Ideas, Talent, and Companies."" This collaborative project incorporates three public and one private primarily undergraduate institutions, three Tribal Colleges & Universities (TCUs), and three PhD-granting institutions. Additional partners include a specialty school for students with disabilities, SD Board of Regents, SD Department of Education, and a US Department of Energy-funded research facility. An informal science education center across the jurisdiction focuses on ""talent"" and on the S&T plan's two related strategies to strengthen the SD research ecosystem. These two strategies are (i) increasing the diversity, inclusion, and equity of the SD STEM workforce; and (ii) cultivating a workforce pipeline by promoting STEM careers with SD K-12 students. The project will build a strong network of educators and researchers and strengthen the STEM education landscape across South Dakota, including within the most rural and remote regions and Tribal communities. K-12 students, their teachers, teacher preparation programs, families, post-secondary faculty, and STEM researchers will all benefit. The citizenry will be better informed about STEM research underway within SD, and a broader array of students will see that they are welcome to a seat at the table and are supported to succeed in STEM. Inspiring more underrepresented students to pursue careers in STEM has the potential to strengthen the research enterprise in the state and nationwide.<br/><br/>This project is led by Black Hills State University, a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) within the SD Board of Regents system.

This doctoral dissertation research examines how residents of an ancient city managed their forest resources and developed sustainable agricultural practices. The study of ancient plant remains, environmental DNA (eDNA), pollen, and Lidar-based forest surveys, provide information about land and forest resource utilization patterns across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In addition to supporting the training of a graduate student, findings of the project are being communicated via public presentations, electronic media platforms and journal articles to inform modern decision-making in the neotropical land management and across the globe.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to investigate how the occupants of an ancient city managed their forest resources and developed agricultural practices that enabled them to sustain large populations for many centuries. The project hypothesizes that over time they shifted from a wide-ranging extractive mode of resource acquisition to a more intensive, yet sustainable, mode of forest utilization and agricultural production. The researchers predict that as population increases, there will be evidence of: (1) a transition from naturally occurring, dominant forest species to more domesticated trees and shrubs, (2) a more intensive exploitation of wetlands for agriculture and (3) a shift from a maize-based diet to one more reliant on root crops. The methodological used in this project consists of Lidar-based vegetation surveys, which provide baseline data, combined with analyses of carbonized plant remains, and pollen from excavations, which offers a robust record of plants species used through time. This project enhances scientific understanding of the complexities of life in a major community that endured for over a millennium and illuminate larger issues concerning the impact of a complex society on its surrounding environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This region, termed the Western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) releases a vast amount of water vapor and heat into the atmosphere and is thus a key region for regulating global climate and hydrology.  Principal Investigators B. Linsley and K. Gibson have recently discovered that in the previous two time periods of global warming during the transition from glacial conditions to interglacial conditions, that the layer of the ocean 100 meters below the warm surface begins warming and reaches peak warming several thousand years before the surface ocean. They have observed this through geochemical analysis of calcareous microfossil shells preserved in deep sea sediment cores recovered from the WPWP. Modern ocean circulation patterns suggest that this subsurface warming is initiated in the Southern Hemisphere. The main objective of this research project will be to extend the geochemical record back in time to better understand the pattern of subsurface western Pacific warm pool warming during other glacial-interglacial transitions over the last 1.5 million years. A key question is whether the subsurface warming in this region of the ocean is a triggering event for the global warming that occurred after each of the multiple glaciations that occurred during this time period, and how changes in the Southern Hemisphere might influence the WPWP and global hydroclimate in our present period of climate change. Outreach, training, and educational activities are broad and include high school, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as the general public. <br/><br/><br/>There is a growing body of paleoclimate evidence pointing to the importance of South Pacific forcing of the lower latitude Pacific, and in particular the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) thermocline. Just below the buoyant surface layer in the WPWP are waters of subtropical origin with ~ 70% supplied from the South Pacific gyre region. This is part of the shallow overturning cell-western boundary current circulation that transmits water at thermocline depths to the WPWP where it mixes with the Northern Hemisphere western boundary current.  Much of this subtropical South Pacific water flows as part of the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent into the Bismarck Sea where our study site, International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1486 is located. The South Pacific influence on oceanographic conditions in the Bismarck Sea indicates that sediment cores from this strategic location can be used to reconstruct temporal changes of the southern Hemisphere influence on the WPWP thermocline. Preliminary surface ocean and thermocline-depth foraminifera oxygen isotopes  and Mg/Ca results from Site 1486 indicate a 3-4C warming of the thermocline that started several thousand years before the deglacial transitions at Marine Isotope Stages 2/1 and 6/5. Thermocline temperatures then peaked in the early interglacials at 11 and 126 kyr, followed by abrupt cooling that lasted several thousand years. These are time periods when maximum Earth axial tilt and minimum precession align, suggesting a connection between warming of the WPWP thermocline, maximum obliquity angle and time periods when the summer solstice occurs at perihelion.  The Principal Investigators will analyze three species of mixed layer- and thermocline-depth fossil foraminifera shells for oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca from Site 1486 back to 1.5 Ma at a millennial-scale downcore timestep, spanning the entire mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT). This will allow them to determine when this pattern of early interglacial thermocline warmth developed relative to surface conditions and investigate the following questions: Is there a consistent relationship between thermocline warming in the region of Site 1486 and periods when obliquity angle was at a maximum and precession at a minimum? Are thermocline warming events consistent features of all interglacial periods in the WPWP or just in the latest Pleistocene?  Given the importance of the WPWP to global climate and hydrology, the possibility that WPWP thermocline warming prior to and during glacial-interglacial transitions were triggering events with global implications needs to be explored. Since some recent studies have hypothesized a southern hemisphere origin for the dominant phase of the last glacial termination, our results documenting early interglacial warming in the Bismarck Sea sector of the WPWP thermocline may support this idea. Thus, determining the temporal relationship between WPWP thermocline warming events and past deglacial ?global warming? events is important in the context of current climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diaspora communities ? people who reside in one country but maintain attachments to their real or imagined ?homeland? ? have been increasingly mobilized for or against their country of origin. What shapes diasporic individuals? attitudes toward the homeland and their tendency to mobilize politically on this basis? This research answers this question using a survey experiment that randomly exposes individuals to one of three narratives: (1) a narrative that emphasizes contemporary danger for one?s kin in the homeland; (2) a narrative that emphasizes shared trauma and common suffering; and (3) a narrative that emphasizes discrimination and rejection in the diaspora?s country of residence. Doing so allows us to assess the persuasive impact of these narratives and identify whether they resonate across different sociodemographic subgroups within the diaspora.<br/><br/>The burgeoning literature on diaspora mobilization highlights three ideational factors that shape the attitudes of diaspora communities toward their ?homeland?: (1) perceptions of contemporary danger for one?s kin in the homeland; (2) narratives about shared trauma and common suffering; and (3) a sense of discrimination and rejection in the diaspora?s country of residence. However, there is little rigorous empirical evidence assessing the impact of these factors at the individual level. This research asks whether references to danger in the homeland, shared historical trauma, or current discrimination move the diaspora?s attachment to its purported ?homeland,? the diaspora?s tendency to mobilize, and the diaspora?s support of their country of residence?s policies toward the ?homeland.? Using experimental methods, this research also examines whether these factors operate uniformly across different sociodemographic subgroups within the diaspora. Investigating how different narratives shape homeland attachment across subgroups will further researchers? understanding about the preservation and reproduction of diasporic identity, particularly among younger generations who did not directly experience the historic trauma, dislocation, and discrimination. Moreover, our project will also contribute to better understanding of how references to shared trauma affect group attitudes and behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By employing passive heating and cooling to enable biochemical reactions without reliance on conventional, energy-intensive equipment, this device aims to make diagnostics accessible in resource-limited environments. The technology facilitates rapid, on-site disease detection using a smartphone, thereby bypassing the logistical challenges of centralized laboratories. The societal benefits include quicker diagnosis and intervention, which are critical in outbreak containment and management, leading to saved lives and reduced spread of diseases. Commercially, this innovation opens market opportunities within the growing field of point-of-care testing, which is projected to grow due to increasing demand for decentralized healthcare solutions.<br/><br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an innovative thermal cycling mechanism that facilitates rapid heating and cooling cycles crucial for the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) processes. The mechanism features a spinning disc embedded with conductors located near stationary magnets. As the disc spins, the changing magnetic fields interact with the conductors to induce eddy currents, which generate Joule heating. This method allows for efficient nucleic acid amplification. By harnessing such passive energy sources, the system achieves significant reductions in complexity and operational costs. The technical merit of this approach lies in its ability to maintain precise temperature control necessary for accurate biochemical reactions, thereby enabling reliable diagnostics in a compact, portable format. This solution has the potential to simplify and expedite pathogen detection in both developed and under-resourced settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The geologic formations that contain oil and gas deposits also contain radionuclides (referred to as Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM)) as well as compounds containing Barium (Ba), Strontium (Sr), and Arsenic (As) that can pose problems with scaling on the equipment and are hazardous to workers' health. Stochastic Research Technologies is developing easily disposable, safe, cost-effective, and customizable clay-based adsorbents to remove As, Ba, Sr, and Radium from produced water. This will enable oil and gas exploration and production companies to reduce their environmental impact, representing a key constraint on their growth. Removing contaminants will allow water to be reused and recycled for agricultural and household needs. The technology is not energy intensive and does not pose scaling or safety concerns like current technologies. Further, the adsorbents result in a small amount of waste, which minimizes disposal costs. The technology is not restricted to removal of just NORM but can also be very useful in applications like removal of PFAS, and recovering important materials like Lithium, rare earth elements.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a unique technology for removing Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) and other contaminants from produced waters of Oil and gas Industries. Through the development of theory and a novel optimization-based Computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) framework, the company researchers generated order-of-magnitude better clay-based adsorbents than currently commercially available or published adsorbents for removal of produced water impurities.   The proposed research and development are of considerable fundamental and practical significance to the wastewater and produced water area. The project addresses important issues concerning group-contribution methods, computer-aided molecular design, NORM removal, and environmental impacts. On the practical side, the NORM removal problem occurs in the oil and gas industries worldwide. The unique adsorbents generated by Stochastic Research Technologies provide a cost-effective, safe, and customized solution to this ubiquitous problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its mission is to  reimagine natural disaster/catastrophe insurance and develop it as a tool to protect vulnerable populations and ensure solvency of the insurance/re-insurance sector. Center outcomes will incentivize community disaster mitigation and promote climate change adaptation. It will shape the way engineers, scientists, land use managers, and governments model post-disaster recovery. Catastrophe models are an essential tool used by the insurance and finance sectors to assess risk and financial exposure. They are used to tune policies and portfolios in order for companies to remain solvent in the face of extreme events and the costs incurred. This Center will provide research and ideas that allow the insurance sector to continue providing policies and supporting the recovery of disaster affected communities and regions. University-faculty-driven ideas and research projects that address the insurance sector's collective needs are the focus of any IUCRC. The proposed Center will also include in its consideration critical elements that affect rate payers like social and environmental equity, community resilience, and planning and investment across multiple temporal scales. A Center, such as that proposed will deliver climate risk mitigation and possible means of community adaptation. Broader impacts of the Center include development of sustainable solutions to climate change that are paired with novel modeling techniques, insurance products, and technical approaches. It will also form an engine for catastrophe model workforce development as well as a much needed research engine from which insurance companies and their decision on policies and portfolios can be used to stimulate, incentivize, and help better determine risk and financial implications of natural disasters. The Center will formalize the catastrophe modeling field into a distinct academic discipline and create and provide its first formal, coherent educational program and curriculum. This addresses a serious industry need in terms of development of a skilled catastrophe modeling workforce.<br/> <br/>Catastrophe modeling exists as a key discipline in the insurance and finance industries. It focuses on rare events and combines physics-based models with the limited data available for some natural disasters. The approach can be applied beyond natural disaster crises, however, to those in the financial sector, to political unrest, and to pandemics. The proposed Center for Climate, Equity, and Resilience in CatModeling (CERCat) will pursue a convergent educational and research agenda that generates new knowledge so the insurance and finance sectors of the economy can use Center project results to overcome hurdles in the sector's inability to adequately asses risk and the economic implications of climate-driven disasters brought on by rapidly changing and unexpected weather patterns. The Center will adopt a probabilistic approach to study natural disasters, with the purpose of computing expected losses, risk, and premiums. Faculty from a variety of disciplines at the two universities forming the Center (Lehigh University and Rice University) have coalesced with the purpose of addressing the impacts of climate and weather uncertainty on insurance and re-insurance companies and these sectors' abilities to provide a stable economic environment in which risk is sufficiently distributed and disaster outcomes can be reasonably well predicted to provide essential financial coverage for those needing to insure against catastrophic loss. Center research thrusts include examining feedback loops among the various models being used and using multidisciplinary investigations to tackle challenges of high impact and importance to the insurance/risk assessment sectors so they can create new and improved products and services. Center faculty and research draw expertise and insights from engineering, social science, data science, climate science, and economics. The Center's goal is to create and translate new concepts, tools, utilities, and algorithms from academia to private sector enterprises and government.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cancer remains a global health concern, with substantial resources being allocated to the discovery and development of next generation anticancer therapies. While mutational scanning has been performed in academic labs, this project will evaluate the commercial potential of a drug screening platform as a service to pharmaceutical companies. There are currently no commercially available services that can profile a compound and successfully predict clinical drug resistance with high accuracy. Comprehensive profiling of investigational drugs at the preclinical stage of development will aid in the design and selection of promising compounds, ideally resulting in more successful clinical trials and accelerating the speed with which better cures for cancer are made available to patients.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of Deep Mutational Scanning with Duplex Sequencing (DMS-DS), a technology that can comprehensively map the mutational landscape of investigational anti-cancer compounds and predict clinical drug resistance in cancer. DMS-DS overcomes the limitations of existing methods for scanning drug resistance by directly measuring the effect of every potential point mutation within the drug target in a quantifiable and translatable way. With this solution, the specific clinical exposure levels required to counteract resistance mutations can be assessed, thereby informing critical dosing decisions during clinical trials. A proof-of-concept was developed and validated using a DMS-DS drug screening platform for BCR-ABL, a genetic test that looks for an abnormal gene that is linked to certain types of blood cancer. The process used duplex sequencing to evaluate a modular BCR-ABL kinase library treated with a compound of interest administered at a clinically relevant concentration. DMS-DS successfully identified all clinically known imatinib resistant mutations and classified 18 variants of uncertain drug resistance with >98% accuracy and a detection limit below 1 in 10,000 cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Leveraging these multimodal biological and environmental signals and reliable machine learning algorithms, diagnostic markers of ASD in young children will be identified. The outcomes of this research can confirm findings suggesting that repetitive movement is one of the important biomarkers and at the same time investigate other behavioral and physiological biomarkers to increase sensitivity and specificity of ASD detection earlier in children?s development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, Black women comprise less than 1% of the workforce at the most popular U.S. software companies. Low participation of Black students in CS areas is often attributed to a lack of ?preparatory privilege,? encompassing the unavailability of resources and experiences that build content knowledge and associated skills, and few role models. This Scaling, Expanding, and Iterating Innovations project will scale up a successful project that engaged Black young women in high schools throughout the state of Alabama in a year-long peer-learning community to prepare them for the College Board?s Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course. Called LEGACY++, the project will expand the focus to 500 students, adding two other states - Mississippi and Ohio. To do so, it will create a partnership among (1) post-secondary institutions in diverse cultural settings (urban and rural); (2) collaborators that specialize in analyzing programmatic outcomes and identifying factors that promote student success in CS; and (3) industry partners to connect students with new learning experiences from the automotive, wireless, and health sector domains. Eighteen Black CS Teacher Leaders will receive training across the tri-State partnership to facilitate an immersive summer institute experience to initiate the preparation of students for the AP CSP course at their school. Interactions will continue during the school year to promote students? AP exam readiness through curriculum workshops focused on AP CSP topics and interactions with multiple mentors who are all Black women. Students will also be provided with resources to mitigate the barriers to CS access often faced by low-income families, such as access to a peer learning community with scheduled meetings over the academic year. <br/><br/>The LEGACY++ Scholars will represent Black young women from three states to imbue CS content knowledge and an awareness of opportunities in CS-related occupations. LEGACY++ Scholars will learn AP CSP concepts through culturally responsive instruction and project-based learning facilitated by tools to support remote student collaborations to highlight the nature of virtual work, while connecting with new learning experiences from industry partners, their own life situations, and career aspirations. The synergy among these strategies is a promising approach to stimulate the learning of CS for this population; thus, the project?s activities will explore creative and transformative approaches targeted at enabling the participation of groups historically underrepresented in CS careers. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this project include investigating how LEGACY++ activities foster a perception of CS as a communal endeavor, how creating a community of learners can strengthen participants? identity with CS/technical careers and reduce the effects of stereotype threat, and whether LEGACY++ participation can increase awareness and understanding of CS careers. The LEGACY++ evaluation plan will continuously assess activities and provide quantitative and qualitative feedback by identifying promising practices and evidence of success that stimulate CS interest among Black young women. Data collection and evaluation of the implementation of the program activities will include observations of the Summer Institutes, semi-annual interviews of teacher leaders, annual interviews of program leaders and mentoring board members, and student projects. These data will be analyzed qualitatively in terms of pre-defined program success criteria. Measurable program outcomes will include changes in Scholars? content knowledge and attitudes towards CS, and Scholars? career plans. The knowledge-generation component will investigate how creating a community of learners increases identification, belonging, and persistence in CS among Black women. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this gap in the partnering ecosystem, this project will explore how an open and accessible digital platform that leverages a universal innovation taxonomy can drive new engagements between U.S. universities and industry innovators. The project team will explore what enables or blocks successful matchmaking and how a digital platform can democratize access to industry partners regardless of a researcher?s geography or institutional status. To maximize impact, this project will involve the design and deployment of software features accessible to users (rather than pure prototypes for lab testing purposes). As a result, these features will not only support this research undertaking, but will also facilitate new, diverse, sustainable and impactful real-world partnering relationships. <br/><br/>In this project, the research efforts will focus on developing effective ways to grow networks of researchers and industry partners within the specific domain of materials science and engineering.

Statewide project partners include the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, University of Maine, University of Southern Maine, University of Maine at Fort Kent, and Southern Maine Community College. These partners will leverage current and evolving infrastructure investments to enhance the growth of the Research & Development (R&D) ecosystem in Maine. The project includes four synergistic cores that aim to support building additional research capacity in Maine. The administrative core will advance diversity, coordination, evaluation, reporting, growth, and sustainability in the state. The K-16/workforce readiness core will address STEM worker shortages and develop pathways to broaden the participation of institutions and individuals in the state?s research ecosystem. These efforts will focus on Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, Emerging Research Institutions, and youth from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The academic facilities and research infrastructure core will invest in early career faculty, incentivize collaboration across organizations and disciplines, and strengthen R&D through seed grants that align with Maine?s Science and Technology plan. The economic development and use-inspired core will generate new knowledge about research translation and how to measure and communicate the impact of specific R&D investments to inform decision-makers. Team science is built into the project to support its leaders and program participants, including graduate students and postdocs. The overarching societal benefit of the project is the development of an enhanced and productive research ecosystem that fully engages different institution types and sectors.<br/><br/>This E-CORE RII project will advance understanding of how to increase R&D competitiveness in rural areas. Building strong networks across organizations will create and sustain an inclusive statewide network connecting major research efforts and individuals. The project has potential to generate new, actionable knowledge about how synergistic interventions, integrated across four cores that undergird research capacity, can strengthen the research ecosystem within Maine specifically, and, more generally, within rural states with limited and highly distributed research and STEM assets. The project includes a framework for an evidence-based initiative designed to prepare STEM faculty in Indigenous knowledge and foster systemic changes in Maine?s institutions of higher learning and subsequently its STEM workforce. Additionally, project cores will deploy convergent research approaches grounded in sociocultural learning theory and research-to-practice partnerships to generate new knowledge regarding (i) collaboration among STEM educators, (ii) pathways to STEM education, (iii) acquisition of STEM content, and (iv) Indigenous Sciences integration into the undergraduate curriculum through dialogues led by Cultural Knowledge Keepers. Short-term outcomes of the project will include: a new Indigenous Science program; new professional development programs for educators, particularly those who serve underrepresented youth with authentic STEM research experiences; and research and work-readiness experiences for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. Longer-term outcomes include: improved faculty retention and related increases in faculty productivity; fuller participation in research by institutions across the state; improved stakeholder understanding of the positive impacts of R&D investment; greater engagement and retention of students, faculty, and staff historically underrepresented in STEM; a more robust integration of Research-Practice Partnerships that strengthen and sustain education, training, and professional development for Maine?s STEM workforce; and more start-up businesses, entrepreneurial capacity, and commercialization outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, Black women comprise less than 1% of the workforce at the most popular U.S. software companies. Low participation of Black students in CS areas is often attributed to a lack of ?preparatory privilege,? encompassing the unavailability of resources and experiences that build content knowledge and associated skills, and few role models. This Scaling, Expanding, and Iterating Innovations project will scale up a successful project that engaged Black young women in high schools throughout the state of Alabama in a year-long peer-learning community to prepare them for the College Board?s Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course. Called LEGACY++, the project will expand the focus to 500 students, adding two other states - Mississippi and Ohio. To do so, it will create a partnership among (1) post-secondary institutions in diverse cultural settings (urban and rural); (2) collaborators that specialize in analyzing programmatic outcomes and identifying factors that promote student success in CS; and (3) industry partners to connect students with new learning experiences from the automotive, wireless, and health sector domains. Eighteen Black CS Teacher Leaders will receive training across the tri-State partnership to facilitate an immersive summer institute experience to initiate the preparation of students for the AP CSP course at their school. Interactions will continue during the school year to promote students? AP exam readiness through curriculum workshops focused on AP CSP topics and interactions with multiple mentors who are all Black women. Students will also be provided with resources to mitigate the barriers to CS access often faced by low-income families, such as access to a peer learning community with scheduled meetings over the academic year. <br/><br/>The LEGACY++ Scholars will represent Black young women from three states to imbue CS content knowledge and an awareness of opportunities in CS-related occupations. LEGACY++ Scholars will learn AP CSP concepts through culturally responsive instruction and project-based learning facilitated by tools to support remote student collaborations to highlight the nature of virtual work, while connecting with new learning experiences from industry partners, their own life situations, and career aspirations. The synergy among these strategies is a promising approach to stimulate the learning of CS for this population; thus, the project?s activities will explore creative and transformative approaches targeted at enabling the participation of groups historically underrepresented in CS careers. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this project include investigating how LEGACY++ activities foster a perception of CS as a communal endeavor, how creating a community of learners can strengthen participants? identity with CS/technical careers and reduce the effects of stereotype threat, and whether LEGACY++ participation can increase awareness and understanding of CS careers. The LEGACY++ evaluation plan will continuously assess activities and provide quantitative and qualitative feedback by identifying promising practices and evidence of success that stimulate CS interest among Black young women. Data collection and evaluation of the implementation of the program activities will include observations of the Summer Institutes, semi-annual interviews of teacher leaders, annual interviews of program leaders and mentoring board members, and student projects. These data will be analyzed qualitatively in terms of pre-defined program success criteria. Measurable program outcomes will include changes in Scholars? content knowledge and attitudes towards CS, and Scholars? career plans. The knowledge-generation component will investigate how creating a community of learners increases identification, belonging, and persistence in CS among Black women. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on computational methods for control of optimal transport and mixing of some quantity of interest in fluid flows.  The question of what fluid flow maximizes mixing rate, slows it down, or even steers a quantity of interest toward a desired target distribution draws great attention from a broad range of scientists and engineers in the area of complex dynamical systems. The goal of this project is to place these problems within a flexible computational framework, and to develop a solution strategy based on optimal control tools, data compression strategies, and methods to reduce the complexity of the mathematical models. This project will also help the training and development of graduate students across different disciplines to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods for solving these problems.<br/><br/><br/>The project is concerned with the development and analysis of numerical methods for optimal control for mixing in fluid flows.  More precisely, the transport equation is used to describe the non-dissipative scalar field advected by the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes flows. The research aims at achieving optimal mixing via an active control of the flow velocity and constructing efficient numerical schemes for solving this problem. Various control designs will be investigated to steer the fluid flows. Sparsity of the optimal boundary control will be promoted via a non-smooth penalty term in the objective functional. This essentially leads to a highly challenging nonlinear non-smooth control problem for a coupled parabolic and hyperbolic system, or a semi-dissipative system. The project will establish a novel and rigorous mathematical framework and also new accurate and efficient computational techniques for these difficult optimal control problems. Compatible discretization methods for coupled flow and transport will be employed to discretize the controlled system and implement the optimal control designs numerically. Numerical schemes for the highly complicated optimality system will be constructed and analyzed in a systematic fashion. New incremental data compression techniques will be utilized to avoid storing extremely large solution data sets in the iterative solvers, and new model order reduction techniques specifically designed for the optimal mixing problem will be developed to increase efficiency. The synthesis of optimal control and numerical approximation will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in many other complex and real-world flow dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Synthetic data is artificially generated data that is statistically similar to real-world datasets used by businesses. Synthetic data can be used for analytics and machine learning when access to real data is limited and may have uses in augmenting minority representation in real-world datasets thereby aiding in more equitable outcomes. Overall, the broad applicability of synthetic datasets has the potential to drive innovation in healthcare and other industries by allowing businesses to share synthetic versions of proprietary data with strategic partners, such as data analytics companies, and remain in full compliance with data privacy laws. This ability can lead to an increase in data-driven decision-making in the private sector and effective policy formulation in the public sector. For instance, applications of synthetic medical data may help healthcare researchers and administrators to better model patient activity, including representative data of understudied populations, and ultimately improve human health.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the prior development of a non-deep learning technique to generate synthetic datasets using features of real data. Synthetic data is artificially generated data that is statistically similar to real datasets and can be used for analytics and machine learning when access to real data is limited. This innovative solution allows significantly faster generation of tabular and timeseries synthetic data without the need for training or optimization processes, while internally using linear algebra-based techniques. Although this solution was initially created to generate synthetic timeseries data, it can be modified to generate synthetic tabular data.  This solution is completely non-parametric and does not involve the additional steps associated with training and optimization, making it 300x faster than state-of-the-art deep learning generation methods for tabular data. Thus, this approach can generate richly structured datasets using significantly less computing time relative to deep-learning methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To provide high-quality and interactive experiences, XR apps on mobile devices such as smartphones will need to offload heavy computational tasks such as object detection and video frame rendering to edge servers at low latency and high data rates, which places high bandwidth demands on the wireless network. While 5G millimeter wave networks promise unprecedented data rates and ultra-low latency for wireless communication, their performance is not optimized for dynamic networks where signals may be blocked and the user may be moving. Additionally, today's edge servers are attached to the core of the cell phone network (called the mobile packet core network), resulting in long round trip times unsuitable for high frame rate XR applications. To address these shortcomings of today?s 5G millimeter wave network and edge infrastructure, this project proposes an enhanced edge architecture for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks featuring (i) dense base station deployment, (ii) caching of XR contents to eliminate long processing latency of heavy computational tasks, and (iii) a distributed infrastructure with computational and storage units attached to each base station and mobile packet core router to reduce the round trip times between mobile devices and edge servers. Using this new architecture, the project develops TARGET, a novel algorithmic framework for latency-aware edge computing for XR in B5G networks. TARGET establishes the theoretical foundations for enabling seamless mobile high-quality XR applications, enabled by the anticipated wide deployment of 5G and B5G networks. The proposed research activities also offer new materials for integration in classes taught by the PIs and help extend the PIs? excellent track record of involving undergraduate students and recruiting students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The TARGET framework consists of algorithms that (i) jointly optimize base station association/handover and beamforming directions for both uplink and downlink to minimize wireless latency by maximizing a weighted sum rate; (ii) jointly optimize caching and routing over general multi-hop edge computing networks to meet end-to-end latency constraints; and (iii) optimally trade off the computation and storage resources of a distributed hierarchical computing/storage infrastructure, through joint routing, computation placement and caching, to minimize end-to-end latency. The project examines both traditional optimization approaches and complementary machine learning approaches in designing and integrating these algorithms. The algorithms and protocols are evaluated via extensive network simulations along with experimental validation on two Northeastern University testbeds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enumerative geometry is the study of a particular class of mathematical problems, called enumerative problems, which are fundamental to STEM fields including mathematics, particle physics, robotics, and computer vision. The main goal of this workshop is to unite experts working on problems related to enumerative geometry to increase dialogue between theory and application. There will be several talks on state-of-the-art research in computational and applied enumerative geometry, software demonstrations, and time to discuss open problems. The exchange of ideas will inform experts as they continue devising computational investigations of enumerative problems going forward. The grant supports the participation of fifteen US-based participants in the workshops. <br/><br/>Classically, an enumerative problem asks how many geometric objects have a prescribed position with respect to other fixed geometric objects. Famous examples include the problems of (a) 2 lines meeting four lines, (b) 27 lines on a cubic surface, and (c) 3264 conics tangent to five conics in the plane. A modern definition of an enumerative problem is a system of polynomial equations in variables and parameters with finitely many solutions given fixed generic parameters.  Counting solutions to such a problem is the tip of the iceberg.  Beyond enumeration lie questions of symmetries, solvability, real behavior, and computation.  Techniques from a broad range of disciplines lend themselves to the creation of algorithms and software designed to answer these questions. ""Computational Enumerative Geometry"" refers to this approach of using computers to solve, experiment with, and prove theorems about, enumerative problems.

The development of numeracy is also associated with major functional reorganization of the brain. However, the relationship between these brain changes and the development of numeracy remains unclear. The purpose of this project is to advance our understanding of the relationship between brain and cognitive development during early numeracy acquisition. This will be accomplished by measuring and analyzing the relationship between functional brain organization and numerical development in a large, diverse group of children at three critical developmental time points from 3-6 years of age. Doing this will establish a coherent timeline of brain and cognitive development in the emergence of numeracy from early to middle childhood, advance understanding of the underlying biological and cognitive mechanisms, and determine what early brain and cognitive-behavioral factors are most predictive of mathematics achievement in the first year of elementary school. Results regarding predictive factors and underlying mechanisms of numeracy will provide a foundation that may inform future curricular interventions and parenting practices that promote early numeracy in preschool children. Brain development results will provide a novel empirical basis on which to identify and evaluate typical and atypical developmental trajectories in individuals before entering school.<br/><br/>This project will harness the complementary strengths of temporally-resolved electrophysiological brain measures (event-related potentials, ERP) and spatially-resolved optical measures (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS) to track key functional brain changes longitudinally from before children are numerate (~3 years), during numeracy acquisition (~4 years), and after they have started formal schooling (~5-6 years). Symbolic numeracy abilities will also be assessed at all these timepoints using standardized and experimental tasks. Specific efforts will be made to recruit a racially and socio-economically diverse sample and tailor methods and procedures to maximize inclusion. Statistical models will then be applied to identify developmental predictors and assess directionality in longitudinal brain-behavior relationships, while also rigorously accounting for non-numerical cognitive, linguistic, and maturational factors. Results will increase understanding as to whether and to what extent relationships between brain changes and cognitive development in numeracy result from general cognitive development or number-specific experience, identify early predictors of school readiness, and provide insights into the cognitive and brain mechanisms that support numeracy learning. Results also promise to adjudicate between theories of numeracy development, including whether and to what extent core non-verbal number systems form a foundation for symbolic numeracy, whether numerical development involves conceptual change or knowledge enrichment, and whether numeracy is supported by domain-general or domain-specific learning mechanisms. The hope is that results will also lead to new theories on the broader relationship between biology and culture. This project is supported by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, Black women comprise less than 1% of the workforce at the most popular U.S. software companies. Low participation of Black students in CS areas is often attributed to a lack of ?preparatory privilege,? encompassing the unavailability of resources and experiences that build content knowledge and associated skills, and few role models. This Scaling, Expanding, and Iterating Innovations project will scale up a successful project that engaged Black young women in high schools throughout the state of Alabama in a year-long peer-learning community to prepare them for the College Board?s Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course. Called LEGACY++, the project will expand the focus to 500 students, adding two other states - Mississippi and Ohio. To do so, it will create a partnership among (1) post-secondary institutions in diverse cultural settings (urban and rural); (2) collaborators that specialize in analyzing programmatic outcomes and identifying factors that promote student success in CS; and (3) industry partners to connect students with new learning experiences from the automotive, wireless, and health sector domains. Eighteen Black CS Teacher Leaders will receive training across the tri-State partnership to facilitate an immersive summer institute experience to initiate the preparation of students for the AP CSP course at their school. Interactions will continue during the school year to promote students? AP exam readiness through curriculum workshops focused on AP CSP topics and interactions with multiple mentors who are all Black women. Students will also be provided with resources to mitigate the barriers to CS access often faced by low-income families, such as access to a peer learning community with scheduled meetings over the academic year. <br/><br/>The LEGACY++ Scholars will represent Black young women from three states to imbue CS content knowledge and an awareness of opportunities in CS-related occupations. LEGACY++ Scholars will learn AP CSP concepts through culturally responsive instruction and project-based learning facilitated by tools to support remote student collaborations to highlight the nature of virtual work, while connecting with new learning experiences from industry partners, their own life situations, and career aspirations. The synergy among these strategies is a promising approach to stimulate the learning of CS for this population; thus, the project?s activities will explore creative and transformative approaches targeted at enabling the participation of groups historically underrepresented in CS careers. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this project include investigating how LEGACY++ activities foster a perception of CS as a communal endeavor, how creating a community of learners can strengthen participants? identity with CS/technical careers and reduce the effects of stereotype threat, and whether LEGACY++ participation can increase awareness and understanding of CS careers. The LEGACY++ evaluation plan will continuously assess activities and provide quantitative and qualitative feedback by identifying promising practices and evidence of success that stimulate CS interest among Black young women. Data collection and evaluation of the implementation of the program activities will include observations of the Summer Institutes, semi-annual interviews of teacher leaders, annual interviews of program leaders and mentoring board members, and student projects. These data will be analyzed qualitatively in terms of pre-defined program success criteria. Measurable program outcomes will include changes in Scholars? content knowledge and attitudes towards CS, and Scholars? career plans. The knowledge-generation component will investigate how creating a community of learners increases identification, belonging, and persistence in CS among Black women. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In most existing autonomy architectures, the ambient environment remains beyond the direct control of the robots. Thus, if the structure of the environment prevents the robots from accomplishing their tasks, then existing autonomy algorithms will return a mission failure message. This situation can naturally occur in mission scenarios in unstructured environments where pathways towards regions of interest may be blocked by unexpected objects or disconnected with unexpected physical gaps. The autonomy methods anticipated to be developed by research funded via this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will enable robots to reason about when and how to physically interact with the environment by re-configuring its structure to accomplish their tasks. The developed algorithms are anticipated to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability of collaborative robots in diverse humanitarian and scientific applications in unstructured environments, such as search-and-rescue, disaster response, and surveillance. In addition, the research will inspire several educational activities that include developing a suite of open-source education materials (e.g., lectures, software, and robot demonstrations), curriculum development, as well as outreach and research activities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students.<br/><br/>The research agenda will be achieved by designing foundational interactive perception-based planning capabilities for robot teams operating in unknown and unstructured environments. These capabilities will empower robots to collaboratively engage with the perceived environment, while also accounting for imperfect perception, and respond to unanticipated events that could otherwise impede task completion. In particular, this project will develop multi-robot planning algorithms that, given a high-level task, jointly design (i) cooperative manipulation plans orchestrating the interaction with the perceived environment to facilitate task completion, as well as (ii) motion plans to complete assigned tasks. To ensure safe robot-environment interaction, the developed planners will also be integrated with active perception techniques mitigating geometric and semantic environmental uncertainty arising due to imperfect perception. These research results will be grounded through extensive evaluations on both physical robotic testbeds and photorealistic simulators with particular emphasis on autonomous delivery and search-and-rescue applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for pathways for young learners to develop interest and confidence in STEM and to become motivated to work in STEM fields is recognized by SD?s Science & Technology (S&T) Plan, which identifies the importance of ""Ideas, Talent, and Companies."" This collaborative project incorporates three public and one private primarily undergraduate institutions, three Tribal Colleges & Universities (TCUs), and three PhD-granting institutions. Additional partners include a specialty school for students with disabilities, SD Board of Regents, SD Department of Education, and a US Department of Energy-funded research facility. An informal science education center across the jurisdiction focuses on ""talent"" and on the S&T plan's two related strategies to strengthen the SD research ecosystem. These two strategies are (i) increasing the diversity, inclusion, and equity of the SD STEM workforce; and (ii) cultivating a workforce pipeline by promoting STEM careers with SD K-12 students. The project will build a strong network of educators and researchers and strengthen the STEM education landscape across South Dakota, including within the most rural and remote regions and Tribal communities. K-12 students, their teachers, teacher preparation programs, families, post-secondary faculty, and STEM researchers will all benefit. The citizenry will be better informed about STEM research underway within SD, and a broader array of students will see that they are welcome to a seat at the table and are supported to succeed in STEM.

This Network is designed to generate interaction and collaboration between health practitioners who worry about what goes on inside the patient and earth, atmosphere, climate, and ocean scientists who study the earth and physical environment from which mnay climate-induced causes and triggers of human health conditions originate. The Network is an ambitious five-year program of structured and synergistic convenings, webinars, in-person meetings, and other interactions between health and medical practitioners and geoscientists to bring together the fields required for a holisitic approach to solving and perhaps devising novel means of mitigating serious medical conditions tied to climate changge. The GeoCAFE builds on the foundation and existing infrastructure of the National Institutes of Health-funded CAFE Research Coordinating Center is managed as a joint effort between the Schools of Public Health at Boston University and Harvard University. The CAFE acronym stands for: Convene, Accelerate, Foster, and Expand the global climate change and health community of practice. The CAFE has a track record already of successfully convening the community of experts across diverse health fields. However, GeoCAFE was initiated because it is recognized in the medical/health community that there is a critical need to expand these conversations, planning sessings, collaborations, and joint actions to other fields, like geoscience, to ensure the fields of both climate change and health research benefit from meaningful engagement of experts in the sciences that study climate change and health/medical science. Broader impacts of the project include providing cross/transdisciplinary interactions focused on accelerating advances in climate-induced medical conditions, engagement of both geo- and health scientists, early in their career, so they can effectively communicate, understand, and collaborate on joint projects to improve human health. <br/><br/>Climate change poses substantial risks to human health.

CAFE RCC is successfully convening the community of experts across diverse health fields, but there is a critical need to expand CAFE to ensure that the field of climate change and health research benefits from meaningful bi-directional collaboration and engagement between experts in the climate sciences and health sciences.<br/>The GeoCAFE RCN seeks to: 1) actively recruit geoscientists to the growing community of climate and health research, with a view to increasing diversity (writ large) in this community, 2) increase dialogue and mutual understanding between experts in the geosciences and health sciences, and 3) accelerate the pace of research and translation in climate and health by fostering meaningful collaboration across all disciplines necessary to advance this agenda. To achieve these goals, the RCN will host a series of virtual events, create new interdisciplinary cohorts of climate and health researchers that gather in-person twice per year, and apply to bring the International Conference on Urban Climate (ICUC) to Boston University. The RCN will be led by three top experts across the health and geosciences with further support and guidance provided by a Steering Committee of five additional distinguished geoscientists. Program participants will be drawn from a wider existing network of collaborators across the geosciences community. Success of the network will be assessed regularly and program offerings optimized accordingly.<br/>The proposed GeoCAFE RCN will build upon the substantial programming and infrastructure already available as part of the NIH-funded CAFE RCC. We expect that this innovative combination of activities will foster new engagement and collaboration across the geosciences and health science, break down silos between disciplines, and meaningfully accelerate urgently-needed research at the intersection of climate change and human health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improvements in the sensitivity in the Advanced LIGO detectors made this revolution possible. Planned future upgrades to improve detector sensitivity will require reduced-thermal-noise mirror coatings that are used in the detector optics. These improvements will continue to impact gravitational-wave astronomy for at least 20 years. A planned upgrade called A-sharp aims to reduce the thermal noise from the mirror coatings by at least half. The challenge of developing lower thermal noise coatings requires progress in the understanding of the physics of amorphous oxide materials, which is the core research focus of this collaborative project. The collaboration brings together experts in both experimental and theoretical aspects of this research at Stanford University and the University of Florida. The goal is to create mirror coatings that meet the necessary standards for use in future LIGO detectors. The team will continue to train the next generation of STEM researchers and professionals through their multidisciplinary activities and outreach activities.<br/><br/>Future planned upgrades to LIGO will seek to install mirrors with further improved coatings, in particular with lower Brownian thermal noise (BTN), which is a key noise source limiting detector sensitivity. The baseline design for the potential A-sharp upgrade calls for a coating thermal noise reduced by a factor of at least two with respect to Advanced LIGO + (A+) levels. Synergies between the Stanford-Florida program and the Center for Coatings Research (CCR) have enabled considerable progress under previous support. Having identified, based on characterization via X-ray scattering and atomic structure modeling, the connection between room-temperature mechanical losses and edge- and face-shared polyhedral structural motifs, the team proposed Ti-doped GeO2 as a high refractive-index low-mechanical-loss coating. Subsequent experimental work in the CCR and LIGO Lab supported this identification, leading to the selection of this material for the A+ mirrors. The research conducted under this award builds on these results, with a goal of finding coating solutions with a further factor of two reduction in thermal noise for mirror upgrades and/or an A-sharp system. The group will work iteratively with deposition groups developing amorphous coatings, both refining the atomic structure models with data generated from the materials they deposit, and by providing those groups with guidance for next steps in their synthesis campaigns based on the results from the atomic structure and modeling efforts. While the major portion of our work will remain focused on amorphous coatings, the group will also continue to contribute to crystalline AlGaAs coatings by characterizing optical absorption and developing models for birefringence and observed excess noise above the expected Brownian contribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for pathways for young learners to develop interest and confidence in STEM and to become motivated to work in STEM fields is recognized by SD?s Science & Technology (S&T) Plan, which identifies the importance of ""Ideas, Talent, and Companies."" This collaborative project incorporates three public and one private primarily undergraduate institutions, three Tribal Colleges & Universities (TCUs), and three PhD-granting institutions. Additional partners include a specialty school for students with disabilities, SD Board of Regents, SD Department of Education, and a US Department of Energy-funded research facility. An informal science education center across the jurisdiction focuses on ""talent"" and on the S&T plan's two related strategies to strengthen the SD research ecosystem. These two strategies are (i) increasing the diversity, inclusion, and equity of the SD STEM workforce; and (ii) cultivating a workforce pipeline by promoting STEM careers with SD K-12 students. The project will build a strong network of educators and researchers and strengthen the STEM education landscape across South Dakota, including within the most rural and remote regions and Tribal communities. K-12 students, their teachers, teacher preparation programs, families, post-secondary faculty, and STEM researchers will all benefit. The citizenry will be better informed about STEM research underway within SD, and a broader array of students will see that they are welcome to a seat at the table and are supported to succeed in STEM. Inspiring more underrepresented students to pursue careers in STEM has the potential to strengthen the research enterprise in the state and nationwide.<br/><br/>This project is led by Black Hills State University, a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) within the SD Board of Regents system. The project?s 35-member leadership team represents a collaboration across a breadth of SD organizations and institutions (i.e., Oglala Lakota College, University of South Dakota Main Campus, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Dakota State University, South Dakota State University, Augustana University Association, Northern State University, Sinte Gleska University, Sisseton Wahpeton College, Sanford Underground Research Facility/SD Science and Technology Authority, South Dakota Discovery Center). In service to the SD S&T plan, this project includes an Administrative Core focused specifically on STEM education, both in-school and out-of-school, and on three additional cores in STEM Education (K-16), Broadening Participation, and Community Engagement & Outreach. Through these cores, the project will build a jurisdiction-wide network with 6 project goals. The project seeks to: (i) enhance the ability of STEM researchers to engage effectively with K-12 educators and students, the general public, and other audiences outside their disciplines; (ii) identify and nurture STEM teacher leaders, equipping them to strengthen STEM education within their school buildings and districts and to advance STEM education across the state; (iii) enhance the ability of all K-12 teachers to deliver high-quality STEM instruction, especially those who serve rural and Native American populations; (iv) strengthen the level of interest, sense of belonging, and academic preparation in STEM of SD's full array of students ? from kindergarten through high school and into post-secondary; (v) generate and share research findings relevant beyond SD about STEM teacher leadership, building student identity in STEM, and factors important in supporting Native American students in STEM; and (vi) provide STEM education guidance and support to the SD Jurisdictional Steering Committee in strengthening collaboration among researchers, educators, and STEM education programs across SD, and to catalyze yet-to-be envisioned efforts related to STEM education. The project has potential to engage STEM researchers, K-12 teachers, and K-12 students in an interconnected network designed to create a pipeline of the next generation for the SD STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This region, termed the Western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) releases a vast amount of water vapor and heat into the atmosphere and is thus a key region for regulating global climate and hydrology.  Principal Investigators B. Linsley and K. Gibson have recently discovered that in the previous two time periods of global warming during the transition from glacial conditions to interglacial conditions, that the layer of the ocean 100 meters below the warm surface begins warming and reaches peak warming several thousand years before the surface ocean. They have observed this through geochemical analysis of calcareous microfossil shells preserved in deep sea sediment cores recovered from the WPWP. Modern ocean circulation patterns suggest that this subsurface warming is initiated in the Southern Hemisphere. The main objective of this research project will be to extend the geochemical record back in time to better understand the pattern of subsurface western Pacific warm pool warming during other glacial-interglacial transitions over the last 1.5 million years. A key question is whether the subsurface warming in this region of the ocean is a triggering event for the global warming that occurred after each of the multiple glaciations that occurred during this time period, and how changes in the Southern Hemisphere might influence the WPWP and global hydroclimate in our present period of climate change. Outreach, training, and educational activities are broad and include high school, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as the general public. <br/><br/><br/>There is a growing body of paleoclimate evidence pointing to the importance of South Pacific forcing of the lower latitude Pacific, and in particular the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) thermocline. Just below the buoyant surface layer in the WPWP are waters of subtropical origin with ~ 70% supplied from the South Pacific gyre region. This is part of the shallow overturning cell-western boundary current circulation that transmits water at thermocline depths to the WPWP where it mixes with the Northern Hemisphere western boundary current.  Much of this subtropical South Pacific water flows as part of the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent into the Bismarck Sea where our study site, International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1486 is located. The South Pacific influence on oceanographic conditions in the Bismarck Sea indicates that sediment cores from this strategic location can be used to reconstruct temporal changes of the southern Hemisphere influence on the WPWP thermocline. Preliminary surface ocean and thermocline-depth foraminifera oxygen isotopes  and Mg/Ca results from Site 1486 indicate a 3-4C warming of the thermocline that started several thousand years before the deglacial transitions at Marine Isotope Stages 2/1 and 6/5. Thermocline temperatures then peaked in the early interglacials at 11 and 126 kyr, followed by abrupt cooling that lasted several thousand years. These are time periods when maximum Earth axial tilt and minimum precession align, suggesting a connection between warming of the WPWP thermocline, maximum obliquity angle and time periods when the summer solstice occurs at perihelion.  The Principal Investigators will analyze three species of mixed layer- and thermocline-depth fossil foraminifera shells for oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca from Site 1486 back to 1.5 Ma at a millennial-scale downcore timestep, spanning the entire mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT). This will allow them to determine when this pattern of early interglacial thermocline warmth developed relative to surface conditions and investigate the following questions: Is there a consistent relationship between thermocline warming in the region of Site 1486 and periods when obliquity angle was at a maximum and precession at a minimum? Are thermocline warming events consistent features of all interglacial periods in the WPWP or just in the latest Pleistocene?  Given the importance of the WPWP to global climate and hydrology, the possibility that WPWP thermocline warming prior to and during glacial-interglacial transitions were triggering events with global implications needs to be explored. Since some recent studies have hypothesized a southern hemisphere origin for the dominant phase of the last glacial termination, our results documenting early interglacial warming in the Bismarck Sea sector of the WPWP thermocline may support this idea. Thus, determining the temporal relationship between WPWP thermocline warming events and past deglacial ?global warming? events is important in the context of current climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In answering this question most people visualize their dwelling as they imagine walking around to count the windows. Surprisingly, about 7% of people answer this question correctly but do not ?see? their home in their mind. Such people are ?aphantasic? meaning that they do not experience images in their mind. The fact that aphantasics can answer such questions without ?seeing? their home, suggests a need to change the understanding of how people with and without aphantasia manage to think about things that are not present. While people with aphantasia are able to do things like counting windows without experiencing images, they differ from people without aphantasia in that their pupils do not change size when they think about bright objects, like the sun. This difference means that measuring the size of people?s pupils can be used to determine whether or not they are experiencing imagery. This pupil-based method of measuring imagery will then be able to determine whether other animals, like apes and monkeys, use visual imagery. Determining whether other animals experience imagery is critical for understanding how visual imagery evolved, what purpose it serves in human thinking, and provides better animal models to use in research to understand and improve human mental health.<br/><br/>At this point, it is unclear whether experiments done with people with aphantasia can be extended to other animals. This project tests whether the experiments conducted previously with humans are correct and extends them to conditions that will allow tests with other primates, like monkeys and orangutans. Humans are tested in several experiments that determine whether their pupils change size when they think about bright objects. For instance, people are asked to think about the sun while they are looking at an image of a neutral brightness. If their pupils contract more when they think about the sun than when they think about darkness, this shows that what they think about affects the size of their pupils and that they are probably seeing an image in their mind. These experiments are then modified in ways that allow  them to be used with monkeys and apes, and are readministered to humans, to determine if pupil size still indexes mental imagery. This set of experiments provides the necessary preconditions that for eventual experiments with apes and monkeys, allowing these results to be compared with results from humans. The work will be done in part by graduate students and undergraduate students who will receive training in doing the type of cross-species research that advances understanding of human mental function and develop better animal models for biomedical research.

Furthermore, the successful completion of this project will provide compelling evidence for field trials, paving the way for regulatory approval and commercialization. This advancement has significant economic implications, enhancing the competitiveness of the United States and stakeholders by allowing for the reallocation of resources through cost savings, and addressing pressing environmental concerns. This enhanced approach offers significant promise for furthering scientific knowledge and delivering tangible benefits to society by tackling a crucial environmental issue, yielding far-reaching benefits.<br/>The proposed project focuses on developing a scalable and effective biological remediation method that utilizes synergistic interactions between fungi and plants to degrade and remove PFAS from contaminated environments. The project aims to expand on fungi that are able to efficiently degrade PFAS and evaluate their effectiveness in degrading six specific PFAS compounds recommended by the EPA. The research expands the understanding of fungal degradation of PFAS by identifying additional defluorinators and characterizing the resulting breakdown products. The impact of several environmental factors on degradation rates will be assessed to understand how site-specific challenges may impact remediation efforts. Additionally, various delivery methods for microbial inoculation, such as pelleting, soil drenching, and in-furrow application will be evaluated for consistent inoculum application to contaminated sites. Bench trials will assess the efficiency of this approach, combining fungi and hybrid poplars, for PFAS remediation. This research addresses a critical need for effective PFAS remediation methods, expanding the frontier of scientific knowledge in fungal bioremediation, offering a fresh perspective and innovative approach towards mitigating the impacts of PFAS on our ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many modern formulations of food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products are based on mixing two or more fluid components to form a stable emulsion. Typical fluid components, such as oil and water, normally separate into two separate phases. Solid particles added to the mixture prevent the separation and lead to formation of stable compartments that give rise to peculiar structure and properties of the mixture. The compartments can encapsulate and transport specific chemical ingredients, mimicking the function of living cells. Such structured fluids offer us the potential to design smart soft materials that can be controlled and manipulated on demand. However, the complex processes that determine the formation of interfaces and droplets in emulsions over time are incompletely understood, thus hindering the formulation of protocols for control of the evolving fluid structure.<br/><br/>This project aims to use magnetic particles in emulsions to manipulate the formation of interfaces and droplets in external magnetic fields. The PI's research group seeks to explore ways to control phase separation and to stimulate separation and fusion of fluid compartments. This will be done by using magnetic interactions to orient the particles and to manipulate the interface between fluid components. The research will employ large computer simulations on Clemson University's Palmetto cluster, a TOP500 high-performance computing system.<br/><br/>Training of graduate and undergraduate students plays an important role in these activities. The PI will develop innovative teaching materials that support the development of computational competencies and research computing skills. The PI's research group also seeks to enhance outreach and will design showcases of computer-aided materials design to engage a broad audience in the increasingly multidisciplinary field of computational science.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports computational modeling and education in multiscale simulations to understand and control the formation of non-equilibrium structures in complex multiphase fluids. The mesoscale structure and nonlinear rheology of soft interface-dominated materials raises many challenges for the development of control mechanisms that enable design of smart fluids that self-organize and respond to external stimuli. Interfacial assembly of colloidal particles can arrest the phase separation of immiscible fluids such that they become trapped in metastable states, e.g., fluid-bicontinuous gels. These arrested phase states emerge in particulate multicomponent mixtures due to the intricate interplay of physico-chemical interactions across different length and time-scales. The research aims to gain a fundamental understanding of the connection between microscale self-assembly and mesoscale phase formation in particle-stabilized multiphase fluids, with a focus on non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of kinetically arrested phase states. The PI seeks to employ lattice Boltzmann simulations and innovative data analytics to explore avenues for tailoring the phase morphology and rheological properties of complex multiphase fluids.<br/><br/>The research will investigate the use of magnetic particles in external magnetic fields to control interfacial assembly and manipulate the mesoscale structure of droplets and fluid compartments. Large-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations will be used to systematically study the conditions and parameters under which such control is possible for emulsions and fluid-bicontinuous gels. The PI seeks to propel the nascent field of soft materials informatics by developing a data-driven active learning approach for nanofluid assembly with tailored structure-property-processing relations. The integration of multiscale simulation methods and data-centric approaches will foster discovery and design of new nanofluid materials with the expectation of new engineering principles for synthetic systems with targeted functionality.<br/><br/>The project will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to develop advanced computational competencies and research computing skills. The PI will develop curriculum components and teaching materials that integrate diverse aspects of multiscale modeling, high-performance computing, and research software engineering. The simulation methods and software tools developed in this project will enhance the broader computing ecosystem for simulation-based science and engineering. The PI's research team will also design outreach activities showcasing the use of advanced cyberinfastructure and virtual-reality/augmented-reality technology for materials discovery and exploration. The activities aim to increase computing literacy and support broader participation in simulation-driven science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The autonomous charging technology and upcoming drone corridors can extend the drone reach and allow long-range and intercity drone flights. The high technology readiness level of the developed system makes it immediately deployable as soon as the commercial and legal framework is established. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translational potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a high-power wireless drone charger with an integrated charging platform localization and alignment system. The alignment mechanism identifies the drone's position in the platform and promptly begins the wireless charging process within 30 seconds. The designed power converters are based on highly efficient wide bandgap semiconductor devices, which lead to improved gravimetric power density and flight distance with a single charge. The unique approach utilizes wireless charging pads for drone detection, coil alignment, and power transfer, offering a robust solution and eliminating the need for complex alignment circuits. The 700-W fully autonomous wireless charging system is the highest-power-level charger designed with an integrated alignment mechanism that does not require an additional sensing system.

Understanding how such organization emerges, and how it affects biodiversity and processes such as carbon storage and nutrient recycling, is thus a key theme in ecological research and management. Animals that act as ?ecosystem engineers? by modifying the environment are major causes of spatial variation. When multiple engineering species co-occur, each may regulate the behavior and impacts of the other; in this case, the properties of the ecosystem may depend on the interplay between engineers. The goals of this research are to understand how ecosystem engineers interact, how they influence ecosystem organization and function, and how these processes depend on human activity. The project focuses on two influential species at opposite ends of the body-size spectrum: white rhinoceros (one of the biggest land animals, which modify vegetation by grazing and transporting nutrients across landscapes) and termites (which boost plant growth by decomposing organic matter and altering soils) in South Africa?s Kruger National Park. There, the world?s largest population of white rhinoceros occupies a landscape with numerous patchily distributed termite colonies and varying levels of risk from poachers. By tracking rhino behavior, experimentally excluding rhino and/or termite activity, and building detailed 3D landscape maps, the research will give insight into how feedbacks between engineers regulate plant growth and nutrient cycling, and whether the threat of poaching disrupts these processes. Because ecosystem engineers occur worldwide (e.g., prairie dogs, beaver, and bison in North America), knowledge produced through this project will be widely applicable to environmental management. The project will also advance understanding and conservation of white rhinoceros, which are threatened with extinction. Finally, the project will train early-career scientists and engage K-12 school audiences and the public through field- and museum-based programs in the United States and South Africa, deepening public understanding of ecosystem science and the important roles played by animals both large and small.<br/><br/>Researchers will use surveys, exclusion experiments, GPS tracking, hormonal assays, and fecal DNA and nutrient analysis together with high-resolution drone-based remote sensing to measure feedbacks between mega-grazers (white rhino) and soil-dwelling decomposers (fungus-farming termites); how these feedbacks create and maintain heterogeneity, regulate ecosystem functions (productivity, decomposition, nutrient transport, nitrogen mineralization), and affect biodiversity; and whether risk of predation (poaching) alters these feedbacks by modifying rhino behavior and abundance. Specifically, data will be analyzed to test: (1) How do termites affect the movement, diet, and behavior of white rhino, and how does that affect nutrient redistribution? (2) How does rhino activity reciprocally alter termite distribution, and how does this feedback loop affect the spatial organization of species and nutrient cycles? (3) How does human pressure affect rhino behavior and physiology, and does this disrupt the rhino?termite feedback and thus diminish the ecological role of mega-grazers? By working across areas that differ in geology, climate, and poaching risk, the researchers will also evaluate how and why such multi-engineer feedbacks depend on environmental context. Conceptually, the project advances the study of ecosystem engineering by linking it to theories of consumer-resource dynamics and ?landscapes of fear?.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern large-scale AI systems such as Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities, passing a range of benchmark tests in mathematical, medical, and legal reasoning. However, because large-scale AI systems are trained automatically using massive amounts of data?instead of being designed line-by-line by a programmer?the internal workings of the current generation of AI are inscrutable to humans. Understanding how these systems work is an emerging science. But performing science on the internals of such large-scale AI systems requires substantial computational resources that are not practical at institutional scale, because a platform required to study the detailed computations of AI differs from the computing systems used for ordinary commercial deployment of AI. NDIF addresses this critical need by planning to develop a unique nationwide research computing fabric that enables scientists to perform transparent and reproducible experiments on the largest-scale open AI systems, in order to advance our nation?s understanding of their capabilities, as well as their limitations, robustness, safety issues, and impacts on human society.<br/><br/>Led by Northeastern University in partnership with the NSF Delta AI high-performance computing cluster at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, NDIF plans to consist of three major components. (1) A nationwide high-performance computing fabric hosting the largest open pretrained machine learning models for transparent deep inference. This National Deep Inference Fabric is a unique combination of GPU hardware with the creation of a deep network AI inference software to provide a remotely-accessible computing resource for scientists to perform detailed and reproducible experiments on large AI systems on the fabric. Once developed, the fabric will allow many scientists to efficiently and simultaneously share the same AI computing capacity to make efficient use of resources. (2) A novel open-source research software library to be created that enables scientists to develop and deploy new research methods on AI models by creating intervention code that inspects, modifies and customizes AI model computations.

Many of the most promising energy conversion and storage options associated with renewable and sustainable energy rely on catalysis. To develop cost-effective, environmentally benign chemical conversion technologies, it is necessary to continue to deepen our understanding of the fundamental steps in catalytic processes. Many technologically relevant catalytic processes take place on the surfaces of small particles, so-called nanoparticles. Incoming reactant molecules interact with these surfaces and are transformed into new product molecules. Many of the details of how the particle surface facilitates those transformations are still not well understood. Direct observation of molecule-surface interactions will aid the design of more durable and effective catalysts. As a first step towards realizing this goal, it is necessary to directly see reactant molecular layers on nanoparticle surfaces. The goal of the project is to discover how to make such observations of individual molecules on nanoparticle surfaces, and correlate the observations with spatially averaged information obtained by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).<br/><br/>To visualize molecules on nanoparticle surfaces, the project will correlate signals from in situ atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy with in situ FTIR spectroscopy recorded from catalysts with well-defined nanostructures (matching exposure conditions in the respective environmental chambers). The recent availability of newly developed, high sensitivity electron detectors now makes it feasible to sense adsorbate layers on surfaces using electron microscopy, but it is not clear how to optimize the experimental conditions to make such observations a reality. Infrared spectroscopy will provide spatially averaged information on the characteristics of the surface sites where adsorbate binding is most likely to occur. This spectroscopy will direct the electron microscopy to surface regions where the concentration of molecules is high, so that optimum conditions for molecular imaging can be discovered. The investigation will focus on CO oxidation and NO reduction with CO over supported metal catalysts - two reactions of fundamental interest with broad impact on energy and environmental technologies. Specifically, this research will provide information on the heterogeneity of the adsorbate layer structure and dynamics at terrace, edge, facet, and defect sites on nanoparticle surfaces during catalysis. Spatially resolved characterization of real adlayer structures will provide fundamental new insights on the nature of nanoparticle surfaces giving more accurate foundational information for developing structure-reactivity relations. The research will enhance fundamental knowledge of adsorbate structure and dynamics leading to new approaches to catalyst design. The project will provide education and outreach activities to students and the public in the fields of catalysis, nanoparticles, atomic resolution electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To assure the safety and protection of American bridges, the risk posed by the tremendous increase in shipping volume and ship sizes must be assessed. With the need to make decisions quickly to rebuild the Key Bridge and invest in retrofits and protections to existing critical bridges, there are billions of dollars in infrastructure investment at stake. These urgent investment decisions, to be considered by agencies such as the National Transportation Safety Board and Maryland State and Federal Highway Administrations, will benefit from accurate assessment of bridge collapse risk. The impetus to make these critical investments is perishable. To meet this pressing need, this grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will estimate the annual probability that a bridge collapse inducing ship collision will occur and then will compare this probability to existing standards for bridge risk analysis and design. By estimating the annual probability of occurrence, the project will aim to provide vital insight into whether existing U.S. bridge infrastructure is vulnerable to similar collisions or whether the Key Bridge disaster was, in fact, a rare event. The project further will aim to assess the evolution of collision probabilities from the 1970s, when the Key Bridge was built, to modern day to observe how risk to critical bridges has changed over the past 50 years due to increasing ship traffic and the huge growth in vessel size, with a particular focus on estimating future risk to enable informed decision-making processes in both rebuilding and retrofitting efforts. <br/><br/>To estimate annual collision probabilities over time, the project will evaluate global ship Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to estimate the probability of large vessels aberrating from their course near a major U.S. bridge. These AIS data report heading, speed, destination, and status data for every ship globally in transit and provide an abundant stream of historical shipping data from which to assess aberrancy probability. Combining these aberrancy probabilities with estimates of shipping traffic in major American ports and near critical bridges will further allow the estimation of the time evolving collision probabilities for the Key Bridge and other critical bridges in the U.S. These estimates will be used to inform risk analysis for critical bridges by modeling ship collisions as a Poisson process and considering the economic impacts and potential loss of life associated with major bridge collapse. The project, therefore, will aim to answer the fundamental question of evolving bridge collapse risk in the United States to provide decision-makers with immediately actionable data as they prepare to invest in new bridges and bridge protections where needed, revise design standards and shipping practices if necessary, and reconsider risk tolerance in the wake of the Key Bridge disaster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These compartments are connected by proteins that act as bridges by interacting with each other, resulting in complex ""protein interaction networks."" These protein interactions are dynamic and constantly fine tune cellular function. Even minor disruptions in protein interactions can substantially impact a cell?s function and its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, mapping protein interaction networks can enrich our knowledge of cellular responses and help us develop strategies to enhance plant resilience to environmental changes. However, the available methods for identifying and analyzing protein interactions have limitations, particularly when the protein of interest is found in different cellular compartments. This project aims to close this gap by developing new molecular tools to identify protein-protein interactions within specific cellular compartments. This tool will be tested in plant cells and can be applied to study in numerous organisms. The Broader Impact of the work includes its intrinsic merit as all cells contain a myriad of interacting proteins.  Additional activities include the training of undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>When characterizing the biological roles of proteins in different cellular processes, it is crucial to map their interaction networks, known as ""interactomes,"" and determine the timing and location of these interactions. Traditional methods often detect binary interactions but fail to identify complex interactions via multiple proteins. Furthermore, building an interactome becomes challenging when bait proteins have various subcellular locations. For example, the plant protein RAB-GTPase 7 (RAB7) localizes to endosomes and autophagosomes, where it performs different functions by interacting with different proteins in each location. Yet, only a few RAB7 interactors have been identified in endosomes, and only one in autophagosomes, severely limiting our ability to investigate the diverse biological pathways controlled by this protein. The location-specific interactions can be discovered by split proximity tagging approaches, which fuse a target and a known target interactor in a specific compartment with inactive halves of a biotin tagging enzyme. Once activated, the enzyme will biotinylate nearby proteins in that compartment. However, when expressed alone, the C-terminal enzyme half produces a significant background activity, hindering the analysis and severely limiting the tool's utility. This project aims to develop new split enzyme versions by combining bioinformatics, modular cloning, and in-planta activity assays. The research program will enable the selection of split proximity tagging tools with no background when expressed alone and which are efficient and specific once the enzyme activity is reconstructed. The project focuses on developing tools for plant systems, but given their versatility, these tools are useful across biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Earth is going through a rapid transformation, causing plants and animals to move to different places due to changes in temperature and humidity. Sometimes, these organisms are also unintentionally moved around by humans. An important result of these changes is that insects encounter new plant species they are not used to eating, and these plants also face new insect species that can harm them. Insects are a varied group of animals, including crop pests, pollinators, and species that become meals for birds and mammals. So, understanding how insects respond to environmental changes is crucial for creating effective plans to control pests and conserve wildlife and beneficial species of insects. This project will study the Baltimore Checkerspot butterfly, a species that has recently started to feed on a common non-native plant. The project will determine how these insects include new plants in their diet and if feeding on new plants affects their ability to deal with dryer and hotter conditions. Additionally, the project will educate college students and the general public through outdoor displays of living butterflies to promote insect conservation.<br/><br/>The proposed work will focus on a butterfly of conservation concern, the Baltimore Checkerspot (Euphydryas phaeton, Drury, Nymphalidae), to investigate whether host shifts 1) affect herbivore exposure to thermal stress and drought, 2) are driven by phenological synchrony between herbivores and host plants, and 3) influence herbivore thermal sensitivity and their ability to respond to environmental stress. This project will integrate information from field surveys, laboratory, and field experiments to determine whether E. phaeton populations inhabiting areas dominated by the native vs. the novel host differ in both their exposure and tolerance to thermal stress and drought. Understanding the ecological trade-offs involved in herbivore host range expansion, and more specifically, the extent to which thermal environment restricts host use is critical as we seek to understand organismal responses to climate change and the dynamics of novel communities.

They also influence atmospheric chemistry and climate, and are of economic importance to humans. Given the importance of volatiles, significant progress has been made in elucidating the biosynthesis and regulation of plant VOCs, and in recent years, the molecular mechanisms involved in the release of volatiles from cells into the atmosphere. It has been shown that the movement of volatiles across the plasma membrane relies on transporters and non-specific lipid transfer proteins to facilitate their diffusion across the cell wall to the cuticle, the final barrier for VOCs to cross, which acts as a VOC sink/concentrator. Yet, the transport of VOCs to the plasma membrane remains unexplored. This project will investigate the involvement of lipid droplets in VOC intracellular trafficking to the plasma membrane and how toxicity of volatiles via sequestration is prevented.  This research will provide new insights into the biological mechanisms of VOC trafficking and storage in plant cells. The results will have a substantial practical impact by uncovering new targets for accumulating valuable compounds or altering their release from the plant. The information gained may also lay the foundation for boosting plants' capability to store lipophilic compounds.

Rose and petunia petals as well as pelargonium leaf trichomes will be used as model systems in this research. Comparative analysis of roses, which emit both terpenoids and phenylpropanoids during the day, and petunia, which emit high levels of phenylpropanoids/benzenoids during the night, will not only determine whether the lipid droplets' contributions to emissions depends on the nature of the VOCs but also uncover if lipid droplet abundances change rhythmically during a daily light/dark cycle correlated with VOC emission. In contrast, analysis of lipid droplets in trichomes will uncover their distinct storage properties, which prevent VOC emission from these extracellular structures.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/France project is jointly supported by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics at the US National Science Foundation and the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, where NSF funds the US investigator and ANR funds the partners in France.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although water utilities add residual disinfectant (e.g., chlorine or chloramine) to treated DW to control and prevent the regrowth of microorganisms in both the distribution systems (DS) and premise plumbing,  treated/disinfected DW still contains a diversity of microorganisms including water-associated pathogens (DWPIs) such as Legionella pneumophila and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to test the hypothesis that DWPIs (e.g., NTM) which survive chemical oxidant stressor (COS) exposure during water disinfection will be more virulent at causing disease due to the similarities between the COS found in the human body during infection and TT/DS disinfection processes. To test this hypothesis, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to use a pilot DW treatment plant and laboratory-scale systems to evaluate, quantify, and identify how different TT and DS protocols impact COS generation during water disinfection and how this in turn impacts the survival of DWPIs and their ability to cause infection. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to inform the design of more effective DW TT and disinfection operational protocols to minimize and mitigate the seeding and growth of DWPIs in drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student and one undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>Despite the broad range of physical and chemical processes used in their treatment trains (TT), water treatment plants are home to complex microbial communities that survive the exposure to chemical oxidant stressor (COS) generated during disinfection to seed drinking water distribution systems (DS) and premise plumbing with water-associated pathogens (DWPIs) including nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) that cause respiratory infections. Although several recent studies show a clear link between the strains of NTM found in household DW and those infecting people, a fundamental understanding of this link  has remained elusive. This CAREER project will address this critical knowledge gap. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) Investigate and evaluate the influence of different TT configurations on the functional microbial community and abundance of NTM; 2) Quantify the impacts of TT/DS associated COS exposure on the survival and pathogenesis of NTM; and 3) Identify the mechanism(s) responsible for changes in NTM virulence due to repeated exposure to disinfection generated COS. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new knowledge to 1) advance the fundamental understanding of how DWPIs respond to COS generated from various TT and DS configurations and 2) inform improved DW treatment plant design and operation to mitigate the generation and impact of NMT on human health. To implement the educational and outreach goals of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to  leverage existing resources and programs at the University of Pittsburgh to 1) Engage undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research combining public health, civil engineering, and microbiology and 2) Enhance the participation of students from underrepresented groups in STEM research. In addition,  the PI plans to  design and implement new K-16 educational and outreach programs to raise awareness of the impacts of changes in the design and operational protocols of DW treatment trains on the generation of DWPIs during water disinfection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Certain nucleic acid sequences rich in guanine can fold into four-stranded quadruplexes (G4) that present a natural barrier to DNA replication. These nucleic acid structures help control diverse cellular functions that drive evolution and affect the overall physiology and health of organisms. Additionally, G4 motifs play critical roles in human disease. For example, alterations in G4 regulatory processes contribute to neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer?s disease, Parkinson?s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Frontal-temporal Dementia, and Fragile X syndrome. Dysregulation of G4 biology also impacts cancer in multiple ways, such as through activation of genes that promote tumor growth and survival. Even the natural process of aging is thought to depend to some degree on how reactive chemical species alter G4 motifs. The goal of this project is to determine how specific proteins are recruited to sites of replication and then function together to copy G4 DNA. The project will support scientific training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. and produce two main outcomes: (1) it will increase knowledge of molecular mechanisms that have evolved to maintain functionally important genomic regions across the tree of life and (2)help promote student performance and retention in biochemistry, molecular biology, and biomedical science programs.<br/><br/>Plasticity in response to impaired fork progression is critical for bypass and tolerance of a variety of agents that challenge timely and accurate DNA replication. Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) is an ancient mediator of the replication stress response. This project will elucidate the molecular and cellular features of Rev1 that led to the evolutionary selection of this TLS enzyme as a principle means of promoting successful resolution of G4 motifs. Both in vitro biochemical and biophysical techniques will be combined with cellular approaches to advance models describing the mechanics of Rev1-mediated G4 bypass and the importance of interactions with other replication proteins. The summation of the work will provide new insights that will advance models describing replication of difficult-to-replicate sequences that are conserved across species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

UGIB represents 75% of all GI bleeding cases worldwide and it is one of the leading causes of emergency hospital admission for gastrointestinal complications in the US. Currently, there are no products on the market that can be utilized to quickly stop UGIB prior to endoscopic treatment. Intact Therapeutics? (IT) proprietary thermogel can rapidly stop UGIB due to its faster gelation time, mucoadhesive properties, and ability to deliver clot-promoting drugs topically at the site of bleeding, all without the need for endoscopy. Topical administration of the medications results in lower required doses, improved efficacy, and fewer side effects. Stabilizing the patient without endoscopy reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality, hospitalization time, the need for blood transfusions, and healthcare system costs. The current lack of a pre-endoscopic treatment for the stabilization of UGIB patients will ensure the broad adoption of IT?s thermogel product. Additionally, the range of therapeutics that could be delivered via thermogels is wide: including but not limited to small molecules, peptides, antibodies, and cells.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a thermogel-based drug delivery platform that combines mechanical and clotting-promoting actions to provide a rapid initial blockade in the upper GI tract and stabilize patients before endoscopy. The prehospital management of UGIB is pivotal to safeguard the conditions of patients prior to an effective endoscopic treatment. IT?s proprietary thermogel?s action is based on two synergistic effects: (1) In-situ gelation (liquid at ambient temperature and becomes a gel when heated to body temperature) provides a mechanical barrier against the blood flow. (2) The slow release of loaded drugs enables complete hemostasis of the haemorrhage site. In this project, the R&D efforts will be dedicated to the further development of the lead formulation identified in the Phase I project and to establish its long-term stability and comprehensive release profile, demonstration of the efficacy of the lead formulation via in-vivo study in a large animal model, and investigation of the pharmacokinetics to establish product safety. The successful completion of Phase II activities will bring the development of IT?s thermogel-based product to the clinical trial-ready stage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cryptographic techniques protect data only during transmission and storage, not processing.  Cloud and distributed services process sensitive data in a variety of ways, from medical diagnostics to tax returns to financial transactions. Servers must decrypt data before processing it, and once data is decrypted, it can be stolen by an attacker. Further, the computation performed on the data can be corrupted or maliciously altered, producing incorrect results with catastrophic consequences, e.g., an incorrect cancer diagnosis. This project will develop a performant, cryptography-based approach to secure computation that provides privacy and integrity guarantees, without trusting the cloud infrastructure.<br/><br/>Sophisticated cryptographic primitives like Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Verifiable Computation (VC), and Private Information Retrieval (PIR) are used in applications such as outsourced computation, cryptocurrencies, private search, and anonymous communication. These primitives provide privacy and integrity guarantees, without requiring trust in cloud infrastructure. However, current implementations suffer from poor performance, limiting their use. This project takes a synergistic approach of designing programmable hardware for cryptography and tailoring cryptography to this hardware, leveraging lattice-based cryptography and computation-communication tradeoffs. The overall goal of this project is to accelerate cryptographic schemes for FHE, VC, and PIR using a single hardware accelerator. The proposed approach can accelerate cryptographic primitives by orders of magnitude, enabling important use cases. Moreover, this project will develop compiler techniques that abstract the complexity of these cryptographic primitives, making them easier to use, and automatically target this hardware accelerator. The project will open-source the proposed hardware accelerator and compiler that can be shared across the whole research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The biopharmaceutical industry heavily relies on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as the primary organisms for manufacturing these medicines. However, the cultivation of CHO cells poses challenges due to limited methods available to gauge the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) which is a critical metric for assessing CHO cell health. This project seeks to enhance the accuracy of OUR estimation and develop tools to differentiate cell metabolism from other physical system changes. Furthermore, the project constructs a comprehensive mathematical model of cell behavior to improve CHO cell productivity. Beyond technological advancements, this project has broader impact that includes several modes of interaction between graduate students and industry collaborators and the development of curriculum modules at Clemson, focused on fed-batch and perfusion operation, that are shared broadly through Amgen?s curriculum outreach program.  <br/><br/>This project develops a controls-oriented metabolic model for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that correlates cell responses with on-line process signals, such as the dissolved oxygen, pH, base addition rates, gas mass flow rates, and off-gas compositions.  Additionally, a robust volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) estimator that accounts for filtering and latency effects, is developed. Accounting for these filtering and latency effects enables oxygen uptake rate calculations in real-time without distortion. Furthermore, the control algorithm enables distinguishing between chemical and physical process disturbances (i.e., antifoam additions and sampling) from cellular metabolic responses (i.e., glucose depletion).  These modeling and feed control innovations will lead to reduced waste ? improved nutrient utilization and more homogeneous critical product quality attributes, a key long-term long-standing vision in the biopharmaceutical industry.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those sources alone, however, are insufficient to provide enough energy during the transition period to meet the burgeoning demands for energy.  Thus, fossil resources, such as abundant natural gas, will continue to provide a significant fraction of total energy and feedstocks for chemical manufacturing and fuel production.  To that end, this Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project explores novel catalyst technology for converting methane (the chief component of natural gas) to ethane and hydrogen.  Those products are primary precursors for energy-efficient manufacture of a broad range of chemicals and fuels.  Specifically, the project focuses on a class of catalysts known as MXenes, which show promising properties and stability at the high temperatures required to non-oxidatively couple two methane molecules together to produce ethane and hydrogen.  From the broader impact perspective, the project will provide resources for the early-career investigator to expand research capacity in their laboratory, while providing research experiences to a diverse group of undergraduate students.<br/> <br/>The overarching research goal of the ERI project is to establish research capability directed toward the fundamental understanding of catalytic methane conversion over Pt/Mo2TiC2 MXene catalysts.  Specific thrusts include: 1) quantifying reaction-diffusion phenomena in the interlayer pores containing the Pt clusters; 2) identifying the active sites for methane bond activation; 3) obtaining insights regarding the C-C coupling mechanism as related to the Pt nanolayer structures and interactions with the MXene metals (specifically Mo); and 4) exploring in detail the factors responsible for the coke-resistant properties of the MXene catalyst observed in preliminary studies.  To achieve those goals, the project will employ a suite of catalyst characterization and kinetic analysis tools, highlighted by the combination of steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) and operando transmission FTIR, i.e., SSITKA-FTIR, in a single flow reactor to investigate catalytic mechanisms under working conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a thermoradiative cell, by contrast, a semiconductor photodiode is placed on a hot body, and it generates power while emitting photons toward cold surroundings. Such a device is ideal for space applications since it can operate at moderate temperatures while utilizing space, whose temperature is around 3 K, to generate power. This project aims to lay the groundwork for thermoradiative power generators that use space as a cold reservoir. The findings will be broadly disseminated in multidisciplinary conferences and research journals, including a special volume on the emerging field of cryogenic heat transfer that will be compiled for publication in the Annual Reviews of Heat Transfer. The principal investigators will provide mentorship to junior researchers and students, especially those from traditionally underrepresented groups, and deliver seminars at historically black colleges and universities.<br/><br/>While the theory for thermoradiative devices has been established in earlier studies and qualitative experiments have shown promise, further research is necessary to facilitate the practical application of thermoradiative devices for space applications. The composition and doping levels of indium antimonide and mercury-cadmium-telluride will be carefully selected and optimized for thermoradiative applications since the semiconductor p-n junctions are placed at temperatures from 300-600 K, which are much higher than the traditional operating temperatures of mid-infrared photodetectors. Previously demonstrated schemes for improving the performance of thermophotovoltaic devices will be evaluated and optimized for thermoradiative power generators operating in both far- and near-field regimes. Metamaterials will be designed to enhance the performance of near-field thermoradiative devices. A vacuum chamber equipped with a two-stage cryocooler will be used to create cold surroundings at a temperature down to about 4 K for testing the characteristics of semiconductor photodiodes with bandgaps in the mid-infrared region. This research will help improve the current understanding of how the photon chemical potential, micro/nanostructures, and near-field operation may affect the radiative heat transfer and charge transport processes.

However, describing the precise force responses from these materials in order to understand the dynamics of running is extremely challenging because small changes to the grains, how the material is packed, or how the foot hits the ground can lead to huge differences in the behavior of the ground. Furthermore, animals rarely do the same exact motion twice on exactly the same kind of ground, making the empirical data about these interactions very noisy. Two ways of conducting controlled experiments that can produce cleaner empirical data about the foot-ground interactions include using robotic models and simulating the behavior of the ground using mathematical and numerical models. Such experiments can inform our understanding of how and why animals have evolved the diversity of feet that we see in the animal kingdom. Understanding how animals might have evolved to handle the different kinds of flowing and soft substrates that they encounter in their natural environments could lead to breakthroughs in legged robot locomotion and suggest better designs for shoes and prosthetics. In addition, this project will support the development of an interdisciplinary undergraduate course in using robotics to address biological questions and will engage numerous students in authentic research at the interface of computer science and biology.<br/><br/>This project will develop and use an open-source and low-cost legged robot platform to stand in for an animal, and systematically vary foot features to answer questions about the evolution of different foot structures found in lizards. The focus on lizards stems from the diversity of foot shapes in this group and previous results suggesting that sand specialist lizards, which often have long, thin toes, may have evolved the separation of these toes to be 3-5 times the width of the most common particles in the environment to which they are adapted. Discrete element method simulations, which are simulations modeling the forces acting on individual grains in a granular media, suggest that this may be because a spacing of 3-5 particle diameters leads to a virtual webbing effect in which the granular media reacts to a foot as if it has more surface area than it actually does. A primary goal of this project is to determine the effects of foot shape on the force response from the ground compared with simple surface area using a combination of discrete element method simulations and experiments jumping a physical robot on homogeneous granular media. The project will also investigate another potential benefit of toes for locomotion on granular media: removing the foot from the ground. Long, thin toes, as are often seen in sand specialist species, can collapse down quickly for easy extraction from the ground.

Typical organic pollutants include disinfection byproducts, pharmaceutical and personal care products, and persistent organic chemicals.  The project is a collaborative effort led by Elizabeth City State University (an HBCU institution) and Old Dominion University.   The project utilizes biocatalytic enzymes to oxidize organic contaminants to carbon dioxide (CO2) in an electrochemical environment.  The produced CO2 is further reacted electro-biocatalytically to methanol which can be used on-site for wastewater denitrification.  Electrical energy needed for the overall process can potentially be supplied by sustainable electricity, thus enabling an overall clean energy process for wastewater remediation.  The process design is conceptual at present.  In keeping with the ?high risk, high reward? goal of EAGER projects, the project will generate data that will be used to assess the transformational potential of the process.  Beyond the technical aspects, the project includes a broad slate of initiatives associated with building research capability across both institutions while providing educational and outreach opportunities to the large populations of underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged high-school students in neighboring counties.<br/>   <br/>The project targets a unique integrated stackable proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer design that accomplishes multiple tasks: 1) using redox enzymes immobilized into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to oxidize dissolved organic compounds of wastewater into CO2 at the anode, 2) subsequently converting the CO2 to methanol at the cathode, and 3) evaluating the electrolyzer design consisting of an activated PEM sandwiched between nanofiber-immobilized hydrogenase and carbonic anhydrase enzymes serving as the respective anode and cathode.  From a broader impact perspective, the project?s rooting in electrochemistry opens the door to significant reduction in CO2 emissions associated with current wastewater treatment processes that still rely chiefly on fossil-fuel derived energy, while also avoiding CO2 emissions associated with current Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) water treatment technologies.

Gliding is a smooth motion of individual bacterial cells on a solid surface that does not involve obvious appendages like flagella or pili, yet can rely on different mechanisms. In the model gliding bacteria Flavobacterium johnsoniae, gliding relies on highly dynamic molecular machineries composed of unique proteins. This project is to decipher the composition, architecture, and mechanism of the gliding machinery with a multidisciplinary approach. Graduate and postdoctoral fellows will actively participate in the project and will receive training in interdisciplinary research involving bacterial genetics, molecular biology, modern fluorescence microscopy and cryogenic electron microscopy. They will also receive training in academic writing and research presentations. The results of this research will be of interest to a large community of scientists studying cell motility and cell envelope processes and will be published in the best possible journals. The findings will also be reported by students and postdoctoral fellows at national and international conferences and in academic seminars. The results and data generated from this project will be incorporated into lectures for a cryogenic electron microscopy course designed for graduate students.<br/><br/>The mechanism of the bacterial gliding motility is not fully understood. The goal of this project is to decipher the global composition, architecture and dynamics of the gliding machinery with a multidisciplinary approach heavily relying on cutting-edge cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET), single particle cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy methods combined with protein biochemistry, bacterial genetics and bioinformatics. This project will address two specific aims: 1) Defining the gliding machinery and its dynamics in live cells. In this aim, a global picture of the gliding machinery will be determined by in situ APEX2-dependent proximity labeling. Then, the dynamics of the gliding machinery components will be determined by biochemistry and fluorescence microscopy approaches. 2) Mapping the architecture of the gliding machinery. The objective of this aim is to obtain the three-dimensional architecture of the gliding machinery by cryo-electron microscopy. Cryo-ET, an imaging technique to analyze the structure of biological assemblies in their native environments, will be used to determine the intact structure of the gliding machinery at nanometer resolution by imaging the bacterial cells. Single particle Cryo-EM is ideal for investigating purified protein complexes at near-atomic resolution, and this approach will be used to determine the structure of the purified subcomplex of gliding machinery. Completion of these aims will provide valuable insight on how proteins are organized to enable gliding motility.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/France project is jointly supported by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics at the US National Science Foundation and the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, where NSF funds the US investigator and ANR funds the partners in France.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These environmental changes have important effects on how inorganic nutrients (Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium) are stored and cycled in the soils of temperate forests. Inorganic nutrients are essential for plant growth and are sourced to soils from mineral weathering, deposition from the atmosphere, and leaf litter from plants. While roots are known for their role in extracting inorganic nutrients for plants, they can contribute organic matter to help store inorganic nutrients in soils. This research project explores how leaf litter and surface roots promote inorganic nutrient storage in soils and the extent of their codependence. To understand climatic controls on leaf litter and roots for inorganic nutrient cycling, the researchers will leverage a network of research sites spanning from the warm temperate forests of Virginia to the cold temperate forests of northern New England. The findings will be used to inform the U.S. Forest Service and several state Forestry and Natural Resources Departments of the current and future inorganic nutrient cycling in their forests. Furthermore, the research site in Massachusetts will serve as an instructional tool for university and community college courses. <br/><br/>The primary objective of the project is to quantify the codependence of leaf litter and roots on Mg, P, K, and Ca stabilization in temperate forest soil. Leaf litter and roots may act synergistically to stabilize inorganic nutrients in the mineral soil through generating organic matter and aggregation. To avoid the common issue of heterogeneity of soil materials and duration of development, the project will leverage soil columns buried three years ago, containing a quartz-feldspar-kaolinite mixture to examine the effect of leaf litter and tree roots on inorganic nutrients in mineral soil. Researchers will quantify the rate of inorganic nutrient stabilization in bulk soils and use microprobe analyses to examine rhizosphere and microaggregation. Moreover, the project will utilize existing litterfall and atmospheric deposition monitoring to estimate nutrient cycling budgets. When examined across the climate gradient, the findings can be used to predict future shifts in nutrient cycling from shifts in leaf litter-root codependence with changes in climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For a week during the summer, these scientists and researchers from universities, companies, hospitals and national/government laboratories from around the country and the world, come together in a quiet setting on a college campus in Maine to present their latest results, discoveries and inventions and to discuss these with one another. An important component of this particular conference is that more than half of the attendees are scientists who are the beginning of their careers (graduate students and the like) who will have the unique opportunity to hear from and interact with the well-known and established scientists and leaders in their field. The conference also has made a strong effort to bring together a very diverse group of attendees with close to 40% being female, more than 1/3 of the attendees coming from countries outside of the US and a significant number being part of traditionally underrepresent groups in science and engineering. One of the results of this from previous conferences like this one, has been that the participants get to really know each other and start to work together. They become colleagues and collaborators and in some cases friends for life. Ultimately this means that together they can make more research progress than each person can on their own which in turn benefits society and ultimate the patients that benefit from these new technologies. During formal presentations and informal discussions the overall goal of the meeting is to work together and exchange ideas in order to improve our understanding of how light interacts with biological tissue and how lasers and other optical technologies can be used to diagnose and treat diseases such as cancer or heart disease and use those high tech approaches to understand how certain parts of the body such as the brain actually work.<br/><br/>The theme of the 2024 GRC-OPMB conference is ?Biophotonics: From Fundamental Physics to Applied Physiology?, The conference will consist of 9 scientific sessions with 3 or 4 invited speakers each. Each session will focus on a biophotonic technology, research question or application area. Topics within a session span the full spectrum from fundamental biophysics to biological science question to clinical medicine and explore the current and future use of these advances for improving health and wellness. Most of the topics and sessions directly align with the interest and mission of the NSF, especially the sessions on ?Quantum Biophotonics?, ?AI/ML in Optical Imaging?, ?Modeling and Theory of Laser-Tissue Interactions? and throughout the conference and its participants there will be a significant focus on early career investigators and diversity.

Scientists have begun to characterize the molecular mechanisms of recovery at the tissue level, but little is known about larger scale traits that enable recovery at the level of the whole plant. This project will attempt to discover those key traits by comparing the structure and function of closely related resurrection and non-resurrection plants. Land-dwelling and tree-dwelling resurrection plants will be compared in order to better understand which traits are common to all resurrection plants and which traits are specific to a given habitat. High resolution x-ray technology will be used to visualize the movement of water through resurrection and non-resurrection plants during rehydration. Knowledge of the traits that enable recovery in resurrection plants will improve the current understanding of plant drought tolerance and inform ecological management of resurrection plants. This knowledge might also be used to assess the potential for developing crops that are more drought tolerant.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide insight into the evolution of whole-plant desiccation tolerance (DT) by systematically determining traits enabling whole-plant recovery in six DT lineages of ferns and lycophytes. Anatomical and physiological traits related to water use will be assessed in hydrated plants, comparing closely related DT and non-DT species. During dehydration and rehydration, high resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) will be used to assess timing and level of recovery in distal tissues. Vascular DT plants will likely exhibit varied mechanisms of recovery according to their habitat, with terrestrial (land-dwelling) plants resurrecting by means of root pressure and epiphytic (tree-dwelling) plants recovering via foliar water uptake. However, other traits will likely be shared among all DT ferns and lycophytes, such as traits that maintain structural integrity in the dry state and traits that facilitate timely desiccation. Including both sporophytes and gametophytes in this comparison will provide a holistic perspective on fitness and trait coordination between life history stages. Furthermore, DT ferns represent a neglected opportunity to learn about DT adaptations to the epiphytic habitat and its varied ecological niches. This study will elucidate how DT has been co-opted for fern survival in the epiphytic habitat, broadening our understanding of both ferns and epiphytes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are the iron cofactors utilized by proteins in these cellular pathways.  This research focuses on revealing the molecular details of how Fe-S clusters are formed and trafficked to the appropriate Fe-S cluster protein within the cell (Fe-S cluster biogenesis), even under stress conditions that perturb iron homeostasis.  In the model organism, Escherichia coli, our multidisciplinary team will combine microbial genetics, analytical chemistry, protein biochemistry, and quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches to determine the role of monothiol glutaredoxins and their binding partner proteins in Fe-S cluster trafficking.  Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that monothiol glutaredoxins form a storage pool of Fe-S clusters that is conditionally required for reloading Fe-S cluster trafficking or other target proteins under stress.  Furthermore, through its interaction with partner proteins, these glutaredoxins may coordinate Fe-S cluster metabolism with cell envelope biogenesis in E. coli.  Our interdisciplinary studies will provide a detailed molecular understanding of monothiol glutaredoxin function providing insight into the cellular mechanisms for crosstalk between Fe-S cluster biogenesis and cell envelope biogenesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large-scale data collection has significant privacy concerns due to the growing data breaches. Different kinds of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) exist. Still, they all have various limitations in efficiency and scalability due to the scale and complexity of real-world applications nowadays requiring large-scale and complex data processing. This project aims to develop methodologies and theories for heterogeneous secure computation for large-scale data processing, where different kinds of secure computation technologies are integrated into a seamless pipeline such that one can achieve the efficiency and scalability that cannot be attained by any existing secure computation paradigm alone. The heterogeneous secure computation framework resulting from this project will enhance cybersecurity, individual privacy, and national security by significantly improving the efficiency and scalability of secure computations performed on encrypted data. Moreover, this research will support the development of Ph.D., undergraduate, and high school students via the novel Research Experience for High Schoolers (REHS) program to be developed from the project and other education and outreach activities.<br/> <br/>Underlying the proposed work is a novel idea of integrating the two seemingly disjoint secure computation paradigms: homomorphic computations and confidential computing. The project goal is to, by combining different secure computation primitives into a pipeline of heterogeneous secure computation, achieve the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability that cannot be attained by any individual secure computation primitive. Three interconnected research thrusts will be investigated for this goal. Firstly, confidential computing and homomorphic computations will be integrated into a pipeline such that one large-scale data processing workflow can be decomposed into several subcomputations that are handled by either confidential or homomorphic computations. Secondly, a heterogeneous trusted execution environment (TEE) will be researched to overcome the security and scalability limitations of existing TEEs, with novel zero-knowledge enclave verification and end-to-end attestation across different TEEs. Finally, parallel and distributed computing will be studied in the context of the new heterogeneous secure computation such that the unique challenges of applying parallel and distributed computing in this new heterogeneous framework are addressed. The research outcomes will be an end-to-end heterogeneous secure computation framework with high efficiency and scalability that are comparable to the plain computations without any security or privacy guarantees. The project outcomes will include (1) open-source projects implementing the framework, (2) scientific articles presented/published at conferences and journals, and (3) novel education materials for REHS and a new graduate-level course in homomorphic and confidential computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, prey can sense when the risk from predators is higher, and they may dramatically change their foraging behavior or use of refugia. Perhaps surprisingly, such defensive behavioral responses can sometimes have larger effects on the prey population than the effects of predators directly killing prey. This project is designed to develop a general framework that can predict how much a prey species will use defensive traits (including behaviors) and how that response may affect the prey?s fitness.  Understanding these predator risk effects is necessary to understand many wide-ranging ecological problems that affect society such as agricultural pests, invasive species, conservation of endangered species, and management of fisheries and wildlife.  A postdoctoral researcher will be trained in quantitative ecology as part of this project.<br/><br/>This project seeks to innovate a graphical approach called the Integrated Risk-Effects Framework (IREF) that predicts the magnitude of a prey?s risk-induced trait response and the ensuing fitness costs (i.e., non-consumptive effects), and facilitates theory-based empirical work suitable for synthesis and cross-system generalization of risk effects. The approach predicts defensive trait expression using explicitly defined fitness functions, which will be derived for specific predator-prey pairs using models of the interaction informed by empirical data. For example, published models of predators hunting prey in a spatial landscape will be used to predict the dependence of costs and benefits on different prey traits that prey can modify to reduce predation risk (e.g., movement rate).  These relationships will then be incorporated in IREF to predict optimal defensive traits responses to predation risks, and the costs and benefits to fitness of that response.  IREF will also be used to generate testable hypotheses about the influence of characteristics of prey (e.g., density, type of trait response), predator (e.g., ambush vs. cursorial), and environmental characteristics (e.g., resource quality, alternative prey) across different taxonomic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both institutions have strong outreach programs to high-school students that will be integrated into the project to engage students early-on in STEM areas related to renewable/sustainable energy and environmentally based chemical processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How blood flows through the body is vital diagnostic information for heart disease. It can be determined from medical imaging techniques like phase-contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 4D Flow MRI, and Color Doppler echocardiography (Echo). These methods directly measure blood flow, but several limitations obscure results for practical use in clinical settings. This project will advance methods for increasing reconstruction accuracy and quantifying uncertainty for advanced medical imaging techniques. Success in both aspects can provide valuable information to clinicians, aiding treatment decisions. Quantifying uncertainty can also help improve imaging protocols for maximum information gain, leading to faster, cheaper, and more reliable scans. The approach promises to significantly enhance medical image analysis to inform clinical decision-making by improving accuracy, resolution, and quantifying uncertainties in hemodynamic fields, ultimately leading to more effective and personalized treatment plans for heart disease patients.<br/><br/>This project develops a scalable Bayesian methodology to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing cardiovascular hemodynamic flow fields and cardiac structure from advanced medical imaging modalities (PC-MRI, 4D Flow MRI, and Echo). The research design seeks to overcome existing limitations, such as inaccurately reconstructed velocity flow, which often violates known physical laws, low signal-to-noise ratio, scanner-to-scanner variation, and lack of quantified uncertainty in reconstructions.<br/>Central to this effort is the application of information field theory (IFT), which allows for the fusion of governing physical laws with noisy, heterogeneous data. Through four specific aims, the project: 1) Formulates the inverse problem of identifying hemodynamic fields within the IFT framework; 2) Explores parameterizations of time-varying hemodynamic fields; 3) Devises scalable numerical algorithms to characterize the joint posterior distributions of these fields and relevant parameters; and 4) Verifies and validates the methodology using synthetic, in vitro, and in vivo data. The expected outcome is a next-generation statistical methodology that solves the hemodynamics field and physical parameter estimation problem with quantified uncertainty. The success of this project will provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of the complex blood flow structures within the physiology under study, which, in turn, will aid medical diagnosis, especially in the early asymptomatic phase, risk assessment, treatment planning, and pre/post-treatment management. The project will also impact biomedical research. The probabilistic quantification of hemodynamics parameters such as pressure drop, vorticity, turbulent kinetic energy, or viscous energy loss can lead biomedical researchers to identify biomarkers for various diseases. Furthermore, since it will contribute to the core theory of IFT, the project will impact other applications that reconstruct spatiotemporal fields in multi-physics settings. The open-source package the team will develop will make it easier for other domain experts to adopt IFT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying defective iron transport is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets for many diseases caused by iron dysregulation, e.g., oncological, and neurological diseases. Traditional methods for monitoring live cells require the addition of chemical labels, which can change both cell morphology and chemistry. Therefore, innovative imaging techniques are required. The project?s investigators propose to develop and employ Raman spectral imaging together with transport of intensity equation optical diffraction tomography (TIE-ODT), which provide such a technology. The interdisciplinary nature of this project presents many opportunities for students with various scientific interests and backgrounds to participate and work together. This collaboration, involving Physics and Biomedical Science, will provide intensive, focused, and interdisciplinary dissertation projects for undergraduate and graduate students, who will be able to advance in both fundamental and applied aspects of cell biology research. The proposed summer school program for high school students will broaden participation of under-represented minorities in data collection and/or analysis steps, thereby gaining experience in optical science, software coding, mathematics, and cell biology.<br/><br/>The project?s goal is to use innovative and label-free methodologies, such as Raman spectroscopic hyperspectral analysis and phase imaging, to label the distribution of iron binding proteins in intact cells and tissues. The primary hypothesis is that iron-dependent chemical changes in cells can be detected with label-free optical methods. Currently, there is no robust method to visualize and quantify the distribution of iron-binding proteins in intact cells and tissues. Two iron binding proteins that have an essential role in iron metabolism are the iron storage protein, ferritin, and iron transporting protein, transferrin. As previously demonstrated by the principal investigators of this project in their publications, Raman hyperspectral imaging detects spectral peaks that can be correlated with iron-bound transferrin. Recently, their Raman studies have shown substantial differences in spectra of both transferrin and ferritin with and without bound iron, thus proving that it is an appropriate technique to determine the levels of bound iron in these protein mixtures. The project?s interdisciplinary team will develop and employ 3D transport of intensity equation optical diffraction tomography (TIE-ODT) together with multiline Raman microspectroscopy to monitor both morphological and chemical changes during ferroptosis in real time and in living unlabeled cells to (1) visualize and quantify the iron-binding status and subcellular location of iron-binding proteins; (2) extract cells? optical properties and utilize it to monitor both morphological and chemical changes in cells during ferroptosis. Successful completion of this work will provide a new paradigm for understanding the regulation of intracellular transport of iron. It will also result in development of the first integrated TIE-ODT and multiline Raman microscope to establish a morphological and chemical profile in unlabeled living cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Migratory birds modify their exposure to daylight due to the effects of latitude on daylength. This study examines whether birds that migrate to the southern hemisphere use cues from the earth's magnetic field to change their sensitivity to daylight so that breeding occurs in only one hemisphere. It also examines whether the longer summer days of high latitudes facilitate parental provisioning of baby birds compared to the shorter summer days of low latitudes. This will aid in the understanding of the ecological and physiological bases for long-distance migration. Because daylength is an astronomical phenomenon, the P.I. will partner with a public science center in the construction of exhibits to teach school children about the astronomy of daylength and about migratory birds. The P.I. will also partner with First Nations and Mtis people of northern Canada to ensure that field work in this region is sensitive to cultural and environmental issues and to learn traditional knowledge as it pertains to high-latitude wild animals. The research will expand knowledge in a fundamental biological response to global change, migration to high latitudes. It is highly interdisciplinary, being biological, geographical, and astronomical in nature. But it further addresses issues important to the conservation of animals that reside in some of the world's most endangered ecosystems, those of high latitude that are particularly susceptible to global change.<br/><br/><br/>In moving between photoperiodic schedules of different latitudes, individual latitudinal migrants modify the number of hours of daylight per year to which they are exposed. Whether or not daylight availability associated with migration has direct fitness benefits, such as enabling more time each day to feed rapidly growing young, has never been examined. Also, the type of latitudinal migration that is trans-equatorial cannot be reconciled with current knowledge on avian photoperiodism, which regulates the seasonal timing of breeding and other life-history transitions. This proposal aims to determine if the additional summer daylight availability at higher latitudes accelerates parental provisioning and thus offspring growth relative to lower latitudes and to identify a photoperiodic and geomagnetic mechanism that enables unihemispheric breeding under transhemispheric migration. It will examine nestling growth in both free-ranging Lincoln's sparrows along a transect from central New Mexico to over 60 latitude and in laboratory zebra finches under experimentally manipulated photoperiods and food availability. It will also use photoperiod and geomagnetic manipulations in laboratory-housed bobolinks, a transequatorial migrant that breeds in the northern hemisphere but overwinters in the southern hemisphere, to examine the physiological mechanisms regulating breeding in a transequatorial migrant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Capturing this CO2 using most state-of-the-art separation technologies requires electricity, compromising their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, 67% of the primary energy is wasted in the atmosphere as heat. This award is uniquely placed at the intersection of these two problems and focuses on developing a waste heat-driven adsorption-based CO2 separation technique. This concept uses thin and porous adsorbent layers fabricated on microchannel walls, which offer excellent heat and mass transfer attributes, resulting in rapid adsorption of CO2 from the feed stream. This project will comprehensively evaluate how hot liquid water can effectively remove the adsorbed CO2 through direct contact, which has not been employed previously. Successful implementation of such a shared channel approach will increase the specific CO2 capture capacity by up to two orders of magnitude. This technology can provide inexpensive, scalable, location-independent, and compact solutions for post-combustion CO2 capture. This research will also enrich the thermal-fluids courses, generate new paradigms for senior design projects, and attract participation in STEM outreach events.<br/><br/>Temperature swing adsorption-based (TSA) carbon dioxide (CO2) separation processes, which involve an alternating flow of gases and liquids in adsorbent-coated microchannels, have been shown to yield superior and environmentally friendly performance compared with existing processes.The proposed cyclic process begins by sending the feed gas mixture through adsorbent-coated microchannels, which results in carbon dioxide adsorption. Subsequently, hot water flows through the same channels, regenerates the adsorbent, desorbs the carbon dioxide, and removes the desorbed CO2 from the channel. This stage is followed by cooling and purging of liquid in preparation for the next cycle. Here, the regeneration stage involves a complex and poorly studied set of transport phenomena involving multiphase interactions between hot liquid water, solid adsorbent, and adsorbed, dissolved and gaseous CO2. The scientific objective of this award is to develop a fundamental understanding of these multiphase interactions through experiments and modeling to demonstrate effective CO2 separation using this technology. Experiments involving high-speed flow visualization and first-principle-based computational models will determine the intermediate variables in these transport phenomena, and the end effects of the multiphase interactions in the models will be validated with those in the experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Green NH3, on the other hand, is costly and still requires long-term development to be commercially viable. Until Green NH3 becomes affordable, the renewable NH3 produced by the proposed technology can serve as a bridge fuel to help the industries start energy transition now. This technology could replace half the current synthetic N fertilizers. Manure generates 180 Mt of CO2eq emissions by applications to the soil. This technology has a significant potential to reduce GHG emissions. The market value of the N fertilizers is about $10 billion in the U.S. The estimated dollar value of the target market would be half that amount.

The Phase I objective is to increase the NH3 absorption mass transfer rate by an order of magnitude by applying the model. The model will be validated by comparing the model against experimental data to be collected in Phase I. The experiments will be conducted using two columns: one for the NH3 stripping and another for the NH3 absorption. The operating parameters will be explored to maximize the mass transfer kinetics based on the model for flushed manure samples. The anticipated result would be a new, validated consecutive LG-to-GL mass transfer model, establishing the relationship between the mass transfer rate and the operating parameters and optimizing parameters that would significantly increase the NH3 recovery efficiency, making the technology affordable to livestock farmers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The exact relationship between acoustically generated flow and force fields, deformable vessel wall mechanics, and bubble oscillation dynamics remains unclear. Hence, the principal goal of this research is to understand how microbubble clusters move in blood vessels actuated by acoustics.

This will enable them to assess the feasibility of microbubble navigation in blood vessels under physiological conditions and biocompatible acoustic power levels. As a result, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms and parameters that govern microbubble cluster motion in blood vessels. It will also relate this motion to external acoustic fields. The computational developments enabled by this project will facilitate further research in microscale propulsion and biomedical acoustics.

While many tree and microbial species have evolved traits that make them resilient to and often benefit from fire, many forests are failing to recover, and we don?t know why. Within biology, incremental advances within siloed disciplines have provided very few science-informed solutions to mitigate climate change, the primary driver behind extreme wildfire and drought events. EMBER posits this problem exists because molecular and cellular processes have never been embedded in ecosystem research. EMBER?s vision is to identify key traits and variables that govern how biological communities respond to and interact with stress. By uniting a team of diverse scientists with expertise spanning multiple biological disciplines, EMBER aims to transform our understanding of fundamental controls on forest processes. To extend its vision and reach, EMBER will partner with the Coeur d?Alene tribe and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation to establish an Indigenous Innovation Lab for tribal and rural students, develop a unique teacher fellows training program, and engage with citizens from across the political spectrum (including climate change skeptics). Expected outcomes of these efforts include determining thresholds for forest recovery, predicting how stress impacts the forest carbon sink, training the next generation of scientists to transcend disciplines for use-inspired solutions to climate change, and developing an effective science-communication framework to inform forest policy. <br/><br/>By Embedding Molecular Biology in Ecosystem Research, the EMBER Institute will identify key traits and variables that govern how biological communities respond to and interact with compounding environmental stress. EMBER focuses on two overarching Aims: (1) Identify direct physiological and evolutionary acclimation strategies of individual model microorganisms and conifer tree species to simulated fire and drought and (2) Determine how these stress-response strategies influence ecological interactions among organisms (microbe-microbe and microbe-tree) that scale-up to impact ecosystem resilience and function. Beginning with controlled laboratory experiments and tractable model organisms, EMBER will determine how stress induces transcriptional and functional responses that impact microbial community assembly and conifer seedling physiology. Fire and drought conditions will be manipulated at an experimental field site to test how biological responses scale up to impact the forest carbon balance. Finally, ecosystem modeling will be used to test whether transcriptional and compositional signatures modulate key forest processes (e.g., photosynthesis, metabolism, mortality risk). Because evolution and plasticity are just beginning to be incorporated into ecosystem models, EMBER will capitalize on a tremendous and exciting opportunity to use experimental data to directly inform model development. Ultimately, these activities will help scientists unravel linkages within and among levels of organization to reveal the underlying traits that predict biological responses to increasing and compounding environmental stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As hardware designs become more complex, finding these security flaws becomes harder due to the heavy manual effort involved. Effective security for hardware and software systems requires deep knowledge of both software and hardware, and a collaborative approach between security experts and hardware designers. This project aims to create fully automated tools for security checks in these systems. These tools will use generated assertions to pinpoint hardware security issues without the need for human intervention or specialized security knowledge. This automation will help reduce labor costs and workload in the semiconductor industry. Additionally, a hardware security-oriented dataset will be developed to fine-tune or pre-train domain-specific large language models (LLMs). This will be a valuable resource for the security community. The project will also produce practical methods, like an online field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. These methods will be useful for training professionals in advanced embedded system development and verification, fostering industry collaboration, and supporting other researchers in this area. This project also includes creating tutorials and hands-on labs to engage and inspire undergraduates and K-12 students in early science and engineering activities.<br/><br/>This CAREER project develops techniques to fully automate the security assessment process for hardware and software systems, ranging from user security requirements to the mitigation of malicious activities.

The use of acoustically-controlled microbubble clusters to navigate blood vessels has recently been investigated experimentally as one such possibility. Complex acoustic-fluid-structure interactions occur as microbubble clusters move within deformable blood vessels. The exact relationship between acoustically generated flow and force fields, deformable vessel wall mechanics, and bubble oscillation dynamics remains unclear. Hence, the principal goal of this research is to understand how microbubble clusters move in blood vessels actuated by acoustics. Moreover, the project provides significant opportunities for training and research for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups, as well as for curriculum enhancement, the development of open-source computational codes, and outreach activities.  <br/><br/>This project will investigate the relationship between acoustically generated force fields, deformable vessel wall mechanics, and bubble oscillation dynamics. The central hypothesis is that acoustically generated streaming flow fields facilitate the motion of microbubble clusters within narrow blood vessels by lubricating the vessels walls. The research team will leverage advanced computer simulations that incorporate realistic models of vessel mechanics, acoustic phenomena, and bubble interfacial dynamics. This will enable them to assess the feasibility of microbubble navigation in blood vessels under physiological conditions and biocompatible acoustic power levels. As a result, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms and parameters that govern microbubble cluster motion in blood vessels. It will also relate this motion to external acoustic fields. The computational developments enabled by this project will facilitate further research in microscale propulsion and biomedical acoustics. In addition to enabling underrepresented students to participate in computational research, this project will also create outreach learning opportunities through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute that engages the general public through basic science classes.

Critical materials such as lithium, cobalt and magnesium are key to successfully transitioning to a green/clean and sustainable energy landscape as they are the materials/elements that form the backbone of electrical energy conversion and storage technologies. These critical materials are currently sourced through multi-national supply chains and via environmentally harmful mining processes, which impede and act as bottlenecks to U.S. sustainability and clean energy goals. The goal of this EAGER project is to investigate the potential for extraction of critical materials, specifically lithium, from a large domestic waste stream (and potential resource)- extreme salinity oil and gas produced water, using atmospheric pressure direct current (dc) non-equilibrium plasma discharges. Plasma, as one of the four fundamental states of matter, is an ionized and highly energetic state with unique properties. By tuning the plasma characteristics and environment, its interaction with a liquid and the resulting liquid-phase reactions can be tailored and controlled. The cross-disciplinary (plasma physics/chemistry, interfacial processes, transport phenomena, and electrochemistry) project will impact education as it relates to developing a competitive STEM workforce, and sustainable extraction of critical materials from domestic sources has the potential to strengthen supply chains of these materials for the energy and defense sectors, which is of vital importance for U.S. national security and energy independence.<br/><br/>The intellectual focus of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms/pathways that facilitate precipitation of stable lithium (and other critical material) compounds from extreme salinity produced water when it is treated with dc non-equilibrium plasma discharges under atmospheric pressure conditions. The main questions that the project addresses are: (i) to what extent do the non-equilibrium characteristics of the plasma facilitate both Faradaic and non-Faradaic pathways towards precipitation of lithium (and other critical materials) from extreme salinity water, (ii) what role does the solvated electron play in this precipitation process, and (iii) can supersaturation of the liquid with solvated electrons forcibly facilitate metal reduction, even reduction of highly soluble/reactive metals such as lithium. The team will explore electrochemical and non-electrochemical pathways for precipitation of lithium compounds during plasma-liquid interactions with synthetic produced water solutions, and characterize the role of the plasma-liquid interface region in regulating these pathways. The experimental approach will leverage plasma diagnostic tools, aqueous solution metrology, and solid material characterization tools to evaluate the pathways for lithium precipitation during dc plasma treatment of extreme salinity aqueous solutions. These fundamental studies can then be leveraged to intensify lithium compound/complex precipitation from real oil and gas produced water, thus valorizing a high-volume domestic wastewater source and increasing the resiliency of domestic critical materials supply chains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the most promising energy conversion and storage options associated with renewable and sustainable energy rely on catalysis. To develop cost-effective, environmentally benign chemical conversion technologies, it is necessary to continue to deepen our understanding of the fundamental steps in catalytic processes. Many technologically relevant catalytic processes take place on the surfaces of small particles, so-called nanoparticles. Incoming reactant molecules interact with these surfaces and are transformed into new product molecules. Many of the details of how the particle surface facilitates those transformations are still not well understood. Direct observation of molecule-surface interactions will aid the design of more durable and effective catalysts. As a first step towards realizing this goal, it is necessary to directly see reactant molecular layers on nanoparticle surfaces. The goal of the project is to discover how to make such observations of individual molecules on nanoparticle surfaces, and correlate the observations with spatially averaged information obtained by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).<br/><br/>To visualize molecules on nanoparticle surfaces, the project will correlate signals from in situ atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy with in situ FTIR spectroscopy recorded from catalysts with well-defined nanostructures (matching exposure conditions in the respective environmental chambers). The recent availability of newly developed, high sensitivity electron detectors now makes it feasible to sense adsorbate layers on surfaces using electron microscopy, but it is not clear how to optimize the experimental conditions to make such observations a reality. Infrared spectroscopy will provide spatially averaged information on the characteristics of the surface sites where adsorbate binding is most likely to occur. This spectroscopy will direct the electron microscopy to surface regions where the concentration of molecules is high, so that optimum conditions for molecular imaging can be discovered. The investigation will focus on CO oxidation and NO reduction with CO over supported metal catalysts - two reactions of fundamental interest with broad impact on energy and environmental technologies. Specifically, this research will provide information on the heterogeneity of the adsorbate layer structure and dynamics at terrace, edge, facet, and defect sites on nanoparticle surfaces during catalysis. Spatially resolved characterization of real adlayer structures will provide fundamental new insights on the nature of nanoparticle surfaces giving more accurate foundational information for developing structure-reactivity relations. The research will enhance fundamental knowledge of adsorbate structure and dynamics leading to new approaches to catalyst design. The project will provide education and outreach activities to students and the public in the fields of catalysis, nanoparticles, atomic resolution electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, ?housekeeping? or ?constitutive? genes carrying out normal maintenance functions are, typically, expressed broadly at consistent levels whereas genes involved in more dynamic processes such as development, stress-response, or immune-related functions have more complex timing and expression level requirements, and often require considerable ?fine-tuning? for proper function.  It has been shown that gene expression levels can be regulated by enzymes known as ?histone writers? that mark the chromatin with activating or repressing marks, but how these enzymes collaborate to effect dynamic rheostat control is poorly understood.  This project will explore how three different histone writers coordinate to fine-tune gene expression, determine how this marking affects chromatin accessibility, and identify factors involved in opening or condensing the chromatin.  Some of these experiments will be incorporated into independent undergraduate research projects, including as part of a new departmental summer intern program directed by the PI that integrates conducting scientific research projects with developing presentation skills.<br/><br/>The hypothesis that histone modifications H3K9me2, H3S10ph, and H4K16ac ?fine-tune? gene expression in a coordinated fashion by regulating the permissiveness of the chromatin state for transcription will be tested.  Interphase, Drosophila 3rd instar larval salivary glands are uniquely suited for these studies, given the lack of interference from residual mitotic H3S10 phosphorylation.  Also, investigators will test whether the three epigenetic mark writers (Su(var)3-9, JIL-1, and MOF) directly regulate each other via post-translational modifications. This will be accomplished using two approaches: 1) wild-type and mutated lacI or GAL-4 fusion constructs for the epigenetic writers JIL-1 H3S10 kinase, Su(var)3-9 H3K9 methyltransferase and MOF H4K16 acetyltransferase will be targeted to different chromatin locations (individually or sequentially) and molecularly characterized with respect to induced changes in epigenetic marking and chromatin structure, recruitment or loss of chromatin remodeling factors, nucleosome array organization, and reporter gene expression; and 2) histone writer crossregulation will be studied by mutating known JIL-1 phosphorylation sites on Su(var)3-9 and potential MOF-1 acetylation sites on JIL-1 and characterizing their subsequent effects on chromatin structure. These studies will assess the special relationship between H3K9me2 and H3S10ph in the relatively unexplored genomic context of euchromatic gene regulation.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms program in BIO/MCB and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program in the Office of Integrative Activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how such organization emerges, and how it affects biodiversity and processes such as carbon storage and nutrient recycling, is thus a key theme in ecological research and management. Animals that act as ?ecosystem engineers? by modifying the environment are major causes of spatial variation. When multiple engineering species co-occur, each may regulate the behavior and impacts of the other; in this case, the properties of the ecosystem may depend on the interplay between engineers. The goals of this research are to understand how ecosystem engineers interact, how they influence ecosystem organization and function, and how these processes depend on human activity. The project focuses on two influential species at opposite ends of the body-size spectrum: white rhinoceros (one of the biggest land animals, which modify vegetation by grazing and transporting nutrients across landscapes) and termites (which boost plant growth by decomposing organic matter and altering soils) in South Africa?s Kruger National Park. There, the world?s largest population of white rhinoceros occupies a landscape with numerous patchily distributed termite colonies and varying levels of risk from poachers. By tracking rhino behavior, experimentally excluding rhino and/or termite activity, and building detailed 3D landscape maps, the research will give insight into how feedbacks between engineers regulate plant growth and nutrient cycling, and whether the threat of poaching disrupts these processes. Because ecosystem engineers occur worldwide (e.g., prairie dogs, beaver, and bison in North America), knowledge produced through this project will be widely applicable to environmental management. The project will also advance understanding and conservation of white rhinoceros, which are threatened with extinction. Finally, the project will train early-career scientists and engage K-12 school audiences and the public through field- and museum-based programs in the United States and South Africa, deepening public understanding of ecosystem science and the important roles played by animals both large and small.<br/><br/>Researchers will use surveys, exclusion experiments, GPS tracking, hormonal assays, and fecal DNA and nutrient analysis together with high-resolution drone-based remote sensing to measure feedbacks between mega-grazers (white rhino) and soil-dwelling decomposers (fungus-farming termites); how these feedbacks create and maintain heterogeneity, regulate ecosystem functions (productivity, decomposition, nutrient transport, nitrogen mineralization), and affect biodiversity; and whether risk of predation (poaching) alters these feedbacks by modifying rhino behavior and abundance. Specifically, data will be analyzed to test: (1) How do termites affect the movement, diet, and behavior of white rhino, and how does that affect nutrient redistribution? (2) How does rhino activity reciprocally alter termite distribution, and how does this feedback loop affect the spatial organization of species and nutrient cycles? (3) How does human pressure affect rhino behavior and physiology, and does this disrupt the rhino?termite feedback and thus diminish the ecological role of mega-grazers? By working across areas that differ in geology, climate, and poaching risk, the researchers will also evaluate how and why such multi-engineer feedbacks depend on environmental context. Conceptually, the project advances the study of ecosystem engineering by linking it to theories of consumer-resource dynamics and ?landscapes of fear?.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is made in response to Dear Colleague Letter 23-109. The US plans to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030, increasing to 110 GW by 2050. Such deployment is projected to power 10 million homes, create 77,000 new jobs, and reduce carbon emissions by 78 million metric tons. However, significant knowledge gaps exist in understanding the unique dynamics of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) during their installation phases, posing major challenges to their safe and cost-efficient deployment. This high-risk, high-reward EAGER project, led by an interdisciplinary team from the University of Maine, will address a critical challenge related to installing OWT blades, which impedes the adoption and development of offshore wind energy.  The team will conduct original research on the orbital motion dynamics in the nacelle of a partially installed bottom-fixed OWT configuration through wave tank experiments and numerical modeling.  They will then use a digital twin framework based on generative artificial intelligence to predict the orbital motion dynamics in real-time. The project also aims to advance offshore wind education and workforce training through activities such as integrating new knowledge into existing undergraduate and graduate courses at the university, expanding collaboration with a local high school?s diverse STEM academy by offering K-12 research internships to students from underrepresented communities; preparing an open-source graduate textbook on OWT installation, and mentoring graduate students in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), Equinor - a global leader in offshore wind farm development, and Kartorium - an Alaska-based digital twin company.  <br/><br/>This project explores the root causes of the intricate oscillation orbits in OWTs during the blade installation phase.  The current lack of understanding in this area including the absence of a predictive tool compromises the safe and cost-efficient deployment of OWT.  The interdisciplinary team from the University of Maine will examine the orbital motion dynamics in the nacelle of a bottom-fixed, monopile-mounted OWT in its hammerhead configuration and identify correlations with variables such as varying sea states, wave headings, and hammerhead configurations.  A Froude-scaled model experiment in a wave tank will be performed, developing and employing a groundbreaking methodology for designing a flexible scaled model of an OWT in hammerhead configurations, suitable for wave tank testing. The experiments will be complemented by a high-fidelity numerical model for analyzing these orbital motions and trajectories. The project will use the results from the model scale experiments and the high-fidelity numerical simulations to design, verify, and evaluate a digital twin of the dynamic system based on generative AI algorithms based on a novel physics-informed latent diffusion model to make real-time predictions of orbital motions. Here, domain-specific physics-based knowledge will be integrated into the architecture and training process of the modern diffusion model, enhancing the AI model?s learning capabilities, interpretability, and generalizability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Successful transplantations extend the lives of patients and improve their life quality. Unfortunately, the waiting list for organ transplants keeps growing due to the shortage of available organs.  Meanwhile a large fraction of donor organs end up unused because of the lack of long-term organ preservation technology. Long-term cryopreservation and biobanking of organs (cooling and storing them at very low or freezing temperatures to save them for future use) can address the organ shortage crisis in transplantation and save millions of lives every year. However, as the ?holy grail? in cryobiology, organ cryopreservation (at temperatures below -150 degrees centigrade) remains an unsolved problem due to critical challenges, in particular, the lack of an efficient approach for ultrafast and uniform heating during rewarming. This project aims to overcome the longstanding barriers in organ cryopreservation by advancing the innovative technology of vitrification (cooling to cryogenic temperatures in the absence of ice) and electromagnetic (EM) heating and developing a transformative technology for the cryopreservation of biological samples with large volume, which addresses the urgent needs in transplantation, regenerative medicine, fertility preservation, biomedical research, and beyond. The project will also encompass significant education activities, expand participation of undergraduate students in the cutting-edge research with a particular focus on underserved groups, extend outreach to the local communities, and foster the development of a diverse and creative workforce to meet the growing demands in cryopreservation.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is to develop an innovative approach for long-term cryopreservation of organs by ice-free vitrification and single-mode electromagnetic resonance (SMER) heating. To accomplish this goal, the electromagnetic characteristics of multiscale biological systems will be investigated, which will bridge the knowledge gap and lay the foundation of EM heating technology for cryopreservation. The SMER system with automatic control of the resonant state will be further developed based on theoretical simulations and experimental studies to achieve fast and uniform rewarming, prevent organ damage caused by devitrification/recrystallization and thermal stress-induced fractures. Vitrification solutions for organ preservation will be designed not only for high vitrification tendency and low toxicity, but also for fast and uniform rewarming by EM heating, addressing the major issues in cooling and rewarming in a holistic way. To evaluate the approaches, a model organ (e.g., rabbit kidney) will be vitrified with the optimized vitrification solution and protocol, rewarmed by the developed SMER system, and then assessed by in vitro evaluations of the viability and functionalities of kidneys. The technologies, devices, and protocols generated by this project will significantly advance our capability for the long-term cryopreservation of organs and pave the way for future endeavors toward the cryopreservation of human organs and other complex biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mitochondria are specialized cellular compartments that are essential for energy transduction, and which contain their own special genes that are maintained independently of the rest of the DNA in the cell. While much is known about the inheritance of genes that reside in the cell nucleus, comparatively little is understood about how mitochondrial genes are inherited. The goals of this project are to reveal, at the molecular and organelle levels, the mechanisms of mitochondrial genome inheritance and how it relates to mitochondrial function. Once this is known, it may be possible to tune energy production up or down in cells by manipulating the number and quality of mitochondrial genomes. The Broader Impacts of the work involve the intrinsic merit of the research as virtually all eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria.  In addition, training opportunities will be provided for students from UC Berkeley, along with those from a local community college.<br/><br/>Mitochondrial oxidative function is at the nexus of cellular metabolism in animal cells. For example, over 90% of the Oxygen in every human breath is consumed in mitochondria by the electron transport chain, generating a trans-membrane proton gradient that not only makes ATP but is necessary for multiple anabolic functions of mitochondria including the synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids. Mitochondrial form and function are integrated by molecular machines that divide and fuse organelle fragments to affect inheritance of the polyploid mitochondrial genome, giving rise to a dynamic network that spans the cytoplasm and is responsive to metabolic signals and energy demands on the micron scale. Understanding how mitochondria are remodeled to ensure that mitochondrial genomes are present in sufficient abundance and positioning to meet energy demands is a major open question in biology. The results of this project will reveal how mitochondrial DNA transmission is mechanistically linked to mitochondrial dynamics, identify molecular tether(s) that position mitochondrial genomes in organelle networks, and generally expand our understanding of mitochondrial quality control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A unique feature of Tachigali is that many species are monocarpic: they flower only once in their lives and die shortly after reproducing. On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, Tachigali trees are also associated with the fungus Amauroderma. The fruiting bodies of this fungus only appear on the roots of Tachigali. They have never been found on other tree species. The specificity of this association suggests a parasitic or pathogenic relationship with Tachigali, but the mode and timing of infection remains unknown. Furthermore, while Amauroderma has been collected around other dead Tachigali species in South America, it is unclear whether this relationship is restricted to monocarpic Tachigali, or whether the tree and fungus have evolved together. This project takes advantage of a rare flowering event in Tachigali to collect and identify Amauroderma fungi and their associated hosts across multiple Amazonian and Central American sites.

Among them, healthcare and public health systems are frequently disrupted or destroyed. Yet, little is known about the decision-making processes that lead to prioritization of resources and efforts as community transitions from response to recovery. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project supports research on theoretical and practical implications of organizational behavior and decision-making processes to restore healthcare access in the wake of wildfire disasters. A key focus is on examining differences between work as planned (stipulated in emergency management plans, incident action plans, recovery plans, etc.) and the work as done (implementation of these plans) as well as their effect on vulnerable populations (e.g., persons with physical and mental health vulnerabilities) within vulnerable communities (e.g., rural, low capacity). <br/><br/>Using the recent Texas Smokehouse Creek Fire as a case study, this project explores an emerging theme of research on how decisions are made and implemented with respect to prioritizing the restoration of healthcare access as incident operations transition from response to recovery. In February 2024, nearly 1.25 M acres of the rural Texas panhandle was consumed by fire in less than two weeks. It significantly disrupted healthcare operations, access, and services in affected communities. To better understand the phenomenon, the research team collects highly ephemeral data including participant observations in planning meetings and briefings within the Emergency Operation Centers, emergency management offices, local and regional health departments, hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities as well as in-person semi-structured interviews with officials across public health, emergency management and relevant public safety leaders in the communities directly impacted by the fire. They are supplemented with secondary data including incident action plans, demobilization plans, operational briefings, recovery plans, and communications with the public and media immediately preceding, during, and after the fire.

Given the substantial environmental challenges climate change presents, there is an urgent need to understand how plants regulate cell-to-cell communication to adapt to changing environments. This project will explore the function and regulation of plant cell-to-cell communication systems. To communicate, plant cells utilize membrane-lined channels that connect adjoining cells. This research will investigate the function of these channels as hubs for reactive oxygen species signaling. Reactive oxygen species play a pivotal role in maintaining normal cellular processes in animals and plants, making them essential components in the health and disease of organisms. In addition, reactive oxygen species play a crucial role during plant stress responses. Unraveling the role of plant cell-to-cell communication channels as reactive oxygen species hubs holds promise for designing climate-resilient crops, crucial for safeguarding human nutrition in the face of climate change. The Broader Impacts of the project include the intrinsic nature of work as all plants have these channels. In addition, the project will involve the training of young scientists at various career stages, providing them with early exposure to life science. Middle and high school students in STEM will have opportunities to gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge cell biology research. The PI will develop a new course to educate undergraduate students, sharpening their skills in plant molecular biology techniques. Moreover, undergraduate students will receive training in utilizing artificial intelligence to study plant cell biology. Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will also receive training. These activities will increase the number and skills of students pursuing future careers in plant biology.<br/><br/>Multicellular organisms rely on cell-to-cell communication to exchange signals and resources for survival and adaptation. In plants, membrane-lined pores, termed plasmodesmata, connect adjoining cells. This study will investigate the regulation and function of plasmodesmata. Recent studies have highlighted that plasmodesmata-located protein 5 (PDLP5) regulates plasmodesmal function and governs plant growth and defense in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using an enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling assay and AlphaFold-Multimer analysis, the PI?s lab identified proteins involved in producing, sensing, and transporting reactive oxygen species (ROS) as functional partners of PDLP5. The findings suggest the function of plasmodesmata as ROS signaling hubs. The project will test the central hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide sensor HPCA1 functions at plasmodesmata to regulate hydrogen peroxide transport by phosphorylating plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (aquaporins), which can transport water and hydrogen peroxide. The project will apply a multidisciplinary approach encompassing genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, structural biology, and yeast analysis. As redox regulation and cell-to-cell communication are fundamental for maintaining the health of multicellular organisms, findings from the project will contribute to improving the health of plants and humans. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosociences along with the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ice age cycles occur on roughly 100,000 year timescales and are marked by 100 meter-scale changes in global sea level in response to the growth and retreat of large continental ice sheets. The timing, duration, and magnitude of ice age sea-level fluctuations is largely controlled by changes in Earth?s surface temperature due to variations in the Earth?s orbit around the sun and the amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our understanding of the complex interactions between Earth?s orbit and greenhouse gases that drive sea-level change remains incomplete. Coastal cave deposits called speleothems provide rare, but valuable constraints on past sea-level change. Speleothems provide an upper limit on the position of the ocean surface, as they form from cavern dripwaters and cannot grow when submerged below sea level and can be precisely dated using U-Th dating or geochronology. For this project, the researcher will produce a novel, speleothem-based sea level record extending back ~400,000 years, covering the last four glacial cycles. This project will improve our understanding of the fundamental physical processes that drive sea-level change during ice age cycles and, by extension, the sea-level rise in a warming world. This is a timely topic, as ?what are the rates, mechanisms, impacts and geographic variability of sea level change?? has been highlighted as one of the eight priority science questions by the National Academy of Sciences? 2015-2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences.<br/><br/>The project will leverage an extraordinary collection of speleothems recovered from presently-submerged Bahamian coastal caves (blue holes) during the late 1980s/early 1990s at depths ranging from 4 to 77 m below present sea level. Such records are exceedingly rare, requiring many years of expensive and risky fieldwork and coordination with experience cave divers. In pursuing the project, the PI will have access to (1) the entire Bahamas collection (~117 speleothems), many of which remain undated, (2) state-of-the-art U-series analytical facilities and (3) cutting-edge microanalytical facilities available at University of Minnesota ? Twin Cities (e.g., micro computed tomography [?CT], electron probe microanalysis [EPMA]) to assess the physical, chemical and petrologic characteristics of growth hiatus boundaries, which is crucial for determining the precise timing of cave inundation due to sea-level rise. Finally, the results will be evaluated using GIA modelling to place the data in the broader context of global mean sea level. Taken together, this approach will greatly enhance the quality of sea-level information that can be extracted from speleothem-based archives, providing critical constraints on the timing and duration of late Pleistocene sea level change.<br/>Results will be useful to the broader Ocean Sciences community to produce robust sea-level projections to help policymakers, stakeholders and the general public in coastal communities adapt to future sea-level rise. Potential avenues for disseminating project results to the general public include outreach efforts such as the Skype a Scientist program, where the PI has an active record of participation. The PI will also partner with NOAA?s Science on a Sphere program to develop data visualizations that effectively convey key concepts of late Pleistocene sea-level change to a non-specialist audience. The PI is also committed to broadening participation in the Ocean Sciences and will partner with the hosting institution to foster an inclusive work environment and also encourage increased STEM participation from historically underrepresented groups through ongoing K-12 outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two examples are the flow of ash and debris following a volcanic eruption and the flow inside circulating fluidized bed reactors, which can be used to convert agricultural waste into biofuels. In both examples, the solid and gaseous phases interact with each other.  This interaction is strong enough to alter large-scale behavior, which, in turn, affects key quantities of interest, such as the speed at which volcanic ash propagates or the chemical conversion efficiency in a reactor.  Predicting the dynamics of these flows is challenging, because they contain particles with widely variable properties such as size, composition, and shape.  This project will use data-driven modeling methodologies to (1) quantify how large-scale behavior of gas-solid systems are affected by variations in particle size; (2) develop a novel, data-driven approach for formulating predictive models of these types of flows; and (3) develop a K-12 outreach demonstration that illustrates how high performance computing can be leveraged to understand and predict multiphase flows that are important to society.<br/><br/>Strongly coupled, gas-solid flows occur in a wide range of industrial and natural systems. In systems with substantial mass loading, momentum coupling between the phases gives rise to large-scale heterogeneity, which directly affects quantities of interest such as chemical conversion of biomass, heat transfer between phases, and settling time. Despite the importance of such flows, accurately predicting their behavior at relevant scales remains challenging.  As a result, engineering decisions are frequently made based on over-simplifications such as idealized mixing or uniformity in the particulate phase. The objective of this project is to advance knowledge of polydisperse, gas-solid flows and close the modeling gap that exists in characterizing and predicting their behavior at relevant scales. In particular, this work will (1) leverage high-fidelity Euler-Lagrange simulations to quantify the relevant terms that dominate polydisperse behavior, particularly with application to variable particle size; (2) introduce a novel modeling framework capable of distilling complex data into optimally simple and accurate models; and (3) propose models for polydisperse gas-solid flows that are robust across relevant scales and easily interpretable and integrated into existing solvers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project investigates the effectiveness of perovskite materials to serve the dual function of capturing CO2 and catalyzing its conversion to hydrocarbons by reaction with CH4.  Specifically, the aim is to tune the perovskite composition to promote efficient capture of CO2, followed by reaction with CH4, to produce syngas, ethane, and ethylene - all of value as essential platform chemicals that can be readily converted to polymers and fuels.  Thus, the project explores a novel approach to achieving the simultaneous goals of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while securing future supplies of energy and chemical raw materials. The project integrates the research with an education and outreach plan introducing students to sustainable engineering precepts, while broadening and diversifying the future science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>The project investigates structure-composition-function properties of sorption-enhanced perovskite oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon synthesis via either dry methane reforming (DRM) or CO2-mediated oxidative coupling of methane (CO2-OCM).  Specifically, the project focuses on SrTiO3 and CaTiO3 given their inherent basicity (which promotes the adsorption of CO2), combined with their capability to activate CO2 and CH4 using oxygen vacancies.  Preliminary studies by the investigator have determined that the SrTiO3-based multifunctional catalysts, doped with Ni, can capture CO2 and convert it to syngas, ethane, and ethylene.  The project will use SrTi1-xMxO3/SrO or CaTi1-xMxO3/CaO  (with M=Ce, Mn and x = 0 ? 0.1) systems to selectivity adsorb CO2 from simulated ideal or flue gas mixtures.  Specific goals include: (1) elucidating the transport and reaction kinetics for CO2 capture and release in air and flue streams, (2) evaluating the effects of dopant metals on the kinetics, selectivity, and stability of the multifunctional catalysts under reaction conditions, and (3) enhancing the surface area of the perovskite-based catalysts by synthesizing them on monolith supports, and 4) ensuring the stability of the catalysts by investigating cyclic operation to periodically regenerate the catalysts due to metal-dopant exsolution, and/or perovskite structure destabilization under reaction conditions.  The project utilizes a broad range of characterization and evaluation techniques, highlighted by in situ and operando high-pressure/high-temperature FTIR and Raman spectroscopic characterization of adsorbed surface species (FTIR) and oxygen vacancies (Raman), the latter in collaboration with Dr. T. J. Kim at Stony Brook University.  Integration of the research with educational and outreach initiatives focuses on sustainable engineering concepts related to chemical engineering, particularly with respect to improving the inclusiveness of women in the chemical engineering field.  Efforts along those lines will be incorporated into well-established education and outreach programs for underrepresented students at the investigator?s institution. Specifically, the investigator plans to 1) start an annual graduate preparation retreat program for first-year graduate women in engineering, 2) develop research experience for undergraduate women and transfer students, 3) develop hands-on engineering activities for K-8 girls to solve environmental problems, and 4) expand undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering course curricula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is driven by the need for efficient, accurate tools that can interpret complex data and pinpoint the origin of these pollutants, even without complete knowledge of the environment. To address such needs, the project proposes a revolutionary approach using the domain of dependence, a concept derived from the governing equations of fluid dynamics, for a network of sensors. The project also aims to understand the intricate dynamics between pollutants and turbulent flows, leveraging the probability distribution of these domains of dependence to effectively interpret sensor data and give uncertainty bounds for the prediction. The implications of this work extend beyond pollution detection, offering new insights and tools for weather forecasting and disaster response, thereby contributing to a safer, more resilient society.<br/><br/>The core of this research is to develop and utilize a novel framework for computing and utilizing the probability distribution of the domain of dependence in turbulent, uncertain flows. These dependence fields can be obtained from the adjoint simulations of the scalar transport equations, where flow physics is integrated into scientific search strategies of localized scalar sources. By aggregating multiple domains of dependence, the project designs a geometric approach to locate the scalar source, enhancing accuracy and reliability. A pivotal aspect of this research involves adapting to the inherent uncertainties in the flow fields by utilizing the probabilistic nature of the probabilistic domain of dependence, which allows for a more nuanced and informed interpretation of sensor data.  Uncertainties in the prediction can also be evaluated and mitigated by optimizing sensor networks to maximize information extraction. The project will use advanced sensitivity analysis techniques to exploit the probabilistic domain of dependence for sensor measurements, providing a new method for optimizing sensor placement and trajectory in pollution detection. This research is not only transformative for environmental science and urban planning but also holds the potential for significant advancements in the detection of extreme weather events and other anomalies in fluid dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High flow velocities occur in, valves, pumps, hydraulic tools, hydro-turbines, and ship propellers.  The high flow velocity decreases the local pressure sufficiently to cause the liquid to vaporize and form small bubbles that collapse after the pressure rises again.  When a cavitation bubble collapses near a solid surface it forms a liquid jet directed toward the surface which causes the bubble to migrate in that direction.  If the jet impinges on the surface or the bubble collapses directly onto it, then undesirable consequences occur.  These consequences include surface damage that increases operational costs and reduces efficiency, undesirable structural vibrations, and high levels of noise, which can harm nearby people or animals.  While rigid solid surfaces attract cavitation bubbles, gaseous surfaces repel them.  A few scientific studies show that solid surfaces with gas-filled holes can repel a collapsing cavitation bubble, but the parameter space explored in these works is minimal and insufficient to develop bubble repellent surfaces.  Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to study a wide parameter space of solid surfaces with gas-filled holes to find optimal surface geometries that repel cavitation bubbles and prevent cavitation damage, undesirable noise, and undesirable structural vibrations.  The high-speed videos resulting from this work will also be used to develop educational videos that describe cavitation bubble dynamics to the public on YouTube.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand when mixed solid-gaseous surfaces repel cavitation bubbles.  To accomplish this, cavitation bubbles will be formed with a pulsed laser next to a surface that consists of a rigid solid material with air-filled holes. Bubble jetting and migration behaviors will be studied using high-speed photography with the objective to measure and model the cavitation bubble collapse and migration dynamics near a solid surface with a single gas-filled hole, or an array of gas-filled holes.  Bubble behaviors will be mapped to find regions of bubble repulsion, and theoretical models will be created to predict the bubble behavior transitions.  These models can then be used to design novel cavitation bubble repelling surfaces that prevent damage, noise, and undesirable vibrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Shape reconfiguration induced by instabilities is repeatable, fast, extensive, triggered on-demand, and consume minimal energy input. These remarkable characteristics present tremendous potential for a variety of adaptive structures and autonomous machines ranging from small medical robots to giant deployable spacecraft. Current shape-reconfigurable structures are limited in their achievable shapes, motions, and stiffness, making them unsuitable for some functional and load-bearing applications. The outcome of this research will provide theoretical models, experimental data, simulation tools, and new design methods for achieving structures that can extensively vary their shapes while maintaining stiffness as well as volume and mass efficiency. The knowledge generated will expand the capabilities of vehicles to adapt in remote and unknown environments and advance the frontiers of space exploration, targeted drug delivery, and robotic systems. For example, reconfigurable sensor and antenna structures equipped on swarms or constellations of small satellites could enable low-cost, large-scale measurements for inquiry in geospace and atmospheric science.

The goal of the 2024 GRC/GRS Nanotechnology for Agriculture and Food Systems is to provide academic and governmental scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs, and graduate students, as well as scientists and engineers from business, and non-governmental organizations with the framework necessary to address complex questions at the interface of agriculture, food, and nanotechnology required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications in food and agriculture systems. A diverse range of invited speakers and discussion leaders from 12 countries will present a comprehensive vision of critical and emerging nanotechnology research advances across the field of agricultural, environmental, and food science. The objectives of this GRC/GRS are: 1) Bring together experts, emerging investigators and stakeholders to discuss nanotechnology advances, directions, and needs in food and agriculture; 2) Identify cutting-edge research and emerging opportunities to address global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, food safety, and agricultural productivity, and 3) Embolden the knowledge that ?nano in food & agriculture? represents a single unifying concept, rather than two distinct subfields. With growing agricultural demands on diminishing arable lands, agricultural output and food production will require innovative technologies and a collective voice of scientists, engineers, and stakeholders to address global needs. The impact of nanotechnology within information science, biotechnology, plant science, animal science, crop, and food science/technology, agricultural and biosystems engineering, and environmental science and engineering are envisioned to lead to revolutionary advances in the next 5-15 years for sustainable food production. The successful achievement of this vision requires the profound intellectual commitment of scientists and engineers in a highly integrated engagement across numerous disciplines. Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize global agricultural and food systems in numerous ways, and this GRC/GRS will help build a diverse community committed to advancing work in the area of nanotechnology for agriculture and food systems, leading to novel ideas and approaches to create a sustainable future. <br/><br/>Nanoscale science and engineering has an important role in creating safer, more productive, and sustainable agriculture and food systems. Given that research at the nanoscale in agriculture and food systems is only in its second decade, it is anticipated that the ?new? applications to participate in this GRC/GRS will come from persons relatively early in their careers. To encourage open communication, each conference member agrees that the presented information is private and not for public use. This collaborative GRC/GRS environment, with an emphasis on sharing previously unpublished information, enables the cultivation of innovative approaches to address the most critical global challenges.

The goal of this project is to investigate how a class of small-molecule compounds called dipeptides control the activity of the central carbon metabolism of plants. This research may lead to innovation in the form of dipeptide-based strategies for improving plant fitness and perhaps generate knowledge that can be used in human and animal health. This project will provide research training for high school students, undergraduate students and post-doctoral associates.<br/><br/>Due to its rapid and reversible nature, small-molecule regulation of key enzymatic activities is vital to controlling metabolic fluxes.

This research aims to systematically characterize the newly discovered enzyme-dipeptide interaction network and its role in regulating central carbon metabolism in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To elucidate the metabolic consequences of the studied enzyme-dipeptide interactions, the research will exploit a combination of in vitro bimolecular binding assays, characterization of enzymatic activities, comprehensive metabolomic analysis of steady-state metabolite levels, and 13C metabolic flux analysis after dipeptide treatments. The results of these assays will be overlaid with dipeptide accumulation patterns to demonstrate the physiological relevance of the identified interactions. The basic knowledge accrued through this project will shed light on one of the central questions in biology: how organisms regulate their metabolism as they adapt to the environment.

Therefore, they must be safe at all times and on all levels, from their design to their operation. This is especially challenging since industrial control software is largely automated to make decisions on behalf of humans while being increasingly targeted by adversarial cyber-physical attacks. In order to act in advance before unsafe or undesired situations occur, models that describe the physics of the system and the effects of potential security attacks need to become a central element in designing industrial control systems. The project's novelties are mathematics- and logic-based software-development methods to make industrial control software aware of real-world effects and threats. The project's impacts are improved support for practitioners in developing trustworthy and resilient industrial control systems, with the aim of providing the crucial missing verification link between industrial control software development and execution.<br/><br/>The project's technical approach studies a provably correct development stack for industrial control systems with Programmable Logic Control (PLC) that is expected to provide a chain of fully verified links from high-level models all the way down to the running code, accompanied by synthesized correctness proofs. The correctness proofs entail strong safety guarantees on the actual industrial control system implementation through validation methods to analyze, at runtime, whether models and reality agree and to counteract when deviations occur. To this end, the team of researchers expects to advance techniques for verified runtime monitoring of the operating context and for verified bi-directional translation between code and models. The models combine differential equations with nondeterministic control and environment models to describe physical effects and security threats. Such predictive models, safety proofs, and validation methods are crucial elements of every trustworthy implementation stack so that proofs from models transfer to the running system. To address design safety at the scale of industrial control systems, the investigators bring together complementary expertise in foundations and practical verification for cyber-physical systems, with field expertise in embedded systems for industrial control systems safety and security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent research indicates that noise pollution could also affect how well animals learn to solve problems. This award examines the mechanism through which noise pollution affects animal cognition and will help determine whether animals living in noisy habitats (e.g., near highways or busy cities) can overcome the negative impacts of these noise sources on their cognitive performance. This research will provide generalizable insights about how animals respond to changing environmental conditions and will have key implications for the conservation of animal populations. With similar negative effects of noise on cognitive function also proposed for humans, better understanding this relationship will also likely have direct application to the welfare of human societies. The award will provide key infrastructure and research capability at a primarily undergraduate and minority-serving institution, leading directly to numerous opportunities for undergraduate students to gain hands-on research experiences that will help support their future careers in science, especially from groups who have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM fields. <br/><br/><br/>Anthropogenic noise has a number of detrimental impacts on animal physiology, behavior, populations, and communities. A recent study demonstrated further negative effects on cognitive function in one species of captive-raised songbird, but this phenomenon has been little studied and the mechanisms driving this relationship are unknown. The goal of this research is to determine whether traffic noise similarly impacts cognition in other songbird species and whether animals that regularly encounter noise pollution in their environment continue to experience the same level of reduced cognitive performance as nave individuals. This research will expose birds to foraging tasks designed to measure a variety of aspects of animal cognition (e.g., inhibitory control, motor learning, associative learning, spatial memory, etc.) under varying road traffic noise regimes. This research will make several advances by examining how varying the type and duration of traffic noise exposure impacts cognitive performance in birds held under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, determining whether previous findings extend to wild songbird species, and establish whether noise differentially affects those animals living in wild populations that are more exposed to noise pollution. The results of this award will shed light on the mechanisms driving noise-induced cognitive inhibition, with implications for cognitive science, animal behavior, urban ecology, and conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Closely related viruses, however, can have very dissimilar genomes, complicating integration of knowledge acquired from the study of independent viruses, and limiting prediction of the characteristics and potential threats of emerging viruses. Viruses, however, conserve a few structural properties that could help circumvent this problem. Most viruses store their infective genetic material in a protein shell called a capsid. The capsid self-assembles from multiple copies of the same (or similar) proteins, and most capsids display icosahedral symmetry. This architecture optimizes the interaction of proteins and the volume available to store the viral genetic information. This research project hypothesizes that viruses have evolved a limited set of replication strategies to specialize and exploit the reduced number of geometrical templates capable of forming icosahedral capsids. This, in turn, may have constrained the number of three-dimensional configurations adopted by capsid proteins, providing a mechanistic rationale for the existence of viral structural lineages. This hypothesis will be tested by analyzing and comparing hundreds of viruses from multiple different viral families using novel mathematical methods. Confirming this hypothesis will offer a quantitative framework to study viral evolution and open the door to design of generic antiviral strategies targeting viruses in the same structural lineage.<br/><br/>Only ten protein folds have been identified among major capsid proteins of viruses that form icosahedral capsids. These folds define viral lineages that group viruses that can be genetically unrelated and infect hosts from different domains of life. This limited number of folds contrasts with the vast genetic diversity of viruses. The existence of these folds across the virosphere, however, remains unknown. Here, it is hypothesized that there is a direct relationship between the viral replication strategy of each viral lineage, the icosahedral lattice of the capsid, and the fold of capsid proteins. The hypothesis will be tested by developing a database that will include the viral replication, protein fold, and capsid lattice of five hundred viruses that have been reconstructed at high or medium molecular resolution. Voronoi tessellations and protein-protein interaction lattices will be obtained to identify computationally the icosahedral lattice associated to each virus. Additionally, molecular measurements of the reconstructed capsids will be obtained to establish allometric relationships for at least one viral lineage, facilitating the prediction of icosahedral capsid properties from genomic information. The new icosahedral framework will be also extended to obtain new sets of elongated capsids, which represent the second most abundant type of capsid. The methods will be disseminated online for use by viral structure researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monitoring of lakes, especially those that are ice covered in winter months, is critical to understand how lakes are changing. However, it is difficult to make such measurements because of the high cost to install and maintain instruments in the lake year-round. This Ideas Lab: Engineering Technologies to Advance Underwater Sciences (ETAUS) project will advance the field of water quality monitoring by developing a sensor that can monitor multiple water quality parameters throughout the year and fill this knowledge gap. The goal for the sensor development is to simultaneously measure parameters that are significant components of measuring a lake?s influence on climate change (carbon dioxide, methane), the health of the lake ecosystem (temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen), and the impacts of human influence (salinity, temperature). An easy-to-deploy, cost-effective sensor will provide an improved understanding of the carbon footprint of all lake systems that will better inform lake management decisions. The education programs supported by this project will also promote learning and discovery of water quality issues, science, and solutions for children and adults through the partnership with the Museum of Science (MOS) in Boston. The MOS has a focus on working with women and girls from the Boston community in engineering and a field-leading emphasis on universal design. <br/><br/>The overall aim of this project is to increase our quantitative understanding of greenhouse gas cycling within lakes through the development of a novel, miniature, fiber-optic multiparameter sensor (FOMS) capable of long-term, under-ice deployment. A fundamental understanding of the wave-material/structure interaction in cascaded high-Q ring resonators will be achieved to develop miniature photonic sensors for simultaneous monitoring of multiple parameters with high analyte specificity and fast response. The FOMS will be developed to measure seven parameters simultaneously, including CO2 and CH4, and deployed on a stationary mooring and mobile underwater robotic platforms for high temporal and spatial resolution data collection. The development and calibration of the FOMS will be guided by a novel machine learning-based sensor calibration model that will help transform the FOMS into an intelligent sensing system, leading to high-fidelity ?fingerprint? sensing that can address hardware variations, noise in the monitoring environment, nonlinearities and uncertainties in the sensor response, and cross-talk between the multiple sensor inputs. Data will be collected year-round using the FOMS across stationary and mobile platforms, which will produce four-dimensional data. Data assimilation methods will be compared with the goal of producing a modeling framework that can inform measurement optimization in future deployments. Collectively, the development, testing, and use of the FOMS will produce a measurement tool and framework for a quantitative understanding of GHG production, consumption, and transport in ice-covered lakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Aim 2, he will address the mechanics and scaling of swimming in anurans. He will develop and empirically test a mathematical model of the complete swimming stroke in frogs, then use the model and phylogenetic comparative methods to explain the scaling between peak swimming velocity and body mass. In Aim 3, the PI will examine the sensitivity of swimming performance to different morphological variables through both mathematical and statistical modeling, and he will test the tempo and mode of morphological and swimming performance evolution as a function of mechanical sensitivity. The intellectual merit of the project primarily stems from integrating disparate methods (experiments, mathematical modeling, phylogenetic analyses) and providing an evolutionary comparative framework for testing general physical principles and their influence on the macroevolution of form and function. The broader impacts of the project will result from developing secondary education in scientific research and evolutionary concepts in the PI's state, integrating research training into undergraduate laboratories, and training young researchers in biomechanics in phylogenetic comparative methods workshops. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program of BIO-Integrative Organismal Systems and the Established Program to Support Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rainforests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photosynthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. <br/><br/>The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photosynthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The software developed in this project connects the ever-growing volume of environmental data being collected from high latitudes datasets with cutting-edge software to advance understanding of permafrost landscapes. These analyses will help understand permafrost landscape dynamics and their influence on carbon release, which is crucial for accurate climate projections and informed mitigation efforts. This work trains the next generation of geoscientists in the use of advanced data and computational tools, ensuring they are well-equipped to tackle complex environmental challenges and fostering a more inclusive and diverse scientific community. Through its commitment to open-source tools and interoperability, PyCoGSS also promotes interdisciplinary investigations in permafrost research. This project advances our understanding of climate change and its effects on landscapes while providing hands-on learning experiences in geospatial science through the development of teaching materials alongside research tools.<br/><br/>Recent advancements in satellite technology and software have improved the study of permafrost landscapes, but the lack of appropriate cyberinfrastructure and training hinders widespread adoption, limiting progress in understanding permafrost landscape dynamics. To overcome this, the project combines process geomorphology with advanced computational tools for acquiring, analyzing, and visualizing large interdisciplinary datasets. The Python Computational Geomorphology Software System (PyCoGSS) enables reproducible and scalable analyses of landscape morphology, topographic change, and ecohydrological indicators. The software facilitates the acquisition, analysis, and visualization of topographic and multispectral data, allowing for spatial and temporal trend analyses. It enables quick experimentation with different combinations of morphometric data and multispectral products as inputs to machine learning algorithms. The software development prioritizes user-friendliness and accessibility, catering to researchers at different career stages.

This information, gleaned from the geologic past across climate perturbations, is vital for understanding and predicting how evolution will operate across the biodiversity and climate crises today. The research team will focus on groups of ancient echinoderms, marine invertebrates (e.g., sea stars) that were globally widespread through Earth?s history. This group is vastly understudied and, as such, analyses conducted on the group will provide critical insight into animal response to Earth systems perturbations. New organismal forms appear through shifts in developmental timing, called heterochrony. What is unclear is how shifts in climate, organism biogeography, and ecology affect heterochronic shifts. This research uses a holistic approach via multiple analyses, addressing changes in ecology, biogeography, and heterochrony through extreme climate events that occurred hundreds of millions of years ago, to explore aspects of organisms? evolutionary history and long-term consequences.<br/><br/>Database, museum, and literature data will be used jointly within phylogenetic frameworks to develop understanding of the evolutionary dynamics (i.e., changes in rates of evolution, heterochrony, biogeography, ecology) of extinct echinoderms. The chief merit of this research is the integration of multiple variables within a phylogenetic context to quantitatively understand broader patterns of evolution through abiotic change on Earth. This project will train the next generation of museum curators, educators, and researchers, and provide open-access information about echinoderms.

Such lattice-based cryptography has many attractive properties including its apparent security even against adversaries equipped with quantum computers (being ""post-quantum"") and its usefulness in constructing advanced primitives, including Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which allows for ""computing on encrypted data."" Based on this, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently selected several lattice-based cryptosystems for standardization as part of their years-long post-quantum cryptography standardization process. As lattice-based cryptosystems will be in widespread use in the near future, it is especially urgent to understand the complexity (security) of the problems that underlie them.<br/><br/>This project has three primary research goals. First, the project seeks to better understand the fine-grained complexity of lattice problems, i.e., the precise running time necessary to solve the computational problems underlying lattice-based cryptosystems. This work will ideally lead to a better understanding of the practical security of these cryptosystems. Second, this project will study connections between lattices and error-correcting codes, which have many similarities to lattices and are important and well-studied objects in their own right. Third, this project will study the complexity of problems on algebraically structured lattices. Cryptosystems based on these lattices---which include most practical cryptosystems, including those recently selected for standardization by NIST---are generally much more efficient, but much less is known about the complexity of the problems that underlie them. In addition to these main research goals, the investigators will write a comprehensive, freely available textbook about lattices in computer science.

Modern theories of adhesion were originally developed to describe contact with relatively stiff materials like rubber, but much softer sticky materials are ubiquitous in biology, medicine, engineering, and everyday consumer products. Over the past decade, soft solid surface mechanics has emerged as an exciting new field of study, driven largely by the surprising discovery that classic theories fail to describe the contact behavior of compliant materials and that soft materials adhere very differently than their stiffer counterparts. Recent experiments, theory, and simulations have revealed a rich array of new physics and suggest a powerful new design space for engineering applications. The fundamental discoveries and materials developed through this research project will enable the development of new strain-controlled, responsive adhesives and will also involve student researchers at various stages of their educational careers from undergraduates to postdoctoral scholars. An ?Adhesion Engineering Summer Camp? will be established to bring Williams College students to visit Purdue University each summer of the project.<br/><br/>The surface properties of compliant polymers have been shown to change as a function of bulk deformation in previously-unanticipated ways. While recent debates over the nature of strain-dependent surface stress in soft solids have motivated numerous experimental and theoretical studies, much less work has focused on strain-dependent adhesion. By performing measurements that directly investigate the normal adhesive response of compliant network polymer systems as a function of both quasi-static and dynamic deformation using integrated mechanical testing and direct imaging, this project will establish a fundamental understanding of how the adhesion of soft materials is modified by deformation across a broad range of length scales, time scales, and material properties. The interplay between strain, adhesion energy, network architecture, and material relaxation mechanisms will be investigated through the experimental, numerical, and theoretical work in this collaborative grant. The specific research objectives of the project will be to (i) quantify quasistatic adhesion to stretched, compliant network polymer systems across length scales and (ii) characterize the adhesive response of compliant networked polymer systems during dynamic deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this period, the unprecedented achievements of the Computer Vision domain made many believe that object detection is a solved problem. However, when it comes to scientific imagery such as microscopic, telescopic, aerial, satellite, and medical images, the general-purpose object-detection algorithms are far from perfect. A pixel-precise segmentation of objects and identification of their physical properties based on their texture features are still outstanding challenges in many interdisciplinary areas of research. Space Weather is one such area. Extreme space-weather events, similar to extreme terrestrial events, can have drastic economic and collateral impacts on mankind. Continuous and automatic monitoring of solar filaments plays an integral role in achieving reliable space-weather forecast/prediction systems, which consequently results in the technical preparedness much needed in many infrastructural aspects of the society, such as the power grid and the GPS systems. Our Machine Learning Ecosystem brings automatic, accurate, and reliable analyses of filaments? dynamic behavior to the experts? fingertips. The main contributions of this ecosystem are two data products of annotated filaments, and four software products which carry out the annotation (localization, identification, and segmentation) of these filaments. This modular ecosystem can be easily expanded in the future, beyond the lifetime of the award, as faster and more efficient modules are expected to be implemented by the community and replace the existing ones. Throughout the development of this project, we consult with the instrument/data experts from the National Solar Observatory (NSO) for proper utilization of the observation images and metadata we integrate from the six ground-based observatories of the Global Oscillation Network Group, that together provide a full-disk and continuous (24/7) coverage of the Sun.<br/><br/>The primary focus of this project is on the localization and segmentation of a specific solar event, called a filament, and the identification of its magnetic field chirality. That said, the novel concepts investigated in this project, such as the detection algorithm, the augmentation engine, and the segmentation loss function which is sensitive to granularities of objects, remain agnostic to the type of the event/object of interest. Moreover, the released datasets of annotated filaments can serve the Computer Vision community as a testbed for algorithms that aim at high-precision segmentation of objects. Our Machine Learning Ecosystem consists of two data products and four software products. The largest collection of manually annotated filaments data, and a continuously-growing collection of automatically annotated filaments are the two main data products. The main software products are (1) an augmentation engine that provides users with practically unlimited semi-real filament instances, (2) a deep neural network algorithm for localization, segmentation, and classification of filaments, (3) a high-precision segmentation loss function (sensitive to granularities of the observed filaments) that guides the segmentation task, and (4) a deployable detection module which carries out the localization, segmentation, and classification tasks in real time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Common sources of uncertainty include missing values, sensor errors, bias, outliers, and many other factors. Classical deterministic data management does not track uncertainty and, thus requires data quality issues to be resolved before data is ingested into the system, which is often not feasible. The net effect is that inherently uncertain data is being treated as certain. However, if ignored, data uncertainty results in hard to trace errors, which in turn can have severe real world implications such as unfounded scientific discoveries, financial damages, or even medical decisions based on incorrect data. While there exist techniques for managing incomplete data, these techniques are generally too heavy-weight for real-world usage and may hide relevant information from users. The goal of this project is to develop light-weight techniques for managing uncertain data that empower a wide range of applications to manage uncertainty.<br/><br/>Current methods for managing uncertain data are often computationally expensive and are only applicable to limited types of queries. The planned research will result in novel methods for managing uncertain data that bridge the gap between deterministic and incomplete data management. The foundation of this project are uncertainty-annotated databases, which enrich data with uncertainty labels and provide semantics for propagating these labels through queries. The result is a strict generalization of classical data management that combines the performance, generality, and ease-of-use of deterministic data management with the strong correctness guarantees of incomplete database techniques. Achieving this goal is highly non-trivial, because query evaluation over uncertain data is intractable, even for relatively simple uncertain data models and restricted classes of queries. Three main research thrusts will be explored that address the main challenges in developing such a technique: (i) uncertainty-annotated databases will be extended with attribute-level annotations and an compact encoding of an over-approximation of possible answers. This enables the approach to handle missing data and to deal with non-monotone queries such as queries with aggregation; (ii) methods to compactly approximating incomplete databases will be developed to deal with the large or even infinite sets of possible results produced by queries over uncertain data; (iii) optimized algorithms for query evaluation over uncertainty-annotated databases will be developed to address the performance limitations of queries over uncertain data. The planned work will significantly enhance the state-of-the-art in uncertain data management by, for the first time, enabling principled uncertainty management for complex queries at a reasonable cost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include controlling an excavator, teleoperating a surgical robot, and operating a cutting-edge brain-controlled prosthetic limb. However, it remains unknown how large sets of control variables can be organized to optimize how people learn to control complex machines. This project seeks to promote the progress of science and advance the national health by addressing two questions related to the design and implementation of adaptive brain-machine-interfaces such as those used by severely impaired people to control assistive robotics. An important novelty of the researched approach is the non-invasive recording of finger motions as a proxy for the high-dimensional inputs typically provided by intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI). The specific research questions addressed by this project include: 1) ""How should control signals be presented to the user at the control interface to optimize output behavior of the machine?"", and 2) ""Should the robotic system predict what the user wants it to do and adapt its behavior accordingly, and if so, how should task-level control be shared between the user and the machine to optimize task performance?"". Project outcomes promise to be applicable to a wide range of difficult human-machine interaction problems. The awardee's institution is a Hispanic Serving Institution; the research includes outreach activities that specifically engage underrepresented groups, undergraduate students, and the local community.<br/><br/>The project will use two models of intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) to evaluate how high-dimensional human input should be mapped onto command variables for a 6 degree-of-freedom embodied robotic arm. The project uses non-invasive recording of finger motions as a proxy for the high-dimensional inputs typically provided by iBCIs. The first model linearly projects finger articulations into one of seven different robot command spaces (effector position, joint velocity, motor torques, etc.). The project team will evaluate how human subjects perform with the assistive robot on tasks of daily living (e.g., moving objects on a tabletop or bringing a cup to their mouth) with each of the seven different interfaces.  By doing so, they will determine the role that command space encoding plays in the rate of human learning and the ultimate extent of task proficiency. The second model acquires human kinematic input to drive a deep neural network model of motor cortex neurons, whose firing rates are then passed through a decoding algorithm to infer commands for the robot; this is an explicit and validated model of intracortical brain-computer interfaces. The project team will use this model to determine optimal rates of online decoder adaptation to emulated neural input, and the extent to which the adaptation rates interact with the choice of command space in optimizing task performance of the assistive robotic machine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Angular momentum carrying acoustic waves, such as acoustic vortex beam, are a special type of sound waves that have a rotating pressure field or energy flux. Previous studies indicated that these waves could have many potential biomedical applications, including medical imaging with better resolution than traditional ultrasound imaging and targeted ultrasonic removal of kidney stones and blood clots with higher efficacy than classical focused ultrasound therapies. However, these studies focused on waves propagating underwater and ignored the anisotropy and heterogeneity of biomaterials such as muscle fibers. Recent theoretical studies have indicated that acoustic angular momenta will couple when propagating in anisotropic or heterogeneity materials, altering the propagation path of the wave, and potentially impeding their reliable use in the suggested biomedical applications. The research supported by this CAREER award seeks to understand the fundamental coupling mechanism between different acoustic angular momenta, especially when propagating in anisotropic biomaterials, through modeling and experimentation. This understanding will be applied to demonstrate imaging and blood clot thrombolysis capabilities through anisotropic media. The results from this research will advance knowledge in acoustics, dynamics, biomechanics, as well as biomedical engineering, and can potentially lead to novel medical diagnostics and therapies. This award will positively impact STEM education through collaboration with existing programs at Georgia Tech aimed to engage students and high school science teachers from the Atlanta Public Schools and Atlanta International School, especially from currently underrepresented groups, and to promote their participation in research.

The central hypothesis of this research is that this coupling occurs through Coriolis effects resulting from rotations induced by the wave-medium interactions. The researchers will test this hypothesis in theoretical models and in experiments conducted underwater and in soft anisotropic media.  They will probe the ability to translate this understanding to the suggested imaging and thrombolysis capabilities experimentally using anisotropic tissue mimicking gels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social psychology helps to understand how biases such as stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination contribute to Native Americans? disparate outcomes. This research team has identified another distinct form of bias that undermines Native Americans? opportunities and wellbeing: biases of omission. Biases of omission refer to the ways in which Native Americans are written out of public consciousness. For example, research demonstrates that relative to other groups, mainstream television and news media rarely include Native People or discuss Native issues. Americans are also taught relatively little -- and largely inaccurate -- information about Native Americans. As one example, the majority of history curricula in American schools discuss Native Peoples only in pre-20th century contexts, rendering invisible the 5.2 million Native Americans currently living in the United States. The research in this project documents the scope and psychological impact of Native omissions, and explores how non-Native Americans justify those omissions. Studies also examine the motivational underpinnings of the relation between justifications of Native omissions and non-Natives? national esteem, and test the efficacy of interventions that offer potential for improving Native peoples? wellbeing.<br/> <br/>This project explores both the scope of biases of omissions of Native Americans and the psychological processes that perpetuate these biases. The research is based on the observation that a core cultural narrative of the United States is that of an exceptional, morally superior, equitable, and meritocratic society. Yet Native Peoples? historic and contemporary experiences in the United States, including state-sanctioned violence and discrimination arising from the country?s settler colonial origins, contradicts these core cultural narratives. It is therefore hypothesized that Native omissions arise from a desire among non-Native Americans to protect these core cultural narratives and to maintain national esteem -- a sense of attachment to and pride in one?s nation. Three lines of studies test the tenets of this theoretical framework using large samples of Native American participants coupled with samples of non-Native adults from across the United States. The first phase of research documents the scope and psychological impact of Native omissions, including assessments of how and in what domains Native People experience omissions in U.S. society and the effect of omissions on individual and community wellbeing. Additional studies explore how and to what extent non-Native Americans justify omissions documented by Native participants, and whether justifications of Native omissions play a culturally protective role for non-Natives. The final phase of research examines the efficacy of acknowledging Native omissions as a means of improving Native peoples? wellbeing by examining whether acknowledgements (vs. justifications) of Native omissions by mainstream U.S. institutions can enhance Native Americans? individual and collective wellbeing. The program of research aims to expand the psychological literature by laying the theoretical groundwork for understanding an understudied form of bias and by shedding light on the experiences of Native Americans -- people who are vastly underrepresented in psychological theory and research. The project also documents and helps to change the psychological processes that perpetuate social inequalities, particularly those experienced by Native Americans, thereby contributing to the science of broadening participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scarcity of resources, environmental regulations, and potential profits from salvaging valuable materials and components have motivated consideration of end-of-use product recovery and remanufacturing. However there are significant challenges related to the labor-intensive nature of disassembly, which is an integral part of critical remanufacturing operations such as reuse, repair, maintenance, and recycling. This project focuses on robot-assisted disassembly to increase productivity, while enhancing job satisfaction and ensuring worker safety. Today, disassembly is still a predominantly labor-intensive process that requires direct contact with many elements that are potentially harmful to human health. The research will advance fundamental understanding of the way humans and robots distribute tasks, cooperate, and interact in a safe and complementary manner. Among the expected benefits of the research results are improved quality of life for remanufacturing workers, increased recycling and reduced waste for used electronic materials, the creation of new manufacturing jobs, reduced dependency on foreign sources of strategic materials, and increased stocks of domestically harvested rare earth elements. The multidisciplinary research crosses the boundaries between robotics, sustainable design, human factors, data science, and labor economics, by the joint efforts between the University at Buffalo (UB) and the University of Florida (UF). The research will positively impact engineering education and workforce development through educational and outreach activities such as workshops for K12 students, course development at both institutions, timely training of graduate students, and a set of workshops for industry and academic audiences. <br/><br/>The project is focused on advancing an integrated framework that utilizes the capabilities of both humans and robots in a safe, complementary, and interactive manner, towards designing an economically viable disassembly system for the remanufacturing industry.

These ecosystems are also being affected by climate variability and warming. Changes in land-use have the potential for important feedbacks on our climate, especially via the carbon cycle. However, the magnitude of these feedbacks on ecosystems are uncertain. This is particularly the case for soil carbon in the tropics. Field measurements of the extent and location of carbon stored in tropical soils, and the processes that control net carbon balance remain sparse. This study specifically looks at tropical peatlands, a very carbon-rich type of habitat. Current maps are believed to significantly underestimate tropical wetland (and peatland) areas resulting in unreliable carbon stock estimates. Likewise, the origin, timing, and developmental history of peatland complexes across the tropics are poorly known, making it challenging to identify and quantify the main controls on peat formation. These data and knowledge gaps make it difficult to predict peatland evolution and their associated carbon content under present and future conditions. As such, ecologists don?t quite understand where or why peat forms under tropical conditions, and what controls accumulation rates. This project is the first to aim at gaining an integrated understanding of the origin and development of Caribbean peatlands, and will use extensive field surveys, detailed peat-core data and synthesis, as well as process-based computer modeling. This CAREER project will contribute to the US world-leading expertise in Earth System Science, advance the peatland community?s research needs, and guide policy and land management decisions.<br/><br/>This research project combines new field work with paleoecological and modeling studies as well as extensive student training on the terrestrial carbon balance of Caribbean peatlands. The PI and her team will be integrating 1) new data collection from multiple sites along the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, 2) a synthesis of existing data from other Caribbean peatlands, and 3) processed-based ecological simulations. The overarching question this project addresses is: what are the conditions that enable peatland initiation, facilitate peat development, and control peatland C balance over decadal to millennial timescales? The existence of peat deposits across the study region will be mapped and confirmed using extensive field surveys. How and when Caribbean peatlands became established will be determined by using detailed peat-core data and synthesis of published records. C stocks will be estimated, and the relationships between the rate of peat formation and paleoenvironmental change will be examined. Using process-based peatland models, C sequestration rates will be simulated and quantified to elucidate the current function of Carribean peatlands, and forecast how they might respond to natural and anthropogenic forcings in the future. Overall, this project will produce the first comprehensive assessment of the location, extent, genesis, and development of Caribbean peatlands. This work is necessary to assess the past, present, and future resilience of tropical ecosystems and to help inform land management decisions; it will also allow ecologists to benchmark Earth System Models and test hypotheses about the role of tropical peatlands in the Holocene global C cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants cohabitate soil with these diverse bacterial communities, a subset of which are recruited to plant roots via a myriad of processes and can provide beneficial services to the host. For example, root associated bacteria can help the host plant acquire critical nutrients, thwart pathogen attack, and promote growth and yield. Therefore, there is widespread interest in harnessing the plant microbiome to increase yield and environmental resilience of agricultural commodities. A roadblock, however, is the complexity of the soil microbiome and the environment from which the host plants recruit root-associated bacteria. This makes dissection of the microbiome assembly process difficult under natural settings. A promising avenue to overcome this hurdle is by using controlled synthetic microbial communities, where previously isolated and characterized bacterial strains are inoculated into a controlled system.<br/><br/>This research investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of the switchgrass root microbiome by implementing synthetic microbial communities which are tractable, reproducible, and ecologically relevant. Switchgrass is native to the North America and is used as both a biofuel feedstock and in soil restoration. Previous efforts by the researchers undertook a comprehensive effort to cultivate members of the switchgrass microbiome across diverse locations. Here, the researchers will use these previously isolated bacterial strains to form reduced complexity communities to examine how bacteria assemble both across time and space on plant roots. This information will be used to form a network to infer microbe-microbe interactions which can be further tested by dropping out select microbial modules. These results will bring the field closer to fully understanding the root microbiome assembly process, will provide a resource in the form of a universal switchgrass synthetic microbiome which will be shared with other switchgrass / plant microbial ecologists, and may provide new avenues for beneficial microbe delivery into agronomic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This problem can negatively affect the ability of doctors to make correct decisions about how to treat these patients, leading to worse health outcomes for patients with darker skin. Most experts believe that the primary cause of this effect is the absorption of light by melanin in the top layer of the skin. There are wide variations in the amount of melanin in the skin among the population. Instruments called melanometers can measure variables related to the amount of melanin in the skin. Using data from melanometers may help to properly account for the effect of melanin on the accuracy of medical devices in diverse populations. This proposal will develop materials that mimic skin with different amounts of melanin and blood and measure these materials with melanometers to better understand the effects of melanin and blood on the data obtained with melanometers. This project may lead to improved methods for making sure that medical devices are safe and effective for patients of all races and skin types. Results of this project will be incorporated into courses at the University of California Irvine on identifying disparities in health outcomes to illustrate how technologies can be developed and validated in a way that is equally accurate across diverse groups of patients.<br/><br/>Ensuring robustness of biophotonic technologies across the full range of skin colors is crucial for healthcare equity in clinical environments and personal health monitoring settings. Over the past two decades, numerous studies have identified racial disparities in biophotonic devices, from cerebral oximeters to photoacoustic imagers. These discrepancies can adversely impact clinical decision making, leading to worse health outcomes for patients with darker skin. Most experts believe that the primary cause of this effect is the intense, spectrally varying absorption of epidermal melanin; the concentration of which varies considerably across the population. To determine the magnitude of impact on a device, one must accurately determine the correlation between melanin content and device outputs/accuracy. Prior studies have used subjective methods, including self-identification of race and the Fitzpatrick phototype scale to assess subject pigmentation. However, objective, quantitative, and well-standardized methods based on optical measurements may provide a more precise and effective way to isolate the impact of epidermal melanin. The PI and collaborators will pursue this goal via constructing a rigorous set of synthetic tissue-simulating phantoms and using these phantoms as calibration standards to systematically characterize commercial (non-FDA-approved/cleared) melanometers for measuring skin pigmentation. Validating the outputs of these commercial devices against a well-characterized set of tissue models that simulate both melanin content and confounding tissue factors (e.g., hemoglobin, tissue scattering) will provide a critical fundamental step forward in establishing the credibility of melanometers as regulatory science tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, a large body of research demonstrates that people misinterpret the most common methods for visualizing uncertainty in forecasts such as these. This project?s goal is to learn more about why people have difficulty using forecast visualizations and how to create more effective ones. One key outcome of the project will be a theory of uncertainty visualization literacy that will identify the skills needed to effectively use visualized uncertainty and provide cognitively informed rules for new visualization designs.

The first phase of this work will create tools to reveal a priori schemas and visualization-driven schemas using previously established cognitive methods for evaluating schemas. These methods include analysis of participants' drawings, eye tracking, and memory tests. In the second phase, the team will develop a measurement tool to determine the relative distance between the two schemas, using a mapping agreement unit based on methods developed in human factors, then use that tool to empirically test the schema-based theory compared to alternative explanations for reasoning errors when using uncertainty visualizations.

In this project, the PI and his team will address transformation of P composition in soils and its coupling to organic carbon cycling during long-term ecosystem development.

The research, education and outreach components of this proposal have been developed synergistically to maximize the impact on the PI's, as well as existing on-campus outreach organizations.<br/><br/>The well-received Walker and Syers model describing P transformation during pedogenesis or soil development is based on operationally-defined P fractions as measured by chemical extractions, rather than P speciation. Thus, it has significant limitations in describing P biogeochemical transformation involving P interactions with minerals and organics. Moreover, the model was developed from humid environment and has limited applicability to semi-arid ecosystems as the model does not consider aeolian dust deposition as another important P input in the semi arid environment. There is, therefore, a great need to develop P speciation-based models that can accurately describe P transformation in both humid and semi-arid ecosystems. In this project, P X-ray absorption spectroscopy will be used to determine P speciation in soils, the P pools of the Walker and Syers model, and aeolian dust. Chronosequences in contrasting climate conditions and/or parent materials will be examined. A P-speciation based transformation model during ecosystem development will be proposed. To gain insights into coupled cycling of organic P and carbon facilitated by interacting with minerals, P speciation in soil organic matter associated with soil particles of different size regimes will be characterized using spectroscopic and biochemical analyses.

This research builds computer models of the brain based on measurements taken from humans and animals performing behaviors, and uses those models to identify how different brain regions communicate and work together to produce behaviors. This work will identify shared and distinct features of brain-wide communication to guide new experimental studies and enable new computer models to better define brain functions. Additionally, this project promotes community engagement, diversity, and inclusion through two complementary programs: ""Comp-ic Book Neuroscience,"" which brings research findings from computational neuroscience into under-served classrooms in New York City through the jargon-free and visually appealing medium of comics; and the Student Outreach for Neuroscience Integrated with CS (SONiC) program, an annual lab-based summer school to give NYC-area senior college and graduate students hands-on experience with visualizing and modeling brain data.<br/><br/>While rapid advances in neuroscience have catalyzed a deeper understanding of individual brain regions and their functions, these regions generally do not operate in isolation. Yet, little is known about processes regulating the brain-wide communication underlying many behavioral outputs. To reveal fundamental principles of brain-wide communication, this project will produce (1) a new, scalable, robust, and flexible class of multi-region recurrent-neural network (RNN) models with inter-area communication; and (2) analysis methods to infer the direction and magnitude of interactions within and between areas. Multi-region RNNs will be constrained with real neural data to uncover mechanisms of the real biological system, for instance, how the cooperative activity of neurons within and across brain regions gives rise to complex behaviors like decision-making. Reverse-engineering these models will reveal how multi-area brain circuits use biological plasticity to acquire a new skill. Finally, RNN modeling of human electrophysiology data will help identify inter-area communication processes that are conserved or divergent across multiple species. Wider adoption of the new models and tools will transform the understanding of how interacting brain areas function cohesively to orchestrate complex behaviors and inform future experimental paradigms. The research will also promote cross-fertilization between neuroscience and artificial intelligence/machine learning communities, and provide quantitative techniques shared in the broader neuroscience community. Furthermore, the project will foster an inclusive, welcoming environment for a diverse new generation of computational neuroscientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This dependence on grasses has deep roots.  Humans and their ancestors evolved in concert with grassland ecosystems in Africa over the past 7 million years. Despite the well-documented association between human evolution and grasslands, little is known about the origin of grasses in Africa, especially before 10 million years ago.  When and how did grasses rise to ecological dominance?  Lack of knowledge on this subject is largely due to the sparse plant fossil record.  To understand how grasslands may have shaped the evolutionary trajectory of our species and other mammals, new, widely applicable approaches are needed to reconstruct ancient ecosystems. This project is developing new methods for reconstructing vegetation in past ecosystems using molecular plant fossils preserved in ancient sediments.  Combining these approaches with existing isotopic methods, the researcher is reconstructing the rise of grasslands in East Africa over the past ~25 million years and exploring the relationships between climate, ecosystem, and evolutionary change.  The results could produce new insights on the interconnectedness of climate, ecosystems and human evolution over geological timescales. A parallel objective throughout the project is to support students in their pursuit of STEM careers with an emphasis on increasing participation of underrepresented groups in the Earth sciences. The project includes intensive three-week field and lab courses for graduate students and postdocs from the US and African nations, lab-based research opportunities for undergraduate and New York City high school students, and support for a graduate student to conduct PhD research. <br/><br/>African terrestrial ecosystems underwent revolutionary change in the Neogene. Sparse paleobotanical evidence suggests that denser forested ecosystems gave way to more open forests, woodlands, and perhaps nascent grasslands near the end of the early Miocene to the middle Miocene. This same period (~19 to 13 Ma) was marked by major changes in the primate and large mammal communities, yet the paleoecological context remains poorly known.  By the late Miocene (10 Ma), carbon isotopic evidence shows that C4 grasslands began to spread. Despite the firm record of C4 grassland expansion beginning at 10 Ma, the role of ecological change in mammalian and human evolution through most of the Neogene has been insufficiently addressed. The Principal Investigator is developing organic geochemical approaches for reconstructing terrestrial ecosystem structure using modern ecosystems. This includes methods to estimate the fraction of woody cover from n-alkane molecular distributions and to measure grass abundance using PTMEs.  Modern ecosystem research will also yield carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment factors between biomarkers, bulk plant tissue, and soils. The researcher is applying these methods to terrestrial and marine sedimentary records from the Neogene Period in Africa to determine when and how grasslands became ecologically significant and how ecosystem change may have affected faunal and human evolution. The project will incorporate postdocs and graduate, undergraduate, and high school students into research, training, and field work. This includes developing a three-week paleoecology short course in Kenya for graduate students and postdocs from US institutions and African nations. The Principal Investigator is also providing research opportunities in his lab, built on a tiered mentoring program, for high school and undergraduate students from New York City. This program has high participation rates of students from underrepresented groups and serves as a pipeline for first-generation college students, many of whom ultimately major in STEM fields. One graduate student will be trained and supported by this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When liquid helium is cooled to ultra-low temperatures it becomes superfluid, which is a state of matter that is characterized by a variety of peculiar properties. One of these properties is the ability to flow without friction, which implies that if an isolated superfluid is set into rotation, it will continue to rotate indefinitely. This type of frictionless flow was discovered in bulk superfluid helium about 80 years ago, and in tiny droplets (consisting of about 10 helium atoms) about 20 years ago. Surprisingly, the evolution of superfluidity in the realm between tiny droplets and the bulk remains largely unexplored. This CAREER award supports curiosity-driven exploration in this uncharted territory using state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques. By exploring new manifestations of finite-sized superfluidity, the work aims to provide fresh challenges for theory and seeks to provide for a deeper understanding of quantum chemistry at a fundamental level. The research program also will provide an enriching educational experience for undergraduate student researchers and seeks to attract a diverse body of students into science. Inspired by difficulties associated with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project also includes an educational component that focuses on developing virtual instrumentation and experiments for teaching modern techniques and approaches in spectroscopy to undergraduate students when in-person classes are not possible, or when the instrumentation is not available.<br/><br/>A key intellectual contribution of this work lies in determining the minimum number of helium atoms that are required for superfluidity according to the Landau criterion, which is the traditional criterion for bulk superfluidity. This number is especially important since it corresponds to the transition from the cluster having discrete energy levels to one that has a (quasi) continuum of energy levels, implying that the gap between the energetic properties of small clusters and the bulk has (finally) been bridged. Along the way, it is expected that broad oscillations in the rotational inertia will occur, which are thought to be related to the opening and closing of solvation shells, thus providing detailed structural information regarding microscopic solvation. Another significant contribution involves exploring how nanoscopic surfaces are wetted by investigating the quantum solvation of small aromatics with helium. The spectra of these systems provide information about how the helium fluid coats the surfaces, and about how the superfluid behavior evolves with cluster size. Finally, Dr. Raston and his research team are investigating quantum solvation by fermions (deuterium hydride) in order to experimentally test whether the previously reported decoupling of boson (helium or hydrogen) density from molecular rotation is indeed an indicator of microscopic superfluidity. The educational dimension of this project is inspired by the difficulties associated with delivering upper-division laboratory courses online. To help alleviate these challenges and to make experiments possible for those who do not have access to the required scientific instrumentation, a suite of modern virtual instruments is being developed. The user-friendly interface is designed to engage and guide students through a variety of experiments that will be made freely available on the web so that users can easily access them. The virtual instruments will provide a platform for learning about data acquisition in an autonomous environment, while also fostering an improved understanding of instrument control and developing student intuition about instrument operation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This IRES project aims to tackle the challenge on both sides of software infrastructure creation to bridge scientific communities and research training curriculum development to educate STEM students. By collaborating with two user interface research groups at the University of Tokyo and Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), we bring together an interdisciplinary team with their complementary expertise in physics simulation, digital fabrication, data science, and human-computer interaction to devise novel computational tools to support the interactive design of intelligence-embodied physical systems. Fifteen U.S. students, both graduates and undergraduates, will visit Japan in the summer and jointly lead the research project by working with their collaborators at the University of Tokyo and JAIST. The three-month study and research experience will immerse the students in a unique research environment to develop their scientific understanding and programming practices to address the frontier research problems crossing artificial intelligence (AI), scientific computing, user interface, and computational design. The follow-up mentoring activities will guide the students' self-motivated exploration and future professional development in this interdisciplinary field.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of this research project is to build an open-source software framework to lower the barriers for students, researchers, and engineers to conduct interactive design and visual programming of data-driven intelligent algorithms for various customizable physical systems, including examples of soft-bodied robots, drones, and materials. On the side of infrastructure development, we aim to democratize the creation of adaptable AI algorithms in specific physical and engineering contexts by providing an easy-to-access software framework to help designers conduct their data-integrated design tasks across engineering and computing communities. The software's architecture consists of three essential components --- frontend design interface, backend physics simulator, and data-driven physical-intelligent coordination --- which naturally transition to fifteen clustered sub-projects for the IRES students. On the side of research training development, we plan to redefine the standard way of problem-solving in physical intelligence by transitioning the workflow from the traditional data collection and model activity to a fully integrated design loop by interactively co-designing the data model, physical principles, and intelligent algorithms. We plan to train an inclusive group of students, with a particular focus on minorities and underrepresented students, by developing their new skillsets through developing this open-source infrastructure crossing physical and data sciences.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the International Research Experience for Students program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to bring innovations to mobile video delivery for new content types and over emerging networks. Specifically, the project investigates three aspects: (1) 360-degree immersive video delivery, (2) video streaming over multiple network paths (multipath), and (3) video streaming over millimeter-wave (mmWave) links. These are expected to be the key building blocks of next-generation video streaming services.  First, 360-degree videos provide users with unique panoramic viewing experience; however, 360-degree video content delivery is much more challenging compared to regular videos. Second, multiple network interfaces have become a norm on off-the-shelf mobile devices but their potential is far from being fully exploited. Third, mmWave is a key technology that will be integrated into 5G wireless networks; but adapting video streaming to mmWave largely remains an uncharted territory. The proposed solutions will benefit the society by enhancing the user experience and reducing the resource consumption for next-generation immersive video services. The research will also be integrated with an education plan that seeks to prepare computer science students with the knowledge of new technological trends in networking and systems, and stimulate the general public interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.<br/><br/>This project includes three inter-connected research thrusts. (1) For 360 video streaming, based on the concept of field-of-view (FoV) guided streaming, the project uses big data analytics to facilitate accurate head movement prediction, a key prerequisite for FoV-guided streaming. It also uses a rate adaptation scheme with a ""delta encoding"" design allowing the quality of a fetched chunk to be incrementally upgraded. This substantially improves adaptability when facing randomness in head movements. (2) For multipath streaming, the project uses multiple network interfaces to be used simultaneously for streaming videos. The network framework supports video rate adaptation and allows users to flexibly configure each path's cost. The framework also supports delay-sensitive live streaming over multipath through strategic packet scheduling. (3) mmWave links bear unique characteristics of massive capacity and intermittent availability. The project first designs a transport layer for mmWave links. It then proposes several video streaming strategies tailored to mmWave, such as strategically combining mmWave and legacy omni-directional radios.  For the above research thrusts, the project will develop algorithms, models, and systems, backed up by real implementation and evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is well understood that muscles in the lower body produce forces and that tendons, which attach to muscles, transmit those forces to the skeleton, allowing animals to stand and walk. However, most current knowledge about muscle and tendon comes from experiments that study these tissues when functioning outside of the body. What is not well understood is how muscle and tendon function as an integrated system within the body and, in particular, how they function to meet the demands of maintaining balance while moving. This project will measure the mechanical behavior of muscle and tendon when the body responds to a push intended to challenge the ability to maintain balance. Integrated within the research component is training for two students from underrepresented groups pursuing a PhD in STEM. These students will gain knowledge in the field, develop first-hand experience in carrying out scientific experiments, and develop as leaders in the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. This CAREER project will impact society by translating new knowledge about how muscle and tendon function during movement by (1) contributing design principles for biologically inspired prosthetics and (2) developing teaching units and workshops offered to students at the Multicultural Education and Counseling through the Arts (MECA) non-profit organization, which serves K-12 grade students (~4,000 underserved youth) in Houston?s historic 6th Ward.<br/><br/>This CAREER project focuses on understanding the role of muscle-tendon units to control movement and stability using a live, freely moving animal, and integrates research, education, training, and outreach. Movement stabilization can be accomplished by several interacting mechanisms: a muscle?s force-modulating properties, the energy-modulating capacity of variable-stiffness tendon springs, and the co-behavior of agonist-antagonist muscle-tendon units. The project?s primary research objectives and outcomes are to use a work-energy based framework to: (1) Determine the muscle-tendon unit properties that modulate the rapid flow of energy absorption during active lengthening in situ. (2) Determine the properties that allow ankle joint agonist-antagonist muscle-tendon units to govern the response of destabilizing perturbations elicited during standing in vivo. (3) Determine the properties that allow ankle joint agonist-antagonist muscle-tendon units to govern the response of destabilizing perturbations elicited during walking in vivo. The experimental approach involves the use of a custom-built, high performance linear actuator to elicit unexpected perturbations to the body during standing and walking. Custom sensors implanted into muscle-tendon tissue and force platform measurements are used to understand the response to perturbations at multiple scales, from muscle-tendon units that control ankle joint function to whole body mechanics. In addition, the project will implement an educational outreach plan that will advance a summer STEM camp curriculum that serves K-12th graders from underrepresented groups. The hands-on activities to be developed will focus on key biomechanical concepts that integrate math, physics, and physical models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, when looking at the genes being expressed in male and female cells in any organ, there are substantial differences. Some of these are due to the fact that female cells have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. In addition, the hormones produced by the gonads can influence the genes expressed. How these molecular differences are established and how they affect functionality is not known. The objective of this project is to investigate the molecular differences between male and female mice, starting soon after fertilization and throughout embryonic development by characterizing gene expression and epigenetic features at successive stages of embryogenesis. The data generated will allow comparative studies with other model organisms and lend insight into how evolution has shaped male and female genetic and hormonal differences. The project includes outreach and educational programs to increase awareness of how male and female physiologies differ among students, both at the graduate and undergraduate level. This project will also provide training opportunities for undergraduate hands-on research experiences. In addition, it will contribute towards creating a resource to train students to teach genomic and bioinformatic concepts to high school students in the area. These students are generally from underrepresented backgrounds, especially in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Beginning soon after fertilization, the X and Y chromosomes program autosomal gene expression and the epigenomic landscape, establishing male- and female-specific gene networks. The mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown, as well as how male and female biases evolve across development and in different lineages. The objective of this project is to fill this knowledge gap by integrating experimental and systems level analyses in vitro and in vivo. It examines the hypothesis that regulatory factors encoded on the X and Y chromosomes dictate differential expression and epigenetic profiles of autosomal genes. Hormones equalize some of these differences, but others persist, affecting cellular phenotypes even in the adult organism. This hypothesis will be tested by: 1) determining the transcriptional and epigenetic effects of differentially expressed regulatory factors in early embryogenesis; and 2) identifing the biases in gene expression and epigenetic patterns dependent on the X and Y chromosomes before and after the appearance of gonadal hormones. These experiments will exploit a mouse model that allows segregation of the genetic and hormonal components of the male and female phenotypes. Since epigenetic marks established in early development can be latent and relevant to gene expression at later stages, this research will also serve as a paradigm for understanding how events in embryogenesis influence dimorphisms after birth and beyond. Moreover, these studies will lay the groundwork for mechanistic studies on the effects of transcription and epigenetic factor dosage on the transcriptome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent efforts are accounting for the role of ecosystems in supporting human activities and are demonstrating the many economic, environmental and societal benefits of including nature in human decisions. Such advances related to engineering design and life cycle assessment have been demonstrated through case studies, but rigorous methods are needed for systematic inclusion of ecosystems in engineering decisions. This work will advance the framework of Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES), with specific focus on developing methods for, 1) integrated design of chemical processes and ecosystems on and around manufacturing sites while accounting for their temporal and spatial variation, 2) including ecosystem services in life cycle assessment (LCA) by means of a rigorous mathematical framework, 3) education and outreach activities to improve knowledge about ecosystem services among students and practitioners.<br/><br/>Local TES design at a manufacturing site will be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem that accounts for spatial and temporal variation of these systems such as the intermittent availability of many ecosystem services versus the continuous demand for these services from human activities.

The US wildfire management strategy has changed from ?fighting wildfires? to ?living with wildfires,? which involves community adaptation to wildfires. Post-wildfire landslides have been identified as a serious cascading risk to community adaptation to wildfires, but the fundamental initiation mechanisms are not yet understood. There is currently no wildfire-specific approach to evaluating the landslide susceptibility of burned hillslopes. This project will be the first step toward developing a wildfire-specific framework for analyzing the stability of hillslopes as a function of time, saturation, and forest use practices for different intensity fires and different landslide mechanisms. The research will be integrated with an education program aiming to place a new generation of engineers in a position to analyze and alleviate the risk of post-wildfire landslides, inform the policy makers, and promote community education about such risks.<br/><br/>The primary research objective of this study is to quantify the fundamental mechanisms that change mechanical and hydrologic soil behavior and therefore slope stability in post-wildfire environments. The fundamental mechanisms are hypothesized to be controlled by forest system dynamics (i.e., tree loss, regrowth, ash movement), that synergistically control suction stress. To achieve the primary research objective, the following specific objectives will be achieved: 1) quantify post-wildfire suction stress and forest system dynamics over time, 2) identify the change functions for the components of forest system dynamics in relation to suction stress, and 3) evaluate post-wildfire shallow landslide susceptibility using a probabilistic approach. This will require a multiscale investigation of soil behavior in post-wildfire environments. The research plan involves testing soil behavior from the atomic scale to the hillslope scale and will allow multi-sensor data fusion. Field and laboratory data will be combined with spatial data from LiDAR scans and aerial photographs. The spatial variability in suction stress along the hillslope will be presented as a distribution function and will be an input for a probabilistic slope stability model for evaluating the wetting-induced shallow landslide susceptibility of burned hillslopes. In addition, the dependency of the adsorptive component of suction stress on the soil water retention curve will be investigated through water vapor sorption isotherms. This will improve our understanding of the degree of physicochemical forces on mechanical soil behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, popular techniques using earthquakes and ground deformation to obtain storage depths cannot be used at many potentially hazardous volcanoes which show little activity at present, or have limited monitoring networks. More widely applicable methods which measure the chemistry of erupted crystals are associated with large uncertainty. This team will investigate a powerful but under-used approach in volcanology, by measuring the densities of pockets of gas-rich fluids trapped within growing crystals, known as fluid inclusions (FI). This method has the potential to be significantly more precise and accurate, placing very tight constraints on where magma is stored in the crust. After investigating the strengths and weaknesses of depths from FIs using eruptions from Hawai?i and Canary Islands as a case study (where storage depths have been determined by other methods), magma storage depths will be investigated in a series of explosive eruptions that occurred several centuries ago at both locations where future eruptions of this type present a significant hazard. A rapid response simulation will be carried out in collaboration with Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) to determine just how quickly estimates of magma storage depths can be obtained during the next large eruptive crisis, and how this information can be used to inform decision making to mitigate societal risk. This proposal will foster close collaborations between three PIs with complimentary scientific expertise at different career levels, and support several students and a postdoc in a multi-tiered mentoring structure spanning three institutions. The team will develop and distribute synthetic and natural fluid inclusions to be used as calibration standards, and a workshop will promote collaboration and synergy between different research groups using Raman spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award will capitalize on recent advances in the spectral and spatial resolution of confocal Raman spectroscopy, allowing highly precise and accurate measurements of the densities of CO2-rich fluids trapped within fluid inclusions down to ~ 1 m in size. The simple physical relationship between the density and pressure of a CO2-rich fluid means that distributions of FI densities can be converted into magma storage pressures with very small errors (~5-10%), and then magma storage depths using known crustal density profiles. First, detailed comparisons of depths obtained from FIs will be compared to published work investigating melt inclusion saturation pressures in samples from K?lauea Volcano, Hawai?i, and Timanfaya, Canary Islands. This will permit assessment of sources of uncertainty affecting FI barometry such as decrepitation (when the inclusion explodes) using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD), and the presence of additional volatile species (e.g., S, Cl, H) using synthetic FIs equilibrated with different fluid compositions. After determining the strengths and weaknesses of fluid inclusion barometry, new constraints will be placed on changes in magmatic plumbing during explosive to effusive transitions at K?lauea Volcano (a significant societal hazard), evolution from shield to post-shield in the Galpagos, and from unknown samples during an eruption simulation in collaboration with HVO. Synthetic FIs with different concentrations of CO2 will be synthesized and characterized with an experimentally calibrated Raman system to distribute to laboratories around the world to use as standard reference materials for calibration of Raman Spectrometers. This will eliminate systematic offsets between densities determined in different laboratories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kangaroo rats construct elaborate burrows over multiple years and occupy them for extended periods of time. The burrows remain open and stable in desert sand and survive the harsh desert conditions, with extreme daily and yearly relative humidity and temperature fluctuations and flash-flood events. This research tests the hypothesis that the burrow microbiome is determined by the microbial community in cheek pouches or feet of kangaroo rats and that biofilms formed in this microbiome (i.e., burrow biofilms) are crucial to burrow stability in stochastic, fluctuating desert environments. The fundamental understanding gained from this project could translate to the design of sustainable ground improvement techniques to be used in geotechnical engineering practice, particularly in locations prone to landslides and substrate collapse. The research will establish direct collaborations among researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering, bioengineering, and biology. <br/> <br/>The research will specifically test the hypotheses that (i) the suction stress characteristic curve of burrow-biofilm-enhanced desert soil is a non-monotonic function of saturation, due to water retention by both the soil and the biofilm, and contributes to effective stress regardless of the extreme fluctuations in humidity, saturation, and temperature, to maintain the stability of the burrows and (ii) biofilms reduce the hydraulic conductivity of burrow ceilings, and therefore prevent flooding of the burrows during storms. The experimental program will include growing the burrow biofilms in the laboratory and determining the strength of burrow-biofilm-enhanced soil over the entire range of saturation and after multiple wet/dry and heat/cool cycles. The research will also investigate how water retention by the cementing agent (i.e., burrow biofilm) contributes to suction stress to maintain burrow stability under extreme fluctuations in environmental conditions. This is important for establishing the mechanistic basis for stability in sandy soils in arid environments. In addition, the research will study how the hydraulic conductivity of desert sand changes with the addition of burrow biofilm. Results from this research will reveal how one of the most prolific ecosystem engineers digs complex, stable, and sustainable underground environments in desert sand and how an individual?s phenotype extends from their microbiome, to burrow site selection, and more broadly to landscape biogeomorphology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will examine the role of predator-prey interactions in building modern-style ecological systems during this time of dramatic environmental change. Student mentorship groups comprised of undergraduates and students from nearby tribal high schools will develop research projects to solve environmental problems using the skills learned as part of the present study. <br/><br/>The goal of the present research is to quantify the antagonistic relationships between predator and prey taxa from three distinct marine regions during the Late Triassic. Series of fossiliferous bulk samples will be collected from regions in Nevada, Italy, and New Zealand to determine geographic patterns of predator occurrence and abundance, coupled with abundance and morphological pattern data for prey groups. In order to create a temporally- and spatially-resolved faunal dataset reflecting shifting ecological relationships, the three fossiliferous bulk sample sequences will be correlated to each other and to recognized geologic events using multiple chronostratigraphic methods. Paleoecological niche modeling will be used to test the concept of escalation in this predator-prey system, thus allowing for an evaluation of the role of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in ecological function and health. Results will be made available through public databases, publications, and presentations at conferences by student researchers."

The system infrastructure for data-intensive computing is built and run on top of compute resources housed in large, centralized data centers. These data centers are typically placed away from populous regions for economic reasons. This leads to a fundamental limit on the speed of communication between users and data centers.  To overcome this limit, the project aims to extend data management systems to be edge-aware.  Edge-awareness is the capability of utilizing resources that are closer to users to reduce the latency they experience by one to two orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>The project will investigate two closely related research challenges to enable edge-aware data management systems. The first research challenge focuses on one of the most important building blocks of distributed systems, namely the problem of agreement between different nodes (also called the consensus problem.) The project proposes a design of a new consensus protocol that, unlike existing consensus protocols, is edge-aware and thus enables preserving consensus and fault-tolerance while achieving the low-latency performance enabled by edge-awareness. The second research challenge is building edge data management systems that react efficiently to user mobility. The project proposes augmenting consensus protocols with a mobility component that enables handling user mobility efficiently while preserving consensus and fault-tolerance.<br/><br/>Large sectors of business and industry, in addition to the modern style of living, increasingly rely on data-intensive Internet and cloud applications.

Applications in domain-knowledge intensive engineering environments such as energy infrastructure, aviation safety, and manufacturing require interpretable models, explainable decisions and actionable insights.  In these environments, the old paradiam of ?letting the data speak for themselves? is being replaced by the capability of ?letting the data speak based on the laws of physics and engineering?.  This project will address the development of methods to integrate data with physics-based models in three main use cases, namely environmental processes to enhance resilience of our national utilities during extreme events intensified by climate change; thermal modeling to improve energy efficiency in Data Center operations; and structural dynamics to enhance aviation safety in an increasingly crowded airspace.  The accompanying educational plan aims to address the gaps between general-purpose data science education at the school and university level and the specific needs for next-generation engineering students with diverse backgrounds. The educational plan also aims to improve data literacy among the general public by improving awareness of the increasing availability of data and the capability of interpreting those data through local community activities.<br/><br/>This research establishes a new Structure-Exploiting-Preserving (SEP) domain-aware statistical learning paradigm that enables the direct embedding of governing physics into data-driven models during model construction. Unlike existing approaches that impose governing physics as auxiliary regularizations or constraints, the SEP framework will enable the embedding of data-driven models into the solution space of governing physics (i.e., governing physics will no longer be used as auxiliary regularizations, but an inherent component that is directly integrated into data-driven models during model construction). This is achieved by exposing the solution structure of governing physics (i.e., structure exploiting), and embedding data-driven models into the solution space of governing equations (i.e., structure preserving). Under the SEP framework and through the collaboration with industry partners, the research will initiate a  trajectory that leads to a set of new methodologies for domain-aware statistical modeling, data-driven discovery of governing physics, and dynamic sampling for non-stationary engineering processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An additional opportunity for high-impact innovation stems from the plethora of devices incorporating both solid and fluid components that human engineers have traditionally crafted relying on experience and established designed practices; examples include jet engines, hydraulic pumps, filtration systems and medical implants such as heart valves and coronary stents, all of which rely on a delicate functional interaction between a solid, often elastic, structure and a fluid medium. This project will leverage research momentum and experience from computational design optimization of purely solid, elastic structures (that have been the dominant focus of such techniques until now), to extend the reach of optimization-driven design to fluid- and flow-modulating mechanisms. Project outcomes will ultimately fuel innovation in energy efficiency, boost the functionality of soft robotic platforms, and enable the creation of next-generation microfluidic mechanisms including in highly effective prosthetics.

Non-linearity of both the solid/compliant phase and the dynamics of the fluid flow is highly relevant to such design tasks and will be treated as an integral component of algorithmic exploration.  Non-parametric design approaches that are free to create accurate geometric details and intricate topological features will be explored, and the design of dynamic systems that include periodic or chaotic motion or flow, in conjunction with transient contact/collision patterns, will be investigated.  The work will build on the PIs' prior products and expertise in delivering computational design frameworks that can handle tens or hundreds of millions of degrees of freedom, so that project outcomes can accommodate the specification of multiple design objectives stemming from multiple flow scenarios and/or multiple functional traits that contribute to the overall design.

However, the processes that drive resilience (e.g., the relative contribution of genetic versus environmental factors) remain largely a mystery. Corals are a major focus of current studies on organismal resilience because they are undergoing a worldwide decline, and they are so important for both the health of the oceans and the welfare of coastal communities. Corals often occupy and build habitats through asexual reproduction (production of clones), and it is widely assumed that such asexual populations may lack sufficient genetic diversity to respond to diverse environmental stressors. However, few previous studies have quantified the effects of asexual reproduction on the ability of corals to respond to environmental change. This research explores the different mechanisms that contribute to differences in coral stress response among two predominately clonal populations of the Caribbean thin finger coral (Porites divaricata) dwelling in distinct habitat types (mangroves vs. reef). This research will illuminate the drivers of organismal resilience, potentially impacting ongoing coral conservation and restoration efforts. It will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by encouraging active participation by local community members, students and scientists at the University of Belize, as well as providing unique training opportunities for next-generation scientists at the interface of field marine ecology and genomics. Importantly, these results will be communicated to a wide audience through diverse venues, including technical reports and management recommendations provided for government agencies and non-profit Belizean conservation organizations, popular articles and curricular materials for the community at large, and peer-reviewed manuscripts and presentations targeted to the scientific community.<br/><br/>Among conservation biologists and ecologists, there is an urgent effort underway to understand the causes of diversity in traits impacting organismal survival and reproduction. If we are to understand how natural populations will respond to environmental change, it is critical to understand how genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors impact resilience. Such studies have advanced significantly in many plant species, but they are only just beginning to be applied to animals like corals. As in many plants, the model species used here? Caribbean thin finger coral (Porites divaricata)?reproduces primarily asexually, allowing us to compare the performance of clones in different environments and isolate the effects of genotype, epigenetics (namely DNA methylation), environment, and somatic mutations on variation in stress-related coral traits. Specially, combining fully-crossed reciprocally transplanted coral ramets across mangrove and reef sites with genomic and methylation sequencing data, this research will evaluate 1) the role of intra-genet variation accumulated during asexual reproduction in facilitating adaptation in the mangrove population, relative to roles of between-genet variation and phenotypic plasticity, 2) assess the role of new DNA methylation states, and 3) measure the rate of accumulation of new DNA methylation marks and base-changes during asexual reproduction. Results from this research effort will advance our understanding of the role of mechanisms like DNA methylation and somatic mutations in driving phenotypic variation in critical stress-response traits and how these mutations accumulate over time, provide insight into how such mechanisms are generated and inherited across asexual generations, build upon the sparse understanding of the role of novel habitat types, i.e. mangroves, in coral ecology and evolution; and generate novel molecular resources including the first reference genome assembly for the non-model coral, P. divaricata.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study incorporates geologic mapping in the field, analyses of mineral structures, chemical analyses, and analyses to determine the timing of movement along the fault. The project has the potential to tie analytic data to specific fluid sources and better constrain fluid flow at a crustal-scale. This project is led by an early career faculty member and includes Masters-level graduate and undergraduate students. First-generation and minority college students at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette are also involved. The project incorporates an outreach effort to support K-12 education in rural western North Carolina that includes geologic time resources developed by undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve the understanding of fluid-rock interaction in detachment shear zones associated with metamorphic core complexes. Hydrous metamorphic minerals record the presence of meteoric fluids at great depths within the crust. Despite the clear record of meteoric fluids down to mid- to lower-crustal depths, many chemical and petrologic inconsistencies remain. During orogenic collapse, the upper crust thins by brittle normal faulting while the ductile lower crust flows laterally. Localization of extension eventually leads to the formation of a detachment shear zone and metamorphic core complex. Ductile extension in the lower crust is characterized by high heat fluxes, granitic intrusion, and migmatitic gneiss domes, associated with metamorphic/magmatic fluids. During exhumation, there is competition between two fluid reservoirs (magmatic/metamorphic and meteoric water from surface sources). This project uses hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope data as tracers of fluid source and fluid-rock exchange to provide constraints on fluid-rock interaction during continental extension. Isotopic data is linked to specific fluid sources to better constrain the hydrology of crustal-scale fluid flow, in order to bridge the gap between experimentally-derived rock strengths, and field observations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Tectonics program in the Division of Earth Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
