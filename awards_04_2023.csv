Continental crust is thick and ancient, preserving billions of years of history. Oceanic crust is much younger. Plate tectonic processes bring together different continental plates into supercontinents. Supercontinents are then broken apart to form new oceans. This project focuses on the process of transition between continental and oceanic crust. We examine lava from the edge of a continent that has been rifted, and where an ocean has been newly created. These lavas can provide insight into how magmatism impacted the breakup process. The project focuses on the southwestern margin of the Atlantic Ocean along the coast of Angola. This region has been uplifted since the continent began to break apart. The uplift brings to the surface rocks that are usually buried under thick piles of sediment. Broader Impacts include support for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in research and training activities. The project will also create a module for use in undergraduate classes for non-science majors. <br/><br/>The substantial hydrocarbon interests along the rifted margins of the South Atlantic have resulted in strong seismic characterization of basins along the continental margin. The seismic data provide an important interpretive framework that has recognized the presence of magmatism in the hyper-extended and supposedly ?non-volcanic? basins. Lavas and xenoliths, typically the most direct probe of mantle conditions at passive rifted margins, are usually buried under thick sediments. This project will obtain new petrographic, geochronologic, major and trace element, and isotopic data from volcanic rocks and xenoliths from the southern Angolan continental margin that are exposed due to uplift of the crust. This focus region provides an ideal venue to explore the transition between the richly volcanic margin that dominates further south in Namibia, and the vast sedimentary basins that define the margin further north in Angola. Analytical and interpretative aspects of the project are focused on two questions: 1) Why do basins in southern Angola exhibit the characteristics of a magma-poor volcanic margin (i.e., hyper-extended crust and thick sediment accumulation) but also experience magmatism? This question will be addressed by examining the isotopic, major and trace element characteristics of magmatism along the basin margin that is along strike with gravity highs associated with offshore magmatic features. Sub-lithosphere contributions to the lavas will be constrained using these data. 2) Is the Upper Cretaceous magmatic event in this region and synchronous African margin uplift the result of processes operating in the plate or underlying asthenosphere? This question will be addressed by examining lavas and associated mantle xenoliths that erupted along the African passive margin contemporaneous with this uplift event. The project will include an isotope study on lavas and xenoliths to explore possible source reservoirs, and a compositional study of minerals within the xenoliths. The outcome of this work could have substantial implications beyond the discipline given the importance of magmatism in influencing hydrocarbon systems along this passive rifted margin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes referred to as the pace of life, these slow-fast differences in physiology, behavior and life history, integrated into a set of contrasting characteristics, can distinguish different species or different individuals within a species along a slow-fast axis. Since the rate of energy use, or metabolic rate, can have a large impact in defining the overall lifestyle of an animal, this project will take advantage of two genetic lines of honeybees that have been bred for their low and high metabolic rates, to understand the fundamental basis of slow-fast differences. Even more importantly, since honeybee colonies are superorganisms, they allow one to ask how a collective slow-fast phenotype can emerge from the diversity among colony members and define performance at the group level. Slow-fast differences are also seen among the different species of honeybees such that the ones which nest in cavities have a faster tempo than the ones which nest in the open. This project will also undertake a comparative study of the four different species to understand how ecology shapes slow-fast diversity. The results of this study will add to our understanding of slow-fast differences and how it contributes to the evolution of social behavior. With the current concern about anthropogenic changes, understanding these differences in behavior and life history has implications for honeybee health and management. This project will also contribute to modules for use in the Science for School program which supports K-5 science curriculum and establish a student mentorship program for undergraduates with interests in animal behavior. It will also provide students with opportunities to travel and participate in research internationally.<br/><br/>Slow-fast differences in physiology, behavior and life history is a classic and fundamental concept in behavioral and evolutionary ecology, owing its history to r- and k-selection. More recently, metabolic rate (MR) and cognitive style have been cited as the primary drivers of these phenotypic differences, modeled as a set of correlated traits under the pace-of-life framework. Such slow-fast diversity is especially interesting in the context of a social group where the phenotypic expression at the group level is an emergent outcome of the phenotypic diversity of its members, which also makes it possible for the group to potentially override some of the constraints that might be imposed by the covariance among the different traits at the individual level. Using the experimental leverage of the genetic lines of Slow (low MR) and Fast (high MR) honeybees (Apis mellifera) that were bred, this project will take an integrative approach modeled on Tinbergen?s four questions to understand (1) the mechanistic and developmental bases of slow-fast differences, (2) the functional consequences of slow-fast phenotypic diversity at the group level, and (3) the evolutionary basis of slow-fast phenotypic differences and its ecological drivers using a comparative approach integrating the work with A. mellifera with that in the other three honeybee species, A. cerana, A. dorsata and A. florea, the first two being  cavity-nesters and the latter two being open-nesters. Together, these studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of the significance of slow-fast phenotypic diversity that characterizes different levels of biological organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While our understanding of invasive species biology on tropical island systems has been shaped extensively by research in Hawai?i, other intensively studied locations, such as the Galapagos Islands, have much to offer. This project will host an immersive, experiential learning, undergraduate student research program on island invasion biology at the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. The program will provide a unique opportunity for University of Hawai?i at M?noa (UHM) students, who represent one of the most diverse student bodies in the nation, to immerse themselves in cutting edge international research in invasion biology at two globally-recognized research institutions that have spearheaded a wealth of understanding in this field. The histories that have shaped the two archipelagoes, including similarities and differences, will allow students and mentors to develop novel research that is relevant to both island systems, as well as tropical islands more broadly, while fostering new research collaborations between UHM faculty and foreign collaborators at CDF. As such, this project will serve as a catalyst for future research collaborations thereby providing opportunities for student research experiences for years to come in a field of critical importance to both locations.<br/><br/>The Galapagos and Hawaiian archipelagoes arguably represent two of the most iconic island ecosystems in the world.

This project will host an immersive, experiential learning, undergraduate student research program on island invasion biology at the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. At least six U.S. students in each cohort year from the University of Hawai?i at M?noa (UHM) (?18 students total) will spend one year, including eight weeks in Galapagos, researching the drivers and consequences of invasive species introductions, while assessing means to mitigate their spread and impact. In the semester preceding their field research program, students will take an accredited UHM course on invasion biology to provide them with a core baseline understanding of the threats and challenges posed by invasive species in tropical island systems, using the Hawaiian Islands as a model system. During this course, students will interact with UHM faculty advisors and foreign collaborators at CDF, to develop the framework and design for their individual summer research projects in Galapagos. Each foreign collaborator will oversee 2 students each field season and, along with UHM mentors, will provide pre- and post-field program support. Upon returning to Hawai?i, students will continue to work with their UHM and CDF mentors to write up project results for submission to peer-reviewed scientific outlets, and present results to the UHM campus and the broader applied conservation and scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A recent survey of Massachusetts car dealers and independent automotive repair facilities have all indicated that they are facing a shortage of automotive technicians trained in hybrid and EV technology. This project from Mount Wachusett Community College will address an emerging regional demand for technicians skilled in EV technologies by developing a new Hybrid and EV curriculum for an Advanced Automotive Technician Hybrid and EV certificate and degree program. Throughout the project, 40 students will be recruited into this new degree and certificate program in the repair and maintenance of electric vehicles. The project will train faculty and provide the program with Hybrid and EV training equipment. It will also develop a new state-of the-art industry informed curriculum, develop a prior learning assessment framework, and tools for incumbent workers. Finally, the project team will build internship opportunities and employer partner relationships to foster student engagement, and institute a recruitment and retention strategy for a diverse group of students. The project is expected to generate new knowledge on how to augment a traditional combustion engine automotive technician program with emerging Hybrid and EV technologies. This project will also provide a model for engaging incumbent workers to accelerate their progress towards a certificate or degree in Hybrid and EV. Finally, the project will build knowledge about creating a high school student pipeline for the Hybrid and EV technician fields, with an additional special emphasis on recruiting females into the field.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of the project is to create an industry supported advanced automotive degree and certificate program in the repair and maintenance of Electric Vehicles that meets employer?s needs for skilled, knowledgeable, and more diverse EV automotive technicians. Approximately 40 students are expected to enroll in this certificate and degree program over 3 years, with an increase of female students and an additional 40 dual enrolled high school students. Three faculty will be trained in Hybrid and EV technology during summer learning experiences. Students new to the field completing ten Automotive courses with EV and Hybrid technologies embedded in them, will earn the certificate, needing only another 7 general education classes to earn the Associate Degree. Alternatively, incumbent workers with prior experience or completion of a prior learning assessment test will potentially be able to receive credit for up to seven core courses to earn their certificate and/or Associates Degree. The Business and Industry Leadership Team will inform and enrich the curriculum by mapping out the scope of skills and knowledge essential for Hybrid and EV Automotive Repair and Maintenance technicians.

The aerospace industry is shifting toward increased reliance on semi- or fully autonomous electric or hybrid aircraft, which will soon be used more frequently and in expanded roles. At the same time, upcoming additions and changes to federal regulations will require that these new aircraft types are regularly serviced to ensure their airworthiness and safety of operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). To support the domestic growth of the industry and to keep the expanding fleet of UAS and AAM aircraft performing at its full potential while remaining in compliance with federal regulations, the nation will require a sufficient number of aviation maintenance technicians. These technicians will need to have the skills to maintain these aircraft and to diagnose and repair any problems with inherent advanced technologies including sensors, avionics, communications, electric propulsion, and battery systems. This project will help address this need by enabling access to training and resources to develop these skill sets for both incumbent aviation maintenance workers and individuals who are new to the aviation field.<br/><br/>This project will develop educational pathways by which a diverse pool of technicians will be trained to maintain and repair UAS and AAM aircraft. It will also advance a shared understanding of the skills and competencies needed to fill such roles and embed these skills into a post-secondary short-term technical certificate curriculum. The development of this curriculum will be undertaken in coordination with partners having regional and national reach, validated by industry representatives, and widely disseminated and replicated at colleges across the country. These efforts will be key to addressing the projected workforce shortage of technicians capable of servicing these new types of aircraft. Training workshops will be developed for current aviation maintenance workers exploring the innovations in UAS and AAM and orienting them to the skills needed to service these aircraft. Additionally, to develop the recruitment pipeline for future UAS and AAM maintenance technicians, the project will develop high school STEM content and train-the-teacher modules. Further, the project will conduct workshops to provide high school teachers with innovative curriculum, multimedia, and learning activities introducing the AAM paradigm, the components of UAS technologies, and opportunities for aviation maintenance technicians.

Low-level software includes things like operating systems and the tools, such as programming language compilers, that are used by software developers to build those applications.  Flaws in the design of low-level software, or bugs in its implementation, can lead to system crashes, security vulnerabilities, or incorrect results that can be very costly to individuals, businesses, and scientific or educational institutions.  The research conducted as part of this project will investigate how to improve the security and reliability of low-level software.   The research focuses on a specific piece of the modern software infrastructure (something called LLVM IR, an industrial-strength bit of compiler infrastructure that is widely used in industry and academia), and develop a formal, computer-checkable, mathematical model of its behaviors.  That model will be used to uncover flaws in the infrastructure, and as an aid to implementing correct systems using it. Because such systems are ubiquitous, improving their security and reliability can potentially have significant positive impact for society as a whole.  This project will also develop educational resources suitable for teaching the underlying theory and techniques to software developers who use this infrastructure.<br/><br/>The project will build on and extend the capabilities of Vellvm--the ""Verified LLVM IR""--a formalization of the LLVM compiler infrastructure implemented in the Coq interactive theorem prover. Because the LLVM ecosystem supports many source languages (C, C++, Rust, Haskell, among others) and target platforms (including almost all modern processors), it is a natural fulcrum to amplify the impact of formal modeling and verification efforts. The research conducted here will have three main thrusts: (1) Improving Vellvm's fidelity and completeness with respect to the LLVM IR by extending the suite of supported LLVM IR constructs, developing a new memory model, and concurrency semantics that enable optimizations unavailable previousl; (2) Designing abstractions that facilitate relational reasoning about LLVM IR programs. These abstractions will take the form of a collection of domain-specific logics for reasoning about LLVM IR code at various levels of abstraction; (3) applying the Vellvm framework to build tools that help identify undefined behaviors and mitigate security vulnerabilities in LLVM IR programs.  To achieve these goals, the proposed research will develop novel reasoning and proof automation techniques that are applicable to low-level program semantics.  All of the developments will be implemented and verified using the Coq interactive theorem prover, yielding a high-degree of confidence in the results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, Professor Bowling and his students will generate molecular templates that hold different molecular components in proximity and study how the relative orientation of the components affects their interactions and electronic properties.  The fundamental knowledge to be gained will help advance the development of next generation, charge transfer-based devices and catalysts.  Synthesis, purification, and characterization of these compounds will be performed exclusively by undergraduate students and Professor Bowling at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Hands-on experience with cutting edge research projects will position these students well to excel in the chemical industry or in graduate studies. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a variety of templates to promote efficient charge-transfer between electron-rich and electron-poor aromatic subunits in solution and the solid state. The primary method for promoting through-space interaction of these subunits is a twisted arylene ethynylene framework upon which the subunits interact in an intramolecular fashion. Rotation around a central tolane forces complementary electron-rich/electron-poor arms of the rotor to collide. Electronic (UV-vis) and crystallographic (x-ray) studies will provide insight into how the orientation of subunits in these through-space collisions impacts charge transfer behavior. Additionally, halogen bonding and metal complexation will be used as driving forces to mimic the geometry of the twisted arylene ethynylene systems. The onset of visible color expected with charge transfer may provide opportunities for colorimetric quantification of host-guest interaction in these dynamic systems. After initial characterization, template design will focus on controlling the relative orientations of electron-rich/electron-poor pairs for optoelectronic, sensing, and catalyst applications. The designed systems are expected to provide a method for studying charge transfer behavior that is otherwise difficult to study.

Results of this form are of mathematical interest as well as practical interest, as they show that certain behavior does not depend on the particulars of a given model but only on a small number of general properties of the model.  The work on Gibbs point processes consists of understanding and expanding the uniqueness regime of these models, with results and proposed problems both theoretical as well as algorithmic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pregnancy and lactation are two of the most expensive physiological states in mammals. Because individuals cannot increase energy utilization indefinitely to keep up with these metabolic demands, other processes must become less costly. The research project tests the hypothesis that locomotor costs are reduced during pregnancy and lactation to offset the higher energetic costs. An integrated suite of experimental techniques, including computational modeling, will be used to quantify locomotor activity and form and function of muscles and tendons during movement. This information will lead to a more complete understanding of the metabolic costs of muscle-tendon interactions during locomotion and how they change during pregnancy and lactation, and the results should allow better tailored advice regarding exercise for women in the pre- and post-natal phases. The project will create 10 paid summer research internships for undergraduates and 10 for high school students, 5 years of a paid lab technician position for an undergraduate student, and three mentored postdoctoral training opportunities at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. Teaching resources to identify new areas of anatomy and physiology research will be developed and disseminated. <br/><br/>The overarching aim of this project is to understand the form and function of skeletal muscle and its connective tissues during pregnancy and lactation. It is hypothesized that hormonal effects on elastic tissues during pregnancy and/or lactation improve locomotor performance by increasing the usage of elastic potential energy. Using a model of mammalian muscle-tendon physiology, the rat Rattus norvegicus, the Principal Investigator will lead a team of undergraduate and postdoctoral researchers to complete the following research and educational aims: [1] Quantify the effects of pregnancy and lactation on gait mechanics, energetics and in vivo muscle-tendon function, using high-speed videography, implanted electromyography, sonomicrometry, and indirect calorimetry. [2] Characterize in situ, during pregnancy and lactation, the form and function of an isolated hindlimb muscle-tendon unit, the lateral gastrocnemius and its contribution to the Achilles tendon. By using the same subjects to track the function of leg muscle-tendons in vivo and when the muscle-tendon is isolated in an anesthetized animal, muscle-tendon function will be directly linked to whole body movement. [3] Develop teaching resources to identify new areas of anatomy and physiology research. The work will set the stage for a career-long research program that integrates laboratory work on a model organism with comparative field studies, and advances an under-invested field of research with potential impacts on human health and welfare.

This CAREER project aims to broaden participation in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by examining how artificial intelligence (AI) can be harnessed to improve persistence in STEM. Specifically, the project uses an online intervention to facilitate students' career exploration using conversational virtual agents (""virtual mentors"") recorded by real-life STEM professionals. Students choose and engage with virtual mentors to learn about their career paths, experiences, and advice. The study models processes that promote STEM persistence over time for students who have historically been underserved in STEM fields of study. Based on interactions with virtual mentors, students receive personalized follow-up and resources for career development. This longitudinal research study is conducted at California State University, Fullerton, a large public Hispanic-Serving Institution, with a focus on students majoring in the psychological sciences. <br/><br/>The project is co-funded by the Directorate for STEM Education Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development, and the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). The study uses a prospective, longitudinal, mixed-methods approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data across a period of four years and gathering insights from existing literature on STEM persistence and learning sciences. The project establishes a framework for modeling psychological and behavioral processes that predict observed STEM persistence over time and develops a personalized, online intervention for career exploration using AI. Models of STEM persistence and a tailored, AI-based intervention for diverse student bodies will result from this study. Findings will be widely disseminated to encourage adoption and adaptation of future AI applications in other STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unimodality is a remarkable example of such a phenomenon, which is characterized by the presence of a single maximum or mode in a statistical distribution. This phenomenon has been observed in various objects, including student grade distributions and the frequency of earthquakes at a specific location. The project aims to analyze the precise mechanism of the emergence of such phenomena using approaches based on recent advances and techniques in combinatorics, probability, and order theory. The PI will mentor students as part of this project.<br/><br/>More technically, the project deals with log-concave inequalities and correlation inequalities in combinatorial objects and their connections to the underlying combinatorial structure. Significant advancements have been made in this field in recent years, particularly with the solutions to the Heron-Rota-Welsh Conjecture and Mason's Conjecture in matroid theory being the most prominent examples of progress. The project aims to explore the combinatorial nature of these inequalities by developing purely combinatorial tools to generalize and strengthen them to match their equality conditions. On the order theory side, the project seeks to use these new insights to establish log-concave and correlation inequalities, which historically were crucial elements in deriving the best-known bound to the 1/3-2/3 Conjecture in order theory. The employed tools include a combination of classical tools from these fields, such as FKG-type inequalities in probability and mixed volume inequalities in geometry, along with some new tools such as Lorentzian polynomials and the combinatorial atlas method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, in thermodynamics one might model a gas with a large number of atoms, with parameters describing the state of each atom; or in mathematical biology, one might consider a statistical model of a genome, where there are parameters for each base pair. Such systems often exhibit a large amount of symmetry; for instance, in the gas system, the positions of the various atoms play a similar role to one another in the equations governing the system. The last decade has seen major progress in our understanding of the mathematics of such systems. This project aims to continue this progress on four specific fronts. This project will provide research training activities for undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs. Additionally, the investigator is developing expository resources related to the mathematics in this proposal that will be available to the general public.<br/><br/>The four areas of focus of this project are: (i) representations of categories; (ii) equivariant commutative algebra; (iii) representations of oligomorphic groups; and (iv) infinite dimensional tensors. The first two topics have been a prevalent theme in representation stability for the last decade, and have had important applications (such as proofs of the artinian conjecture and Stillman's conjecture). The PI's work in these areas is a natural continuation of previous work. Interest in the latter two topics is more recent, and based on exciting new connections to tensor categories, analytic number theory, and model theory. The PI's work in these areas will study these connections in detail.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Department of Sociology at Texas A&M University will immerse 8 students each year in an 8-week summer social science research experience. The site will recruit undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM. Participants will conduct research with faculty at Texas A&M, joining a faculty mentor's ongoing research program. The primary objectives of the program are to: (1) increase the social science research opportunities available to undergraduates from underrepresented groups; (2) prepare a future workforce to engage in sophisticated evidence-based analyses of social inequality; (3) increase the scientific literacy of participants; and (4) prepare students for academic or non-academic careers with a research focus through both education and intensive mentoring. The intended impact is to increase students' understanding of research and increase the number of students from underrepresented groups pursuing graduate education and professional careers in science. Providing students with hands-on experience in research, intensive mentoring, and research skills, the benefit to society is to expand the pipeline of underrepresented groups into advanced social science research and increase the ability of participants to conduct independent research. <br/><br/>The most important intellectual merit of the program rests not on the students' individual contributions to social science knowledge in one summer, but on increasing the pipeline of talented students with meaningful social science research experiences and interest in research. Activities for each REU participant include: participating in a summer research seminar that will focus on practical instruction in social science theory, methods, and practices; learning about graduate educational opportunities and careers in science; completing a research project with a faculty mentor; writing a research paper; and presenting their research findings at a professional academic conference. This REU program is designed to interest students from underrepresented groups in the possibility of research-based careers and prepare them with the skills necessary to succeed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is often the case that by starting with a large enough structure, a substructure with desired properties emerges.  Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have the same color.  Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines. This project utilizes techniques in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures.  A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not.  Progress on infinite structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology, creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics. This project includes important questions suitable for graduate students and early career researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.<br/><br/>This research program investigates infinite relational structures supporting Ramsey theory.  A major focus of this project is to develop the Ramsey theory of homogeneous structures.  This involves constructing new types of trees which code homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce (in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees, as well as developing purely combinatorial proofs.  Computability theoretic strengths of structural Ramsey statements will be investigated, as will model-theoretic dividing lines.  The second main focus is the continued development of topological Ramsey space theory and its implications for forcing, ultrafilters, and Banach spaces.  Development of Ramsey spaces for homogeneous structures ties this together with the first focus.  The third line of research will develop Ramsey theory on uncountable structures.  The techniques developed, involving simultaneous uses of logic, combinatorics and topology, will create new pathways between these areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the liberation of small stable molecules (carbon dioxide and/or hydrogen) from simple feedstocks, sometimes in combination with harvesting light energy, will provide the energy to drive chemical reactions without the need for traditional, more wasteful, methods of energy input. To further lessen the environmental impact of the chemical processes being designed, catalysts based on earth-abundant cobalt metal will be utilized as reaction promoters in lieu of traditional expensive noble metals. These new catalysts will also allow the design of new types of reaction pathways. It is anticipated that the methods developed will be applicable to the synthesis of a wide variety of materials with potential applications as pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and other substances of value to science, engineering, and commerce. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the benefits accrued to society as Professor Tunge and his coworkers engage in outreach and educational activities designed to integrate the goals of this research with training and recruitment programs that incorporate the promotion of 'green chemistry' principles. A significant goal of these activities will be to engage in outreach to educate area K-12 students on common chemistry that occurs in their everyday environment and to connect these observables to contemporary challenges in sustainable chemistry. A further goal is to utilize these community connections to attract students from diverse backgrounds, including individuals belonging to groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, to careers that address critical issues of sustainability.<br/><br/>The funded project is focused on the development of chemical transformations based on the catalytic generation of reactive intermediates via the cleavage of C?C and C?H bonds. The catalytic pathways being developed utilize decarboxylation to provide an efficient strategy for the in situ formation of synthetically useful reactive intermediates directly from inexpensive carboxylic acids. Other processes under investigation utilize the hydrogen evolution reaction for atom-economical functionalization. Cobalt catalysts replace traditional, expensive, palladium catalysts in decarboxylative coupling reactions and are anticipated to allow for new transformation types that are inaccessible using current technologies. Additionally, photoredox-catalyzed hydrogen evolution will allow for the site-specific functionalization of amino acids and peptides, while also enabling regiocontrolled decarboxylative Heck-like acylations and regiochemically complementary allylations. Performing these new transformations in series will further allow construction of complex molecules through temporally- and kinetically-controlled iterative decarboxylative couplings. The ongoing studies will advance a general paradigm for synthetic chemists to use for accessing reactive species under mild conditions, while generating minimal waste using: (1) visible light photoredox catalysts for redox shuffling of transition metal catalysts, and (2) hydrogen evolution to allow oxidative couplings through liberation of the smallest molecule, hydrogen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator will develop a mathematical understanding for the equations arising in these applications, while also studying the stabilizing and regularizing effects of stochastic noise, for which there is often experimental or numerical evidence. This project will generate opportunities to mentor graduate and undergraduate students by providing both professional advice and mathematical knowledge related to the project. <br/><br/>Dynamical random behavior under various complex influences is often described by nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. Such equations cannot be solved through the superposition of simple formulae and are therefore not yet well-understood mathematically. The project will draw on tools from functional analysis and probability to resolve the well-posedness of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations arising in competitive large population dynamics and in stochastically forced interface evolutions. The effects of stochasticity will be further analyzed by studying the long-time behavior of solutions, probabilistic averaging and regularizing phenomena, and stochastic selection principles for models with a small level of background noise. The material influence of stochasticity indicates that the statistical fluctuations in experimental data cannot be completely ignored, thereby justifying the technical study of those stochastic partial differential equations involved in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, they appear in number theory as building blocks in the theory of L-functions. L-functions shed light on many important number theoretic topics such as the distribution of prime numbers. In physics, automorphic forms model symmetry conditions of supersymmetric string theory and are used to find coefficients of the scattering amplitude for gravitons (hypothetical particles of gravity). Finding higher order coefficients of the graviton scattering amplitude may provide a quantum correction to the discrepancy between relativity and experimental data. This project seeks to answer a number of questions centered around the theory of L-functions and scattering amplitudes for certain string interactions using the study of automorphic forms. For broader impacts, the PI will lead undergraduate research projects, continue her involvement with the Sonya Kovalevsky Day and the Navajo Math Circle, and will write an open access text on math for elementary teachers with a focus on activities and curriculum that centers Native American traditions and ideas?.<br/><br/>The study of differential equations involving automorphic forms is a common thread connecting most of the questions addressed in this project. Specifically, the PI plans to answer a number of questions relating to the zeros and special values of GL(2) L-functions. Most of these questions relate the zeros of L-functions to the spectrum of certain operators.  The project also addresses a number of questions arising from the study of scattering amplitudes for gravitons. The PI will conduct a more detailed analysis of the Fourier modes of the SL(2) solutions and classify a family of solutions through a closed form expansion. In the course of the study of these Fourier solutions, the PI will address an open conjecture relating to a shifted convolution sum of divisor functions. Certain shifted convolution sums also have applications to subconvexity bounds for L-functions. The PI will also compute a spectral solution in SL(3) and uses these techniques to prove quantum unique ergodicity for non-degenerate Eisenstein series. To address these problems, the PI will use techniques in functional analysis, analytic number theory, the theory of special functions, and PDEs.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To classify such spaces we need to mathematically  understand the possible shapes they can take as well as their rigidity and flexibility properties. Such properties are called invariants of the spaces and they  arise from a variety of mathematical considerations, often with crucial input from physics. The proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture established that certain three-dimensional spaces, called manifolds, decompose into pieces with nice geometric properties. In the last few decades, ideas from quantum physics have led mathematicians to discover a variety of subtle invariants and structures of three-manifolds.There are several open conjectures, both in physics and in mathematics, that predict deep relations between quantum structures and geometries of three-manifolds. This project  will study the relations of these quantum invariants to the geometric structures arising from Thurston's picture, with an eye towards developing tools to tackle  open conjectures in topology and physics.

To fully characterize the parallel processes occurring in the active layers of photovoltaic cells, Professor Moran and his group will develop a transient grating photocurrent spectrometer in which drift and diffusion are simultaneously measured in orthogonal directions within the active layers of the devices. In addition, separate detection channels will be incorporated to distinguish transport processes involving excitons (fluorescence) and free charge carriers (photocurrent).

With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator?s group at Franklin and Marshal College seek to develop new ways to design complex nanoparticles by starting with simple particles that we can make reproducibly that have only two components?the elements copper and sulfur and then swapping-out the sulfur component with the related elements selenium and tellurium.  This represents a new chemical approach to making many-component nanoparticles.  It is expected that by targeting the sulfur component, the PI?s team will be able to create nanoscale patterns that would not be achievable otherwise.  Peer-mentored undergraduate student teams will carry out experimental work, receiving excellent training for careers in materials and other STEM fields.  Through the nanobots Early College Research Experience, first- and second-year students will perform computational modeling of these processes.  The Early College Research Experience is an inclusive and supportive research cohort intended to create a welcoming entry to STEM that will encourage a diverse set of students to continue with research and STEM coursework.<br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>Post-synthetic transformations of nanoparticles can create complex multi-component nanoheterostructures. Cu2-xS nanoparticles are common starting materials for cation exchanges, forming the basis for whole libraries of nanoparticles through repeated partial cation exchanges.  Despite the success of cation exchange in nanoheterostructure design, anion exchange has been much less implemented.  The PI?s group has recently developed selenide and telluride anion exchange transformations of Cu2-xS nanorods.  This project, with support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, will seek to better understand how these anionic transformations affect Cu2-xS nanoparticles, how broadly applicable these transformations are, and how they affect plasmonic properties, regioselectivity of new components, and defect formation.  Addtionally, molecular dynamics simulations will be used to gain mechanistic insight into the post-synthetic transformation processes.  Finally, anionic transformations will be coupled with secondary transformations to uncover the interplay of the design rules guiding post-synthetic transformations.  This fundamental work will advance knowledge of how to design nanoparticle heterostructures a priori, affording new routes to materials for optoelectronic applications.  The metal chalcogenide particles investigated have the potential to act as catalysts, solar energy absorbers in PV or solar water evaporation, NIR absorbers in photothermal cancer treatment, sensors, or thermoelectrics.  Activities are proposed that strengthen training in materials chemistry through undergraduate research with close student-faculty interaction and innovative partnerships between PUI and R1 laboratories, all of which improve student training and sense of belonging through peer- and near-peer mentoring structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PD patients experience motor symptoms including uncontrolled shaking or rigid muscles that may feel tight and difficult to move. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy used to treat motor symptoms of PD. DBS is a surgical procedure that involves placing a signal generator in the chest to send electrical pulses to a specific region of the brain. These electrical pulses from the signal generator control motor symptoms by affecting the cells in the brain. The DBS system is life-changing for patients, but the continuous and rigid electrical pulses cause unwanted side effects, such as potentially blocking blood flow. Recently, scientists have developed a new DBS system called Closed-Loop DBS (CL-DBS) where the generator can send various electrical pulses back to the brain depending on PD symptoms to avoid side effects. One challenge for a CL-DBS system is it requires a powerful computer to generate the expected and various electrical pulses. However, these powerful computers cannot be placed in the chest of patients due to their large size. To solve this issue, this project aims to design a new type of computer called a neuromorphic chip. This chip mimics human brains by using small spiking signals for calculations to realize high energy efficiency. This new neuromorphic chip will make CL-DBS smarter, smaller, and lighter, greatly benefiting all PD patients. The project provides a unique opportunity for college and high school students from the Copper Country region in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to participate in interdisciplinary research on neuroscience, Parkinson?s disease, brain rehabilitation, artificial intelligence, and microchip design.  <br/><br/>The project aims to design a neuromorphic CL-DBS chip consisting of electronic neurons and memristive synapses that adapts to user symptoms while substantially lowering power consumption and device size. The severity of PD symptoms is indicated by beta oscillations from the brain. Two Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) will be placed at the feedforward and feedback branches of the closed-loop system to recognize PD symptoms and generate stimulation signals accordingly. The neurons and synapses in these SNNs will be implemented using complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and memristors. The project will focus on two tasks: (1) memristive synapse design; and (2) electronic neuron design. Additionally, peripheral circuitries, including bandpass filters, low-noise amplifiers, and reading/writing circuits, will be developed. The chip will be taped out for further evaluation by comparing it with other CL-DBS systems using different computational hardware, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), based on 1) power consumption; 2) response time; 3) chip area. This research on neuromorphic medical chips will significantly benefit the development of energy-efficient and smart implantable medical devices by reducing their size, weight, and energy budget while making them more intelligent and adaptive.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Focus will be placed on excited state electron transfer and charge recombination within the ?encounter complex? inherent to bimolecular redox reactions. Charge recombination within the encounter complex is known to significantly lower the yield of most photochemical reactions to values far below one, yet the origin(s) of such behavior remain largely unknown. Professor Gerald Meyer and his team propose systematic electron transfer studies that will exploit the charge-transfer excited states of vintage second- and third-row transition metal photosensitizers, as well as emerging earth abundant photosensitizers-based on cobalt, iron, zirconium, and copper. Electron donor and acceptor quenchers with tailored charge, size, and reduction potentials are expected to provide the insight into encounter complex structure that is necessary to understand the factors that control escape of desired products, i.e., the cage escape yield. A fundamental question to be addressed is whether the photosensitizer and/or the quencher structure can be tuned at the molecular level to impact the encounter complex and thereby the cage escape yield.  Supramolecular assembly will be used to quantify the impact of non-covalent interactions within the encounter complex on electron transfer and cage escape. Variable temperature kinetic measurements are proposed to quantify the electronic coupling within the encounter complex and to determine the adiabaticity of the excited state electron transfer reaction. The proposed research is fundamental in nature yet are expected to impact approaches used in solar energy conversion and organic photoredox catalysis. In the long term, insights gained from these studies have the potential to provide a rational means for the molecular-level design of photosensitizer encounter complexes capable of efficiently harvesting solar photons, driving electron transfer reactions, and releasing the sought-after products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Twenty years of CS education research has shown that pair programming significantly improves programming competency and increases the likelihood that students will become and remain computing majors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing modern life and has the potential to change how students learn to program. Modern AI tools like OpenAI?s ChatGPT can write, summarize, comment, and explain programs without human intervention. The goal of this project is to prototype, test, and study a pair-programming AI agent named CoCode that can serve as a tool and tutor for students. This project will help us to better understand the roles AI-based tools play in computing education. <br/><br/>This project will explore a variety of theory-informed design options and innovate on recent breakthroughs in language models and collaborative reinforcement learning resulting in the development of an AI pair-programmer agent. This agent will be able to interact with student programmers and guide them using the pair-programming pedagogy. A series of human subject experiments will serve both to refine design choices and benchmark and train the AI algorithms. The tool will be evaluated in an educational setting. Students will use CoCode in a series of trials to determine what use patterns and learning successes are possible over longer-term interaction. Outcomes will be behavioral, providing an understanding of how students? tasks change as they learn and become competent programmers. These results will be used to postulate how such technologies will continue to be developed for educational settings and how they might be integrated into workforce development for the re-skilling of existing workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project spans a broad range of chemical disciplines from catalysis to synthesis and the outcomes will affect the chemical, pharmaceutical, and materials industries. Consequently, it is well suited for training and educating young scientists who will go on to careers in these science and technology fields. An NSF-Research Experiences for Undergraduates grant enhances the broader impact of this work.<br/><br/>A goal of this award is to prepare and fully characterize charge-enhanced acids and bases, a largely underdeveloped research area. These studies are to include the examination of the catalytic abilities of these acids and bases in a range of chemical transformations. As part of this, we will also study structural variants of the catalysts as a means of increasing reactivity and selectivity. Critical to achieving our goals is that physical studies be carried out to identify key reactive intermediates to elucidate mechanism. With these goals and methods in mind, we are studying the ability of charge-enhanced catalysts to control enantioselectivity and enable the synthesis of chiral compounds. More explicitly, this award will help us to develop charge-activated metallocene complexes. In addition to charge, these catalysts will also contain additional Brønsted acid/hydrogen bond donors and enable multifunctional cooperativity to be studied and exploited. The impact of chiral additives and solvents on the resulting enantioselectivities will also be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A controllable reconfigurable power system can potentially reduce the impact of natural disasters and inherent randomness of widely used renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. This is important because volatility of renewable energies and increase occurrence of extreme weather makes the system significantly more sensitive to changes and therefore, harder to manage. The project will bring transformative change by providing a general framework to model a multi-layer power system that takes into account intermittent renewable energy sources and a robust scheduling scheme that will help system operators to take the appropriate action for delivering power to customers. This will be achieved first by introducing a new coordinated approach for transitioning from the existing grid to a more agile one, and second by developing a model based supervisory algorithm. The intellectual merits of the project include a fundamental framework for the energy management of a modernized electric grid that is agile, reconfigurable, and resilient. The broader impacts of the project include an integrated effort attracting the next generation of engineers to the field of power and energy and increase awareness to the local communities on the impact and utilization of energy technologies. <br/><br/>During the proposed research, a series of novel control strategies will be developed that not only provide operational flexibility to the grid but also allow management and stabilization of the power supply. Microgrids are the building blocks of this framework. The multi-level control algorithm is based on a multi-layer stochastic model that incorporates network constraints. The proposed control strategies have the following key attributes: i) it is hierarchical in a sense that microgrids will connect and disconnect from a network of microgrids as needed; ii) it is robust since it will prioritize stability over optimality and, iii) it is stochastic to address the intermittent character of renewable energies. The network constraints will be addressed by using linear matrix inequalities based design.  The results will be validated in real-time hardware in the loop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory is the study of symmetries of a vector space such as a three-dimensional Euclidean space (or more generally, an infinite dimensional space) endowed with additional important structures. Such symmetries often arise in families encoded by algebraic objects like groups, Lie algebras, or algebras. One important class of algebras that arise in this way is the class of so-called affinized quantum groups. These algebras have been inspiring active research and interactions between mathematics and physics since the 1980s. The main goals of this project are to resolve important questions intrinsic to the affine nature of affinized quantum groups. The project will enhance our understanding of their internal algebraic structures and establish novel connections to the above fields. In addition, the project will have an educational impact through the training and mentoring of students at various levels from high school to graduate school. <br/><br/>In more detail, the project will develop new methods in the study of quantum loop groups with applications to geometric representation theory, integrable systems, mathematical physics, and quantum cluster algebras. Building on recent results, the PI will pursue research in five related areas, with specific goals in each. These research areas are unified by the general notion of duality and the use of the ""shuffle algebra approach."" The rough plan is as follows: 1. Develop key  structures of quantum affine and toroidal algebras; 2. Continue the study of quantized Coulomb branches; 3. Continue work on integrable spin chains; 4. Develop a new approach to finite quantum groups and their integral forms that allows for arbitrary roots of unity, as well as a modular theory, thus generalizing and unifying the classical work of DeConcini-Kac-Procesi; and 5. Provide a rigorous mathematical formulation and proof of the BPS/CFT correspondence for A(n)-type quiver gauge theories in string theory, generalizing the known results for the A(1)-quiver.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the practical use of these methods currently requires a great deal of ML-training and experience to implement due to their sensitivity to nonintuitive and complex configuration settings like the size and shape of deep neural networks.  The subfield of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) seeks to help reduce the barriers to entry by creating models and pipelines which automatically self-configure based on the needs of a given problem.  Within AutoML, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automatically find the ideal structure of a deep neural network.  The process of using ML to find the optimal shape and form of a deep neural network is roughly analogous to the well-studied evolutionary and developmental processes that create shape and form in biological creatures, or that automatically find the shape and form of robots in the field of Evolutionary Robotics.  Despite the analogies between these subfields, and the outsized impact that work in AutoML may have on our ability to Harness the Data Revolution and make practical impacts across a wide variety of application areas, few examples of Neural Architecture Search algorithms have been inspired by methodologies, successes, and challenges in the evolution of development of embodied robots and animals.  <br/><br/>In this work, we propose to: (1) Systematically compare the quality of different neural network architectures by analyzing the amount of ?embodied intelligence? in their network topologies.  (2) Highlight a shortcoming of current ?weight-sharing? approaches to NAS and demonstrate how an embodied perspective to brain-body co-optimization may improve search for high quality neural architectures.  (3) Demonstrate how neural architectures that grow and prune their structures throughout training compare to static neural network architectures.

This study will map and date shoreline deposits along the Eastern Shore of Virginia that were formed over the last ~120,000 years. The focus is on times when sea level was near to, or higher than present. These data will inform modeling of glacial isostatic adjustment and ice-sheet changes to better quantify the history of global ice sheet growth and decay.

Mid-field sea-level observations (along the peripheral bulge of ice sheets) have the potential to bridge gaps in understanding between global sea level and local continental ice-sheet behavior, since relative sea level at these locations is sensitive to changes in the volume and extent in nearby ice sheets, as well as globally averaged sea-level changes. Focusing on the mid-field Eastern Shore of Virginia (USA), this study will first analyze high-resolution topographic and subsurface mapping data, assign indicative meanings to associated preserved Pleistocene coastal deposits, and develop a comprehensive geochronology to create a robust local, mid-field sea-level record over the period of growth of the last ice sheet.

Thus, we can solve equations using geometry (by finding where lines, planes, curves intersect).  These ideas have evolved into algebraic geometry, a field of modern mathematics with applications ranging from physics to cybersecurity.  In this collaborative project we are particularly interested in the connections to physics.  These connections are made through ?derived categories?, a complex system of mathematical data associated to a geometric shape.  While derived categories have experienced explosive development in recent decades, many questions about them remain unsolved.   This project attempts to solve some of the central and most recent questions about derived categories using techniques developed by the principal investigators and many others over the last decade.  This award will also support undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three specific questions about derived categories.  Together, these questions incorporate numerous areas of mathematics including birational geometry, enumerative geometry, and non-commutative algebra.   Specifically, our first question studies connections between derived categories and birational geometry (and the possibly concealed connection between flips/flops and derived partial compactifications).  We ask whether K-equivalent varieties have equivalent derived categories, a central conjecture about derived categories due to Bondal-Orlov and Kawamata.  Our second question asks how decompositions of quantum cohomology are related to semi-orthogonal decompositions of derived categories.  This connection is conjecturally made through mirror symmetry as proposed by Kontsevich and Kuznetsov.  Finally, our third question asks how derived categories shed light on resolutions of singularities (namely as moduli spaces coming from non-commutative algebra).  Here, we aim to construct non-commutative crepant resolutions using ideas from homological mirror symmetry.  The existence of these resolutions has been conjectured by Van den Bergh.  As a whole, this project aims to interpolate between these three questions/conjectures using techniques from geometric invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, derived algebraic geometry, and mirror symmetry. The central theme is the explicit use and construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels whose geometry provides a foothold into understanding these problems.  Combining the past work of the principal investigators on the construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels, wall crossing for derived categories, and virtual fundamental cycles, we expect to advance our understanding of these fundamental questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These light-driven systems are comprised of a protein isolated from algae and an earth-abundant transition metal catalyst. In addition, this project will promote the teaching and training of undergraduate student researchers who stand to become the next generation of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) researchers.  In this project, the Soltau team will also conduct outreach activities with local high school students on green chemistry, alternative energy, and climate change. <br/><br/>Carbon dioxide emissions are a highly significant global health concern. This project aims to develop new catalytic systems to capture and reduce carbon dioxide to generate reduction products as formic acid, methanol, or methane with applications as one-carbon building blocks or as fuel additives.  A photoactive protein, Photosystem I (PSI), will be isolated from the green algae, Chlorella vulgaris, and then will be covalently attached to a series of earth-abundant transition metal catalyst complexes for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction. These PSI-CO2 reduction catalyst systems will be illuminated with white light to characterize their efficiency using a sacrificial electron donor, and an electron transfer protein. The products of these photochemical reactions will be characterized by using a variety of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques to determine the functionality and mechanism of the PSI-CO2 reduction catalyst systems.

A key goal is to start a dialogue between Quantum Imaging and Quantum Optomechanics fields which share common interests but have developed in parallel as subfields of Quantum Photonics and Quantum Optics. Another goal is to extend nanomechanical sensing to gravimetry, giving access to broad applications from inertial navigation to subterranean imaging.

First, a new field of imaging-based quantum optomechanics will be explored, with traditional interferometric measurement replaced by laser deflectometry (the optical lever method).  A key goal is to observe radiation pressure shot noise in torque and study its influence on the quantum state of the reflected light field. Second, a compact pendulum gravimeter will be developed based on frequency tracking of a mass-loaded nanoribbon.  The goal is a self-calibrated gravimeter with nano-g sensitivity in a chip-scale, arrayable format. Third, using advanced engineering techniques, nanoribbons with torsional quality factors exceeding 1 billion will be developed.

The DAPS is an essential component of the energy circulation of the near-Earth space environment and is related to the instabilities responsible for dramatic energy releases in the system. Occurring frequently, DAPS can significantly modify the ionosphere temperature and thus its composition and density, which impact the drag of low-altitude spacecraft and the scintillation of radio wave transmission. Aiming at understanding the formation and consequences of DAPS, this project will provide crucial information for advanced modeling of the near-Earth space environment and space weather prediction. This funded work will promote the development of an early-career scientist (the PI) and a very early-career female researcher. It will also involve undergraduate students interested in space physics as volunteers and for research course credit. This project involves auroral phenomena, so it naturally appeals to the general public. Appropriate materials from the products will be conveyed to the public (including K-12 students) via education and public outreach efforts.<br/><br/>The strong southward electric field and associated eastward flow that extends within the Region 1 current portion of the auroral oval are referred to as the Dawnside Auroral Polarization Stream (DAPS). A DAPS? strong electric field can significantly modify magnetosphere-ionosphere convection and energetic particle drift and heat the ionosphere and thermosphere. This project aims to determine fundamental DAPS properties and their impacts, including how DAPS vary under different conditions, what contributes to these variations, and their role in instabilities responsible for dramatic M-I events. The team will use low-altitude spacecraft observations (Swarm and DMSP) to measure a magnetic field vector and east-west flow, from which they can identify FAC structures and DAPS with automated methods. Applying these methods to ~20 years of data, the team will conduct comprehensive statistical studies to answer the questions. The research results will provide crucial information on DAPS? generation mechanism and its impacts on the M-I system's convection, heating, and instability. The outcome of the studies will thus provide important implications for the M-I energy circulation. Given the frequent occurrence and strength of DAPS and their relationship to a major ionospheric conductivity change, the findings will likely be transformational for M-I-T modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Methane, the largest component of natural gas, is a significant contributor to climate change. Currently large amounts of natural gas are flared (burned without energy capture to produce carbon dioxide and water) because methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and it is not profitable to transport it as a gas or convert it onsite to a liquid. The researchers on this project are working to design metal compounds that will act as catalysts to directly convert natural gas to higher-value products under mild conditions using the oxygen in air. Detailed studies of the selective cleavage and formation of key chemical bonds by specific metal compounds will be carried out to determine the important design principles for these catalysts. With a strong emphasis on increasing diversity in science, this project is also training graduate students and providing them with the research skills needed to creatively address future challenges facing society. <br/><br/>Transition metal complexes have shown a unique ability to selectively activate the C-H bonds of alkanes. However, many of these selective C-H bond cleavage reactions are not viable in the presence of air or oxygen. This condition presents an impediment to the development of technologies to carry out the selective partial oxidation of alkanes on a large scale, where oxygen is considered the most promising oxidant. This project targets the development of transition metal complexes that can selectively activate and functionalize C-H bonds using air or oxygen as the oxidant. The researchers on the Goldberg team will explore new mechanisms for the activation of alkane C-H bonds that proceed in the presence of oxygen and water. Detailed mechanistic studies of the reactions of metal alkyl and hydride complexes, the products of alkane C-H activation, with oxygen will be carried out to learn how to incorporate oxygen as the oxidant in natural gas upgrading. Students involved in these activities will learn synthetic skills and a hypothesis-driven mechanistic approach to catalyst discovery and optimization, while participating in outreach activities and being encouraged to participate in broadening inclusive thinking in chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within GST, there has also been a call for research to better understand how to equip educators, build relevant curricula, and engage future GST learners. As one- and two-year GST training programs structured for nontraditional students can effectively move workers from entry-level, low-wage jobs into well-paying careers the project?s significance includes supporting students? career advancement and financial security. Through the Map Your Success project?s diverse connections to schools, public and private employers, and communities where workforce development is needed, HCC expects to demonstrate the high value and relevance of GST careers. The project aligns with NSF?s mission and draws on Advanced Technological Education (ATE) scholarship, including the work of the ATE-supported GeoTech Center, to advance understanding of how GST programs integrate traditional STEM skills with social and behavioral sciences. The project will support the GST program to train in the competencies employers seek and can effectively open a new pipeline into GST jobs for community college students.<br/><br/>HCC?s goals are to increase GST A.A.S. enrollment from 9 students to 20 students per year and enroll an annual average of 20 GST certificate students by the end of the project period. Project objectives are to (1) enhance the GST A.A.S. and certificate programs to align with workforce needs; (2) enroll an average of 20 GST A.A.S. students and 20 GST certificate students annually, reaching approximately 100 students over the three-year ATE project period, by engaging secondary educators, high school students, and current HCC students in GST outreach and education opportunities; and (3) retain and graduate an average of 80% of students in each program and support their advancement into relevant technical careers. HCC will learn from and partner with the GeoTech Center and the Maryland Geographic Alliance at Towson University to develop statewide professional training opportunities for secondary educators; create a new Unmanned Aerial Vehicles course; expand the existing GST Advisory Board; strengthen GST internships; hold annual International GIS Day events; and reach out to local high schools and underserved communities.

Gellman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison will develop foldamer catalysts that are inspired by the structural diversity of enzymes.  Enzymes are large protein-based macromolecules that act as biological catalysts by accelerating numerous chemical reactions in living organisms.  Some of the most well known reactions catalyzed by enzymes include conversion of cane sugar into glucose and fructose, breaking of glucose into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide, and hydrolysis of fats.  Foldamers, on the other hand, are unnatural scaffolds that mimic protein-like conformational behavior and potentially also the catalytic properties of enzymes. In this project, foldamers will be prepared using ?-amino acids in addition to the usual ?-amino acid building blocks for natural peptides.  During the protein folding process, key subunits are arranged into the precise three-dimensional arrays that are essential for binding to other molecules and catalyzing chemical reactions.  In this project, organic and supramolecular chemistries specifically tailored to enable efficient functional group incorporation into helical foldamer scaffolds will be utilized to prepare bifunctional and trifunctional foldamer catalysts.   The synthesized catalysts will then be utilized in variety of metal and non-metal catalyzed carbon-carbon bond forming reactions.  This project will provide excellent training in interdisciplinary research and enable young scholars to undertake productive careers in academia, industry, or other settings.  Additionally, Professor Gellman will continue to support expansion of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the scientific community through his involvement in graduate student recruitment and through his activities as a Trustee of the Gordon Research Conferences.<br/><br/>This project will seek to expand the range of bifunctional foldamer catalysis by examining ?/?-peptides containing new types of reactive diads.  Three paths will be pursued under the first general goal, focusing on bifunctional catalysis.  In the first path, side chains containing new types of reactive groups that function via covalent activation of substrates, specifically, hydrazides for electrophilic activation of ?-substituted enals, and thiazolium systems or related heterocycles for activation of aldehydes toward Stetter reactions, will be incorporated into foldamer scaffolds.  In the second path, side chains intended to activate substrates noncovalently either through H-bonding or cation-?-interactions will be explored.  The third path will focus on adding bipyridine or terpyridine units that will be used for complexation with nickel and subsequently ?-arylation of aldehydes. In the second goal, the team will seek to harness the modularity of foldamer scaffolds to allow three functional groups to work in coordination to promote a single transformation. This project seeks to enable the development of new catalysts that are inspired by the structural diversity of enzymes.  The ability to precisely control the location of multiple reactive sites within foldamers could additionally provide exciting opportunities of using these enzyme mimics for synergistic catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, we can solve equations using geometry (by finding where lines, planes, curves intersect).  These ideas have evolved into algebraic geometry, a field of modern mathematics with applications ranging from physics to cybersecurity.  In this collaborative project we are particularly interested in the connections to physics.  These connections are made through ?derived categories?, a complex system of mathematical data associated to a geometric shape.  While derived categories have experienced explosive development in recent decades, many questions about them remain unsolved.   This project attempts to solve some of the central and most recent questions about derived categories using techniques developed by the principal investigators and many others over the last decade.  This award will also support undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three specific questions about derived categories.  Together, these questions incorporate numerous areas of mathematics including birational geometry, enumerative geometry, and non-commutative algebra.   Specifically, our first question studies connections between derived categories and birational geometry (and the possibly concealed connection between flips/flops and derived partial compactifications).  We ask whether K-equivalent varieties have equivalent derived categories, a central conjecture about derived categories due to Bondal-Orlov and Kawamata.  Our second question asks how decompositions of quantum cohomology are related to semi-orthogonal decompositions of derived categories.  This connection is conjecturally made through mirror symmetry as proposed by Kontsevich and Kuznetsov.  Finally, our third question asks how derived categories shed light on resolutions of singularities (namely as moduli spaces coming from non-commutative algebra).  Here, we aim to construct non-commutative crepant resolutions using ideas from homological mirror symmetry.  The existence of these resolutions has been conjectured by Van den Bergh.  As a whole, this project aims to interpolate between these three questions/conjectures using techniques from geometric invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, derived algebraic geometry, and mirror symmetry. The central theme is the explicit use and construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels whose geometry provides a foothold into understanding these problems.  Combining the past work of the principal investigators on the construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels, wall crossing for derived categories, and virtual fundamental cycles, we expect to advance our understanding of these fundamental questions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond the technical aspects, the project involves educational and outreach activities ranging from introducing 4-8th grade girls to engineering to teaching a course at the Michigan State Grandparent University Summer Camp.<br/>     <br/>Recent experiments by the investigator?s group, and others, have demonstrated that precious metal current collectors, even unpolarized ones, can alter high-temperature MIEC k(chem) values. However, the full extent to which precious metal surface additions and/or electric polarization influence high-temperature MIEC k(chem) values, and the mechanisms by which this occurs, have yet to be fully explored. Hence, the objective of the project is to: 1) quantify the impact intentionally-added Pt surface additions and/or electric polarization have on the 400-600°C k(chem) of Pulsed Laser Deposited (PLD) praseodymium cerium oxide (PCO) thin films, 2) determine the mechanisms by which these fabrication and testing modifications alter the PCO k(chem), and 3) identify possible sources of previously-unrecognized, inadvertent precious metal contamination. This will be achieved by comparing the k(chem) values obtained from an in situ, non-contact, current-collector-optional wafer curvature measurement technique developed in the investigator?s group with those obtained via simultaneous Electrical Conductivity Relaxation and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy.  In addition, surface and bulk thin film composition and structural characterization techniques (such as X-Ray Diffractometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) will be used to identify relationships between k(chem) and materials properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transfer of volatile elements from Earth?s deep interior to its surface and atmosphere at subduction zones enables a habitable planet. Magmas erupted at arc volcanoes, located at subduction zones, are more oxidized than magmas erupted at mid-ocean ridges. Arc volcanoes are the basis of the continental crust and host economic ore deposits. Quantifying the processes that lead to the oxidation of magmas in subduction zones is then critical for understanding the formation of continents and ores. This project will investigate the hypothesis that the transfer of sulfur throughout the subduction system is responsible for the elevated oxidation state of arc magmas. High-pressure experiments will be executed to measure the behavior of sulfur in rocks at subduction zone conditions. Experimental results will be used to inform observations of natural subduction-related rocks. This project includes research and mentoring experiences for a postdoctoral associate, a PhD student and two undergraduate students. Project results will be assimilated into new open access Earth science educational content. A hybrid capstone outreach event will be held to disseminate research outcomes to the public.<br/><br/>This study will examine the hypothesis that the oxidized signature of arc magmas is due to the transfer of sulfate from metamorphosed oceanic crust on the down-going slab to the overlying arc mantle. High-pressure experiments will be executed to calibrate a new proxy for the oxidation state of subduction-related rocks based on the incorporation and valence state of sulfur in the mineral apatite. Experimental apatite will be co-crystallized with sulfide or sulfate phases such that the behavior of sulfur in apatite can be used to provide indirect information on the relative stabilities of sulfide vs. sulfates in subducted oceanic crust. Results from the experiments will be applied to determine the oxidation states of suites of apatite-bearing metabasites to determine if subducting slabs record an increase in oxidation state concurrent with the increase in dissolved oxygen in the deep oceans and rise in seawater sulfate in the Early Phanerozoic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In number theory, Hilbert's 12th Problem (one of a famous list of 23 problems proposed in 1900) and the related Stark conjectures (formulated in the late 1970s) concern finding more explicit expressions for certain abstract structures involving algebraic numbers. In quantum information theory, Zauner's conjecture (1999) predicts the existence of highly regular geometric configurations called SICs, which describe quantum measurements.  The research project involves investigating a connection between the Hilbert/Stark problems and Zauner's conjecture to provide new insights in both areas. Results from the project will allow for faster computation of SICs, which have potential applications to quantum state tomography as well as classical compressed sensing for radar. The project will also support a graduate student's involvement, allow the PI and his students to disseminate their work through conferences and seminars, support a research seminar in number theory at the PI's institution, and support outreach work by the PI to high school students.<br/><br/>In the project, the PI will prove new results on complex analytic modular cocycles to refine the statement of the Stark conjectures for real quadratic fields and (through joint work with Appleby and Flammia) to conjecturally construct symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs or SICs) in every dimension. The project will develop the theory of (generalized, multiplicative) analytic modular cocycles and their ""real multiplication values,"" reformulating (and proving results towards) the Stark conjectures in a language similar to the language of modular forms rather than L-functions. It will produce a geometric interpretation of explicit class field theory for real quadratic fields through structures generalizing SICs.

A common approach in large data analyses is to use what is commonly called adaptive partitioning in which the large data set is partitioned and recursively used in the analyses.  However, the rationale behind these partitioning methods is not well understood as the broad adoption of machine learning methods in applications has not always been supported by development of theoretical and methodological tools to understand their properties.   This research project will study the rationale behind algorithms used in machine learning and other methods for large data analyses.  The research will then develop new and improved methods for machine learning and other large data analyses and apply these methods to several economic problems.  The results of this research will not only significantly improve machine learning and other large data analyses, but it will also improve decision-making generally, increase economic growth, and help establish the US as a global leader in large data analyses and machine learning.<br/><br/>A technical challenge in formally studying adaptive partitioning and other flexible learning methods is that the randomness introduced by the often-recursive partition scheme is difficult to account for. This research will provide an array of theoretical and methodological results for adaptive partition-based and other flexible learning methods, providing both positive and negative results.  The research will develop new treatment effect estimation and inference methods, and guide practice in program evaluation and causal inference.  One of the main results shows that many popular recursive partitioning methods for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation can be pointwise (uniformly) inconsistent over the support of the conditioning variables. Other results show that adaptive oblique decision trees can have accuracy on par with neural networks.  The research also studies non-linear partitioning-based methods with applications to quantile regression and treatment effects. Spin-off projects on causal inference and program evaluation will also be undertaken as part of this research.  The results of this research will improve the analyses of large scale data, such as those used to make decisions and thus improve program evaluation.  Besides improving economic decision making and economic growth, the results will also establish the US as a global leader in program evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The methods being developed use a single reagent to create high value C?N bonds from a range of commercially available starting materials. Students doing this work will be trained in fundamental chemical principles, catalysis  and the synthesis of complex organic molecular scaffolds of relevance to therapeutics. The broader impacts of the funded project include the creation of a diverse, nitrogen-rich compound screening library for chemical biology/biological discovery that will be made available to other researchers along with educational workshops and recurring virtual conferences. These latter efforts are being developed to provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to network and to receive wider exposure for their research.<br/><br/>This project is expected to expand the scope of amination reagents and contribute to both the late-stage amination of complex scaffolds and to developing a more diverse set of N-containing architectures, including N?containing heterocycles. More specifically, the Lopchuk group is focused on the use of diazirines and diaziridines (three-membered rings with two nitrogens and one carbon) as novel amination reagents. In this approach diazirines will be used in reactions with structurally diverse starting materials to form diaziridine intermediates that are subsequently converted into amines (including 15N stable labeled amines), hydrazines, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrazoles, indazoles, and pyrroles. The use of diazirines and diaziridines avoids many of the drawbacks that have been seen with other electrophilic and radical amination reagents including their instability, their lack of functional group tolerance, and/or the harsh conditions needed for processing them downstream of C?N bond formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

POCT devices can be a solution for this urgent societal need, and this project aims to develop POCT devices by integrating a CMOS optical sensor and microchannel devices. Integrating microchannels for liquid sample pumping and guidance with a CMOS sensor in a portable case with other electronic components poses various research challenges. In overcoming the challenges in an integrated design approach, this project seeks to address the following research question: how can the microfluidic and CMOS components be optimized separately and integrated into a portable device? Participating students will research key parts of a portable POCT device separately based on respective research expertise of mentors, and then they will integrate their solutions at the system level of the device.

Yet, many mathematics teachers are teachers of linguistically marginalized students. When teachers do receive professional development in supporting multilingual and other linguistically marginalized students, it is typically content-neutral and sometimes at odds with notions of quality mathematics teaching, making it difficult to apply in practice. In this project, researchers will develop and investigate a novel professional development model to support mathematics teachers? learning of responsive pedagogies for linguistically marginalized students. Working with secondary mathematics teachers in diverse settings in North Carolina, the project team will develop a series of workshops on linguistically responsive pedagogies tailored to participants? challenges and school contexts. In addition to these workshops, as teachers enact linguistically responsive pedagogies in their classrooms, the research team will support their learning with video-coaching. Central to this model is classroom video as a key resource for teachers? learning, building on the conjecture that by providing a window into students? experiences, video can help develop teachers? insights for responsive pedagogies. This project will contribute to large-scale efforts to improve mathematics education and address longstanding opportunity gaps across the nation, offering a professional development model to foster linguistically responsive and asset-based forms of mathematics teaching.<br/><br/>Using design-based research methods, the research team will investigate the overarching research question: How do secondary mathematics teachers learn about supporting linguistically marginalized students? To investigate this question, the project team will use ethnographic data collection methods to capture the development of teachers? learning trajectories.

Several pathways are available for enhancing strength through control over defects in the material.  However, efforts to-date have failed to bring material strengths anywhere near the holy grail of strengthening, referred to as the ideal strength. This failure has not come from a lack of materials engineering, nor would innovations in materials design or processing immediately solve the problem. Instead, prior approaches have been too limited in scope from the viewpoint of the material?s deformation physics, which is addressed in this research by considering novel design pathways for controlling material structure and, in turn, the defects that govern strength. The findings of this project are applicable to advanced materials with increased chemical complexity, which are desired for modern engineering applications. An interactive online learning module transcending traditional institutional barriers ? denoted the Mechanics Interactive Teaming (MINT) initiative in engineering education ? is being developed to engage students cooperatively at the partnering universities with new virtual learning modules focused on cutting-edge topics in materials science. The initial focus on graduate curricula is being broadened to reach undergraduates through the Women in Science and Engineering Program at Stony Brook University and further expanded for working professionals using relevant design problems through collaboration with the Advanced Casting Research Center at UC Irvine.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/><br/>This research enables materials with near-ideal strength by developing a fundamental understanding of dislocation nucleation and propagation as rate-limiting deformation mechanisms in nanostructured alloys where defect confinement and interaction with grain boundary and lattice solutes act as local barriers to plasticity. Specific research questions to be answered include: (i) what are the important transition states and associated energy barriers for dislocation nucleation at solute-decorated interfaces and for propagation within a nanoscale alloy crystal, (ii) how does interfacial structure and energy variation upon doping alter dislocation nucleation/propagation, and (iii) how do solute atoms inside the grain, which can potentially act as local pinning points but also alter the properties of the lattice, influence dislocation propagation? A practical hypothesis of this research is that the strength of nanocrystalline alloys can be maximized by synergistic doping to stabilize the grain boundaries against local plasticity and delay defect nucleation while simultaneously inhibiting dislocation propagation through the nanograin interiors. Using a combination of atomistic modeling, multi-modal structural characterization, and unique micromechanical testing, this hypothesis is being tested in nanostructured aluminum and copper alloys, where their intrinsically different stacking fault energies will provide access to different confined slip events. In a broad sense, this research will define new strengthening paradigms in nanoengineered metallic materials and establish the mechanistic underpinnings of solute-biased interfacial energy landscapes for understanding fundamental dislocation physics in confined slip environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, students receive certain types of practice problems more frequently than other types of practice problems, an occurrence that may limit as well as interfere with students? development a robust understanding of decimals. This project investigates whether providing balanced distributions of practice problems with immediate feedback can improve students? knowledge of decimals and decimal arithmetic in middle school.<br/><br/>The project includes three short-term intervention studies with 6th and 7th grade students. Study 1 will focus on decimal arithmetic and test whether completing balanced practice problems with immediate feedback will improve students? procedural knowledge. The researchers will compare the effectiveness of balanced decimal arithmetic practice problems with immediate feedback, unbalanced practice problems that reflect typical practice problems presented in textbooks, and business-as-usual activities. Study 2 will focus on decimal magnitude knowledge and test whether procedural knowledge developed from balanced practice with immediate feedback will further improve conceptual knowledge, and whether additional scaffolding is needed.

Understanding these soft materials, which often possess both fluid-like and solid-like properties, and how they flow or deform is necessary for advancing many technologies, including 3D printing where the properties of the ink or resin must be finely tuned. To make progress on our scientific understanding of soft materials, this IRES Track I project will strengthen collaborations between researchers in Southern California and in Mexico. Each year over the 3-year duration of this project, 6 students will be recruited to take part in this international research experience. U.S. students from historically underrepresented groups and from predominantly undergraduate colleges and community colleges will be targeted in the recruitment effort. Those students will conduct research over the summer at either the Center for Research in Advanced Materials (Centro de Investigación en Materiales Avanzados, CIMAV) in Monterrey, Mexico or the University of Guanajuato in León, Mexico. Working with research mentors in Mexico and the mentors in Southern California, students will take various approaches to study the physics and chemistry of soft materials. Such approaches include using computer simulations to study fundamental aspects of soft materials and using 3D printers to apply our scientific understanding of soft materials to the design and use of new inks and resins. Students taking part in this research and receiving mentorship from U.S. and Mexican scientists will be prepared to cooperate with diverse teams across borders and to become leaders of a globally engaged scientific workforce. <br/><br/>This IRES project will strengthen collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and Mexico by supporting the participation of 6 undergraduates per year in mentored summer research experiences.

After receiving training on basic research skills, selected students will spend approximately 8 weeks at either the Center for Research in Advanced Materials (Centro de Investigación en Materiales Avanzados, CIMAV) in Monterrey, Mexico or the University of Guanajuato in León, Mexico. Research projects undertaken by students will advance our understanding of soft matter, particularly in the areas of colloid science and rheology. Projects will include investigating the rheology of nanocellulose and cellulose composites for use in 3D printing applications, quantifying the translational and rotational diffusion of anisotropic colloids to better understand transport and microrheology in complex environments, and developing computer simulations of colloidal particles in external fields. These projects will lead to new analysis techniques in microrheology and optical microscopy and will advance the development of inks for 3D printing. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) train and mentor 18 (6 students per year for 3 years) undergraduate students on soft matter research in a collaborative and international environment, (2) develop and foster research collaborations among institutions in the U.S. and Mexico, (3) characterize and harness the rheological properties of complex fluids and gels for enhancing our fundamental knowledge of soft matter and for applying such materials to 3D printing applications, (4) disseminate research outcomes at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals, and (5) develop a cohort of scientists from predominantly underrepresented groups who can network and collaborate effectively with others from various backgrounds and who can draw upon a diverse set of mentors. IRES participants will advance scientific knowledge in projects that range from applied to fundamental using experimental and computational approaches.

However, challenges in quantifying and communicating the holistic social, environmental, and economic impacts and benefits of wastewater management strategies can prevent the implementation of such initiatives. This IRES Track I program will take place in Costa Rica, where 66% of the septic tank sludge is not treated properly before disposal and 86% of the wastewater connected to sanitary sewers receives limited to no treatment prior to discharge. Contamination caused by untreated wastewater jeopardizes Costa Rica?s national economy, which is dependent on ecotourism. Consequently, this program will provide 18 U.S. students from West Virginia University, University of South Florida, and California State University, Chico with an international and interdisciplinary research experience in engineering and anthropology over the course of three years. Students will use both social science and engineering methods to improve the long-term sustainability of sanitation systems in small communities using triple-bottom line (social, environmental, and economic) decision making strategies for wastewater management. Students will develop interdisciplinary skills and competencies while addressing global sanitation challenges in the socioeconomic and cultural context of rapidly urbanizing cities in Costa Rica. Along with increased participation of students from underrepresented groups, this program will contribute to training a diverse U.S. workforce to address environmental issues of global significance. The program will strengthen and expand the partnership between collaborators in the U.S. and Costa Rica to facilitate progress toward safe management of wastewater and integrated resource recovery in a sustainable and culturally appropriate way.<br/><br/>This IRES Track I program will provide 18 U.S. students from West Virginia University, University of South Florida, and California State University, Chico with an international and interdisciplinary research experience to solve complex sanitation challenges in the ecotourism community of Santa Elena, Costa Rica. This three-year research experience is motivated by the following driving objectives: develop convergent knowledge at the intersection of environmental engineering and anthropology; provide U.S. students the opportunity to develop interdisciplinary global skills and competencies; and facilitate safe management of wastewater and integrated recovery of resources in Costa Rica. The intellectual merit of this project stems from interdisciplinary research combining the fields of environmental engineering and anthropology to address issues of global importance in a sustainable and culturally appropriate way. This convergent research will spur the development of global skills and competencies and will facilitate safe management of wastewater and recovery of resources in Costa Rica. In this IRES program, undergraduate and graduate students will receive training and skill development in water quality testing, life cycle assessment, life cycle cost analysis, and qualitative and quantitative social science data collection and analysis. Students will work in multidisciplinary teams to engage a wide range of local stakeholders to identify and assess sustainability metrics relevant to small wastewater treatment integrating resource recovery to support decision-making in the sanitation sector. Students will assess triple-bottom line (social, environmental, and economic) sustainability metrics and use multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to improve the long-term sustainability of sanitation systems. A new MCDA tool will be developed based on the social, environmental and economic context of Central America. The tool will allow wastewater utilities in small communities serving populations of less than 10,000 to compare performance across multiple criteria for alternate solutions at decentralized, semi-centralized and centralized scales of implementation. IRES students will develop interdisciplinary skills and competencies while addressing global sanitation challenges in the socioeconomic and cultural context of Costa Rica.

The research includes collection and analysis of lake sediment cores from Touson Lake, an oxbow located 2 km west of the site. Identification of the contents provides useful data for inferring human impacts that can be applied at a wide range of situations, yielding useful information without methods that are destructive to sites. Furthermore, understanding how societies responded to past climate change and/or local environmental degradation is important for understanding how challenges of the 21st century might impact populations. Included are sharing of results with the Moundville Archaeological Park Museum and sharing monthly updates to federally recognized Tribal Nations with several representatives of which are involved with both sampling and interpreting the data. This project also trains one graduate and two undergraduate students at multiple universities in a multi-disciplinary setting.<br/><br/>Combined archaeological and paleoenvironmental studies demonstrate that humans are in direct and constant interaction with their environment. While there is considerable information about climate-environment-human interactions for cultures in central and South America, there is a lack of such information for Mississippian mound-building societies in North America. This project addresses two overarching research questions: 1) did environmental conditions influence shifts in population and agriculture at Moundville? and 2) did environmental changes create stresses that caused eventual site abandonment? To answer these questions, sediment cores from Touson Lake  are analyzed for: 1) stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in organic matter, 2) grain size distribution, 3) magnetic susceptibility, 4) charcoal particles, 5) pollen assemblages, 6) cyanobacteria pigments, and 7) fecal sterols, all of which indicate past environmental conditions.

However, high school students' analysis and interpretation of scientific data is often limited in scope, complexity, and authentic purpose. This project aims to support and advance students' work with ecological data in high school biology classrooms by embracing a new approach: Bayesian data analysis methods. Such methods involve expressing initial ideas or beliefs and updating them quantitatively with data that students access or record. This project will empower 20 high school teachers and their approximately 1,200 students to make sense of data within and beyond classroom contexts. It also will involve sharing research findings, an educational technology tool for Bayesian data analysis, and curricular resources in open and accessible ways.<br/><br/>Teachers commonly desire to plan and carry out more data-intensive classroom activities. However, there needs to be more connection between students' work with data and the core science ideas teachers want their students to understand. The result is that students' work with data can be isolated from the sense-making students are doing about science. Because of advances in cognitive science, data science and Bayesian data analysis tools and methods, and science curricular standards, there is an opportunity to provide science teachers with practical tools and teaching strategies for students to use data in science classrooms more ambitiously. This project involves designing and carrying out a multi-year professional development program for 20 high school biology teachers focused on ecosystems-related core science ideas and locally-relevant ecological phenomena and questions. The program includes a collaboration with the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, an experiential and outdoor education center in the nation's most biodiverse national park. The program focuses on strategies and a specially designed and developed statistical software tool to make Bayesian data analysis more accessible for high school learners. This study also involves a field experiment that assesses several teacher and student outcomes using quantitative and qualitative measures over multiple years of classroom implementation.

However, challenges in quantifying and communicating the holistic social, environmental, and economic impacts and benefits of wastewater management strategies can prevent the implementation of such initiatives. This IRES Track I program will take place in Costa Rica, where 66% of the septic tank sludge is not treated properly before disposal and 86% of the wastewater connected to sanitary sewers receives limited to no treatment prior to discharge. Contamination caused by untreated wastewater jeopardizes Costa Rica?s national economy, which is dependent on ecotourism. Consequently, this program will provide 18 U.S. students from West Virginia University, University of South Florida, and California State University, Chico with an international and interdisciplinary research experience in engineering and anthropology over the course of three years. Students will use both social science and engineering methods to improve the long-term sustainability of sanitation systems in small communities using triple-bottom line (social, environmental, and economic) decision making strategies for wastewater management. Students will develop interdisciplinary skills and competencies while addressing global sanitation challenges in the socioeconomic and cultural context of rapidly urbanizing cities in Costa Rica. Along with increased participation of students from underrepresented groups, this program will contribute to training a diverse U.S. workforce to address environmental issues of global significance. The program will strengthen and expand the partnership between collaborators in the U.S. and Costa Rica to facilitate progress toward safe management of wastewater and integrated resource recovery in a sustainable and culturally appropriate way.<br/><br/>This IRES Track I program will provide 18 U.S. students from West Virginia University, University of South Florida, and California State University, Chico with an international and interdisciplinary research experience to solve complex sanitation challenges in the ecotourism community of Santa Elena, Costa Rica. This three-year research experience is motivated by the following driving objectives: develop convergent knowledge at the intersection of environmental engineering and anthropology; provide U.S. students the opportunity to develop interdisciplinary global skills and competencies; and facilitate safe management of wastewater and integrated recovery of resources in Costa Rica. The intellectual merit of this project stems from interdisciplinary research combining the fields of environmental engineering and anthropology to address issues of global importance in a sustainable and culturally appropriate way. This convergent research will spur the development of global skills and competencies and will facilitate safe management of wastewater and recovery of resources in Costa Rica. In this IRES program, undergraduate and graduate students will receive training and skill development in water quality testing, life cycle assessment, life cycle cost analysis, and qualitative and quantitative social science data collection and analysis. Students will work in multidisciplinary teams to engage a wide range of local stakeholders to identify and assess sustainability metrics relevant to small wastewater treatment integrating resource recovery to support decision-making in the sanitation sector. Students will assess triple-bottom line (social, environmental, and economic) sustainability metrics and use multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to improve the long-term sustainability of sanitation systems. A new MCDA tool will be developed based on the social, environmental and economic context of Central America. The tool will allow wastewater utilities in small communities serving populations of less than 10,000 to compare performance across multiple criteria for alternate solutions at decentralized, semi-centralized and centralized scales of implementation. IRES students will develop interdisciplinary skills and competencies while addressing global sanitation challenges in the socioeconomic and cultural context of Costa Rica. This, along with increased participation of students from underrepresented groups, will contribute to training a diverse U.S. workforce. The program will strengthen and expand the partnership between collaborators in the U.S. and Costa Rica to facilitate progress toward safe management of wastewater and integrated resource recovery in Costa Rica.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a field that deals with the local properties of algebraic varieties, i.e., the solution set of a system of polynomial equations in several variables. For example, the solution set of a single polynomial equation in two variables can be realized as a curve in the plane (e.g., a parabola y=x^2). The singular or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have rich algebraic and geometric structures, and detailing their properties is crucial in many investigations. For example, the parabola is nonsingular (meaning that locally it looks like a line), while the curve defined by y^2=x^3 is nonsingular except at the origin, where it locally looks like a cusp. The projects that will be explored are focused on the singular points of algebraic varieties (i.e., singularities), with a focus on measuring singularities using various algebraic techniques. The PI will involve his graduate students and post-docs in this research project.<br/><br/>The PI will construct a mixed characteristic singularity theory in collaboration with other experts in this area. One focus is to develop a mixed characteristic version of test ideals. Projects include studying their behaviors under localization and completion, and their connections to multiplier ideals from birational geometry. Another focus is on perfectoid signature and perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, which are defined using the perfectoidization functor of Bhatt-Scholze and are inspired by F-signature and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity from positive characteristic. Projects include understanding the behavior of these numerical invariants under localization and in families. The PI will also continue the study on Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities, with a focus on the longstanding Lech's conjecture. The proposed projects include attacking the three dimensional mixed characteristic case, and exploring the existence of lim Ulrich sequences beyond the graded case. The PI will also investigate the existence of lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences and their variations to attack the longstanding Serre's conjecture on intersection multiplicities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identification of the contents provides useful data for inferring human impacts that can be applied at a wide range of situations, yielding useful information without methods that are destructive to sites. Furthermore, understanding how societies responded to past climate change and/or local environmental degradation is important for understanding how challenges of the 21st century might impact populations. Included are sharing of results with the Moundville Archaeological Park Museum and sharing monthly updates to federally recognized Tribal Nations with several representatives of which are involved with both sampling and interpreting the data. This project also trains one graduate and two undergraduate students at multiple universities in a multi-disciplinary setting.<br/><br/>Combined archaeological and paleoenvironmental studies demonstrate that humans are in direct and constant interaction with their environment. While there is considerable information about climate-environment-human interactions for cultures in central and South America, there is a lack of such information for Mississippian mound-building societies in North America. This project addresses two overarching research questions: 1) did environmental conditions influence shifts in population and agriculture at Moundville? and 2) did environmental changes create stresses that caused eventual site abandonment? To answer these questions, sediment cores from Touson Lake  are analyzed for: 1) stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in organic matter, 2) grain size distribution, 3) magnetic susceptibility, 4) charcoal particles, 5) pollen assemblages, 6) cyanobacteria pigments, and 7) fecal sterols, all of which indicate past environmental conditions. Compilation of existing archaeological literature on the demography of the local and regional populations are compiled and representatives of Muskogean-speaking tribes affiliated with Moundville contribute to data interpretation with their indigenous traditions and culture histories associated with the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to providing new and effective routes to building complex molecules and materials of importance, the broader impacts of the proposed work include  outreach activities that are aimed at recruiting undergraduate students, including underrepresented minority students, into research where their potential and career possibilities will be enhanced.<br/><br/>In this project,  the Gevorgyan team is developing new mild methods for the generation of carbon- and heteroatom-centered radicals and unlocking their reactivity. The approach under development relies on novel donor-acceptor (DA) complexes capable of the reduction of electrophilic intermediates using single electron transfer (SET). Their work is being carried out using visible light initiation leading to the generation of a precursor radical that undergoes atom transfer (AT) or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to generate transposed radicals. These new radicals can then engage in a number of diverse synthetic transformations, including C(sp3)?H bond functionalization reactions. The factors favoring the efficient formation of DA complexes, as well as SET, AT, and HAT processes, will be investigated under this award. It is believed that these methods, when fully developed, will not only deepen our understanding of electron-transfer chemistry, but they will also substantially broaden the tools that are available for the synthesis and late-stage modification of complex molecules and drugs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Danheiser of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will study the development of new methods for the chemical synthesis of cyclic organic molecules.  Synthesis is often described as the enabling technology of chemistry.  The synthetic methods developed in the proposed research will provide researchers in both academia and industry with new tools for the synthesis of important organic compounds with applications in medicine, agriculture, electronics, and other areas.  Carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems are incorporated in the chemical structures of numerous biologically and medicinally important compounds, and the development of highly efficient methods for their synthesis has great value in providing improved access to molecules with important applications in these areas.  The goal of this research program is the development of new strategies with the power to dramatically streamline the synthesis of these classes of compounds.  The utility of these new methods will be demonstrated by their application to the synthesis of several naturally occurring compounds that have known activity as antitumor agents, but which are not available in quantity from their sources in nature.  The graduate students supported under this grant will serve as coordinators for the MIT Outreach Program, which each year visits ca. 25 high schools in the New England region providing presentations on chemistry and careers in science.  Approximately 1200-1500 high school students attend these presentations each year, with many of the students being members of underrepresented groups in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>The aim of the proposed research is to advance the ability of chemists to develop efficient syntheses of several important classes of organic compounds including polycyclic aromatic molecules, heterocyclic systems such as indoles and carbazoles, and eight-membered carbocyclic compounds. The methods that will be investigated involve mechanistically novel transformations and these studies are expected to advance our understanding of the chemistry of unusual reactive species such as strained carbocyclic rings, vinylketenes, and several other classes of highly unsaturated conjugated molecules.  From the perspective of sustainability, the methodology under development has several attractive features.  Most of the methods are highly atom economical, i.e., all of the atoms of the reactants are incorporated in the products, minimizing the generation of chemical waste.  In addition, most of the new cycloadditions to be developed are triggered simply by heat or light, avoiding the need for even catalytic amounts of reagents (especially heavy metal catalysts).  The graduate students supported under this program will receive training to develop their skills as synthetic chemists, and will also receive training in scientific ethics and training to develop their oral and written communication skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of these experiments is to investigate the physical mechanism responsible for the conversion of antimatter into matter in the early universe.  This is one of the outstanding questions in particle and nuclear physics and cosmology, because the Big Bang theory requires matter and antimatter to have been created in equal parts, although now, we do not observe significant quantities of antimatter in the visible universe.<br/>Five collaborating institutions: University of Kentucky, Indiana University, Berea College, Eastern Kentucky University, and Western Kentucky University will recruit participants from their respective institutions to work together as a student team/cohort.  Three of the institutions operate nuclear physics accelerator facilities with neutron sources for student training, and the other two possess outstanding undergraduate physics programs that draw undergraduates from Appalachia.  An innovative aspect of this proposal is that participants will be recruited during the summer prior to the international experience and will receive extensive training with their advisor at their home institution before travelling to Japan.  This personalized academic year-long training will prepare the students to make meaningful contributions in a highly technical field and give them extra time to study the Japanese language and culture.<br/>The program will directly train a new generation of talented physicists skilled at working in international collaborations and conducting team-based science. The small scale of the NOPTREX experiment and its use of techniques from many subfields of physics lends itself to hands-on student participation and the development of a broad understanding of physical principles and experimental techniques. Special consideration will be given to women, Appalachian, first-generation, and underrepresented minorities.  Students chosen for the program will enjoy a rich intellectual research experience using the most advanced instrumentation currently available and will gain world-class skills in precision measurements with low-energy neutrons in an international collaborative setting.  As a result, the program will strengthen intellectual and cultural ties between the nuclear science programs of the US and Japan both for the immediate future and in the rising generation of nuclear physicists.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of the NOPTREX collaboration is to conduct a new type of sensitive search for time reversal symmetry violation in polarized neutron transmission through polarized nuclei. The discovery of a new source of time reversal violation in neutron-nucleus interactions would uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and could elucidate the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.  This experiment exploits special properties of low energy neutron-nucleus resonances, which can act as a natural amplifier of parity and time reversal violation. The design of the experimental apparatus directly embodies and exploits the principle of motion-reversal symmetry to conduct a sensitive search. The Japanese Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS) at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) is well-suited to host this experiment and will be an ideal backdrop for an international research experience for our students. Several measurements toward the NOPTREX goals have already been completed both at J-PARC and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).<br/>An innovative aspect of this proposal is the extensive individualized, academic-year training for each student prior to conducting nuclear physics research in Japan.  It builds on the highly collaborative work environment centered around both the US multi-institutional team-based R&D experiments at LANL and the international collaborative experiments being performed at J-PARC.  Each US institution contributes specialized hardware expertise and will provide personalized training to IRES participants during the full academic year to prepare them for specific tasks during their research in Japan.  Participants will learn collaborative skills and bond as they share their progress with each other and their Japanese mentors in weekly collaboration video conference meetings during the academic year.  Cohort building, scientific training, and cultural awareness will be consolidated during two in-person collaboration/training meetings before travel to Japan.<br/>The students will perform 10 weeks of summer research at Nagoya University under the supervision of Professors Hirohiko Shimizu, Masaaki Kitaguchi, and Takuya Okudaira, with the aid of one US graduate participant.

Several pathways are available for enhancing strength through control over defects in the material.  However, efforts to-date have failed to bring material strengths anywhere near the holy grail of strengthening, referred to as the ideal strength. This failure has not come from a lack of materials engineering, nor would innovations in materials design or processing immediately solve the problem. Instead, prior approaches have been too limited in scope from the viewpoint of the material?s deformation physics, which is addressed in this research by considering novel design pathways for controlling material structure and, in turn, the defects that govern strength. The findings of this project are applicable to advanced materials with increased chemical complexity, which are desired for modern engineering applications. An interactive online learning module transcending traditional institutional barriers ? denoted the Mechanics Interactive Teaming (MINT) initiative in engineering education ? is being developed to engage students cooperatively at the partnering universities with new virtual learning modules focused on cutting-edge topics in materials science. The initial focus on graduate curricula is being broadened to reach undergraduates through the Women in Science and Engineering Program at Stony Brook University and further expanded for working professionals using relevant design problems through collaboration with the Advanced Casting Research Center at UC Irvine.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/><br/>This research enables materials with near-ideal strength by developing a fundamental understanding of dislocation nucleation and propagation as rate-limiting deformation mechanisms in nanostructured alloys where defect confinement and interaction with grain boundary and lattice solutes act as local barriers to plasticity. Specific research questions to be answered include: (i) what are the important transition states and associated energy barriers for dislocation nucleation at solute-decorated interfaces and for propagation within a nanoscale alloy crystal, (ii) how does interfacial structure and energy variation upon doping alter dislocation nucleation/propagation, and (iii) how do solute atoms inside the grain, which can potentially act as local pinning points but also alter the properties of the lattice, influence dislocation propagation? A practical hypothesis of this research is that the strength of nanocrystalline alloys can be maximized by synergistic doping to stabilize the grain boundaries against local plasticity and delay defect nucleation while simultaneously inhibiting dislocation propagation through the nanograin interiors. Using a combination of atomistic modeling, multi-modal structural characterization, and unique micromechanical testing, this hypothesis is being tested in nanostructured aluminum and copper alloys, where their intrinsically different stacking fault energies will provide access to different confined slip events. In a broad sense, this research will define new strengthening paradigms in nanoengineered metallic materials and establish the mechanistic underpinnings of solute-biased interfacial energy landscapes for understanding fundamental dislocation physics in confined slip environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent transition to ?clean? energy technology has stimulated research in alternative energy sources and associated research and development of electrocatalytic processes for both chemical manufacturing and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  To those ends, the project explores the design of bimetallic alloy electrocatalysts for two critical nitrogen reactions ? ammonia synthesis and nitric acid reduction.  In particular, this Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project provides an opportunity for the early-career researcher to further investigate a novel alloy catalyst design approach ? selective step decoration ? advanced by his research group.  Such improved catalysts will expand the scale and scope with which electrocatalysis can replace traditional processes, while also supporting related educational and outreach activities focused on K-12 students.<br/> <br/>Selective step decoration involves the electrochemical deposition of one type of metal atom selectively onto step-edges on the surface of another metal. This yields a surface which exposes bimetallic surface sites, as on a bulk bimetallic alloy, but with a known structure and composition, and on top of a pure metal substrate. The goal of this ERI project is to expand the selective step decoration technique into a novel method capable of synthesizing a wide variety of multi-metallic surface alloy catalysts, and to use these catalysts, with their well-defined and simpler structure, as a model testbed to understand how alloy composition dictates catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity.  Achieving the promise of selective step decorated bimetallic alloy electrocatalysts requires that two needs be addressed: (1) synthesis techniques must be developed that can directly control both alloy composition and structure at the catalyst surface, and (2) simple design rules must be created that relate performance of the alloy catalyst to its structure and composition.  To overcome these limitations, two primary objectives will be pursued using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) computational modeling and experiments on single-crystal electrodes having a well-defined surface structure.  Those objectives are: (1) identify the driving forces for ad-atom deposition, dissolution (corrosion), and segregation as a function of ad-atom/substrate pair across a variety of substrates to understand alloy stability in operando, and (2) identify simple descriptors (properties of the pure components) and the general rules which govern alloy catalytic activity and selectivity as a function of ad-atom/substrate pairs.  Determining the conditions for a particular ad-atom's favorable deposition on, dissolution from, or segregation with a particular substrate will identify specific pairs of ad-atoms/substrates for which selective step decoration is possible.  Additionally, the study will reveal insights into how the stability of an alloy differs from that of its pure components. With DFT, the driving forces for deposition, dissolution, and segregation will be quantified, to enable the prediction of surface alloy stability in the electrochemical environment for any pair of metals.  By using the same well-defined, step-decorated surface alloys to measure the activity and selectivity of a particular set of reactions (nitrogen and nitric oxide reduction) in combination with DFT modeling, the properties of each alloy component (e.g., d-band center, work function, and the hotly debated potential of zero charge) that dictate alloy catalyst performance will be determined.  Whether the governing rules that limit pure single metal catalysts, such as adsorbate scaling relations, hold true for alloys will also be determined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, challenges in quantifying and communicating the holistic social, environmental, and economic impacts and benefits of wastewater management strategies can prevent the implementation of such initiatives. This IRES Track I program will take place in Costa Rica, where 66% of the septic tank sludge is not treated properly before disposal and 86% of the wastewater connected to sanitary sewers receives limited to no treatment prior to discharge. Contamination caused by untreated wastewater jeopardizes Costa Rica?s national economy, which is dependent on ecotourism. Consequently, this program will provide 18 U.S. students from West Virginia University, University of South Florida, and California State University, Chico with an international and interdisciplinary research experience in engineering and anthropology over the course of three years. Students will use both social science and engineering methods to improve the long-term sustainability of sanitation systems in small communities using triple-bottom line (social, environmental, and economic) decision making strategies for wastewater management. Students will develop interdisciplinary skills and competencies while addressing global sanitation challenges in the socioeconomic and cultural context of rapidly urbanizing cities in Costa Rica. Along with increased participation of students from underrepresented groups, this program will contribute to training a diverse U.S. workforce to address environmental issues of global significance. The program will strengthen and expand the partnership between collaborators in the U.S. and Costa Rica to facilitate progress toward safe management of wastewater and integrated resource recovery in a sustainable and culturally appropriate way.<br/><br/>This IRES Track I program will provide 18 U.S. students from West Virginia University, University of South Florida, and California State University, Chico with an international and interdisciplinary research experience to solve complex sanitation challenges in the ecotourism community of Santa Elena, Costa Rica. This three-year research experience is motivated by the following driving objectives: develop convergent knowledge at the intersection of environmental engineering and anthropology; provide U.S. students the opportunity to develop interdisciplinary global skills and competencies; and facilitate safe management of wastewater and integrated recovery of resources in Costa Rica. The intellectual merit of this project stems from interdisciplinary research combining the fields of environmental engineering and anthropology to address issues of global importance in a sustainable and culturally appropriate way. This convergent research will spur the development of global skills and competencies and will facilitate safe management of wastewater and recovery of resources in Costa Rica. In this IRES program, undergraduate and graduate students will receive training and skill development in water quality testing, life cycle assessment, life cycle cost analysis, and qualitative and quantitative social science data collection and analysis. Students will work in multidisciplinary teams to engage a wide range of local stakeholders to identify and assess sustainability metrics relevant to small wastewater treatment integrating resource recovery to support decision-making in the sanitation sector. Students will assess triple-bottom line (social, environmental, and economic) sustainability metrics and use multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to improve the long-term sustainability of sanitation systems. A new MCDA tool will be developed based on the social, environmental and economic context of Central America. The tool will allow wastewater utilities in small communities serving populations of less than 10,000 to compare performance across multiple criteria for alternate solutions at decentralized, semi-centralized and centralized scales of implementation. IRES students will develop interdisciplinary skills and competencies while addressing global sanitation challenges in the socioeconomic and cultural context of Costa Rica. This, along with increased participation of students from underrepresented groups, will contribute to training a diverse U.S. workforce. The program will strengthen and expand the partnership between collaborators in the U.S. and Costa Rica to facilitate progress toward safe management of wastewater and integrated resource recovery in Costa Rica.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Psychology is the science of behavior and application of the resulting knowledge to help solve individual and societal problems. The current lack of scientists from diverse backgrounds hinders innovation and problem-solving in the field. The MB3 Program at Emory University will address this issue by providing mentorship, research training, and early career support to undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. MB3 will focus on students who would like to pursue interdisciplinary graduate training in psychology but lack resources at their home institution. Specifically, this REU program will (a) identify undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds across the nation who are at institutions without psychology graduate training programs to (b) be trained by leading experts, in completing interdisciplinary psychological research from start to finish, and (c) help prepare them for graduate level training and psychology related careers. The goal of the MB3 Program is to increase the diversity of perspectives on important individual and societal problems that we look to solve as a field by creating a pipeline of talented and diverse undergraduate students to become the next generation of psychologists. <br/><br/>Each year, 10 junior or senior undergraduate students will be selected to participate in a year-long, paid research experience to work with a mentor to execute a research project in one of four areas (i.e., developmental, cognitive and computational, behavioral and systems neuroscience, and clinical science). During the Spring Workshop, students engage in a 10-week virtual seminar to learn about the program mentors, the basics of conducting research, and refine their interests. Upon completion of the Spring Workshop, students begin their 10-week, in-person summer research program at Emory University with their assigned mentor. During this period students engage full-time in research and professional development activities. By the end of this hands-on experience, students will have produced an interdisciplinary, basic science research project. Topics include the genetics influences of compulsive behaviors, biological mechanisms of social behavior in rodents, primate models of auditory cognitive control, and human adjustment and resilience, to name a few. Students will build competency in research methods, data science, ethics, and career development. During the Fall Workshop, the final phase of the program, students will meet with their mentor virtually to build strong graduate school applications. Overall, these opportunities will build capacity in behavioral science by increasing the number of psychological scientists from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research includes collection and analysis of lake sediment cores from Touson Lake, an oxbow located 2 km west of the site. Identification of the contents provides useful data for inferring human impacts that can be applied at a wide range of situations, yielding useful information without methods that are destructive to sites. Furthermore, understanding how societies responded to past climate change and/or local environmental degradation is important for understanding how challenges of the 21st century might impact populations. Included are sharing of results with the Moundville Archaeological Park Museum and sharing monthly updates to federally recognized Tribal Nations with several representatives of which are involved with both sampling and interpreting the data. This project also trains one graduate and two undergraduate students at multiple universities in a multi-disciplinary setting.<br/><br/>Combined archaeological and paleoenvironmental studies demonstrate that humans are in direct and constant interaction with their environment. While there is considerable information about climate-environment-human interactions for cultures in central and South America, there is a lack of such information for Mississippian mound-building societies in North America. This project addresses two overarching research questions: 1) did environmental conditions influence shifts in population and agriculture at Moundville? and 2) did environmental changes create stresses that caused eventual site abandonment? To answer these questions, sediment cores from Touson Lake  are analyzed for: 1) stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in organic matter, 2) grain size distribution, 3) magnetic susceptibility, 4) charcoal particles, 5) pollen assemblages, 6) cyanobacteria pigments, and 7) fecal sterols, all of which indicate past environmental conditions. Compilation of existing archaeological literature on the demography of the local and regional populations are compiled and representatives of Muskogean-speaking tribes affiliated with Moundville contribute to data interpretation with their indigenous traditions and culture histories associated with the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding these soft materials, which often possess both fluid-like and solid-like properties, and how they flow or deform is necessary for advancing many technologies, including 3D printing where the properties of the ink or resin must be finely tuned. To make progress on our scientific understanding of soft materials, this IRES Track I project will strengthen collaborations between researchers in Southern California and in Mexico. Each year over the 3-year duration of this project, 6 students will be recruited to take part in this international research experience. U.S. students from historically underrepresented groups and from predominantly undergraduate colleges and community colleges will be targeted in the recruitment effort. Those students will conduct research over the summer at either the Center for Research in Advanced Materials (Centro de Investigación en Materiales Avanzados, CIMAV) in Monterrey, Mexico or the University of Guanajuato in León, Mexico. Working with research mentors in Mexico and the mentors in Southern California, students will take various approaches to study the physics and chemistry of soft materials. Such approaches include using computer simulations to study fundamental aspects of soft materials and using 3D printers to apply our scientific understanding of soft materials to the design and use of new inks and resins. Students taking part in this research and receiving mentorship from U.S. and Mexican scientists will be prepared to cooperate with diverse teams across borders and to become leaders of a globally engaged scientific workforce. <br/><br/>This IRES project will strengthen collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and Mexico by supporting the participation of 6 undergraduates per year in mentored summer research experiences. The PIs at the University of San Diego and California State University Fullerton will recruit undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups and from predominantly undergraduate institutions and community colleges. After receiving training on basic research skills, selected students will spend approximately 8 weeks at either the Center for Research in Advanced Materials (Centro de Investigación en Materiales Avanzados, CIMAV) in Monterrey, Mexico or the University of Guanajuato in León, Mexico. Research projects undertaken by students will advance our understanding of soft matter, particularly in the areas of colloid science and rheology. Projects will include investigating the rheology of nanocellulose and cellulose composites for use in 3D printing applications, quantifying the translational and rotational diffusion of anisotropic colloids to better understand transport and microrheology in complex environments, and developing computer simulations of colloidal particles in external fields. These projects will lead to new analysis techniques in microrheology and optical microscopy and will advance the development of inks for 3D printing. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) train and mentor 18 (6 students per year for 3 years) undergraduate students on soft matter research in a collaborative and international environment, (2) develop and foster research collaborations among institutions in the U.S. and Mexico, (3) characterize and harness the rheological properties of complex fluids and gels for enhancing our fundamental knowledge of soft matter and for applying such materials to 3D printing applications, (4) disseminate research outcomes at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals, and (5) develop a cohort of scientists from predominantly underrepresented groups who can network and collaborate effectively with others from various backgrounds and who can draw upon a diverse set of mentors. IRES participants will advance scientific knowledge in projects that range from applied to fundamental using experimental and computational approaches. Students will learn how these diverse approaches used by an international team can address pressing scientific and engineering problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improving the success of all students, particularly those from traditionally marginalized backgrounds, is critical to increasing diversity in the sciences. To address this, the project will train STEM faculty in the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which are known to support student learning. A Faculty Learning Community (FLC) will train instructors to design course activities using UDL Principles and then use surveys to measure the extent to which they are used in their teaching practice. These will be correlated with implementation and student outcomes, including a) academic success, b) interest in the sciences, and c) a sense of belonging in introductory science courses. Academic data will be collected from courses faculty teach before, during, and after their participation in the FLC, for up to three years. Students' interest and sense of belonging will be measured with surveys. Differences in the outcomes of different demographic groups to determine the efficacy and equity of UDL Principles will be identified. The FLC model for learning about and implementing UDL is expected to improve student outcomes in science courses, which can be adopted at other institutions in the future.<br/><br/>The goal of this pilot project is to offer multiple cohorts of a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) to train and guide faculty to implement Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Principles in introductory science and math courses at two HSIs. The research question is, ?How are students? academic and affective success impacted by faculty use of Universal Design for Learning Principles in introductory science and math courses?? Measurement of the extent to which faculty and students report that faculty have implemented UDL principles will be correlated to student success in their courses before, during and after the FLC. Student success will be determined with academic measures (course DFW rates) and affective measures using surveys (student interest in STEM, sense of belonging, and value of UDL-based activities). A determination of the extent to which UDL Principles support equity in courses by identifying any differences in student outcomes (academic and affect) among different demographic groups will be conducted. It is expected that integration of UDL Principles will benefit a vast majority of students academically, that courses will become more equitable (as evidenced by decreased equity gaps), and that students, particularly those from traditionally minoritized backgrounds, will demonstrate increased affective gains. The investigation of the implementation of evidence-based professional development is particularly important, given declining enrollments, high DFW rates and equity gaps, and the current lack of culturally responsive pedagogical practices in STEM courses. Dissemination of the results of this project can be used to inspire broader adaptation of the UDL-FLC model at other institutions. This will inform future STEM faculty professional and potentially non-STEM faculty of development activities. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its importance, it has traditionally been difficult to define and study rigorously. One important element of creativity seems to involve defying other?s expectations, by contributing something surprising or novel. Within psychology and neuroscience, robust methods exist for studying how the brain prepares for expected events but then responds to the unexpected. Until now, those methods have not been harnessed to study human creativity. In this set of experiments, participants either create and evaluate fictional stories in response to music or generate melodies with an easy-to-use computer interface and then evaluate them for creativity. Natural language processing and musical information retrieval tools are used to identify the uniqueness or the expectation-defying features of stories and sequences; neuroscience tools are incorporated to understand precisely how violations of expectations arise and contribute to creative outputs. The resultant model should help shape scientific knowledge about how to foster the human potential for innovation. <br/> <br/>The linkage between innovation and expectation-violation will be explored within three major aims: 1) To relate the ability to produce imagined stories and melodies to measures of individual differences in creativity; 2) To relate the perception of creativity to the fulfillment and violations of expectations as defined by the information content of imagined stories and melodies; and 3) To relate neural markers of creativity and innovation to expectancy violations using electroencephalography. The proposed research activities dovetail with plans to develop a course on Music and the Brain that brings together underrepresented students from Psychology, Neuroscience, and Music.

The project carries themes of social networks, behavioral interactions, and cutting-edge analytical approaches over to the educational side by developing a new educational tool to improve data science education and workforce development for biology students as well as providing structured mentoring opportunities for recently-graduated students as a pathway to graduate school and networked peer mentoring opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding how power, support, and information interact within dynamic social system is crucial to predicting how these systems evolve, collapse, and thrive in group-living species as well as the connections between sociality and cognition. The proposed work aims to fill gaps in the current state of knowledge of animal sociality by systematically manipulating power, support, and information in groups of captive monk parakeets. This research tests the central hypothesis that power, support, and information are essential factors in explaining social dynamics in socially and cognitively complex species. In Aim 1, a 2x2 experimental design will be used to manipulate support and information in captive parakeet groups to test for independent and combined effects of support and information on power dynamics. In Aim 2, information will be manipulated using experimental group fission-fusions to evaluate how birds react to a lack of information with information-gathering behaviors. In Aim 3, agent-based models will be used to test how variation in cognitive skills and information use affects power dynamics, social resiliency, and recovery speed more generally across species. In the Educational Plan, this research on animal sociality will be integrated with education using the ?Sociality Game?, an online multiplayer game which uses engaging questions about animal sociality to teach students quantitative analyses, the fundamentals of data science, and R coding skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To improve the cell lifetime, it is important to understand the relationship between the area between the anode and the electrode, the interphase region, and the electrochemical performance of zinc metal anode prior to the design stages. In this Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project, the PI and his research group will study the evolution of this interphase and its effect on the zinc anode performance during cell operation. The project will provide critical scientific knowledge to develop advanced aqueous batteries for maintaining and advancing US battery technology leadership. The multidisciplinary research project will provide ample educational and outreach opportunities for high school, undergraduate, M.S. and Ph.D. students, including those from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>This ERI research project seeks to advance fundamental knowledge of the aqueous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) evolution driven by SEI defects and an electron approachable thickness. A close integration of experimental and modeling approaches based on pyrazole-based containing aqueous electrolytes will be used to study key factors that impact SEI formation and to confirm the effect of the SEI?s defects and thickness. Other unique elements of the research project include 1) identifying the morphology and chemical compositions of zinc anode SEI as a function of aqueous pH value, temperature and cell cycling time using surface characterizations, 2) determining the mechanism of Zn2+ cation transport through the SEI using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in addition to SEI morphology and chemical information, 3) identifying the dependence of zinc metallic dendrite formation/growth and mechanical degradation of the SEI on the cycling history using scanning electron microscopy, nanoindentation and a coupled electrochemical-mechanical multiphysics modeling framework, and 4) identifying the favorable reaction pathways of aqueous SEI formation/evolution using DFT calculations combined with the electro?chemo?mechanical information of the SEI obtained in the first three tasks. Through this project, the PI will catalyze new research partnerships (both with internal and external collaborators) and extend the research group?s capabilities in both theoretical modeling and advanced characterization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is anticipated that the developed synthetic tools will improve access to a range of molecules that could serve as a platform for the discovery of novel therapeutics against a variety of cancer types. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the benefits accrued to society as Professor Stoltz and his team engage in an extensive assortment of educational and outreach activities intended to promote interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) among K-12 students and to widen participation in scientific disciplines by students belonging to groups that have been historically underrepresented.

Notwithstanding the recognized value of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids, a sufficiently rapid and general approach to these polycyclic molecules that may enable analogue development and the synthesis of new congeners is as yet unrealized. The funded project focuses on the development of two palladium-catalyzed methods that are designed to address this deficiency while also improving access to other important target molecules, namely: (1) a Larock/Buchwald?Hartwig cascade process that facilitates biannulations and rapid increases in structural complexity from simple precursors, and (2) a transition metal-catalyzed spirocyclization reaction. The total synthesis of representative pyrroloiminoquinones, including makaluvamines A and F and sanguinone B, as well as other indole alkaloids, such as indolactam V, will be pursued to demonstrate the utility of the developed methods and to evaluate their scope. In addition, the second method will be studied more generally for the synthesis of novel heteroatom-containing spirocycles and enantioselective variants of this technology will be investigated. It is anticipated that the funded project will lead to fundamental advances in the practice of transition metal-based organic synthesis while improving access to a class of alkaloids that are a potentially rich source of lead compounds for the development of new clinical candidates.

The Haley group examines the optical, electronic, and/or magnetic properties of all new molecular scaffolds with an emphasis upon utilization of these materials in optoelectronic devices such as organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).

It can promote public efforts to protect the biodiversity and livelihood of communities around the world. Yet, K-12 students have limited opportunities to engage in inclusive science communication approaches that incorporate their lived experiences and account for the diverse socioeconomic, language, and cultural backgrounds of potential audiences. This project will engage high school students from predominantly Latinx, Title I schools in Orange County, California, in an AI-guided science curriculum for learning and practicing inclusive science communication and marine biodiversity. Students will interact with conversational agents that represent different community perspectives around the local marine ecosystems. They will also collaborate with peers to train and create their own conversational agents to share views on marine conservation. Project activities aim to offer meaningful engagement to deepen students? understanding of science communication, AI literacy, and interest in careers in AI and broader science fields. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>In partnership with Crystal Cove Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit in Orange County, California, the project will invite students, formal and informal educators, community members, and marine scientists to co-design the conversational agents? interface and exchange. The project team will interview additional community members to integrate their perspectives to refine the agents? dialogues. 90 students in grades 9-11 will engage in the AI-guided curriculum. Researchers in STEM education and education technologies from University of California, Irvine and Utah State University will explore research questions surrounding Equitable Partnership and Learning including (1) How can the co-design and implementation of conversational agents with informal educators, community partners, and students be facilitated in equitable, collaborative ways?, (2) How does the AI-integrated curriculum support inclusive science communication about environmental systems, interest in STEM careers, and AI literacy?, and (3) What instructional adaptations do teachers make to facilitate these learning outcomes? The project will draw from equity-centered research-practice partnership and design tension frameworks to answer research questions around how to facilitate equitable design work and adapt the curriculum in instruction. Regression analyses will be used to test the hypothesis that students significantly improve in science communication, interest in STEM careers, and AI literacy, as indicated by pre- and post-assessments.

This project will update DNA Subway 2.0 as a more flexible, accessible, and capable resource to prepare students for the modern bioscience workforce. By adopting a ?mobile-first? approach, it is expected that this will be the only set of high-level bioinformatics tools to run smoothly on a smartphone. Integrating new tools for Nanopore sequencing and data science will provide a coordinated package for anywhere/anytime DNA sequence analysis?putting community college students at the cutting edge of the bioscience big data revolution.<br/><br/>The project will be led by the DNA Learning Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which is the designated Genomics Hub of the InnovATEBIO National Biotechnology Education Center. An advisory board of bioinformatics industry experts and faculty from diverse two-year institutions will ensure that DNA Subway 2.0 is workforce ready.  The redeveloped resource will rely on NSF?s Jetstream2 cloud computing infrastructure, with systems expertise provided by the Texas Advanced Computing Center and NSF?s Science Gateways Community Institute. A mentor network will disseminate DNA Subway 2.0 at professional meetings and summer workshops?at least half of which will be conducted at minority-serving institutions.

Different stakeholders in these environments, including both direct users of smart devices and non-users such as visitors or bystanders, have unique privacy needs and expectations. Although prior research shows evidence of conflicts among stakeholders, there has been less investigation regarding how stakeholders resolve such conflicts and negotiate their privacy options. This interdisciplinary project is investigating different stakeholders? privacy negotiation behaviors in smart environments by designing, developing, and deploying an interactive system to collect people?s real-world privacy negotiation behaviors. The project is contributing solutions that help people manage and negotiate their privacy in various smart environments, especially when their privacy needs conflict with others?. The results will also inform privacy negotiations within other emerging technologies (e.g., virtual reality and the metaverse).<br/><br/><br/>This project moves beyond the lab setting to investigate and support stakeholders? privacy negotiation behaviors in real-world smart environments. To do this, the project team is identifying contextual factors that lead to privacy concerns across multiple stakeholder groups and complex smart environments through the lens of privacy as ?contextual integrity?. It is capturing stakeholders? privacy negotiation behaviors in the real world by iteratively designing and implementing a tool that collects data on smart environmental contexts and privacy negotiation behaviors in real-world smart environments. Finally, it is developing a data-driven approach to support privacy negotiations in the real-world and evaluating its long-term impact on different stakeholder groups through field studies.

The project will use open-source software (OSS) projects to engage students in real software engineering scenarios, entirely online. The project will expand knowledge about how to leverage an authentic OSS project as a learning environment and how to engage learners in the activities, particularly learners from historically disenfranchised groups in STEM. In addition, the project will advance knowledge about the feasibility of devising a structured learning path that begins with non-code contributions (e.g., documentation, typo corrections, translations) and that evolves to other types of contributions. The project will design an online learning environment where individuals make initial non-code contributions, acclimate to the open-source contribution model, and establish a relationship with the OSS community. This environment will promote scaffolding to those wishing to delve deeper into learning to make code-based and other technical contributions, and help students build a professional resumé based on OSS contributions.<br/> <br/>A portal called the OSS-Doorway will be developed as part of this project, focusing on non-programmer learners. These learners will be able to explore the open-source environment and understand different project elements and their roles in the open-source contribution process. Within this informal learning environment, the project will engage a broad range of students as non-code contributors who will gain knowledge about the open-source contribution model. Improving the skills of non-code contributors will also support the sustainability of OSS projects. The first phase of this project will focus on the feasibility of OSS-Doorway to support learning of the open-source contribution model. The methods used in this phase will be participatory design, observational studies, and student surveys. In the second phase, the project will seek to understand how OSS-Doorway supports the learning of students who come from groups historically disenfranchised in STEM. The project team will apply an adapted version of the GenderMag inspection method to assess how the proposed solution supports diverse populations. The team will also employ observational studies and surveys with students and analyze the data in a manner that considers student demographic characteristics and lived experiences. As such, this project will provide inclusive strategies for teaching the open-source contribution process. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to establish general principles that govern the sequence of photorelease of reactive intermediates by sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Sulfoximines are one of the few classes of compounds that are capable of undergoing dual-release photochemistry, and this project is expected to establish which properties regulate the sequence of release. By providing a basis to control the sequence of photorelease, this project is expected to facilitate the development of dual-release photochemistry for uses in biochemical assays and phototherapies. Summer research opportunities and events promoting scientific career options for high school students from underrepresented groups will also be part of the funded project.<br/><br/>The generation of two different reactive intermediates from a single chromophore is a rare occurrence in photochemistry. One of the few examples is the release of nitrenes and atomic oxygen from dibenzothiophene sulfoximines upon irradiation with light. The scarcity of systems capable of undergoing dual-release photochemistry means there is no conceptual framework to predict which properties will control the sequence of release. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to establish the general principles that govern dual-release photochemistry by investigating the photochemistry of thiophene-based sulfoximines. Specifically, the effect of modulating the bond dissociation energies and the excited state properties on the sequence of release will be interrogated with computational and spectroscopic methods. The second important objective of this proposal is to test the generality of the proposed framework by examining if the principles observed for sulfoximines can predict the sequence of release for sulfondiimines. The intriguing potential of dual-release photochemistry arises from the proximity that two reactive intermediates can be produced, which is expected to allow two transient intermediates to combine to form new intermediates that are inaccessible by other means.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integration of atmospheric pressure plasmas with heterogeneous catalysts (plasma catalysis) has recently gained considerable attention because of its potential to carry out transformations that are difficult or impossible using conventional thermal catalysis, and in modular units powered by renewable electricity. Realization of this potential would lead to more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable chemical processes. Nitrogen activation in particular has attracted substantial interest in the plasma catalysis community because of the ability of plasma to activate the strong dinitrogen triple bond. Preliminary work in the O?Brien lab suggests that the types of adsorbed nitrogen species relevant to plasma catalysis may be richer than previously thought. This project focuses on clarifying the nature and reactivity of plasma-generated nitrogen species using spectroscopic techniques developed in the O?Brien lab and computational approaches in the Schneider lab. The theory-informed spectroscopic approach and proof-of-concept catalytic examples will broadly impact both catalysis science and technology. This research will also enhance advanced scientific education through training of graduate students in experimental and computational research, communication, scientific rigor, and the ethical conduct of research.<br/><br/>This proposal explores a strategy to access, stabilize, and concentrate metastable intermediates that are thermally inaccessible by coupling plasma and surface chemistry, and to exploit these metastable species for novel surface reactions. Casey O?Brien and William Schneider will collaboratively explore these concepts in the context of nitrogen activation. Recent unpublished work in the O?Brien lab suggests that metastable azides, or N3, are stabilized by metal surfaces during exposure to N2 plasmas. While preliminary experiments indicate that LTP(low temperature plasma)-exposed metal surfaces can accommodate metastable N3 species, there are many fundamental science questions that remain unanswered: (i) What is the identity (N2, N3, or other) and nature of this species? (ii) Is this species formed in the plasma first and subsequently trapped by the metal surface, or does the surface facilitate its formation? (iii) How reactive are these surface-adsorbed species towards other reactants? This project will address these fundamental science questions to develop strategies to exploit metastable species generally, and azides specifically, to drive chemical transformations that cannot be achieved by conventional thermal catalysis or plasma alone. To this end, this project integrates experimental and computational approaches to clarify the mechanisms by which atmospheric pressure plasmas couple with solid surfaces to access and stabilize metastable N3 species and explore the potential to exploit these metastable states to drive novel reactions. The work leverages state-of-the-art in-situ spectroscopy techniques developed in the O?Brien, and density functional theory calculations that predict the relationship between surface composition, structure, products, and reactivity, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and guiding experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Figueroa of the University of California, San Diego will study how the chemistry and behavior of main-group elements can be controlled and modulated by transition metal compounds featuring isocyanide supporting groups. The isocyanide supporting groups used in the context of this project provide a protective shield for the chemical interactions between the transition metal and main-group elements. This shield, in turn, allows for the preparation and isolation of molecules that are usually unstable and difficult to obtain. A specific focus of this award is to use iron isocyanide compounds to study and understand the fundamental properties and chemical reactivity of the diatomic molecules boron monofluoride (BF) and diphosphorus. Boron monofluoride, as a free molecule, is not stable under ambient conditions on account of the extreme bonding polarization. Similarly, diphosphorus, unlike its lighter analogue dinitrogen, is also not a stable molecule under normal conditions, preferring instead to condense into polyphosphorus solid materials. With the advent of the m-terphenyl isocyanide supporting groups, stable molecules containing both BF and diphosphorus have been prepared. In the course of this award, detailed investigations into the fundamental nature of BF and diphosphorus will be conducted. These investigations seek to provide answers to basic questions, including 1) how do metal-bound BF and diphosphorus react with other molecules, 2) how do BF and diphosphorus influence the chemical behavior on the metals to which they are bound and, 3) how does the reactivity of metal-bound BF and diphosphorus compare to that of the free, yet unstable, molecules? This project will also focus on the preparation and characterization of other transition-metal-supported main-group element species, with a specific emphasis on generating other unusual or unknown diatomic molecules. The broader impacts activities will include student research training and mentoring, the development of a hands-on laboratory safety course for incoming graduate students, and mentorship of transfer students.<br/><br/>This project will specifically focus on the synthesis and reactivity of unusual main-group fragments stabilized by transition-metal m-terphenyl isocyanide complexes. Building on recent reports disclosing the synthesis of an iron terminal boron monofluoride (BF) complex, and a mononuclear diphosphorus complex of iron, detailed investigations will be conducted that aim to elucidate the reactivity of these unusual diatomic ligands with exogenous substrates as well as their specific influence on the transition metal centers to which they are bound. For the terminal BF complex specifically, synthetic studies will be conducted that aim to expand on the pronounced electrophilicity of the boron center, while at the same time detailing reaction profiles that result in the cleavage of the BF unit en route to other metal-boron complexes. In the case of the mononuclear diphosphorus iron complex, its side-on binding mode presents the opportunity to expound upon the fundamental periodic diagonal relationship between phosphorus and carbon. Accordingly, reactivity studies will be conducted that aim to compare and contrast the reactivity of metal-stabilized diphosphorus with that of acetylene and other substituted alkynes. Specific to these efforts will be an assessment of the scope of Diels-Alder-type reactivity between side-on coordinated diphosphorus and organic dienes. In addition, based on preliminary evidence, the electrophilic character of the side-on coordinated diphosphorus with a range of nucleophilic substrates will be evaluated. In parallel to investigations into the nature of BF and diphosphorus coordinated to iron, other low-valent transition metal m-terphenyl isocyanide complexes will be prepared and/or studied with respect to their ability to stabilize unusual main-group fragments, with a focus on the preparation of other unstable or unknown diatomic molecules, especially of the heavier p-block elements. An additional emphasis will be placed on the synthesis of BF complexes of other transition metals in an effort to test electronic structure hypotheses on the factors, electronic environment(s) and conditions that are required to stabilize this reactive diatomic molecule.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zintl phases are compounds composed of metallic elements but have the properties of a semiconductor. This type of material has potentially excellent thermoelectric properties. Less expensive thermoelectric materials could alter the world?s energy landscape by converting waste heat into usable electricity and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. The energy conversion efficiency of a material requires low electrical resistivity like a metal and low thermal conductivity as in an insulator. The unique combination of composition and structure of Zintl phases can give rise to exceptional thermoelectric properties that can be further optimized by systematic substitution of individual elements. This project develops new structures and optimizes properties toward high efficiency thermoelectric materials. A new course for graduate students focused on resiliency, mental health and well-being is developed and assessed during the time of this award. This project also trains young scientists in structure determination and property measurements along with thermoelectric design and optimization.

This project, with support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, provides new Zintl phase compounds via flux and direct synthesis and characterizes their properties with a goal of discovering new thermoelectric materials. Compounds with promising properties are then further optimized for their thermoelectric efficiency and provide new directions of research for the scientific community. Goals include the the synthesis of new compounds that have not yet been investigated and, e.g. morphological optimization of Zintl phases. Two-dimensional (layered) and one-dimensional (chain) containing phases are synthesized and their properties characterized. The properties of these new phases will be enhanced with alio- and iso-valent substitution towards better thermoelectric behavior. Graduate and undergraduate students learn a suite of physical characterization techniques and how to correlate structure and phase composition with electronic and thermal transport properties. In collaboration with the UC Davis graduate division, a mental wellness and scientific resiliency course is taught and assessed during the timeframe of this award.

However, state-of-the-art approaches have only been able to extract part of the precipitation information from the multi-dimensional polarimetric radar data. This research will open new horizons for radar remote sensing of precipitation through developing explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques which can extract the rich information from radar data to improve the understanding of complex precipitation processes and atmospheric dynamics in different precipitation environments. The AI methods developed from this project can potentially be applied to the nationwide operational weather radars and many research radars in the United States and worldwide, thus can advance weather, water, and climate science and service. In addition to the training of undergraduate and graduate students, the planned educational activities are spread across multiple high schools in Northern Colorado, with instruction and field trips aimed at introducing high school students to weather observations and AI applications and instilling a desire to pursue STEM careers. The integration of research and educational activities can foster the next generation of scientists who will be familiar with both AI and meteorology fields.<br/><br/>To achieve the scientific goals, this project focuses on: 1) investigating physics-guided AI models for hydrometeor identification and precipitation microphysics retrievals from polarimetric radar observations; 2) designing a dense convolutional neural network framework that has high generalization capability for radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation; 3) developing an interpretable AI model for precipitation nowcasting and investigating the controlling factors on storm initiation, growth and decay, which are poorly understood.

A noncommutative algebra is a mathematical concept that encodes such a phenomenon, and the subject of noncommutative algebra naturally has many applications in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, string theory, and so on. The study of noncommutativity has become more and more common in modern science and technology. For example, a quantum group is equivalent to a Hopf algebra whose underlying algebraic structure is noncommutative and/or whose underlying coalgebraic structure is noncocommutative. The study of noncommutative algebras is both important and challenging. In many cases, noncommutative algebras arise as noncommutative analogues and generalizations of classical objects coming from other fields such as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and Lie theory. To understand the structure of noncommutative algebras, the PI will investigate invariants that are defined by homological means. These invariants capture hidden structures and symmetries of noncommutative algebras. This research project combines ideas and methodology from several areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, linear algebra, homological algebra, and combinatorics. The proposed research activities will make contributions to teaching, undergraduate and graduate student training, and outreach.<br/> <br/>A major part of the project concerns homological invariants such as Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, Tor-regularity, and Artin-Schelter regularity for connected graded algebras. A weighted version of homological regularities with an extra parameter will also be introduced that incorporates different classical homological concepts. This is a new research direction in noncommutative algebra with connections to representation theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and noncommutative invariant theory. The PI will investigate and prove homological identities involving these invariants for connected graded algebras and their associated categories, and thus expand the foundations for this theory. One particular sub-project is the classification of non-Artin-Schelter regular algebras that are close to being Artin-Schelter regular. In addition this project concerns other active research topics in noncommutative algebra: the automorphism problem, the cancellation problem, operad theory, and noncommutative discriminants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In democracies, governments often provide greater welfare and redistribution to compensate groups harmed by globalization?s impact. In non-democracies without well established interest group representation, however, much less is known about how globalization affects both government provision of welfare and protests driven by globalization-induced inequalities. This project seeks to understand when foreign investment in authoritarian countries increases government redistribution and how both international production chains and local government policies drive or deter protests. The findings of the project will help to better understand how authoritarian governments adapt to globalization and the international business environment faced by multinational corporations operating abroad. <br/><br/>The project has two specific goals. The first goal is to identify the conditions under which economic globalization increases access to authoritarian redistribution. Using text-as-data techniques on government firm registration records and a representative survey of foreign-invested firms in a matching model for time-series cross-sectional data, the project disaggregates foreign direct investment to investigate the hypotheses that market orientation of foreign-funded firms drives the generosity of welfare redistribution through higher government spending, but skill-dependence of foreign firms determines who gains access to redistribution. The second goal is to identify the relationship between increased access to welfare redistribution and incidents of social unrest. Using time-series cross-sectional models on social media and non-governmental organization reports on social protests including labor and social justice protests, the project identifies not only how relative access to welfare redistribution relates to street protests, but also if expanded access to welfare decreases social unrest. The findings of the project will advance basic research on central questions relating to government policy responses to globalization, the relationship of globalization to social unrest, and the political economy of multi-national firms operating in authoritarian countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The isotope compositions of deep-earth minerals are controlled by a process named isotope fractionation, in which different isotopes redistribute between different minerals under various pressures and temperatures. There are three conventional ways to constrain equilibrium isotope fractionation in deep-earth minerals, namely theoretical calculation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear resonance scattering. However, each method has its own challenges. Theoretical calculation is limited by physical approximations used in the model and has to be benchmarked by experiments; mass spectroscopy has difficulty in determining the attainment of equilibrium and is time-consuming; and nuclear resonance scattering can only be applied to the few Mössbauer-active elements. This proposal describes a novel multidisciplinary study on the isotope fractionations of deep-earth minerals that are difficult to be constrained by conventional experimental approaches, through collaborative and synergetic efforts by combining state-of-the-art X-ray spectroscopy with theoretical calculations. The researcher's approach is experimentally benchmarked, time-efficient, directly reflects the equilibrium isotope fractionation, and can be applied to nearly all elements. They aim to answer the following questions with their proposed study: 1) How do the Mössbauer-inactive elements in deep-earth minerals redistribute with pressure, temperature, and crystal structure? 2) How to constrain the fractionation of Mössbauer-inactive elements in deep earth solid solutions efficiently? and 3) How does vibrational anharmonicity affect the isotope fractionation in mantle silicates? The project will support three early to mid-career researchers to continue their research at the University of Hawaii at Maona (Zhang and B. Chen) and Purdue University (M. Chen). Through this project, the team will develop both experimental instruments at a national user facility and open-source codes for computation, and the research suite will be available to domestic and international researchers in earth sciences and beyond. Undergraduate assistants and postdoc scholars will be involved in this project. This project is also committed to establishing the career development pathways for the involved early-career researchers, pushing for the gender and racial equality in geoscience, and broadening the participation in STEM of traditionally underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The fractionation of the isotopes of constituent elements of mantle minerals at high P-T conditions are considered the ramifications of the differentiation of the Earth, offering crucial clues for the mantle?s composition and chemical evolution. Previous studies on the isotope fractionation of Mössbauer-inactive elements between minerals were either measured using mass spectroscopy in which the attainment of equilibrium requires additional caution, or estimated from theoretical calculations without corroboration from experiments. The researchers have demonstrated that the reduced partition function ratio (?-factor) of tetracoordinated Si can be constrained by theoretical-calculation-calibrated in-situ high-T SXD experiments. In this proposed project, they will extend the method to determine experimentally constrained ?-factors of hexacoordinated Si in non-quenchable deep-earth minerals for the first time. They will also tackle challenges to establish an efficient approach to determine ?-factors in solid solutions by theoretical calculations, which are to be benchmarked by SXD experiments and thus allows them to investigate the isotope fractionation of hexacoordinated Ti in deep-earth minerals. Their proposed combined approach circumvents direct theoretical modeling of solid solutions, which significantly reduces computational costs. Using the combined approaches of experiments and theoretical modeling, the correction to Si ?-factor in hydrous phyllosilicates induced by the vibrational anharmonicity will be investigated. The proposed experimentally benchmarked machine learning framework to establish a highly accurate yet efficient model will allow them to provide reliable estimations of Si ?-factor in anharmonic mineral systems. Though they only propose to study select Mössbauer-inactive elements (Si & Ti) in this proposal, the same approach can be extended to other elements such as C, O, Mg, and Ca. All the three proposed tasks will build the foundation for a complete landscape of isotope distribution in mantle minerals, and will enhance understanding of the Earth?s isotopic composition and in turn its chemical evolution. This project is jointly funded by Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior (CSEDI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nightly news broadcasts and social media feeds often include imagery associated with poll results, economic projections, and people taking positions on various social issues. Much of that imagery communicates a particular set of cultural beliefs and values, and often in a very emotional or evocative manner. Although such ideologically-charged imagery is common, it is not clear that people view these images similarly. Past research has shown that a person?s own ideology (cultural beliefs and values they share with others) provides a psychological lens through which information is interpreted and conclusions drawn. Indeed, people can reach very different conclusions from the same information depending on their own ideological perspectives and their motivations to maintain them. This project tests whether people?s ideological values not only shape their judgments but also influence how they attend to and perceive visual information in the first place.<br/><br/>This research integrates many disciplines in the social and behavioral sciences, including social psychology and vision science, to test a model that accounts for how ideological threats affect early-stage attentional and perceptual processes. Across several contested societal issues, this work explores threat-based differences in how people visually represent information, examines attentional mechanisms underlying these processes, and demonstrates downstream consequences of threat-based misperceptions for emotion regulation and behavior. In concert, several studies explore early-stage attentional and perceptual processes that help regulate emotions (when efficacy is low) and promote defensive action (when efficacy is high). In an era in which people increasingly encounter visual information, studying how people perceive the information they encounter provides new insights into the processes that drive social behavior. Understanding how people perceive and interpret information contained in graphs and figures helps to improve educational curricula and the design of media literacy courses that aid individuals in evaluating and interpreting media messages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These glycolipids, which are referred to as phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), play essential roles in bacterial cellular defense, integrity, and immunological activity. While PIMs and related molecules are unique to the Corynebacterineae and contribute to these organisms? distinctive physiological and pathogenic characteristics, many aspects of how these glycolipids are constructed and organized in bacterial cells remain unknown. Such knowledge gaps remain because PIMs are challenging to study using traditional techniques and there is a lack of modern tools for analyzing them. This project seeks to develop new chemical biology tools to allow specific tagging and tracking of PIMs and related glycolipids in cellular contexts. Applications of this toolbox could provide a better understanding of how the Corynebacterineae construct their cell envelope. Undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow working on this research will acquire interdisciplinary training in organic synthesis, chemical biology, and microbiology. To promote interdisciplinary training and communication, students and postdocs at both institutions will meet regularly virtually to discuss the project. This project will be integrated into an outreach program to introduce community college students to chemical bacteriology research and to encourage their continued education in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The tools generated in this project are expected to be broadly applicable and support other scientists pursuing research on the Corynebacterineae.<br/><br/>Phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and their highly glycosylated derivatives, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), are difficult to investigate using traditional techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology because they consist of highly complex, non-genetically encoded lipids and sugars. To address this problem, this research project seeks to develop synthetic carbohydrate-based probes that exploit native and genetically engineered metabolic pathways to introduce chemical tags into PIMs, LM, and LAM in live bacteria. Fluorescently labeled glycolipid molecules will be tested in whole cells, potentially providing a means to track the glycolipids specifically in a cellular context. The probes developed in this project are expected to provide information on (i) the spatiotemporal dynamics of PIM, LM, and LAM construction in live bacterial cells; and (ii) the identity of the protein(s) that is/are responsible for transport of PIMs across the bacterial inner membrane. The findings from this project are expected to provide an improved understanding of glycolipid biosynthesis and dynamics, which could provide insight into the physiology of bacteria in the Corynebacterineae suborder.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experiments will define the detailed seismic structure of the PRT, advance our understanding of the PRT, and improve hazard assessment. The project consists of: (1) Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles using ocean bottom seismometers (OBS); (2) Seven multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, two parallel to and inland from the trench, and five across the trench. (3) An array of 100 short-period land nodal seismometers deployed across the Puerto Rico island.

The PRT is a highly oblique subduction zone, where old Atlantic plate subducts under the Caribbean plate at a slow rate. The PRT is associated with anomalous and unexplained characteristics, such as the widest trench (below 6,000 m), the lowest gravity anomaly on Earth, and anomalous subsidence of the north coast of Puerto Rico. This project will acquire, analyze, and interpret multiple types of data: Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles across the PRT with OBSs, with one of the lines extending to south of the Puerto Rico island and including an array of land nodal seismometers deployed across the Puerto Rico island; seven MCS reflection profiles, two parallel and five perpendicular to the PRT axis; and multibeam bathymetry, 3.5 kHz sub-bottom profiler, gravity, and magnetics. The experiments are designed to address three key questions: (1) What is the shallow geometry of the subducting slab and its lateral continuity along the 500-km section of the trench? (2) What are the degree and spatial extent of hydration of the Atlantic lithosphere entering the Puerto Rico Trench? (3) Does oceanic bivergent thrust system represent double-sided subduction or a crustal retro-wedge of one-sided subduction? The integrated seismic experiments, together with the other ancillary geophysical datasets, will produce two-dimensional seismic reflection images, P-wave and S-wave travel-time tomography 2-D models, and gravity-derived density models of the study region.

The goal of this research is to exploit the characteristics of these dinuclear species to understand how molecular structure can assist in violating EPR selection rules to enable high intensity transitions. The specific transitions being explored may yield new capabilities for bioimaging techniques that use EPR transitions. The research project spans the interface of inorganic and physical chemistries with synthetic and spectroscopic analyses as a key part of the work. The broader outreach goals for the program will be to create an easy-to-access lesson for synthetic chemists to approach the selection rules of EPR. This plan will follow the pedagogical strategies commonly employed for more common techniques, e.g. UV-vis spectroscopy, and as such aims to be a cornerstone in bringing new chemists into the EPR arena.<br/><br/>The longer-term goal for the work is to enable low-frequency EPR transitions at high magnetic field, which would permit the chemical sensitivity of EPR imaging to be integrated with MRI. The singlet-to-triplet transition of two-spin systems is a promising way to realize such an EPR transition, because of its unique field dependence. Yet, the transition is forbidden and therefore weak hence, chemical design strategies for molecules to override the EPR selection rule and increase signal intensity are needed. Dinuclear metal complexes have a plethora of magnetic interactions that could potentially violate the EPR selection rule, but experimental tests of the efficacy of these violations have yet to be performed. This work will study the singlet-to-triplet transition in a variety of dinuclear metal complexes to explore how exchange coupling, hyperfine coupling, and relative spin orientation all contribute to the intensity of the forbidden resonance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These responses are likely to be energetically costly, requiring appropriate adjustments for conditions days to months in the future. Too little will not prepare for freezing, too much may inhibit growth and reproduction. The trade-off between the costs and benefits of adaptation to seasonality can limit where native species and crops can thrive. Climatic variability threatens the capacities of organisms to ?predict? the future environment and will contribute to extinction risks for native species and reduced crop production. Yet, we do not know how most organisms acclimate for winter, and even less about the costs of such acclimation. The proposed research will, for the first time, connect our understanding of adaptation and trade-offs from genes and metabolism to performance in contrasting natural environments. The study system has a foundation of over a decade of field experimental and climate data, and both natural and engineered variants of a gene that regulates cold acclimation and is hypothesized to underlie differences in survival and reproduction across contrasting climates. This focal regulatory gene responds to cold in many plant species, and the costs of acclimation are directly important for climate resilience of native species and for improving agronomical varieties. Broader impact activities for middle and high school students on organismal responses to climate change will be developed, including a ?Data Nugget? module to promote students? quantitative skills by answering scientific questions using real data. <br/><br/>Fitness trade-offs across environments are key drivers of biological diversification. The ultimate, but yet unrealized, goal in understanding the genetic basis of fitness trade-offs is to identify the full causal chain connecting naturally occurring sequence polymorphisms, molecular and organismal phenotypes, and fitness in the contrasting environments in which the organisms evolved. The proposed work uses locally adapted ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana from Italy and Sweden, for which cold-acclimated freezing tolerance loci are hypothesized to underlie genetic trade-offs. A naturally occurring polymorphism in a transcription factor encoding gene CBF2 was identified as responsible for a major freezing tolerance locus. The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that CBF2 mediates a genetic trade-off across environments, and determine the genetic and metabolic mechanisms by which this occurs. Genetic stocks include Near Isogenic and mutant lines in multiple ecotypic backgrounds that contain, or mimic, the loss of function cbf2 allele found in the Italian ecotype. Proposed experiments will quantify growth rates, flowering phenology, lifetime fitness, genome-wide gene expression, and untargeted metabolomics in conditions simulating the natural environments. These conditions are based on site-level climate data and recapitulate differences in relative fitness of the ecotypes at the native sites. This is an unparalleled integration of detailed studies of the genetic, molecular, and physiological mechanisms of an adaptive phenotype in a system with extensive information about local adaptation in the native environments.

Some of the most important and mysterious quantities in number theory, in particular in the grand unified vision of the subject known as the Langlands program, are known as L-functions. In the physics of quantum field theory the fundamental quantities one measures, the partition functions, have a similarly indirect and elusive definition. The PI believes that the study of L-functions can be significantly enhanced by thinking of them as the output of a quantum mechanical system. This perspective makes evident surprising new symmetries and unifying structures in the subject. This project demonstrates the utility of an emerging physics point of view on arithmetic whose broad dissemination the PI is spearheading, including through a planned book. In addition the PI is actively involved in training graduate students and giving expository lectures to broad scientific audiences.<br/><br/>The object of this project is to develop and disseminate new connections between physics and number theory. The PI and collaborators  recently constructed a bridge from electric-magnetic duality to the arithmetic of L-functions, and this project provides a central pillar supporting this bridge. In the physics of quantum field theory, partition functions are the fundamental invariants. In number theory and arithmetic geometry, L-functions are the fundamental invariants and at the heart of the overarching vision provided by the Langlands program. The investigator will develop a new geometric theory of L-functions (in the setting of number fields) directly modeled on partition functions in gauge theory. This reveals a hidden quantum mechanical structure to the subject, situating L-functions as part of the theory of geometric quantization. Conversely, the investigator will develop  a new theory of L-functions for 3-manifolds, suggesting new structure in topology inspired by number theory. The investigator will work to  communicate physics ideas to number theorists and vice versa, connecting two intellectually distant communities, in particular through a book aimed at an advanced graduate audience disseminating the shockingly effective dictionary between gauge theory and automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disparities in Latinas? engineering access and attainment are the result of historically oppressive racist and sexist structures embedded in STEM space that perpetuate sexism and racism. However, there is limited research on the nuanced experiences of how Latinas resist inequities in different STEM educational settings and how they succeed. Another major shortcoming of the current literature on Latinx STEM education is that they are mostly viewed from a deficit perspective. This project aims to investigate how Latinas choose to engage in various resistance behaviors in different engineering cultures and campus climates and how these different cultures and campus climates influence their resistance. This project uses an anti-deficit view to interpret and make meaning of the experiences and assets that may have impacted Latinas? resistance and persistence in engineering programs. Findings from this study can be used to develop inclusive policies and counseling strategies to broaden the participation of Latinas and increase theirpersistence in STEM at both Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs).<br/> <br/>Guided by a combination of LatCrit theory of resistance, intersectionality, and Cultural Wealth Model (CWM), the goal of this project is to investigate how Latinas choose to engage in various resistance behaviors in different engineering cultures and campus climates and how these different STEM cultures and campus climates influence their resistance. Specific research questions include: (1) How do Latinas engage in different resistance behaviors in undergraduate engineering programs? (2) How do different engineering cultures and campus climates at Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) influence Latinas? resistance behaviors in engineering programs? and (3) How do Latinas? intersectional identities and their cultural wealth influence their resistance behaviors in different engineering cultures and campus climates? Using an interpretive phenomenological design, this project will conduct individual interviews with Latina students and qualitative surveys with faculty members and administrators from three PWIs and three HSIs in California, Florida, and Texas. Expected findings include more nuanced information about Latinas? resistance behaviors in engineering programs at PWIs and HSIs. Through sharing finding reports with participating institutions and broader STEM and Latinx communities, this study will provide needed information to promote Latinas? access and persistence in engineering programs. PWIs and HSIs could utilize the findings from this study to develop retention and recruitment policies and practices to broaden the participation and promote equity and inclusion for underrepresented minority students majoring in engineering and entering STEM careers.<br/><br/>This project is supported  by  NSF's EDUCore  Research  (ECR)  program.

The PI is interested in algebraic computations such as the equations that characterize a space, and how they interact with seemingly unrelated computations. The project is broken into three subprojects with a different theme. These include the study of the space of polynomials with repeated roots, super homogeneous spaces, and the use of Lie algebras in representation stability theory. The commonality among them involves viewing specific algebraic computations from a different angle to get a different algebraic computation that surprisingly is much more tractable. This expands on previous work of the PI and his collaborators, and the intention is to take it into new directions. The project will also provide opportunities for training graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will work on three main topics sitting between representation theory and commutative algebra, with applications flowing between these subjects in both directions. The first topic concerns computing the equations and syzygies of multiple root loci in spaces of binary forms. The PI plans to study them all together as the degree of the binary forms grows using certain monad-type constructions. Recently, this was successfully used to give a new proof of the generic Green conjecture on canonically embedded projective curves. The second topic concerns the calculation of syzygies of determinantal-like varieties via their connection to the coherent cohomology of super homogeneous spaces and super analogues of the classical Grothendieck-Springer resolution. This is motivated by the existence of unexpected actions of Lie superalgebras on these syzygies and, in fact, offers a conceptual explanation for their existence. On the other hand, it also offers a new strategy to find super analogues of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, which the PI plans to explore. The third topic concerns curried algebras; a concept recently introduced by the PI in collaboration with Andrew Snowden. This provides a deep connection between representation stability theory and constructions in Lie theory such as the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category O. The PI plans to import these techniques from Lie theory to find and prove new structural results in representation stability and its applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is estimated that catalysis underpins approximately 35% of the U.S. GDP, producing coatings, fertilizers, fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals, medical garments and equipment, and other chemicals on a vast scale. In the future, catalytic transformations must be more energy and resource efficient, non-toxic, non-polluting, and employ low-cost, earth-abundant metals in more selective, sustainable, and economically competitive technologies. Professor Marks and his research group are addressing these important challenges with the development of f-element and d(0) catalysts that advance new ways to build and modify organic molecules. These activities are also serving to educate young scientists to attack global-scale problems, while conducting forefront research across broad disciplinary fields. Projects funded by this award involve a transdisciplinary, educationally rigorous combination of catalyst creation, catalyst evaluation, and understanding the pathways by which catalytic products are formed. These activities combined with a highly interactive research group environment, provide excellent training/mentoring for graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral scholars bound for industrial, national laboratory, or academic careers, with special emphasis on participation by women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The research program supported by this award is configured around three highly-integrated exploratory, hypothesis-driven themes capitalizing on the unique properties of earth-abundant lanthanide, actinide, and early transition metal complexes. In the first, a remarkably rapid and selective reduction process for carbon-element multiple bonds using simple lanthanide catalysts and easy to handle boron compounds is being investigated for new synthetic applications to facilitate access to natural products, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. In the second theme, the position of catalytic rare earth metals in the periodic table is being used to steer reaction outcomes.  When applied to pyridine molecules, which are important for drugs and fine chemicals, large lanthanides lead to a change in the pyridine double bond structure whereas small lanthanides lead to substitution on the pyridine periphery. In the third theme, the tolerance of zirconium olefin polymerization catalysts towards the copolymerization of monomers with amine, phosphine and thioether functional groups is being investigated and the properties of the resulting materials explored. The broader long term scientific impact of this research includes the potential provide new routes to build-in surface anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal characteristics for disposable PPEs and even hospital clothing and face masks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objectives of this project are to design, synthesize and characterize core-shell structured organic molecules, to gain a fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of synthesized organic molecules, and to leverage this understanding for designing a transformative hybrid flow battery for future energy storage applications. The project offers several broader impacts, including fundamental knowledge of organic molecules, novel battery technology development, training of the future science and technology workforce at undergraduate and graduate levels, and an outreach program that can engage high school students including students from groups traditionally underrepresented in chemistry and chemical engineering.<br/> <br/>To unleash the potential of hybrid magnesium-organic flow batteries, new organic molecular structure design is proposed.  The design consists of core-shell structured organic molecules with an aromatic core, a redox-active shell, and a polyether chain connecting them. Such core-shell structured molecules have the potential to enable fast electron-transfer reactions to the redox-active moieties located in the shell, and provides multiple design freedoms to tune the solubility, capacity, potential, and stability of organic molecules. Thus, this approach has great potential to achieve transformative energy storage performance compared to the state-of-the-art hybrid flow batteries. A systematic experimental study is proposed, including design and synthesis of core-shell structured organic molecules, chemical and electrochemical characterization of the synthesized molecules, a device-level study of flow battery performance of synthesized molecules, as well as in situ/ex situ studies to understand reaction mechanisms and performance limiting factors. The overall long term aim is to achieve a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of core-shell structured organic molecules for magnesium-organic flow batteries. The goal is to eventually provide rational structure/design guidelines of organic materials for high-voltage, high-capacity and stable non-aqueous magnesium-organic flow batteries.

For instance, block copolymers are commercially used as thermoplastic elastomers: outer coverings for optical fiber cables, adhesives, bitumen modifiers, or in artificial organ technology. The mathematical theory to be studied by the investigator will offer insights into the nature of these materials and ultimately inform the building of industrial devices.

The negative fractional and the negative fractional screened Laplace operators provide accurate descriptions of inhibitory interaction and are relevant to other mathematical theories. The first task in this project is to identify the ranges for the fractional exponents in which these operators possess inhibition properties. The second is to construct building blocks for periodic structures in inhibitory systems, such as the non-standard double bubble, and to use them to find periodic stationary points for the whole space. A related question is to find an optimal lattice that gives rise to a periodic configuration with the least free energy density.

Dynamics is the study of how systems change and is fundamental to mathematics and applications, while combinatorics explores beautiful mathematical objects composed of discrete structures. Often, combinatorics and dynamics provide insight into the structure of mathematical and physical objects, revealing hidden symmetries and connections. There has been much success in the discovery of mathematical objects and actions that display extremely elegant properties, but many of these objects are two-dimensional. The theme of this proposal is to advance such findings in higher dimensional realms of mathematics and statistical physics. This study will also include mentoring students and early career researchers, especially those of underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/><br/>This work is comprised of several projects involving intricate bijections and actions, building upon results in dynamical algebraic combinatorics and symmetric functions. One project uses a new bijection between certain types of labelled posets that correlates the actions of promotion and rowmotion. Another involves alternating sign matrices, which are multidimensional Catalan analogues related to the square ice model of statistical physics. It has been a long-standing open problem to construct an explicit bijection between these and certain plane partitions. This project aims to make progress on this problem by interpreting these objects as different types of pipe dreams, objects with connections to Schubert polynomials. Finally, web bases for irreducible representations of symmetric groups have applications to quantum link invariants, cluster algebras, and positive geometries. This work searches for such bases in higher dimensional cases, with surprising connections to alternating sign matrices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New Mexico is ideal for CEA with more than 300 days of sun each year, inexpensive land, and growing demand for fresh locally grown produce. Northern New Mexico is a region with historical agricultural Hispanic and Native American communities who often lack access to the educational resources necessary to develop the technical CEA workforce. Thus, the demand for CEA technicians in the region presents an opportunity for economic growth and food security in these rural areas. This 3-year project at Santa Fe Community College (SFCC) will train 18 teachers at 9 rural high schools to provide 180 underserved students with dual-credit courses in the first-year curriculum of the Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree in CEA. The project significantly expands the ability for schools across New Mexico to train a regional CEA workforce and creates a pipeline for students to enter SFCC and earn their A.A.S. degree in reduced time. Remote instructional technologies coupled with on-site, hands-on replicated aquaponics systems provide teachers and students with blended learning opportunities in rural high schools. A novel online network will connect students and teachers with CEA industry and academic professionals whom they would not likely have opportunities to interact with through a conventional high school education. An academic pipeline, including a robust internship program, will ensure that students who complete their SFCC CEA degree requirements are ready to enter the workforce. <br/><br/>This project will meet the technical workforce needs of the industry through integrated education and outreach efforts. In addition it will address the opportunity to increase the number of qualified dual-credit CEA instructors through a summer program for high school teachers at the SFCC campus. Three high schools from underserved communities will each be invited to send two STEM teachers to participate in an intensive week-long summer workshop to learn the introductory CEA college curriculum. The teachers will be prepared to deliver two CEA dual-credit courses annually. Each school will receive a replicated turn-key classroom aquaponics system for hands-on practical instruction complete with sensors for remote monitoring. The first academic year after each cohort of teachers completes the summer workshop the students will participate in hands-on learning with their aquaponics system in classes co-taught by the high school teacher and SFCC faculty.  In subsequent years participating high school teachers will be prepared to teach the dual-credit CEA curriculum independently. The teachers will be mentored weekly by SFCC faculty and staff throughout the three years of the project. Student internships and summer research experiences will reinforce the curriculum and develop workplace skills. The project is unique in providing twenty-first century agricultural education and networking opportunities to largely underserved rural communities. The project will increase the number of dual-credit classes available in local high schools and engage the local community in food sovereignty issues while creating a sustainable workforce in underserved communities.

Despite this seemingly elementary premise, number theory has been at the the forefront of some of the most intricate structures discovered in mathematics, as well as underlying key practical applications (such as public key cryptography, which powers current secure communications over the internet). One fundamental idea of modern number theory is that collections of numbers sharing some common feature (such as being solutions of some list of equations) possess interesting emergent properties and symmetries. The most primordial of such emergent symmetry is the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers, and a large swath of number theory in the last few centuries concerns probing its (complicated) internal structure. In the 1970s, Langlands made a web of surprising predictions that this absolute Galois group is related to the (continuous) symmetry of vibrations on some highly symmetric geometric shapes (the automorphic representations). Such conjectures are known to have far reaching consequences: for instance, a proven special case was at the heart of the resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem. One promising approach to Langlands Conjectures that crystallized over the last few decades is the method of p-adic deformation, where one organizes the information on the two sides of the conjecture according to divisibility by powers of a given prime number p. The key point whose importance has only come into focus very recently is that this process reveals macroscopic/geometric features which make it easier to match the two sides, and the project aims to study exactly those features. Belonging to an emerging research direction, the project is a fertile ground for the discovery of and experimentation with new concrete phenomena, and thus create excellent opportunities for the training of students at both the graduate and undergraduate level. The PI also plans to disseminate the new geometric perspectives in the Langlands program to a broader audience through organizing summer schools and mini-courses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>More specifically, the project studies the geometry of the moduli stack of representations of the Galois groups of p-adic fields, with focus on loci cut out by p-adic Hodge-theoretic conditions. These recently constructed spaces are expected to play a pivotal role in the nascent categorical p-adic Langlands program, which seeks to promote the (conjectural) relationship between individual smooth representations of p-adic Lie groups and individual local p-adic Galois representations to a relationship between the entire categories of such objects. The project aims to establish a bridge between these two categories, by relating both to categories of sheaves on some intermediate objects, moduli spaces of (semi-)linear algebraic objects, which are susceptible to analysis via methods of geometric representation theory. A sufficiently strong control on the geometry would lead to major progress on local questions such as the Breuil-Mezard conjecture as well as global questions such as Serre weight conjectures, automorphy lifting and the structure of mod p cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. The flow of information can also be reversed, namely one can predict new phenomena in geometric representation theory from arguments and heuristics with Galois representations. Furthermore, these linear algebraic moduli spaces are sufficiently concrete that one can experiment on them with computer algebra software, leading to many theoretical and computational projects accessible to undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Findings under this award will promote national prosperity through advanced energy system production in many fields ranging from energetic materials to structural batteries. Structural batteries (i.e., a battery that can bear mechanical load) are an attractive option to improve electric vehicle viability as they replace hazardous liquid electrolytes with a solid counterpart. These solid electrolytes typically combine electroactive polymers and ceramics to enhance battery durability and electrical performance. However, the production of highly conductive, mechanically robust solid-state batteries is currently impossible due to the significant knowledge gaps concerning the manufacturing history ? microstructure link. This award supports integrated experiments and modeling to uncover the impact of manufacturing history (e.g., temperature, cure conditions, and shear rate) on the interface between the electroactive polymer and ceramic in solid composite electrolytes. This interface determines how an electrolyte composite behaves mechanically and ionically. By understanding interface formation mechanisms, structural battery performance can be designed during the manufacturing stage, thus informing industrial processes at all scales to tune and enhance structural battery performance through microstructural manipulation. This project also aims to strengthen science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) career accessibility by introducing caregivers to manufacturing science and increasing accessibility of undergraduate research to this population that faces high barriers. This will be accomplished with course-based undergraduate research experiences, enhancing caregiver support for undergraduate research scholars, and reaching into the community to support parents of first-generation STEM scholars.<br/><br/>This project aims to unveil a mechanistic understanding of microstructural development in controlled manufacturing conditions to tune bulk response in composite electrolytes.

These developments provide guarantees that a model has certain properties, such as security, correctness, and soundness of systems. They are also used as a teaching vehicle, for example in classes on the semantics of programming languages. Unfortunately, proof assistants such as Coq lack a mechanism for extensible design of models and proofs. Today, when a model and its corresponding proofs need to be extended, developers typically copy-paste the development and manually propagate the changes. This leads to a proliferation of developments that are not linked together and that duplicate one another, obscuring concepts. This project brings built-in extensibility of models and proofs to proof assistants. In particular, it prioritizes code reuse, code modularity, and soundness of extensions. The project also aims to make extensibility intuitive for the user and a minimal disruption to the user experience. The project?s novelties are the built-in nature of extensibility ? since related solutions are largely add-ons or plug-ins, as well as the use of family polymorphism to support extensibility of proofs. The project?s impacts are the rapid, incremental verification of evolving systems, code modularity and reuse in the proof setting, and lowered barriers to entry for beginners in verification.<br/><br/>This project brings family polymorphism to the world of proof assistants. Family polymorphism is a mechanism in the theory of programming languages by which families of features can be inherited integrally. Families provide organizational benefits, such as code modularity, as well as extensibility benefits, such as type safety of code in the presence of inheritance. Family polymorphism will support extensible designs of models and proofs, facilitating code reuse and proof reuse. Furthermore, it will be possible to specify and prove family-polymorphic guarantees for any sound family derived from a base family. A derived family is sound if it satisfies all the proof obligations inherited from a base family. Family polymorphism supports both a ?vertical? extension, where features are extended in a single hierarchy, as well as ?horizontal? extension, where features are combined independently. The latter is achieved with traits and mixin composition in systems such as Scala. Since nested family polymorphism enables the encoding of mixin composition, the same mechanism for both vertical and horizontal extensions can be used. This project uses family polymorphism as a unifying mechanism for its set of extensibility strategies for the proof setting. The challenges include integrating family polymorphism and extensibility strategies with the dependent type theory of proof assistants, finding strategies to reuse proofs as well as models, and making the integration seamless for practical use. Informed by these challenges, the project researches three main areas related to modular reuse in proof assistants: (1) meta-theories, (2) strategies, and (3) implementations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study will advance knowledge of blending virtual 3-D immersive learning environments with hands-on project-based learning in culturally-situated contexts to support students in designing energy and water futures. It will also generate new knowledge of how Diné knowledge can be used in engineering design and intersect with STEM and continue evolving community participatory approaches to research. The study will use mixed-method approaches to study student and teacher experiences with and impacts of the curriculum, through research questions on (1) teachers? and students? experiences with the hybrid learning environment, (2) how students use their cultural capital, and how students perceive Diné cultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes intersecting with STEM, and (3) the pre-post impacts of the experiences on student learning and affective measures. The project will also provide professional development to teachers in the Navajo Nation to adapt and implement the curricula, using a train-the-trainer model to scale and sustain the program beyond the duration of the grant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main subject of exploration is homology, which can be thought of as the study of (dis)similarities. Despite being regarded as an abstract mathematical tool, homology has found many applications in recent years, particularly to data analysis and computer science. In algebra, homology refers to a way of measuring the difference between an implicitly defined set of objects (cycles) and an explicitly defined subset (of boundaries). In geometry, it is a tool used to distinguish between different shapes. The homology attached to an object usually focuses on the most significant traits, and it reflects its symmetries in intriguing ways. The PI will investigate homological theories associated to flag varieties, which are geometric objects parametrizing increasing sequences of subspaces of linear spaces, such as a point contained in a line contained in a plane. The symmetry comes from moving the linear spaces around while preserving their containment relations. The homological theories considered depend on a prime number p=2,3,5,7,11 etc., and the goal is to understand how the resulting homology depends on p, and how it encodes the symmetries of the flag varieties. This can then be further applied to study algebro-geometric objects of interest, such as matrices and higher-dimensional tensors. The proposed research is suitable for engaging students in research, as well as for computer experimentation and software development.<br/><br/>A fundamental question at the confluence of commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and representation theory is to describe the cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties. A well-known case is that of the projective space, where it is equivalent to computing local cohomology for a polynomial ring with support in the ideal of the variables. Other examples include Grassmannians, complete flag varieties, or the incidence correspondence. For flag varieties over a field of characteristic zero the cohomology is computed by the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, but the positive characteristic problem remains wide open. The PI's goal is a systematic study of this question, with an emphasis on concrete examples, and on showcasing peculiar interactions between algebra, geometry, and symmetry. The PI plans to use the newly acquired knowledge to solve questions of a homological nature regarding fundamental objects such as matrix determinantal varieties and analogues for higher tensors, equations and syzygies, or Koszul modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many institutions require engineering students to take a prerequisite chemistry course, however, such a course is often not aligned with knowledge and skills that students seek for their majors and is not immediately applicable to solving advanced engineering problems. Additionally, students may experience difficulties in learning chemistry due to its abstract nature and a lack of student-centered learning strategies. To address these challenges the Simulation-Based Pedagogical Approach in Chemistry Education for All Students to Succeed in STEM (SPACE) project aims to fill a gap in the research by integrating advanced engineering techniques to give students dynamic representation of abstract and unobservable phenomena at molecular and atomic levels using real-time simulations. This project intends to embed evidence-based practices in entry level courses to improve long-term student learning and create a community that will cultivate their science identity.<br/><br/>The goals of Project SPACE are to develop and test a co-curricular set of activities that will support the fundamental understanding of chemical reactions and their application in solving advanced science problems for undergraduate students in engineering majors. The project will use training in computational modeling and simulation skills, incorporate evidence-based learning strategies, and further develop students? science identity through an asset-based pedagogical tool. The project will recruit engineering undergraduate students who are enrolled in a prerequisite chemistry course at California State University, Los Angeles using a variety of methods. Over the course of two years in three distinct implementations the team will pilot-test and refine the course of study. In each implementation, students will be assessed before, during, immediately after, and one semester later in four main areas: chemical reaction knowledge, context-based science problem-solving skills, motivation toward science, and science identity. Through the three implementations, the project will be comprehensively evaluated using a set of instruments to examine its promises for future adaptation and replication at an institutional level. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity for institutional transformation at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enumerative algebraic geometry concerns counting geometric objects satisfying a given list of constraints in a space defined by polynomial equations. In good situations, these counts do not change under generically varying the set of constraints and therefore define enumerative invariants. Among the most extensively studied enumerative invariants are Gromov-Witten invariants and Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which have important applications in mathematics and physics. While Gromov-Witten invariants correspond to counts of curves in a space, Donaldson-Thomas invariants are integers counting geometric objects called vector bundles or more generally sheaves. In mathematics, both the count of curves and sheaves in a space carry crucial information about geometric properties of the space, as such properties are used to characterize and classify different spaces. On the other hand in physics, Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants appear in the context of string theory, where they correspond to counts of particles in gauge theory as well as black hole microstates in quantum gravity. This award will also support graduate students working with the PI. <br/><br/>There are four main strands of research directions the project is branched into. In the first part, the project intends to investigate conjectural dualities, establishing new bridges between enumerative algebraic geometry and quantum physics. These dualities are expected to relate Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds to the quantization of the mirror curves. A second subject of study is related to canonical bases in representation theory. In particular, one of the goals of the project is to use enumerative algebraic geometry of surfaces to construct canonical bases for double affine Hecke algebras and their generalizations. In a third direction, the project intends to establish connections between refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants and invariants arising in real algebraic geometry. The focus of the final part of the project will be on holomorphic symplectic geometry. In this context, the goal is to provide a categorification of Floer theory for holomorphic symplectic manifold, motivated by structures in Donaldson-Thomas theory. The unifying ingredient here is the recent advance in the understanding of wall-crossing, mirror symmetry, logarithmic geometry, and tropical geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Candidates will complete a Master of Education (MEd) program in sixteen (16) months leading to a sophisticated skillset and STEM teacher certification followed by an induction process consisting of four additional years. Teacher preparation and induction will feature coaching and mentoring with a focus on STEM content, integrated STEM pedagogy, social and environmental justice, experiential learning, social and emotional learning, and teacher well-being. An important feature of the project will be the implementation of a Whole Teacher Support Model which encompasses a holistic and customized approach to support project participants to develop dispositions and practices for healthy and balanced professional lives. This, in turn, will enable high-need schools in the Baltimore vicinity and other areas across the nation to provide their students a strong and inclusive STEM education, which will help provide a background and direction for many of these students to be prepared for the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This project is housed at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and leverages a partnership with the Baltimore City Public Schools (BCPS).

Glycans and their conjugated forms (e.g., glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and glycolipids etc.) are complex molecules containing many interlinked sugar units that are implicated in a variety of biological processes and pathological events, including: signal transduction, fertilization, cancer metastasis, cell-cell adhesion, and immune responses. Investigations of the biological functions of glycans and glycan conjugates are essential for managing various diseases and for the advancement of medical treatments, but these endeavors are hindered by the difficulty of preparing well-defined glycans for study. The method being developed has the potential to help alleviate bottlenecks in glycan research by enabling automated preparations of a broad range of otherwise inaccessible glycan structures in pure form. It is anticipated that this work will in turn accelerate the development of glycan-based vaccines and pharmaceutical agents. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the benefits accrued to society as Professor Zhang engages in a range of educational activities including the rigorous training that he will provide to the graduate student coworkers conducting the research. These individuals, who will gain knowledge of advanced organic chemistry while acquiring the skills necessary to perform complex synthetic operations, are likely to make valuable future contributions to the Nation's scientific enterprise upon joining the workforce in private industry or academia. Undergraduate students, especially those belonging to groups underrepresented in the physical sciences, will also be recruited to help with the research effort; the inclusive and supportive experiences that the students gain in the laboratory environment are anticipated to encourage them to consider higher educational goals and/or careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The funded project focuses on the study and further development of the directing-group-on-leaving-group (DGLG) strategy for glycosylation in which glycosyl donors equipped with activatable nucleofugal moieties at the C1 position engage with glycosyl acceptors via largely stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution. The SN2-like glycosylation is directed and facilitated/accelerated by a hydrogen bond-accepting group within the anomeric leaving group that promotes an anti-colinear attack trajectory of the nucleophile upon the weakened bond in the electrophile. The aims of the research are divided into three sequential phases: (1) development of improved reaction conditions and next-generation leaving groups for DGLG strategy-based glycosylation reactions that are appropriate for solid phase synthesis and yet are still applicable for the stereoselective formation of essentially any type of glycosidic bond (i.e., 1,2-cis, 1,2-trans, 2-deoxy-alpha, 2-deoxy-beta types in pyranose or furanose systems); (2) validation and implementation of the developed processes on the solid phase; and (3) demonstration of the feasibility of the processes in a commercially available platform for automated glycan synthesis. It is anticipated that the research will lead to fundamental advances in the theory and practice of complex carbohydrate synthesis and that the emergent technology arising from the discoveries will be impactful to ancillary disciplines such as glycobiology and medicinal chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research features the development of techniques to produce unique and difficult-to-access chemical structures in a controlled manner and with high yields and it is envisioned that this work will translate into more efficient manufacturing processes for the production of value added materials. The broader impacts of the funded project will extend to the benefits accrued to society as Dr. Walczak and his team of coworkers engage in a range of educational and outreach activities. For example, the students conducting the research will receive training in sophisticated synthetic chemistry techniques preparing them to become the next generation of scientific leaders in the modern workforce. Additionally, the Walczak team will take part in public presentations at educational outreach events, such as CU Wizards, which are designed to attract a demographically diverse range of visitors and to promote the principles of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among a wide and general audience.<br/><br/>The chemical synthesis of complex oligosaccharides and their isosteres has provided unprecedented insights into biological processes; however, current methods for the elaboration of carbohydrate derivatives are limited in their degree of efficiency and stereoselectivity. Accordingly, the funded project is directed toward the development and study of new and improved methods for the stereocontrolled synthesis of glycosides with a focus on challenging C-nucleoside and rare hexose systems. The approach of interest involves cross-coupling reactions employing stereodefined anomeric nucleophiles (i.e., C1 metalloid reagents) that have the capacity to install glycosidic bonds with high levels of stereoselectivity, and sometimes proceeding with complete stereospecificity, across a broad range of substrates. Practical methods to prepare the requisite anomeric nucleophiles using readily available reagents will be developed and the resultant synthons engaged in stereoretentive C-C bond forming cross-coupling reactions to generate saccharides that are difficult to access using established methods. The study aims to bridge an important knowledge gap in chemical synthesis by exploring two novel classes of reagents, C1 boronic acids and C1 silanes, which have hitherto received little attention in organic synthesis. Specific targets of interest include biologically active C-glycosides such as dapagliflozin and the antibiotic pseudouridimycin alongside rare, but also biomedically significant, L-hexoses and L-aminosugars. For the latter, a C1-homologation operation will be deployed to enable conversion of naturally abundant D-series carbohydrate residues into their less common L-series congeners. It is expected that the fundamental knowledge gained during the course of the funded project will advance the practice of catalytic methods for selective carbohydrate functionalization and our understanding of stereospecific cross-coupling reactions, in particular. From a broader perspective, the methods developed will facilitate the elaboration of complex carbohydrates and glycomimetic systems and ancillary benefits are therefore anticipated in allied disciplines such as glycobiology and medicinal chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During storms animals may seek shelter to save energy and improve survival, but this may be difficult or have negative consequences on their reproductive success if they are also trying to raise young. The decisions that different individuals make can determine if they and their young survive to raise the next generation and this will in turn determine if a species can persist in a particular location. Storms have been increasing in frequency and intensity in some areas of the world and simultaneously becoming less predictable in when they occur. This may be particularly challenging to many animals and, yet, very few studies have attempted to describe how animals make decisions during storms, what types of metabolic traits might help them to better survive during storms and how being a parent might change those decisions. With this grant, researchers at Oregon State University will describe how songbirds behave during storms in the wild and how those behaviors affect their health and their ability to raise young. They will also carefully control different aspects of weather, such as temperature, precipitation and wind, in the lab to determine how these different factors impact the energy costs of staying warm. Together this work will allow for a better understanding of why species ranges may be contracting or expanding as the global climate changes and will guide more efficient management and conservation goals. The proposed educational and outreach plan seeks to advance representation of Native Americans and other underrepresented groups in the biological sciences and to connect communities across multiple agegroups in the context of natural history and science. <br/><br/>Inclement weather may define species distributional edges and may increasingly impact survival as climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of storms. There is wide variation in individual survival within populations with little understanding of the behavioral or physiological mechanisms underlying this differential survival. Despite extensive work describing seasonal flexibility in the metabolic capacity of endotherms in the lab and the impact of inclement weather on mortality and reproductive fitness in the field, few have attempted to connect these bodies of work and relate metabolic capacity to metrics of fitness during inclement weather. The proposed research examines the impact of variable weather on metabolism and behavior in a small-bodied songbird, the red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra), within different seasonal contexts. This research leverages the crossbill?s specialization on conifer seeds and opportunistic breeding behavior to 1. Quantify how the duration, type and severity of inclement weather influences songbird behavioral responses to and metabolic costs of acute weather; 2. Determine how reproductive investment and foraging performance change physiological and behavioral coping mechanisms employed during inclement weather; and 3. Quantify how metabolic traits impact behavioral strategies, performance and fitness metrics during and outside of inclement weather. These research goals will be achieved using a combination of biotelemetry, respirometry and blood physiology in both field and controlled-captive environments. The proposed experiments integrate ecophysiology, behavior and natural history to advance our understanding of why some individuals are more resilient than others in the face of environmental adversity. The PI will utilize the scholarship and guidance of experts on Native Americans mentorship to develop an Indigenous Mentoring Plan (IMP) prior to recruit Native Americans students to the project. IMPs focus on key factors that increase positive outcomes of mentorship, including: community building, relationship building and incorporation of indigenous viewpoints and approaches to science.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Animal Behavior program in Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These devices often operate in high-energy content environments, with unsteady flowing fluids, but no technology exists to enable them to harvest and redirect this energy to perform distributed actuation efficiently and autonomously, without relying on external sources of energy. A compelling paradigm for achieving such vision is to use multistable metamaterials that store and selectively release energy through nonlinear transition waves -- these large amplitude waves sequentially switch elements from one stable state to another. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will support research to build the analytical and experimental foundations for flow-responsive multistable metamaterials that manifest tunable dynamic properties and perform desirable tasks by harnessing fluid-structure interactions. These metamaterials will form building blocks for designing dynamic systems that sustain targeted functionalities under fluidic stimuli. This CAREER project will carry out an ambitious plan for integrating research and education and for developing innovative strategies for public outreach that showcase the societal benefits of the field of dynamic metamaterials and spark interest among high school students. <br/><br/>By combining mechanical metamaterials and fluid flow environments, this research will show how fluid-structure interactions and transition waves can be leveraged to efficiently achieve desired dynamic behaviors in both dynamic systems and flow fields. With a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods, fluid-metastructure interactions will be used as a twofold ?dynamic knob? to (1) manipulate shape reconfigurations in multistable metamaterials for actuation purposes and to (2) control fluid fluxes through transition wavefronts in metamaterials. Reprogrammable dynamic properties and self-regulating flow capabilities will be coupled to passively obtain rigidity on demand and distributed actuation. This research will represent a milestone towards the development of future engineered structures with unprecedented tunable dynamic properties and flow-induced shape transformations. The resulting adaptive metastructures will significantly enhance the field of self-actuating metamaterials with distributed intelligent capabilities. The results of this research will be a leap forward in the design of self-reconfigurable cardiovascular implants, swimming meta-robots, and passive flow-rate control systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some fundamental examples of these shapes are circles or hyperboloids, and as such, algebraic geometry is largely intertwined with many other fields of mathematics. One of the guiding research directions in algebraic geometry as well as the overall focus of this research project is understanding the classification of these shapes, a subfield known as the study of moduli spaces. Algebraic geometry as well as the study of moduli spaces have numerous applications, for example within cryptography as well as in understanding the structure underlying our universe via string theory and mathematical physics. This project includes training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach efforts involving high school students from the local community.<br/><br/>While we have an extensive understanding of moduli spaces of algebraic curves, we understand far less about moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic varieties (i.e. varieties of complex dimension at least two). In short, the main goal of this project is to further our understanding of higher dimensional moduli by leveraging many recent results in moduli theory and birational geometry, such as wall-crossing results that the PI has obtained in joint work with collaborators. The first project aims to use wall-crossing techniques to understand the underlying geometric structure and geometric properties of moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. Additionally, as most known results regarding moduli spaces of higher dimensional varieties focus on two cases, namely (log) general type pairs and (log) Fano pairs, the goal of the second project is to construct and study moduli spaces of (log) Calabi-Yau pairs using tools from the minimal model program and K-stability. Finally, the third project uses techniques from birational geometry, moduli spaces, and the minimal model program to understand various notions of hyperbolicity on varieties of (log) general type, including the distribution of rational and integral points.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It originated from theoretical physics, and generated great impact on various areas of mathematics, in particular differential geometry and algebraic geometry. The objects of study are geometric shapes called Calabi-Yau manifolds that appear naturally in different contexts of mathematics and physics. Mirror symmetry predicts that given any Calabi-Yau manifold, there exists a mirror manifold, such that an ever-growing list of geometric relations hold between the two, involving deep and elaborate invariants that are otherwise unrelated. Despite the continual progress in the subject, both the full extent of existence of mirror manifolds and the underlying mathematical mechanism of mirror symmetry remain unsolved today. This project brings a new approach to the study of mirror symmetry, based on latest developments from non-archimedean geometry. The goal is to conceive and pursue a full-fledged theory of non-archimedean mirror symmetry, which will lead to new results unattainable from existing methods, as well as applications beyond the current scope. This award will also support graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The mirror existence problem will be studied via the enumeration of analytic curves with boundaries in non-archimedean SYZ torus fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. New constructions of such fibrations will be explored using non-archimedean Monge-Ampère equations in addition to the minimal model program. An analog of the Gromov compactness theorem for non-archimedean curves with boundaries needs to be established, based on generalized tail conditions, which depend on novel analytic surgeries of the target spaces. The construction of virtual fundamental classes for the curve counts will rely on our previous works on derived non-archimedean geometry. PI will prove various properties of the mirror algebra obtained from the curve counts, including associativity, radius of convergence and singularity estimates. The local mirror algebras are expected to glue together to form the global mirror variety using wall-crossing formulas. A long-term goal is to show that the mirror construction is an involution, the best exhibition of mirror duality. PI also aims for applications outside mirror symmetry, in particular towards cluster algebras in representation theory and the moduli of KSBA stable pairs in birational geometry. PI expects fruitful future interactions with the Gross-Siebert program based on logarithmic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Forced or coerced migration remains a reality for many people today. The marginalized status of resettled peoples can make it difficult to study their experiences in both the present and the past. In ancient empires, most written accounts of resettlement come from the wealthy and powerful elites who wished to present their actions in a positive light, and forced relocation rarely leaves a clear material signature for archaeologists to study. Often, researchers have overlooked such basic questions as: how did people who were resettled adjust to their new reality? What challenges did they face? To what extent was resettlement violent? Bioarchaeology, the study of human remains from archaeological sites, provides methods and tools to gain insight into the daily life experiences of people relocated by states and empires. Since this is a doctoral dissertation research project this grant furthers the student?s academic and intellectual development. The project includes outreach to the local community.<br/><br/>This project uses bioarchaeology to study the life experiences of one resettled community which was part of a larger process in which as many as 4,000,000 people were moved. The investigators collaborate with archaeologists to excavate parts of an associated cemetery. They employ bone geochemistry to identify who, among those buried in the cemetery, were most likely migrants in order to compare them to non-migrant individuals from the same site. They study indicators on the bones of excavated individuals to see if migrants experienced violence or high rates of disease, and if they changed their diets or forms of body adornment to conform to their new region. Comparing migrants to locals reveal what tactics were used to control resettled subjects and how resettlement shaped overall life experiences. The design of this project allows it to serve both scientific knowledge and practice by facilitating an international collaboration between women in scientific archaeology and promoting scientific understanding of state-directed resettlement within and beyond the Inka case study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many institutions require engineering students to take a prerequisite chemistry course, however, such a course is often not aligned with knowledge and skills that students seek for their majors and is not immediately applicable to solving advanced engineering problems. Additionally, students may experience difficulties in learning chemistry due to its abstract nature and a lack of student-centered learning strategies. To address these challenges the Simulation-Based Pedagogical Approach in Chemistry Education for All Students to Succeed in STEM (SPACE) project aims to fill a gap in the research by integrating advanced engineering techniques to give students dynamic representation of abstract and unobservable phenomena at molecular and atomic levels using real-time simulations. This project intends to embed evidence-based practices in entry level courses to improve long-term student learning and create a community that will cultivate their science identity.<br/><br/>The goals of Project SPACE are to develop and test a co-curricular set of activities that will support the fundamental understanding of chemical reactions and their application in solving advanced science problems for undergraduate students in engineering majors. The project will use training in computational modeling and simulation skills, incorporate evidence-based learning strategies, and further develop students? science identity through an asset-based pedagogical tool. The project will recruit engineering undergraduate students who are enrolled in a prerequisite chemistry course at California State University, Los Angeles using a variety of methods. Over the course of two years in three distinct implementations the team will pilot-test and refine the course of study. In each implementation, students will be assessed before, during, immediately after, and one semester later in four main areas: chemical reaction knowledge, context-based science problem-solving skills, motivation toward science, and science identity. Through the three implementations, the project will be comprehensively evaluated using a set of instruments to examine its promises for future adaptation and replication at an institutional level. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity for institutional transformation at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, data centers require significant capital investment, ongoing operational maintenance, and the technical workforce capacity to support various center operations. As data center capacity continues to expand in the Northern Virginia (NOVA) region and the country at large, a trained engineering technology workforce is necessary to meet the growing demand for skilled workers. At present, community and technical colleges lack the instructional capacity to offer programs and coursework to support this rapidly emerging technological field. This project intends to address the lack of workforce issue by developing a sustained professional development program. The proposed Data Center Operations Program Development (DCO PD) has the potential to prepare engineering technology faculty to integrate DCO skills into their teaching practice, conduct national outreach to administrators and educators, and establish professional networks with data centers and their operators regionally and nationally. <br/><br/>The project has three primary components. First is a sustained professional development fellowship for faculty, including a three-day workshop series at NOVA Community College's data center training facility and a five-day externship at an operational data center. Second is an awareness and recruitment campaign at national conferences including project presentations, data center site visits, and hands-on skills workshops. Third, and finally, is a data center education digital resource hub serving as a repository of curriculum, industry contacts, career information, and a map of growing data center markets. The project intends to advance the understanding of industry externships and site visits as a tool for facultu professional development. Instructional materials would be disseminated through publications of the Association for Career and Technical Education's Techniques magazine, the career and technical education Journal, The Science Teacher, and Technology and Engineering Teacher.

Algebraic curves are one-dimensional sets of points that can be described by polynomial equations. For example, the unit circle in the plane x^2 + y^2 = 1 defines an algebraic curve. A ubiquitous problem in the theory of algebraic curves is to understand how many algebraic curves there are satisfying a given list of conditions. This information corresponds to the so-called ""intersection theory of their moduli space"": a moduli space of curves is a space whose points correspond to algebraic curves, and its intersection theory describes how various loci in this space can meet (which corresponds to various conditions on the algebraic curve being satisfied simultaneously). The Chow ring of the moduli space packages this information of intersection theory into an algebraic structure. This summer school will introduce graduate students and postdocs to recent developments in computing Chow rings through four mini-courses, afternoon exercise sessions, and research groups. Students will participate in exercise sessions to reinforce the material from the mini-courses. They will also work in research groups to apply these techniques to compute new examples of Chow rings (both integral and rational) of moduli spaces of curves.<br/><br/>More specifically, the four mini-courses will be on the following topics: (1) Equivariant intersection theory: this describes how intersection theory behaves in the presence of a group action; (2) Higher Chow groups: these invariants capture the failure of exactness of excision sequences of Chow rings; (3) The tautological ring of the moduli space of stable pointed curves: this describes a well-behaved subring of the Chow ring; and (4) Patching techniques and the integral Chow ring of the moduli of 2-pointed genus 1 curves: often enlarging moduli spaces to include curves with worse singularities can enable patching togetherinformation about Chow rings of strata to the Chow ring of the entire moduli space. https://sites.google.com/site/agneshomepage/brown-2023-agnes-summer-school<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zhdankin of the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) is studying the development of new reagents and synthetic methodologies based on the organic chemistry of iodine. The project is exploring the preparation and fundamental chemistry of new hypervalent iodine compounds.  The ability of hypervalent iodine species to modify organic compounds when coupled with their efficiency and sustainability makes them useful among academic and industrial scientists. This utility is the result of iodine behaving much like a transition metal in many applications. The continued exploration and utilization of these similarities is leading to the development of new useful methodologies for modern organic chemistry. More broadly speaking, this project is at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry and is well-suited for undergraduate, graduate, and more advanced researchers including researchers in industry. The project is expected to provide high level of education and training for students, many of whom are underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>A broad study of new, metal-free, iodine-mediated reactions and an exploratory search for new and potentially useful hypervalent reagents is proposed. Specific objectives include: (i) the development of pseudocyclic arylbenziodoxaboroles as benzyne precursors and highly efficient electrophilic arylating reagents under neutral, aqueous conditions, (ii) the exploration of 4-iodonium substituted arylboronic acids as para-benzyne precursors, (iii) the study of the synthesis and reactivity of stabilized iodonium derivatives of porphyrins and dipyrromethenes, and (iv) the search for new types of polyvalent iodine compounds that are stabilized by internal halogen bonding. New synthetic methodologies based on these efforts will contribute to the discovery of environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as they utilize non-toxic iodine compounds in water as catalysts or as recoverable/recyclable reagents. The successful development of this methodology will have an impact on the areas of science where the synthesis of organic molecules is required, such as in academia and in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the research team aims to understand how the design of lipid nanoparticles impacts their ability to enable high levels of drug delivery to cells and tissues. Although researchers know that the design of lipid nanoparticles impacts their effectiveness, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs remains elusive. Here, the research team will take a fundamental and mechanistic approach to understand how the chemical structure of the lipids impacts how the nanoparticles interact with cells and tissues. This award will enable the inclusion of one graduate student and two undergraduate students on this research, providing exceptional research opportunities to Biomedical Engineering students at Rowan University. Further, the project will enable the recruitment of one student from Rowan College of South Jersey, the local community college, through a unique partnership. Ultimately, the successful completion of this work will allow drug delivery researchers to specifically design lipids for improved drug delivery for a wide range of biological applications.  <br/><br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to study structure-function relationships between ionizable lipid chemistry and the biological interactions of lipid nanoparticles. Lipid nanoparticles have emerged at the forefront of translational drug delivery due to their use in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Lipid nanoparticles are comprised of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and poly(ethylene) glycol complexed with therapeutic nucleic acids. Despite the recent clinical advancements of lipid nanoparticles, remarkably little is known about how their composition and physicochemical properties impact their interactions with biological systems. It has been established that ionizable lipid chemistry dictates how they interact with cells and tissues to drive drug delivery efficiency. However, there is a major gap in knowledge regarding the precise means by which ionizable lipid structure influences how lipid nanoparticles interact with cells and tissues. Here, the research team will take a fundamental and mechanistic approach to evaluate how lipid nanoparticle composition impacts biological interactions at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. The overarching hypothesis is that the degree of saturation, alkyl tail length, and tail branching of the ionizable lipids drives how lipid nanoparticles behave including stability, cell uptake, cytosolic delivery, and tissue specificity and penetration. The research objectives are to: (1) synthesize an array of new ionizable lipids and assess how ionizable lipid structure impacts lipid nanoparticle stability and protein corona formation, and (2) evaluate how ionizable lipid chemistry (branched/linear, degree of saturation, tail length) impacts delivery, uptake, endosomal escape, and tissue penetration. In addition to these research objectives, this project has several educational goals.

Further, this project will enable the recruitment of one student from Rowan College of South Jersey, the local community college, through a unique partnership. The work described herein has the potential to transform the way lipid nanoparticles are developed and tested preclinically by enhancing our understanding of how ionizable lipid chemistry impacts interactions in biological systems.

Nevertheless, one can often characterize an equation by the shape of its set of solutions, even if the solutions themselves cannot be written down.  The Langlands correspondences grow out of the observation that the shapes of the equations that arise in two apparently different areas of mathematics ? number theory and the symmetries of mathematical physics ? are linked by a complex web of relations that allow questions in one area to be solved by reference to the other area.  The branch of mathematics that studies these correspondences is called the theory of automorphic forms.  The simplest examples of automorphic forms are the familiar sine and cosine function from trigonometry.  More general automorphic forms are described in terms of geometry in higher dimensions.  In this way the study of automorphic forms contributes to the development of all branches of mathematics.   Problems studied in the present project, presented at seminars and conferences, will serve as the basis for training the next generation of specialists.  They also provide examples for philosophers and historians of the kind of synthesis of ideas that is characteristic of contemporary mathematics, and that presents a special challenge for those who prodict that artificial intelligence will play a prominent role in the mathematics of the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This project is a contribution to the study of motives over number fields in the setting of the Langlands program, continuing a theme that has been central to the PI's research throughout his career.  The present proposal is divided into two parts.  Part 1 combines motivic methods, ? especially the Grothendieck-Deligne theory of weights ? with the Selberg trace formula and representation theory to the study of local and global Langlands correspondences, both classical and mod p.   In particular, a strategy is outlined for an inductive construction of the local Langlands correspondence over local fields of positive characteristic, and an extension is proposed to Arthur parameters of the author's approach to the generalized Ramanujan conjecture.   Part 2 points in the opposite direction:  it applies the insights of the Langlands program and harmonic analysis on reductive groups to study (p-adic) motivic L-functions, especially square root p-adic L-functions, with special attention to classifying the Gan-Gross-Prasad periods that can be interpreted as cohomological cup products.  A more speculative project, joint with Feng and Mazur, aims to provide a categorical framework for Venkatesh's motivic conjectures in the setting of Iwasawa theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objectives of this project are to design, synthesize and characterize core-shell structured organic molecules, to gain a fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of synthesized organic molecules, and to leverage this understanding for designing a transformative hybrid flow battery for future energy storage applications. The project offers several broader impacts, including fundamental knowledge of organic molecules, novel battery technology development, training of the future science and technology workforce at undergraduate and graduate levels, and an outreach program that can engage high school students including students from groups traditionally underrepresented in chemistry and chemical engineering.<br/> <br/>To unleash the potential of hybrid magnesium-organic flow batteries, new organic molecular structure design is proposed.  The design consists of core-shell structured organic molecules with an aromatic core, a redox-active shell, and a polyether chain connecting them. Such core-shell structured molecules have the potential to enable fast electron-transfer reactions to the redox-active moieties located in the shell, and provides multiple design freedoms to tune the solubility, capacity, potential, and stability of organic molecules. Thus, this approach has great potential to achieve transformative energy storage performance compared to the state-of-the-art hybrid flow batteries. A systematic experimental study is proposed, including design and synthesis of core-shell structured organic molecules, chemical and electrochemical characterization of the synthesized molecules, a device-level study of flow battery performance of synthesized molecules, as well as in situ/ex situ studies to understand reaction mechanisms and performance limiting factors. The overall long term aim is to achieve a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of core-shell structured organic molecules for magnesium-organic flow batteries. The goal is to eventually provide rational structure/design guidelines of organic materials for high-voltage, high-capacity and stable non-aqueous magnesium-organic flow batteries.  Such tunable organic molecules in the longer term have potential application areas that include supporting redox-flow batteries, CO2 capture, electrochemical sensing, organic electronics, and separations science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aromatic compounds are common building blocks throughout synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry, however the chemical reactions of aromatic molecules to give value-added commodities is often hindered because it results in the generation of multiple products, necessitating costly purification sequences. Dr. Gustafson and his team are studying new chemical reactions aimed at controlling the selective modification of both simple and complex aromatic scaffolds, ultimately resulting in more efficient synthetic strategies towards molecules of interest to the academic and pharmaceutical communities. In addition to providing training in organic chemistry for graduate and undergraduate students, this project also impacts the education more broadly in that it proposes to incorporate Virtual Reality experiences to aid students in the 3-dimensional visualization of molecules. Virtual Reality will also be utilized in outreach programs aimed at SDSU?s general population, as well as local high schools and community colleges.  <br/><br/>Professor Gustafson and his team of collaborators and students design ?organocatalysts? that affect the regioselective C-H functionalization of simple and complex aromatics through electrophilic aromatic substitution and related aromatic radical functionalization reactions. These transformations traditionally yield poor regioselectivities, often preventing them from being adopted as viable synthetic strategies, particularly in more complex settings. For the addition of electrophiles into aromatics, the Gustafson group designs bifunctional Lewis basic catalysts that intercept and direct the electrophile, or electrophilic radical to a specific position. The Gustafson group is also exploring similar strategies for the functionalization of aromatics with nucleophiles in the context of nucleophilic aromatic substitution and vicarious nucleophilic substitution.  For the regioselective addition of nucleophiles to aromatics, they utilize a broad array of classic organocatalytic strategies including cation directed catalysis and hydrogen-bonding catalysis. The ability to site-selectively modify simple and complex aromatic systems greatly simplifies the syntheses of molecules and opens the door for these chemistries to be used in the context of late-stage functionalization strategies. In order to allow for the design of better and more efficient catalysts, the Gustafson group is also performing mechanistic studies with collaborators in computational chemistry and electrochemistry. The site-selective modification of complex intermediates that this work enables has the potential to transform how the late-stage structural optimization of pharmaceuticals, materials and other functional molecules are carried out.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As smart learning companions (for example, animated intelligent characters/agents) become popular, children are at risk of overestimating and over-trusting AI given their tendency to anthropomorphize such intelligent systems. This CAREER project investigates the development of novel embodied learning technologies that help K-12 students demystify machine learning (ML), an integral aspect of current approaches to AI. The project will provide hands-on and collaborative learning experiences for children to make sense of the inner workings of ML, similar to how they build, act, and experiment in collaboration with friends. The learning experiences will be designed to be accessible to children, regardless of their math and computing background, with special attention to those from historically underrepresented backgrounds in STEM. The project outcomes will advance an AI-driven society by preparing 21st century learners to become critical thinkers about AI, as both consumers and future creators. It will also promote inclusion in next-generation STEM education by addressing AI inequality in life and work. <br/><br/>AI and ML are often presented to children as a black box, focusing on workflows and capabilities (e.g., data training, image and voice recognition) which can lead to inaccurate or oversimplified understandings. Further, many K-12 students lack math and computing backgrounds that are required for understanding abstract Machine Learning (ML) concepts and methods. To address these challenges in understanding abstract ML concepts, this project will explore the design space of 3D and tangible interaction technologies to provide embodied learning experiences that draw upon children's real-life experience of object manipulation, body movement and role-play. Knowledge discovery will be accelerated through a pedagogical agent with curiosity-eliciting prompts to encourage exploratory learning. The learning experiences will be evaluated for impact in supporting knowledge acquisition, self-efficacy and interest in ML with elementary and middle school students. Findings of this project are expected to: (1) deepen knowledge of embodied and exploratory learning in supporting the understanding of abstract and complex STEM concepts through the lens of ML education; and, (2) inform the design of future learning technologies that seamlessly integrate sensorimotor enactment and situated social prompts to make K-12 ML education highly accessible to students with diverse backgrounds and skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Medical imaging analysis has been significantly advanced using deep learning models. The knowledge extracted from large amounts of medical data can be used to make predictions for new patients. It has been demonstrated in many cases that the performances of machine learning models are comparable to board-certified radiologists or other professional experts, indicating the potential successful integration of those models in clinical applications. For example, imagine a patient notices a painless rash on their skin. If they could take a photo with a cell phone and receive a quick assessment comparable to experienced dermatologists, life-threatening diseases would be intervened or avoided early. However, the current success of deep learning is heavily dependent on large and high-quality labeled datasets. Such nearly perfect environments are only available in ideal lab environments because of the population shift, device differences, or rare diseases in real clinical applications. This project plans to focus on those specific challenges of non-ideal medical imaging diagnosis environments to advance the knowledge of building transferrable deep learning models and enhance national health by providing better tools for medical imaging diagnosis. Furthermore, this research will support the cross-disciplinary development of a diverse cohort of Ph.D. and undergraduate students and outreach activities to diverse communities.<br/><br/>Technically, this project will investigate and build transferable medical imaging diagnosis systems in diverse environments. The project proceeds with one overarching theme of leveraging the understudied geometric properties of deep neural networks to address three universal barriers when deploying medical imaging systems in various environments. Specifically, there are challenges to transferring models to novel classes, where there are not enough training samples, and novel domains, where the deploying environments change, and more importantly, preserving the previous knowledge in the model. If successful, the proposed research is expected to advance the understanding of building transferring deep learning models by leveraging a novel geometric interpretation of deep neural networks partitioning the input and feature space into generalized Voronoi diagrams. The driving applications of the proposed techniques are the prediction of long-tailed disease patterns on chest X-rays and ensuring consistent screening services for glaucoma in underserved communities. In addition, the proposed methods have the potential to be extended to similar scenarios with diverse deployment environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tomson of the University of Pennsylvania will study the selective cleavage of C?H bonds, a grand challenge in chemistry. These notoriously unreactive bonds are widespread, from fossil fuels to plastics and other materials.  The development of methods for splitting C-H bonds in a controlled manner is expected to aid in our fundamental understanding of their reaction chemistry and provide insight into how biological systems can perform these reactions with relative ease. These methods are also expected to enable technological developments, including the use of abundant feedstock chemicals, such as methane, for alternative fuels production. Trainees on this project will become skilled at performing highly air- and moisture-sensitive synthetic chemistry. This work will be supplemented by the use of modern computational chemistry techniques, which will provide an information-rich supplement to the synthetic chemistry being performed in the laboratory. The project will contribute to ongoing outreach efforts aimed at introducing high school students to themes in energy science. This effort will involve the creation of short videos that provide visual aids for explaining important aspects of chemistry in an accessible and captivating manner. The videos will highlight concepts covered within a high school curriculum and dovetail them with the alternative fuels focus of this research project.<br/><br/>The activation of aliphatic C?H bonds is challenging for several reasons, including the need for a strong thermodynamic driving force for C?H bond cleavage. Copper ions, in combination with O2, are known to mediate strong C?H bond activation reactions in enzymes, but homogeneous systems have yet to adequately replicate this reactivity. This research seeks to bridge this divide through two complementary objectives. The first will create ligand scaffolds capable of engaging in low-barrier hydrogen bonds with a protonated cupric superoxide unit.  The added thermodynamic driving force for proton transfer imparted by these unique hydrogen bonding interactions is expected to boost C?H bond activation reactivity. The second will seek to shift the thermodynamic landscape for proton transfer under anaerobic conditions by introducing superbasic functionalities (pKa of conjugate acid greater than 16) into the primary or secondary coordination spheres of cupric complexes. This latter strategy will be supplemented by the use of machine learning to accelerate the discovery of critical factors controlling the capacity of various ligand systems to enable strong C?H bond activation. The research described in this proposal is aimed at generating the knowledge needed to create new classes of base metal complexes for the efficient and selective activation of low molecular weight alkanes. This work has the potential to advance our understanding of critical C?H bond activation chemistry, while guiding future studies on the catalytic processing of alternative fuels relevant to a renewable energy economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MATE interns work with marine technicians and scientists onboard research vessels. These experiences provide interns with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship and interpersonal skills. Ships that are part of the UNOLS and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) fleets will serve as internship hosts. While the program is open to all U.S. undergraduates, recruitment efforts are focused on community college students enrolled in marine technology programs and university students interested in marine technical careers. This training effort is important for the continued operation of the U.S. academic research fleet and for the marine industries that benefit by hiring the highly skilled technicians who graduate from the program.<br/><br/>With a focus on recruiting students from community colleges who are interested in careers as marine technicians, the MATE internship program fills a unique need in the continuum of support for undergraduate students in marine sciences. This program provides an excellent bridge between students who need hands-on training and employers who need technical support. The MATE internship program will provide a total of forty-five undergraduates with internships over the three-year period. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends and their travel to meet the research vessels where they will be working. The MATE internship program supports national goals by developing the next generation of technically skilled workforce. Skills and experience gained through all MATE internships vary depending on the research vessel, cruise goals and the tasks that mentors need to accomplish during the cruise. Typical experiences include: 1) cruise preparation and coordination; 2)operation and maintenance of specific oceanographic equipment [e.g. Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD), Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), fluorometer, transmissometer, temperature and salinity sampling, nutrient sampling, sonar and echosounders, current profilers, corers and nets, underwater cameras, AUVs, ROVs]; 3) trouble shooting instruments and equipment; 4) chemical analyses; 5) operation and maintenance of computer hardware and software; 6) programming software for data retrieval, analysis, and archiving; 7) seamanship, marine operations, and safety procedures; 8) navigation skills; 9) application of basic oceanographic and meteorological knowledge to sampling design and execution; 10) teamwork and other interpersonal skills; 11) experience working in a marine and scientific environment; and 12) communication skills.

Assessing the hazard associated with a fault zone requires understanding the conditions that promote earthquake nucleation. Shearing on faults can occur in an unstable manner, where rapid slip allows an earthquake to nucleate, or in a stable manner, where slip is steady and suppresses earthquake nucleation. Although much work has been devoted to understanding the conditions that lead to earthquake nucleation in the relatively cold portions of Earth?s crust, there is still a considerable gap in knowledge regarding the stability of faults in hotter regions. These hotter regions include the conduits of explosive volcanoes and transform faults in the oceans. This project will determine the influence of temperature on fault stability to enable accurate assessments of hazard and risk in these regions. This work will also provide training to early-career researchers at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. The team involved in this research will present on high-temperature experimental rock physics via international conferences, and they will run a short-course on earthquakes and faulting to be offered to early-career researchers around the world in an in-person and virtual format.<br/><br/>The project team will answer three questions related to fault stability at high temperatures. First, how do extreme temperatures affect the strength and stability of fault materials? To answer this question, deformation experiments will be conducted on fault materials over a wide range of conditions. Second, what microscopic mechanisms control the strength of fault materials, and how do they compete with one another? To answer this question, the team will use high-resolution microscopy to compare mechanical measurements with theoretical models based on the microphysics of rock deformation. Third, how do these mechanisms interact to determine fault stability, and what does this mean for the depth range of earthquakes in natural settings? To answer this question, the project team will assess the relationships among microscopic features, the macroscopic strength, the observed stability, and the rate of deformation. The net result of these observations will be a refined model for the stability of fault zones at high temperatures, which can then be compared to available catalogs of earthquake locations in relatively ?hot? regions to test predictions of the depth range of earthquake nucleation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research will explore the chemical properties and chemical reactions of these reactive molecules.  This research provides a foundation for understanding two very different problems ? one involving combustion and another involving the chemistry of space.  Combustion of organic fuels is central to our nation?s energy supply and national economy.  A fundamental understanding of combustion offers the possibility of enhancing the energy efficiency of fuel combustion and minimizing pollutants (soot) that arise from incomplete combustion.  In interstellar space, it is now known that hundreds of different organic compounds exist throughout the galaxy in environments that are harsh because they are so hot (near stars) or because they are so cold (far from stars).  Studying these environments is a crucial step in understanding the distribution of organic material in the universe and identifying molecules that could be precursors to life.   The proposed program benefits society by supporting the education of graduate and undergraduate students in the study of complex chemical problems as part of an interdisciplinary research team.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia.<br/><br/>The proposed research will explore the structure, reactivity, and spectroscopy of carbon-rich reactive intermediates.  The data obtained in these studies will provide a foundation for understanding the chemistry of organic matter in harsh environments.

The program will address fundamental questions concerning the chemical nature of what is now recognized to be the dominant reservoir of organic compounds in the universe.  The determination of accurate equilibrium structures will provide important benchmarks for prototypical organic molecules, and theory can be further used to establish thermodynamic parameters that are important for modeling combustion chemistry.  Studies of quantum mechanical tunneling reactions are of fundamental interest in mechanistic chemistry and are inherently relevant to chemical processes occurring in cold environments ? including interstellar clouds, planets, moons, small solar system bodies, and comets.

While development of infrastructure ramps up and the number of electric vehicles on the road continues to grow, the impact on the automotive and heavy equipment repair industry will need to be addressed. This project from Linn Benton Community College (LBCC) seeks to address the growing skills gap facing automotive and heavy equipment technicians in southwest Oregon. The college will leverage its existing automotive and heavy equipment diesel facilities to create a new one-year certificate that will focus on electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle technology. As part of this effort, the college will make a special effort to engage more female students in the college's advanced transportation technology program. Finally, the project will promote the development of advanced vehicle technician education programs regionally through a collaborative effort including neighboring community colleges and high schools.  <br/><br/>The project team recently completed an industry survey of dealerships, independent repair shops, and municipalities in the region to gauge their needs for current and future workers. Results from this survey will inform the creation of a new one-year certificate, which will be a new stackable credential that will contribute to the existing Advanced Vehicle Technology degree. Instructors from LBCC will complete industry recognized training to prepare them for the creation of six new courses on Advanced Transportation and Battery Vehicle Technology. To increase the representation of females, the college will participate in customized training sessions to make systemic changes that should result in increased female enrollment. Practices from this training will create a culture of support for female students, and should ultimately help to diversify the electric vehicle workforce. Results from this work will be shared regionally among Oregon's 17 community colleges, and nationally through the ATE community.

However, the process of failure reproduction is often manually done by developers, making the resolution of bugs inefficient and costly, especially since bug reports are often written in natural language. For example, bug reports may miss necessary steps-to-reproduce information or include unclear discussions. However, existing approaches are far from solving all problems in bug report reproduction. The first open problem is the bug oracle generation problem. Current approaches can only support reproducing crash bug reports while other types of bugs still need automatic-generated oracles to determine whether the bug has been reproduced or not. Another open problem is that reproducing environment configurations (e.g., Android SDK version) still requires human effort to manually collect information from bug reports and configure them. This project will develop a novel approach that can support reproducing more bug types of Android bug reports by automatically generating oracles and configuring environments. This research allows software developers to more quickly reproduce bug reports and to fix bugs, which will increase software quality. This, in turn, will benefit our modern society, which greatly relies on software. Additionally, this project contributes toward a diverse workforce, through integration with course curricula, training of students from underrepresented minority groups, and organizing summer workshops aimed at increasing K-12 girls? interest in STEM-related careers.<br/><br/>To substantially improve automated bug report reproduction by supporting oracle generation and environment configuration, novel techniques and tools will be developed that address three important challenges: (1) extract observation/expectation and environment information sentences in a bug report, (2) generate oracle assertion codes that can determine whether the targeted bug has been triggered, (3) configure reproducing environment. In this project, techniques and tools based on a combination of techniques include static/dynamic program analyses, deep learning, natural language processing, and web crawling. The approach will be embedded in a user interface and evaluated extensively on public bug reports and through industrial collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Models of small scale materials like nano magnets or designed meta-materials have fluctuations with spatial dependence that affect their performance.  These systems require the development of tools to account for the interaction of multiple sources of noise and spatially-correlated noise to predict both likely structure and transport, as well as unlikely events that could either help or be catastrophic to the system.  The mathematical advancement of this project includes utilizing these tools to find underlying mathematical mechanisms that can be used along with experimental observations, thus increasing our understanding of the physical world. This project contains a natural interdisciplinary blend of physics, biology and mathematics to train the current generation of applied mathematics students as the research field of applied mathematics grows in diversity. The investigators will continue working to increase participation in mathematics. Students have the opportunity to participate in local camps for high school girls in STEM, build mentoring networks at all levels, create inclusive and emotionally positive spaces, and use outstanding visualizations to promote mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>The applications in this project provide an arena for advancing the mathematical tools for analyzing large and infinite dimensional stochastic systems.  These tools center around bringing a system into the energy landscape framework of Langevin systems and further utilizing this framework to explain the system?s behavior.  Specifically, this project answers open problems regarding stochastic coarse-graining and large deviations.   Rather than standard averaging to remove the noise, investigators provide methods to retain both a deterministic term and a fluctuating term to account for the interaction of multiple sources of noise, as well as derive effective equations for a global variable (energy).  From the coarse-grained equations, the project offers methods to asymptotically approximate transition times between metastable states and show equivalence between different techniques on different limits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This alternation, called the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), has a variety of long-range influences, for instance it affects the chances of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and landfalling atmospheric rivers along the California coast.  Given its slow propagation and worldwide effects the MJO is the dominant driver of predictable weather and climate variations on the subseasonal timescale. Naturally the MJO has been a topic of intensive research since its discovery in 1971 but we still lack a satisfactory understanding of it, and models used for weather predictions and climate simulations have difficulty representing it.<br/><br/>One mystery of the MJO is its dependence on the direction of the stratospheric winds above it, which changes from easterly to westerly in a somewhat regular progression referred as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO).  The MJO is substantially more active in the easterly phase of the QBO, which features colder temperatures in the equatorial lower stratosphere along with the easterly winds.  Some researchers have argued that the colder temperatures promote the MJO by reducing upper tropospheric stability and thus strengthening MJO-related convection.  But the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this award hypothesize that colder temperatures matter because they promote cirrus clouds, which favor the MJO due to their infrared radiative feedback.  The cirrus cloud hypothesis is motivated by several aspects of the QBO influence, among them that the influence does not appear prior to 1980.  The 1980 onset makes sense because the stratosphere was warmer prior to 1980 and thus cirrus clouds would have been less susceptible to the cooling effect of the easterly QBO phase.  The QBO-MJO relationship is explored through a variety of activities including analysis of data from several satellite missions (including COSMIC, CALYPSO, MLS) and reanalysis datasets, climate model simulations, and a simple linear model (based on the one used in AGS-2201441).<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific value given the influence of the MJO on weather around the world and the possibility that the MJO could be predictable given better understanding of its behavior. The PIs conduct a webinar series to exchange research results with the MJO research community, and the lead PI is developing an online Spanish language workshop on the role of cloud processes in weather and climate.  In addition, the project provide support and training to two graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tsunamis generated at this subduction zone may also impact the U.S. East Coast. This project supports land and sea seismic experiments across the PRT and Puerto Rico. The experiments will define the detailed seismic structure of the PRT, advance our understanding of the PRT, and improve hazard assessment. The project consists of: (1) Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles using ocean bottom seismometers (OBS); (2) Seven multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, two parallel to and inland from the trench, and five across the trench. (3) An array of 100 short-period land nodal seismometers deployed across the Puerto Rico island. The project will provide support for training several graduate students and an early career scientist, as well as research opportunities for faculty and students at a minority serving institution.<br/><br/><br/>This project supports an active-source seismic experiment across the Puerto Rico Trench (PRT), its outer rise, and across the Puerto Rico island arc. The PRT is a highly oblique subduction zone, where old Atlantic plate subducts under the Caribbean plate at a slow rate. The PRT is associated with anomalous and unexplained characteristics, such as the widest trench (below 6,000 m), the lowest gravity anomaly on Earth, and anomalous subsidence of the north coast of Puerto Rico. This project will acquire, analyze, and interpret multiple types of data: Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles across the PRT with OBSs, with one of the lines extending to south of the Puerto Rico island and including an array of land nodal seismometers deployed across the Puerto Rico island; seven MCS reflection profiles, two parallel and five perpendicular to the PRT axis; and multibeam bathymetry, 3.5 kHz sub-bottom profiler, gravity, and magnetics. The experiments are designed to address three key questions: (1) What is the shallow geometry of the subducting slab and its lateral continuity along the 500-km section of the trench? (2) What are the degree and spatial extent of hydration of the Atlantic lithosphere entering the Puerto Rico Trench? (3) Does oceanic bivergent thrust system represent double-sided subduction or a crustal retro-wedge of one-sided subduction? The integrated seismic experiments, together with the other ancillary geophysical datasets, will produce two-dimensional seismic reflection images, P-wave and S-wave travel-time tomography 2-D models, and gravity-derived density models of the study region. These results are expected to significantly advance our understanding of the above scientific questions and assessment of the PRT seismic and tsunami hazard.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The isotope compositions of deep-earth minerals are controlled by a process named isotope fractionation, in which different isotopes redistribute between different minerals under various pressures and temperatures. There are three conventional ways to constrain equilibrium isotope fractionation in deep-earth minerals, namely theoretical calculation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear resonance scattering. However, each method has its own challenges. Theoretical calculation is limited by physical approximations used in the model and has to be benchmarked by experiments; mass spectroscopy has difficulty in determining the attainment of equilibrium and is time-consuming; and nuclear resonance scattering can only be applied to the few Mössbauer-active elements. This proposal describes a novel multidisciplinary study on the isotope fractionations of deep-earth minerals that are difficult to be constrained by conventional experimental approaches, through collaborative and synergetic efforts by combining state-of-the-art X-ray spectroscopy with theoretical calculations. The researcher's approach is experimentally benchmarked, time-efficient, directly reflects the equilibrium isotope fractionation, and can be applied to nearly all elements. They aim to answer the following questions with their proposed study: 1) How do the Mössbauer-inactive elements in deep-earth minerals redistribute with pressure, temperature, and crystal structure? 2) How to constrain the fractionation of Mössbauer-inactive elements in deep earth solid solutions efficiently? and 3) How does vibrational anharmonicity affect the isotope fractionation in mantle silicates? The project will support three early to mid-career researchers to continue their research at the University of Hawaii at Maona (Zhang and B. Chen) and Purdue University (M. Chen). Through this project, the team will develop both experimental instruments at a national user facility and open-source codes for computation, and the research suite will be available to domestic and international researchers in earth sciences and beyond. Undergraduate assistants and postdoc scholars will be involved in this project. This project is also committed to establishing the career development pathways for the involved early-career researchers, pushing for the gender and racial equality in geoscience, and broadening the participation in STEM of traditionally underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The fractionation of the isotopes of constituent elements of mantle minerals at high P-T conditions are considered the ramifications of the differentiation of the Earth, offering crucial clues for the mantle?s composition and chemical evolution. Previous studies on the isotope fractionation of Mössbauer-inactive elements between minerals were either measured using mass spectroscopy in which the attainment of equilibrium requires additional caution, or estimated from theoretical calculations without corroboration from experiments. The researchers have demonstrated that the reduced partition function ratio (?-factor) of tetracoordinated Si can be constrained by theoretical-calculation-calibrated in-situ high-T SXD experiments. In this proposed project, they will extend the method to determine experimentally constrained ?-factors of hexacoordinated Si in non-quenchable deep-earth minerals for the first time. They will also tackle challenges to establish an efficient approach to determine ?-factors in solid solutions by theoretical calculations, which are to be benchmarked by SXD experiments and thus allows them to investigate the isotope fractionation of hexacoordinated Ti in deep-earth minerals. Their proposed combined approach circumvents direct theoretical modeling of solid solutions, which significantly reduces computational costs. Using the combined approaches of experiments and theoretical modeling, the correction to Si ?-factor in hydrous phyllosilicates induced by the vibrational anharmonicity will be investigated. The proposed experimentally benchmarked machine learning framework to establish a highly accurate yet efficient model will allow them to provide reliable estimations of Si ?-factor in anharmonic mineral systems. Though they only propose to study select Mössbauer-inactive elements (Si & Ti) in this proposal, the same approach can be extended to other elements such as C, O, Mg, and Ca. All the three proposed tasks will build the foundation for a complete landscape of isotope distribution in mantle minerals, and will enhance understanding of the Earth?s isotopic composition and in turn its chemical evolution. This project is jointly funded by Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior (CSEDI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In quantum mechanics, this is wrong: if you measure momentum before position, you can get a different answer than if you do the measurements the other way around; this is a manifestation of the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Mathematicians call this phenomenon ? that order matters ? ?noncommutativity.?  Noncommutative systems are much harder to understand than classical ones.  The bulk of this project, which aims to better understand noncommutative systems, concerns the so-called ?universal coefficient theorem problem.? On a very rough level, it asks whether it is true that any (reasonable) noncommutative system can be replaced by a classical one, such that doing computations in the classical system gets the same results.  Other parts of the project concern direct applications of the same ideas to approximation problems in the study of geometry and symmetry.  The project will also involve both undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>The project intends to use approximation methods to study the so-called universal coefficient theorem (UCT) problem, which asks if any separable nuclear operator algebra (potentially highly noncommutative) is equivalent on the level of K-theory to a commutative one.  The recent impressive successes in the Elliott program to classify simple nuclear C*-algebras have thrown this problem into sharp relief: it is now the only extra ingredient needed to get the best possible classification result.  The approximation methods should be useful in other areas: two projects building on these ideas study approximation properties of word hyperbolic groups and finite-dimensional models for elliptic differential operators on manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous archaeological scholarship has often attempted to understand Native artifacts and their significance using frameworks informed by Western traditions. In contrast, this project interprets ancient American Indian ceramics within the context of philosophical tenets espoused by contemporary Native North American cultures. This approach generates novel insights into the significance of Indigenous art, namely how such objects may have contributed to the sacred and secular underpinnings of Native communities. Importantly, this approach, which also includes frequent communication with modern American Indian nations and their tribal historic preservation offices, demonstrates how North American archaeological research focusing on Indigenous topics can be conducted ethically and respectfully. This project ultimately strives to produce results that can be used by descendant communities in ways that they deem most valuable to their own people and tribal objectives. A virtual museum exhibit displaying vessel photos, 3D models, and interpretive details produced and shared with Native collaborators as well as other scholars and the general public as the tribes wish.<br/><br/>The doctoral student specifically assesses the political and cosmological significance of decorated ceramics produced by American Indians in the Mississippi Valley of Arkansas and Missouri during the fifteenth century AD. Here, potters living within a densely populated and highly contentious political landscape created a large quantity of painted and engraved ceramic vessels that depicted the Native cosmos, spirit beings, and culture heroes. An examination of this art offers new perspectives on the relationships between politics and religion among past Indigenous communities living in the American South. Using an innovative combination of iconographic analysis, 3D modeling, and geographic information systems, this project  (1) describes fundamental aspects of production, function, and imagery among these pottery vessels and then (2) interprets the sacred and secular significance of this art corpus within the context of American Indian philosophical tenets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This framework will enable more accurate modeling of the effect of fire on cold-formed steel structures that will support improved design methods for advancing national prosperity and welfare through better safety, resource efficiency, and resilience against fire. Lightweight cold-formed steel structural systems, with high strength-to-weight ratio and rapid construction speed, are widely used in nonresidential construction in the United States. Cold-formed steel structures are traditionally protected from fire based on prescriptive provisions derived from standardized testing. However, the reliance on prescriptive provisions is costly and impedes innovation toward more sustainable and affordable buildings. This research project will develop experimental and computational capabilities for the fire analysis of cold-formed steel structures that will advance understanding of the fundamental relationship between the thermal exposure and the stability and strength of these thin-walled members, to enable better structural fire designs. The research will be complemented by an educational and outreach program to engage a broad audience on the role of structural fire engineers in building resilient communities against extreme hazards. The program will include curriculum development, outreach activities, and educational videos developed in collaboration with the Maryland Institute College of Art. Data generated from this project will be made publicly available in the National Science Foundation-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-CI.org). <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to enable performance-based fire design for cold-formed steel structures by developing the capability to quantify the fire behavior of the thin-walled framing members. This behavior is largely governed by the interaction between buckling failure modes and elevated temperatures. Thus, this project will include: (i) testing of cold-formed steel studs and joists using an innovative experimental method allowing a range of transient high temperature conditions, (ii) development of thermal-mechanical computational modeling strategies and creation of high-fidelity numerical benchmarks, and (iii) development of analysis-based methods for assessing the fire performance of cold-formed steel structures. The provided data and methods will answer fundamental questions about the complex fire-thermal-structural interaction in these thin-walled members. The research thus has the potential to improve understanding of the mechanics of stability-critical structures in fire and advance simulation capability for cold-formed steel structures under physically based design fires. Beyond cold-formed steel structures, the research will create a leap toward integration of structural fire within the design procedure alongside other loading cases, which supports consistent performance-based and risk-informed design, structural optimization, and multi-hazard resilience assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These glycolipids, which are referred to as phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), play essential roles in bacterial cellular defense, integrity, and immunological activity. While PIMs and related molecules are unique to the Corynebacterineae and contribute to these organisms? distinctive physiological and pathogenic characteristics, many aspects of how these glycolipids are constructed and organized in bacterial cells remain unknown. Such knowledge gaps remain because PIMs are challenging to study using traditional techniques and there is a lack of modern tools for analyzing them. This project seeks to develop new chemical biology tools to allow specific tagging and tracking of PIMs and related glycolipids in cellular contexts. Applications of this toolbox could provide a better understanding of how the Corynebacterineae construct their cell envelope. Undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow working on this research will acquire interdisciplinary training in organic synthesis, chemical biology, and microbiology. To promote interdisciplinary training and communication, students and postdocs at both institutions will meet regularly virtually to discuss the project. This project will be integrated into an outreach program to introduce community college students to chemical bacteriology research and to encourage their continued education in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The tools generated in this project are expected to be broadly applicable and support other scientists pursuing research on the Corynebacterineae.<br/><br/>Phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and their highly glycosylated derivatives, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), are difficult to investigate using traditional techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology because they consist of highly complex, non-genetically encoded lipids and sugars. To address this problem, this research project seeks to develop synthetic carbohydrate-based probes that exploit native and genetically engineered metabolic pathways to introduce chemical tags into PIMs, LM, and LAM in live bacteria. Fluorescently labeled glycolipid molecules will be tested in whole cells, potentially providing a means to track the glycolipids specifically in a cellular context. The probes developed in this project are expected to provide information on (i) the spatiotemporal dynamics of PIM, LM, and LAM construction in live bacterial cells; and (ii) the identity of the protein(s) that is/are responsible for transport of PIMs across the bacterial inner membrane. The findings from this project are expected to provide an improved understanding of glycolipid biosynthesis and dynamics, which could provide insight into the physiology of bacteria in the Corynebacterineae suborder.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Assessing the hazard associated with a fault zone requires understanding the conditions that promote earthquake nucleation. Shearing on faults can occur in an unstable manner, where rapid slip allows an earthquake to nucleate, or in a stable manner, where slip is steady and suppresses earthquake nucleation. Although much work has been devoted to understanding the conditions that lead to earthquake nucleation in the relatively cold portions of Earth?s crust, there is still a considerable gap in knowledge regarding the stability of faults in hotter regions. These hotter regions include the conduits of explosive volcanoes and transform faults in the oceans. This project will determine the influence of temperature on fault stability to enable accurate assessments of hazard and risk in these regions. This work will also provide training to early-career researchers at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. The team involved in this research will present on high-temperature experimental rock physics via international conferences, and they will run a short-course on earthquakes and faulting to be offered to early-career researchers around the world in an in-person and virtual format.<br/><br/>The project team will answer three questions related to fault stability at high temperatures. First, how do extreme temperatures affect the strength and stability of fault materials? To answer this question, deformation experiments will be conducted on fault materials over a wide range of conditions. Second, what microscopic mechanisms control the strength of fault materials, and how do they compete with one another? To answer this question, the team will use high-resolution microscopy to compare mechanical measurements with theoretical models based on the microphysics of rock deformation. Third, how do these mechanisms interact to determine fault stability, and what does this mean for the depth range of earthquakes in natural settings? To answer this question, the project team will assess the relationships among microscopic features, the macroscopic strength, the observed stability, and the rate of deformation. The net result of these observations will be a refined model for the stability of fault zones at high temperatures, which can then be compared to available catalogs of earthquake locations in relatively ?hot? regions to test predictions of the depth range of earthquake nucleation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PRT is a highly oblique subduction zone, where old Atlantic plate subducts under the Caribbean plate at a slow rate. The PRT is associated with anomalous and unexplained characteristics, such as the widest trench (below 6,000 m), the lowest gravity anomaly on Earth, and anomalous subsidence of the north coast of Puerto Rico. This project will acquire, analyze, and interpret multiple types of data: Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles across the PRT with OBSs, with one of the lines extending to south of the Puerto Rico island and including an array of land nodal seismometers deployed across the Puerto Rico island; seven MCS reflection profiles, two parallel and five perpendicular to the PRT axis; and multibeam bathymetry, 3.5 kHz sub-bottom profiler, gravity, and magnetics. The experiments are designed to address three key questions: (1) What is the shallow geometry of the subducting slab and its lateral continuity along the 500-km section of the trench? (2) What are the degree and spatial extent of hydration of the Atlantic lithosphere entering the Puerto Rico Trench? (3) Does oceanic bivergent thrust system represent double-sided subduction or a crustal retro-wedge of one-sided subduction? The integrated seismic experiments, together with the other ancillary geophysical datasets, will produce two-dimensional seismic reflection images, P-wave and S-wave travel-time tomography 2-D models, and gravity-derived density models of the study region.

The results from this project has the potential to provide fundamental chemistry knowledge to other areas of research where ionic species  are involved, such as catalysis, energy storage materials, ion transport in biological systems, separation, and sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is affecting this synchrony and this mismatch will have cascading effects on our ecosystems. This project will examine the connection between migratory timing and resource availability in a songbird. Resources on the breeding grounds (e.g., insects important for raising young) are peaking earlier each year. Songbirds may not be able to respond to these changes, modifying the timing of their migration to arrive on the breeding grounds earlier. This mismatch is not only of concern to researchers; federal and state wildlife agencies are also trying to prepare for the downstream consequences of this phenomenon. Accordingly, this project was designed in collaboration with wildlife agencies. Results will help policy makers assess existing protection policies and test new management plans for migratory songbirds. Local outreach along the migratory flyway is also planned (e.g., educational programming on migration that will connect children across North and South America). Underrepresented groups in STEM will also be recruited in this project and included in both the research and outreach plans.<br/><br/>Plasticity and adaptation could allow migrants to advance their migratory timing, but direct estimates of these mechanisms and their molecular basis are rare and restricted to a small number of proximate populations. This project will begin filling this knowledge gap, using state-of-the-art tools from several disciplines (e.g., animal movement ecology, genomics and computer modeling) and data from a broad geographic scale. Specifically, (1) plasticity and (2) adaptation for migratory timing will be estimated and (3) the molecular basis of this trait will be examined. Estimates of plasticity and adaptation will then be (4) integrated into models predicting how populations will respond to climate change and specific conservation strategies being proposed for this group. The species chosen for this work already shows advances in their migratory timing, but these advances are weaker in populations that breed further north. This trend could relate to the fact that environmental conditions on the breeding grounds are less predictable for northern breeders and is a question this project will address. Results from this project will be relevant to many fields (e.g., genetics, behavior and evolution) and the predictive framework can be used for other systems, traits and environmental variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The observatory has remained highly productive ? both in science output and in the development of state-of-the-art instrumentation. This includes more than a hundred peer-reviewed publications over the past four years, as well as operations of the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) as a community facility and upgrading GST instrumentation to meet the evolving scientific requirements of users in the U.S. and worldwide. GST is one of the highest-resolution solar telescopes in the world. Owing to the extended periods of stable excellent seeing at Big Bear Lake, GST with its high-order adaptive optics (AO), routinely collects diffraction-limited spatial resolution (~ 0"".1, or 70 km on the solar surface) photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric data, with a high cadence (< 40 s), across the spectrum from 430 nm to 8.2 ?m. This award supports five years of backbone support for BBSO operations, science, and education activities. BBSO will continue operating GST as a community facility. GST data and a substantial portion of the GST observing time are open to any solar physicists in the US. GST data have been and will be used in many Ph.D. theses. BBSO will continue supporting the NSF-REU program by providing undergraduate students with hands-on experience in astronomical data analysis, high-resolution observations, and instrument development. The graduate student support will include involvement by students in astrophysics and includes two summer schools at BBSO, to train graduate students/postdocs/junior researchers on techniques in ground-based solar physics.<br/><br/>GST will continue playing a crucial and irreplaceable role in high-resolution solar physics to advance our understanding of the origin of space weather and the fundamental nature of the solar atmosphere. GST is the only large-aperture solar telescope that commonly experiences excellent seeing conditions lasting many hours on a regular basis. During the upcoming maximum of Solar Cycle 25, the period covered by the award, BBSO will obtain, analyze, and interpret a wealth of high-resolution solar data. Using this resource, BBSO will develop and apply analytical tools to attack a number of critical, leading-edge problems in space weather research, with a particular focus on high-resolution observations and studies of solar eruptions, including (1) Elementary Magnetic Reconnection, (2) Flare Energetics in Lower Solar Atmosphere, (3) 3-D Magnetic Structure of Flare Productive Active Regions, (4) Data-based Modeling to Understand Flare Triggering, and (5) Small-scale Magnetic Flux Ropes and Associated Jets. Solar eruptions are the key sources of space weather, impacting the daily life of humans through effects on communication, transportation, power systems, national defense, and space travel. Moreover, BBSO will work to enhance coordination with NSF?s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) in telescope operations, instrumentation development and science. GST and DKIST are complementary in instrument capabilities and discovery space. BBSO community users, who are distributed across 61 universities, observatories, and institutes in 21 countries have been granted the majority of the GST observing time (> 80%). BBSO actively supports coordinated campaign observations with NASA space, rocket and balloon missions (e.g., Parker Solar Probe), and other large ground-based facilities. BBSO now provides a permanent home to the NSF?s Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigation of the Sun (SOLIS) facility built by the National Solar Observatory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because many faculty both developed and made considerable use of online resources when courses were taught remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, this is an important time for college teachers to share and build upon those experiences to make better use of web-based tools and data in teaching. Through presentations and discussions, the participants will identify and create new ways to use online resources to improve student learning in their classes. In the geosciences, some highly interactive web pages have been developed to help students understand complex topics by building on the positive effects of student-active learning. On those web pages, students are given control over graphs and other diagrams so that they can change both the data displayed, including uploading their own data, and also change features of the display itself. During the workshop, small groups of participants will design learning activities that take advantage of online interactive web pages based upon their collective knowledge and recent web experiences. The resulting activities will be made available for use by all teachers and students with access to computers. Outcomes from this workshop will be significant beyond the geosciences, serving as examples for other STEM disciplines with difficult concepts to teach. <br/><br/>Participants in the workshop will be geologists who teach courses about igneous and metamorphic rocks and/or combined mineralogy/petrology (earth materials) courses.

Recent developments in online resources for teaching petrology offer new paths to enhance and perhaps accelerate petrology learning. Web-based tools that bring these diagrams and models alive with mouseover, slider, and other effects have the potential to facilitate student learning of these difficult concepts and investigative approaches. A principal goal of the workshop is for petrology teachers, working together, to identify and develop new ways to use online resources to improve teaching and learning. The products of their work will be shared online with other teachers, following the good example of past petrology teaching workshops documented on the Science Education Resource Center website.

Catalysis is estimated to contribute approximately 35% of the global gross domestic product. Heterogeneous catalysis is a sub-class of catalysis, and is a process by which very small metallic nanoparticles (of only a couple of nanometers in size) that are supported on non-reactive substrates are used for chemical conversions. Because these particles are microscopic, nearly all their atoms are on the nanoparticle's surface. Surface atoms have a higher energy than atoms that are present in the nanoparticle bulk because they are not fully bonded. This lack of full bond is essential as it allows them to act as catalysts, but it also leads to problems. Because catalysis occurs in highly reactive environments (including high temperatures and aggressive environments), the atoms at the surface can be driven off of the nanoparticle. These atoms can migrate around and can lead to arrangements that reduce their ability to be effective at further catalysis. This project uses real-time, high-resolution imaging to see these processes directly and tightly couple these observations with computer simulations to determine the fundamental physical mechanisms that degrade catalytic performance. The work is being performed primarily by graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania and Northwestern University. This project incorporates undergraduate students at both institutions in the research efforts, as well as students from minority-serving institutions such as the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. The research outcomes provide scientists with the needed understanding to help stabilize heterogeneous catalysts during reactions, potentially leading to substantial savings in both cost and energy usage.<br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>One of the most critical applications of metal nanoparticles is in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where their small size leads to a prevalence of under-coordinated surface sites that facilitate the conversion of reactants to products. However, a high concentration of under-coordinated surface sites increases the total surface energy, which drives particle evolution via coarsening, coalescence, and evaporation. These processes eventually lead to a decrease in overall catalytic activity. While these phenomena are understood generally, existing theoretical descriptions are mean-field and are under debate. This project uses high-throughput, quantitative image analysis to analyze in-situ transmission electron microscopy data at the University of Pennsylvania. This data is tightly linked to large-scale simulations at Northwestern University. Through the resulting iteration between the ?ground truth? of experimental observations and simulations, this research is determining 1) how rough surfaces affect the dynamics of contact lines and thus nanoparticle evolution, 2) how particle size and placement affect nanoparticle growth, and 3) the role of surface energy anisotropy. In addition to providing an improved fundamental understanding of these processes, these studies suggest new routes to mitigate unwanted coarsening in technologically relevant systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will facilitate novel practices and activities that could be replicated and implemented not only in other NMSU disciplines, but also in other academic settings, including other minority serving institutions (MSIs) with similar student demographics and characteristics.<br/><br/>The Electrical and Computer Engineering Wisdom Community at NMSU?s goal is to identify and establish best practices, impactful attributes, recommendations, and implications for using online media and Mixed Reality (MR) spaces to support STEM communities of practice. The research paradigm is educational design and development research. It includes an analysis of needs and goals and exploration of the learning context to design and construct a functional ECE-WisCom Learning Management System (LMS) prototype. An evaluation and reflection upon the design features of the ECE-WisCom and its effects on ECE students? academic performance will be conducted as well. The research design consists of a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of the MR platform once it is in use. The envisioned MR platform will maximize four outcomes: community, identity formation, critical thinking, and academic performance. The dissemination includes the development of a website to facilitate practices and activities that can be replicated in other academic settings, including other MSIs and HSIs. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research: (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves the STEM undergraduate education enterprise's understanding of how to build institutional capacity to undertake lasting change at HSIs that are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sustainable structures with GI are needed to tackle climate change. This research will address a critical gap in resources for practicing engineers and users of buildings with GI in regions with seismic/wind risk with a set of applied guidelines for weight variations of GI, including associated demands at various moisture content levels for optimal structural performance. The educational plan includes an educational video series on sustainable structural resilience for undergraduate and graduate students and research experiences for five university student assistants from underrepresented groups. Further, open access to research results, design guidelines, and new educational materials will inform civil engineering students in the California State University system, practicing civil engineers in the U.S., and public consumers to increase sustainability efforts and decrease negative impacts of climate change and natural hazard events. Data generated from this project will be made publicly available in the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-CI.org). This award supports the NSF role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.  <br/><br/>The goal of this award is advance knowledge on GI?s sensitivities, influences on structural behavior, and potential as a mitigation strategy. There is an established need to characterize structural response as a combined effort between sustainable and resilient design because the increase in GI usage over the past several decades has outpaced research to support the engineering community in its design efforts. The project?s research objectives include: (1) quantification of structural behavior distributions due to changes in the GI from natural hazards (i.e., drought, storm surge), natural growth, and other life-cycle factors (i.e., poor maintenance); (2) development of an initial design strategy for increased seismic performance; and (3) creation of a transformative set of design guidelines for sustainable structures considering GI variabilities. This will be achieved through sensitivity analyses of modal behavior and testing of a strategic GI plan using nonlinear time history analyses for a seismic scenario. The educational goals are to train the next generation of civil engineers to understand sustainable building designs with new, open-access educational materials and to inform practicing civil engineers and the public about the positive impacts of sustainability efforts that decrease the negative impacts of climate change and wind/seismic events. Informing and building engineering confidence in GI design will: (1) increase structural resilience with improved designs, modeling, and analysis procedures; (2) reduce the human/economic costs associated with structural failure; and (3) increase the use of GI while promoting sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For coastal populations in the developing world, where the use of onsite sanitation is prevalent, the risk of groundwater cross-contamination from septic systems presents an added challenge. Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), peri-urban communities commonly lack access to potable water, compelling households to rely on shallow groundwater, sourced largely from hand-dug wells. Similarly, these communities also lack access to improved sanitation facilities, resulting in a proliferation of onsite systems, such as septic tanks and pit latrines. Routinely, groundwater wells end up too close to toilet facilities, heightening the risk of groundwater cross-contamination. The risks to human health from this dual threat are not in doubt. However, contaminant migration pathways in subsoil media, as well as the factors that drive contamination, are often complex and site-specific. Hence, a litany of physical, chemical, and biological parameters, and physiographic factors, must be well understood to conceptualize and advance sustainable solutions. Relatedly, the need for a trained, globally competent scientists and engineers who can address current and future water challenges has never been greater. This project will address both needs by; (1) undertaking high-impact water quality research to broadly assess impacts of saltwater intrusion and on-site sanitation facilities on coastal groundwater quality in Cape Coast, Ghana, a location that typifies the dual challenge, and 2) strengthen the professional preparation of US students as future, globally engaged water resources scientists and engineers. Faculty at Shippensburg University (SU) and University of South Florida (USF) will work collaboratively with their counterparts at the University of Cape Coast (UCC), in Ghana, to bring three cohorts of US students (grad and undergrad) to Ghana and engage them in transformational learning experiences via research in water quality, sanitation, and climate change. This project will strategically recruit underrepresented minority groups, including females, as an incentive to broaden their participation in international STEM research and enhance their standing in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The project will address three major themes:<br/>1. Effects of onsite sanitation on groundwater quality: To explore the vulnerability of shallow groundwater to onsite sanitation, student participants will conduct both field evaluations and laboratory analyses of groundwater samples for specific chemical and microbial contaminants. They will evaluate existing sanitation infrastructure (e.g., size of septic system & number of users per household), calculate septic system densities, collect GPS coordinates of wells and septic systems, perform soil tests, and assess other pertinent factors to help characterize and attribute sources of vulnerability.<br/>2. Effects of sea level rise on groundwater quality: Although evidence of saltwater intrusion into wells has been reported for some of the communities closest to the coastline, it is not clear how far inland the saltwater has encroached. The US students will work collaboratively with their UCC partners, to determine the spatial extent of saltwater intrusion in the area. They will conduct in-situ measurements of wells for salinity/conductivity/TDS, test water samples in the laboratory, and perform spatial statistical analyses on their results.<br/>3. Education: An important component of this project is a proposed annual water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) Fair. The different cohorts of US students will collaborate with their local partners, mentors, and local high school (HS) students (and their teachers) to implement a WASH fair, which<br/>will become an annual event providing WASH advisory services to the local communities beyond the life of this project. The project also has another outreach component where the US students will engage with community members for knowledge sharing. They will collaborate with Ghanaian HS teachers to develop a local program for HS students to continue routine well water monitoring into the future.<br/><br/>Overall, the project will give US students first-hand experiences with the critical water quality conditions in a developing country context, and enhance their interdisciplinary, problem-solving, and collaborative skills. Through their interactions with local researchers and communities, the US students will further gain knowledge of the social-cultural underpinnings that complicate water quality challenges in the developing world and how to propose solutions from a global context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aerosols are crucially important for weather and climate because they scatter sunlight and act as the base for developing cloud droplets.  This award will provide funding for a team of researchers from Appalachian State University and Georgia Tech to study the growth of particles with increasing humidity, and the range of particle sizes that serve as the base for cloud droplets.  Aerosol impacts on climate have been highlighted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports as a key uncertainty for climate projections.  The project has significant educational and training benefits, with plans for 8-12 undergraduate and Master?s level students to be involved in the project.  Appalachian State is a primarily undergraduate university and will benefit from collaboration with a research-intensive institution.  <br/><br/>The overarching scientific objective of this award is to train, evaluate, and apply measurement-trained models for calculating aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra at an aerosol network site at Appalachian State University, in Boone, North Carolina.  ALWC cannot be directly measured, but it can be estimated from more commonly-measured aerosol optical properties.  Intensive field campaigns during the winter and summer of 2024 would provide the necessary data to develop, train, and evaluate machine learning models that would be used to calculate ALWC and CCN spectra.  Those models would then be retrospectively applied to the historical database of measurements at Appalachian St. to examine how and why aerosol hygroscopicity, ALWC and CCN spectra are changing.  More specifically, the researchers will test the following hypotheses:<br/><br/>1. Machine learning models such as Random Forest, when trained using regionally-representative particle number size distributions and aerosol optical properties, are capable of predicting ALWC and CCN spectra at the Appalachian St. site;<br/>2. Changing aerosol composition in the Southeastern US is leading to less hygroscopic aerosols measured at Appalachian St. over recent years. Less hygroscopic particles in turn are leading to lower ALWC.<br/>3. Changing aerosol composition, hygroscopicity, and fine-mode particle size over the last decade are reducing the CCN concentrations at the Appalachian St. site at different supersaturation values.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences to support AI/ML advancement in the geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop both a pathway for students and training resources for instructors offering the coursework leading to the Electric Vehicle Service and Repair certificate. Over the three-year project, 50 students will be recruited to complete credit bearing courses that will result in an EV Service and Repair certificate enabling them to work in the ever-growing EV repair field. Also, professional development for faculty addressing the new EV curricula will be provided. With mentorship from the CA2VES ATE Center (Center for Aviation and Automotive Technological Education Using Virtual E-Schools), and advisement from EV consortia members, this project will create equitable opportunities for underserved populations in South Carolina to progress to two- and four-year institutions and to the workplace. The project will integrate classroom and virtual learning to increase and diversify the pool of EV service technicians. This will be accomplished by implementing practices to support participation and persistence in EV service technician education for students including those who are rural, underserved, and/or underrepresented in the EV industry. The flexible hybrid approach allows for personalized learning to support students with different backgrounds to achieve proficiency in a shorter time period and attain certification. The assessment of the effectiveness of this hybrid approach regarding creativity and innovation in teaching and learning, digital learning technology, and workforce development will advance ATE knowledge.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to better prepare diverse students to enter the EV workforce or continued education through implementing a hybrid curriculum and providing training for faculty. Working closely with NSF-funded EV consortia, the project will refine and deploy an innovative, creative, and informed EV service industry technician education hybrid curriculum incorporating classroom and virtual learning to augment Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certification courses and complement existing advanced manufacturing research. Additionally, this project will provide professional development for faculty and trainers addressing the augmented EV curricula and create a novel ""Train the Trainer"" program to ensure widespread use. Finally, the project will recruit, retain, and graduate students from EV technician education programs, build career pathways and address South Carolina?s need to build capacity and diversity in the EV maintenance workforce. Fifty students are expected to enroll over three years, and at least twenty-five instructors will be impacted as the ""Train the Trainer"" program is established. Students will participate in in-person and on-line synchronous and asynchronous lectures with in-person labs for all EV Service Technician courses starting with Engine Fundamentals in their first year.

These extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are important astronomical sources of GWs that will be observed by the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detector, which is under cooperative development by NASA and the European Space Agency. This project involves pursuit of a new approach to mathematical modeling that is able to achieve improved realism in a way that avoids technical hindrances encountered in prior work. Accurate EMRI models implemented through this award will enable LISA observations to reveal the inner workings of gravitational interactions like never before. This work involves direct training of quantitative technical skills for undergraduate student researchers, which are highly transferable to STEM related careers in other sectors. This award supports a synergistic physics education research project that will simultaneously improve upper-level undergraduate physics instruction and provide a testing ground to research new mathematical modeling techniques.<br/> <br/>The research objective of this award is to determine how relativistic two-body interactions influence the dynamics of EMRIs utilizing a new approach to self-force (SF) calculations recently discovered by the PI?s research group. Two-body interactions governing EMRIs are accurately dissected by applying black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) to expand the gravitational field and associated SF exerted on the secondary body up to an appropriate order in powers of the small mass-ratio. The new approach pursued by this project involves computation of Kerr metric perturbations by solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), which avoids previously encountered numerical instabilities in Lorenz gauge self-force calculations. Those instabilities are avoided by entering the frequency domain, where the field equations involve only r and theta derivatives and are solved numerically. This project will research and implement the novel elliptic PDE SF method to calculate the 1st order Lorenz gauge Kerr gravitational SF, which opens a pathway to begin exploring the needed 2nd-order Kerr SF. Completion of this project will enhance fundamental understanding of gravitational physics and EMRI dynamics in ways that will assist GW data analysis and reveal the foundations of strong-field gravity with unprecedented precision.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is the 16th edition of an annual series, previous iterations of which have been held in ten different countries on four continents. The goal of the conference is to bring together both early career and established researchers in combinatorial, asymptotic, and geometric aspects of infinite group theory together with researchers in dynamics and discrete probability, to consolidate recent advances based on the interplay between these subjects and to spark new interactions. The conference will feature plenary talks and a discussion session of open problems. Organizers plan a targeted recruitment process to broaden participation among groups that are traditionally underrepresented in these fields. <br/><br/>The topics of the conference include random walks and boundaries, ergodic-theoretic methods, and groups of dynamical origins. The conference will feature three plenary talks. The first will focus on interactions between geometry and discrete probability with applications to random walks, percolation, and the Ising modeling of statistical mechanics. The second involves applications of the geometry of buildings and group actions on cell complexes with climate scientists, in the implementation of the computer package that is used in climate simulation and weather prediction. The third talk will cover applications of combinatorial curvature to analyze the structure of geometric networks.  Probabilistic properties of random walks on groups reveal a close relationship between geometric and algebraic properties. This relationship has been made explicit for the class of hyperbolic groups via the equivalence of the Martin and Gromov boundaries. Exploring this relationship outside the class of hyperbolic groups has resulted in the construction of new notions of boundaries that will be discussed at this conference. Ergodic-theoretic notions and theorems from the classical setting of manifolds have just begun to be understood for more general spaces and groups. Much work remains in relating ergodic-theoretic, group-theoretic, and geometric invariants even in the hyperbolic case.  Finally, groups of dynamical origin have recently provided new examples of infinite groups that settle long-standing open problems in the area. Those examples as well as future directions for study will be discussed at the conference as well.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted classrooms to virtual learning modes, which negatively impacted the retention of many of our undergraduate students. Student success has always been a challenge for minority students in STEM fields and is even more so for TAMIU's at-risk student population. With these challenges, the project will provide engineering students with meaningful video-based learning and group-based activities to facilitate learning. Social and video interactions will be designed to benefit women and minorities, as almost 90% of TAMIU students are Hispanic, and more than half are female. Simultaneously, the project will study the effect and success of an evidence-based STEM enrichment program that can be implemented at other minority-serving institutions.<br/><br/>The Project's specific aim is to improve the persistence, completion, and graduation of Hispanic, under-represented, and low-income students pursuing undergraduate engineering degrees. The Project's research strategy will combine a randomized controlled trial design, a path-analytic approach, and a longitudinal approach, and will engage two cohorts of freshman engineering students. Each cohort will be equally divided into two groups, one with creative video projects and the other without creative video projects, in a 2-semester enrichment program. This intervention will be applied to two existing gateway engineering courses with low retention rates. The Project team includes experts from engineering, psychology, and sociology. The success of this project will generate insights into how psychosocial outcomes facilitate the impact of our intervention on engineering student retention and timely graduation. Findings will be disseminated through local, state, national, and international conferences and forums; manuscripts will be submitted for publication in engineering education, cognitive psychology, and sociology of science journals. This project will advance understanding and generate insights on how active learning strategies can further enhance learning and improve engagement, retention, completion, and persistence in undergraduate engineering education.

The oxidation state of some Hawaii lavas are like lavas erupted at mid-ocean ridges, where new ocean crust forms. Other Hawaii lavas are more like lavas erupted at subduction zones where ocean crust descends into the mantle. This project will investigate whether these differences are because of volcanic processes occurring in the crust at the Hawaii volcanos, or because of differences in the source material deep in the mantle. The results will have implications for plate tectonic and mantle convection processes. Broader impacts include support for a female principal investigator, a nontraditional PhD student, and undergraduate students at a federally designated Hispanic- and Asian and Pacific Islander-serving institution. <br/><br/>Recent geological application of a new synchrotron-source analytical tool ? X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy ? permits precise in situ measurements of Fe3+/Fe2+ and S6+/S2- ratios in basaltic glasses. With this new tool, the effects of igneous differentiation processes on these ratios in basaltic magmas and the oxygen fugacity of these magmas can now be directly quantified and corrected for in the quest to characterize the composition of the mantle from measurements of seafloor basalts. As a result, there is substantial renewed interest in re-examining fundamental questions: Is the upper mantle homogeneous or heterogeneous in its oxidation state? What are the implications of the homo/heterogeneity of this oxidation state of the mantle for plate tectonics, Earth formation, and whole-Earth differentiation? In a carefully assembled suite of samples from the Hawaiian islands that are previously studied for major, trace, and volatile element compositions as well as stable and radiogenic isotopic compositions, new measurements will be used to assess the origins of the oxidized nature of a wide variety of Hawaiian intraplate magmas. This work will determine the extent to which plate tectonic cycling may (or may not) drive a whole-Earth oxygen cycle.

Measurement of physical properties and computational analyses will allow for an assessment of the ability of these molecules to transport charge through these metal-metal bonds. These and related studies are important for advancing toward goals in the field of quantum computing, as they provide new opportunities for us to learn how to control spins and charge flow through synthetic molecule-scale devices. Collaborative projects with researchers in the US as well as in Italy will be pursued. The team will design and play leadership roles in science communication initiatives, presentations that highlight connections between arts and science, outreach efforts aimed at broadening participation in science by underrepresented groups, and other service- or education-related projects.

Expansion of the types of metal atoms included in these heterometallic molecules from first- and second-row transition elements (e.g., nickel and molybdenum) to lanthanide and main group elements is a major goal. Modification of the equatorial ligands as well as metal identities should allow for the filled orbital energy levels (the molecular analog of the ?Fermi? level in metals) to be tuned. The Berry research team anticipates that it will be possible to access new molecules having carboxylate-derived axial ligands that will help us to test linking group effects in molecular conductivity measurements.

In particular, one is interested in the developments of singularities in both fluid flows and topological defects in the liquid crystal orientation as well as its long-time behavior. The project also investigates some geometric variational problems such as the classical problem of energy minimizing maps into spheres among continuous maps, the harmonic Ricci flows into surfaces. A fascinating mathematical fact is that these are somehow all connected with the research on liquid crystal dynamics. The project is an important and integral part of the principal investigator's training program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through topics courses, special lectures and thesis projects. The results obtained as part of the project are disseminated through publications in professional journals as well as through the lectures, seminars, and conferences. The principal investigator (PI) also organizes conferences and mentors graduate and undergraduate researchers on topics related to the work of the project.<br/><br/>This project is aimed at solving several challenging problems from the theory of liquid crystals. Despite numerous efforts by various researchers and tremendous progress over the past three decades, the fundamental problem concerning the global existence of suitable weak solutions of the Ericksen-Leslie system in three dimensions remains a fascinating open problem. The project studies a new modifed model and explores the subtle underlying coupled nonlinear structure. Of related interest are the long time asymptotics and the partial regularity of suitable global weak solutions and the finite-time blow up in both two and three dimensions of initially smooth solutions for this new model. A main focus of the project is the defect and its dynamics. The PI also studies a list of concrete problems related to the heat flow of harmonic maps. When the target is a sphere, which is relevant in the study of liquid crystals, the PI is interested in the gradient flow of the so-called relaxed energy of maps. By using a minimizing movement scheme, one studies its connection to the generalized Brakke flow. A related problem for such coupled equations in geometry is to understand the blow-up mechanism of the harmonic Ricci flow. When the target is a non-positively curved Alexandroff space, the project studies, through a refined minimizing movement scheme, the existence of better weak solutions that satisfy, in addition to the Struwe monotonicity property, the monotonicity of Almgren's frequency. The latter has important consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They play an important role in the study of algebraic geometry. This project is concerned with the use of certain novel techniques to study invariants of singularities. This theory provides an algebraic approach to the study of linear partial differential equations, but it has found many applications in algebraic geometry and related subjects. The goal of this project is, on one hand, to further study some recently introduced classes of singularities and, on the other hand, to explore new connections with zeta functions and invariants. The proposal provides ample opportunity for the PI to collaborate with graduate students and post-docs. He will also write a research monograph on this subject.<br/><br/>This project will involve several different research directions. First, the PI will expand the study of k-rational and k-Du Bois singularities beyond the case of hypersurfaces, using the recently defined version of minimal exponent for locally complete intersections. In a different direction, he will investigate D-module theoretic invariants of singularities modulo powers of a given prime, that refine the test ideals and F-pure thresholds from positive characteristic, and that might provide an arithmetic counterpart to characteristic zero invariants, such as Hodge ideals and minimal exponents. A third direction concerns exploring connections between the motivic zeta function and the minimal exponent on one side, and between the topological zeta function and D-modules on the other side (with possible applications to the Strong Monodromy Conjecture).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teenagers who are poor earn lower grades and are more likely to drop out of high school than teenagers who are not poor. The amount of schooling that teenagers complete determines the opportunities they have for work and, as a result, the amount of money they earn for the rest of their life. Despite the large amount of research on poverty and schooling, there has yet to be a study about the way that teenagers who are poor are treated at school. These experiences may make teenagers feel like that they do not belong at school and, in turn, this may lead to their academic underperformance. Thus, this study creates a new tool to measure the experiences teenagers have at school. Interviews are used to find out how teenagers who are poor are treated by friends, teachers, and staff. This information is used for a survey that will also include academic outcomes. This study reveals how teenagers who are poor are treated at school and how this is related to their schooling. Findings have the potential to inform policies aimed at reducing the effect of poverty on schooling.<br/><br/>This study develops a new tool to measure the experiences that teenagers who are poor have at school. A broad definition of poverty is used that includes social class, such as parental income, education, and occupation. A mixed-methods research design is used that includes interviews and surveys. Interviews are conducted with teenagers to understand how they are treated in school because of their social class. This includes teenagers? experiences with discrimination by friends, teachers, and staff. The information from the interviews is used to inform the development of a new measure, leading to a survey using the new measure and academic outcomes, such as achievement and school completion. This study reflects the early stages of a line of research that can dramatically change our understanding of the effect of poverty on academic outcomes. In addition to the large amount of knowledge this study will generate, we advance a new interdiscplinary theoretical model that integrates developmental, social, counseling, and educational perspectives.

When the cartilage, a cushion that helps reduce friction between bones, gets damaged, it leads to diseases such as arthritis, causing pain. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award aims to understand how the surface of articular cartilage direct and control friction. In addition to the cartilage covering the ends of bones, synovial fluid also serves as the natural lubricant of joints that reduces friction. Combined cartilage and synovial fluid maintain healthy joints, thanks to the lubricating molecules that stick to the surface of the cartilage. This study focuses on examining the biomechanical behaviors of lubricating molecules sticking to the cartilages. Results from this research will help identify molecular strategies to treat arthritis. This research is highly interdisciplinary involving biophysics, polymer physics, surface chemistry, biology, and tribology. This project also supports several educational and outreach activities involving the inclusion and training of underrepresented groups in biomaterials and mechanobiology-relevant research.<br/><br/>Lubricant film formation is critical during locomotion to lubricate and wear-protect the surface of articulated joints. The molecular components of the cartilage extracellular matrix surface provide anchoring sites for lubricating molecules, thus serving as a platform for the assembly of the load/energy-dissipative films. The role of the collagens family in mediating the adsorption of lubricating and wear-protecting molecules has been studied in depth. However, the role of fibronectin, another important cartilage extracellular matrix component, and its various conformations in regulating synovial fluid component adsorption and wear-protecting properties has been overlooked. This award fills this knowledge gap by determining the role of cartilage surface fibronectin in mediating the adsorption and retention of synovial fluid components to regulate joint boundary lubrication and wear protection. To test this hypothesis, this project will: i) develop articular cartilage surface models to control molecular compositions and conformations, ii) quantify synovial fluid component adsorption, and iii) perform nanomechanical and nanotribological characterizations to establish relationships between fibronectin-mediated synovial fluid film formation and tribological performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dimensions are special from an anthropic perspective, since they model our everyday perception of the physical world.  They are also special from a mathematical perspective, since the phenomena they exhibit, and the collection of techniques used to study them are rather different from those in higher dimensions.  The research component of the project explores a collection of important problems from across low-dimensional topology.  A concrete example is a famous old problem which asks whether every continuous closed curve in the plane contains the vertices of a square. A unifying thread through the research is the use of modern methods from nearby fields, such as combinatorics (the mathematics of discrete structures) and symplectic geometry (the geometry of classical mechanics).  Alongside the research, the PI proposes education and training initiatives reaching audiences from high schoolers to professional mathematicians.  The PI will continue his active involvement with mathematics enrichment at the high school level through the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics and through Mathematical Staircase, Inc.  The PI is in the process of editing a book based on a popular graduate summer school in low-dimensional topology that he ran.  Moreover, the PI currently advises three PhD students. The award provides graduate student support and travel support for students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to study a collection of problems in low-dimensional topology, in continuation of an established program.  The main themes are peg problems, using symplectic methods; exceptional Dehn surgery, using graphs of surface intersections; rational homology cobordism, using Floer homology and lattices; and ribbon concordance, using classical topological methods.  Combinatorial and symplectic methods have long influenced the field.  Amongst the various techniques that come to bear on low-dimensional topology are Floer homology, graphs of surface intersections, and lattice-theoretic methods.  Each technique has led to sensational progress on the main problems in low-dimensional topology, and they lend very different perspectives on the subject.  This project will more closely bind these techniques and low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One relevant geometric fact in this setting is that the red dots (and equally so the blue dots) can be rearranged in whatever order you like without ever breaking the no-collisions rule; this would not, for instance, be true if the red and blue dots were located on a line instead of on a sphere.  In a non-technical setting it isn?t easy to say why this has anything to do with the likelihood of two numbers having a prime factor in common; suffice it to say that this passage between contexts has consistently generated new ideas in both number theory and geometry, and is a central theme of the PI?s proposed research.  Beyond that, the PI has several projects at the interface of geometry and machine learning -- for example, can we use the kind of techniques that enable machines to play very strong chess and Go to find large configurations of points in in a grid such that no three form an isosceles triangle?  This is a toy problem but the techniques we develop will tell us a lot about the prospects for accelerating progress in pure mathematics using machine learning techniques.  The PI?s research is closely entwined with his work in outreach to the community outside academic mathematics, which includes a best-selling book on geometry published in 2021;  during the funding period he will continue developing programs to train early-career scientists in writing for the public. This award will also support graduate student research. <br/><br/>The proposed research covers a range of problems at the interface of number theory, algebraic topology, and algebraic topology.

The flexible electronics market was estimated to exceed $41 billion in 2020 and is expected to approximately double in the next decade. Hence, the scientific insights gained from this project will be immediately relevant to a number of fast-growing industries. In particular, biosensors is the application area with a high potential to be disrupted by this emerging fabrication approach and constitutes one of the three largest sectors of the flexile electronics market. Rapid growth is also projected for flexible batteries and stretchable electronics, both of which can also be transformed by laser-induced graphene.

The magnetic field varies on a wide range of time scales and the most striking variations occurring on geological time scales are polarity excursions and reversals. These events can lead to significantly weakened the global field strength, have the societal impacts arising from reduced magnetic shielding of the surface environment, and may be central to understanding the processes that generate and sustain the geomagnetic field in the liquid core.  Excursions have received relatively little attention compared to reversals despite occurring more frequently and lasting long enough to cause potentially significant societal disruption. Recent observational models spanning the past hundred thousand years are illuminating the evolution of excursional fields in previously inaccessible detail. When combined with advances in numerical simulation of the physical field generation process, this paves the way for a new approach to understand such enigmatic events. An integral aspect of the work will be building models enabling further synergy across the geomagnetic, paleomagnetic, and numerical geodynamo and, by extension, the international Studies of Earth?s Deep Interior and planetary science communities. This is a collaborative proposal between scientists at the University of California San Diego and Leeds University, and is therefore co-funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United Kingdom?s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). <br/><br/>Several global, spatial, and temporal representations of Earth?s magnetic field cover 0-100 ka or subsections thereof, and document up to 5 geomagnetic excursions with qualitative similarities as well as distinct differences. Formal definition of excursional field perturbations, duration, local asynchroneity, etc., can be made via the Paleosecular Variation Index allowing comparisons with numerical geodynamo simulations. Expanding the time interval to 0-120 ka, we will produce the first high-resolution models with quantified uncertainty for the Post-Blake excursion at ~95 ka and the Hilina Pali excursion at ~20 ka. In parallel, numerical simulations will build on research at Leeds University (UK) that is defining the requirements for ?Earth-like? field behavior.  The focus of this proposal is to improve understanding of the nature and origin of geomagnetic excursions using these two synergistic interlinked components. We will<br/>(1) Use new and existing global and time-dependent observational models of several excursions during the past 120 kyr to characterize field behavior before, during, and after excursions;<br/>(2) Analyze the excursion mechanism and predictability in new geodynamo simulations conducted with a dominant force balance that reflects expected behavior in Earth?s liquid outer core;<br/>(3) Develop formal criteria for defining excursions and reconcile paleofield behavior with current and emerging views on Earth-like numerical dynamo simulations.<br/>A vital aspect of this proposal is exploiting existing synergy between the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) observational geomagnetic field modelling and paleosecular variation analysis and Leeds simulations of core dynamics. Observational models will contribute to new Earth-like standards for simulations, which will in turn be used to make high-resolution predictions of observable field variations that can be sought in the lower resolution observational data. We expect to enhance understanding of the dynamics of geomagnetic excursions, including their predictability and relation to polarity reversals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Targeted occupations include petroleum pump system operator, refinery operator, chemical plant and system operators, refrigeration specialists and gas plant operators.  Texas is home to seven LNG export facilities that are in use, under construction, or in the planning stages and will eventually support 70,000 jobs in the region. Importantly, this project will build on prior work to redesign the PRO program into a flexible and accessible statewide model to address the needs of industry and employers in the East Texas region. This approach will provide students with increasingly flexible opportunities and pathways to obtain the necessary training to enter and be successful in the LNG industry. Ultimately, this project intends to contribute to the training of a highly skilled workforce for this rapidly growing industry and serve as a model in the region for how to develop flexible technical education pathways that meet student needs. <br/><br/>Texas State Technical College will collaborate with local industry to achieve the primary goal of increasing the quality and number of highly skilled technicians in the LNG industry through the implementation of an innovative and flexible Process Operations Technology (PRO) program.  This will be accomplished through the following activities: 1) partnering with industry to undergo a statewide curriculum alignment process of the PRO program courses to standardize curriculum and learning outcomes, 2) upgrading of instructional equipment to provide flexible, and accessible training in an open lab environment, and 3) combining a performance-based online instructional model with an innovative flexible career pathway approach featuring multiple entry/multiple exit (MEME) points. The project team aims to enroll a minimum of one hundred students over the three-year project period of which fifty students will graduate with either an AAS degree or an industry recognized certificate. A formal evaluation will be conducted to assess project activities and outcomes with a focus on contributing to the body of knowledge on flexible technical education pathways for preparing skilled technicians to be successful in the science and engineering technical workforce. As a result, this project has the potential to provide a model for the technical education community for how to transition from the traditional didactic contact hour format to a flexible career pathway format with a stair-step approach that promotes student retention and career-placement success.  The team aims to immediately expand the project to other campuses located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, the Texas Gulf Coast, West Texas, and the Rio Grande Valley through hybrid courses and other targeted dissemination efforts. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on lanthanide complexes with quantum clock transitions, which can provide protection of the molecular qubits against external magnetic noise and prolong the duration of quantum entanglement ? a crucial factor for the implementation of quantum technologies.  The project will train junior scientists at the nexus of inorganic chemistry, quantum physics, and materials science, thus contributing to the education of the future quantum workforce.  The project team plans to organize a nationwide undergraduate summer school to educate students about magnetic materials.  Outreach activities will also involve high-school students and the general public, and are aimed at broadening participation by members of groups underrepresented in physical sciences.<br/><br/>Paramagnetic molecular complexes are promising platforms for the development of electron spin qubits, due to the high tunability of their synthesis that allows realization of targeted magnetic parameters.  This project will involve the examination of lanthanide complexes as potential electron spin qubits, with a focus on quantum clock transitions (QCTs) that emerge from the opening of quantum tunneling gaps due to mixing of ground doublet states generated by crystal field splitting.  At the QCT, electron spin becomes insensitive to the surrounding spin bath, leading to a dramatic increase in the quantum coherence time, thus allowing protection of the entangled state from the magnetic noise.  The first stage of this project involves the investigation of mononuclear complexes to identify the most promising QCT systems that demonstrate the desired values of tunneling gap and coherence time.  The second stage will be devoted to connecting such qubits through a photo- or redox-switchable linkers, to make possible quantum gate operations.  Advanced characterization methods, including a suite of electron paramagnetic resonance techniques, far-infrared magnetic spectroscopy, inelastic neutron scattering, and theoretical modeling will be used to investigate the molecular qubits and guide further synthetic efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects that are defined by polynomial equations, using methods from algebra, complex analysis, differential geometry, topology, and partial differential equations. Algebraic geometry also provides useful examples for certain parts of theoretical physics such as string theory. Most of the research proposed by the PI has to do with a subfield of algebraic geometry called Hodge theory. Hodge theory makes it possible to apply results from the theory of partial differential equations to problems in algebraic geometry, in a language that is closer to algebra than to analysis. Some of the work proposed by the PI is about developing Hodge theory further (and to make it more accessible to graduate students); the rest is about using Hodge theory to solve several very specific problems in algebraic geometry. The PI will also work on a comprehensive book on this subject which will be of enormous use to the research community.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project has several different research objectives, all related to Hodge theory:<br/>(1) To develop a theory of higher multiplier ideals for effective divisors, in joint work with Ruijie Yang, by using the nearby cycles functor for mixed Hodge modules.<br/>(2) To apply this theory to theta divisors on principally polarized abelian varieties, in particular to a conjecture by Casalaina-Martin about the multiplicities of their singular points.<br/>(3) To continue to study the local and global structure of the locus of self-dual classes for integral variations of Hodge structure; self-dual classes are a generalization of Hodge classes that are of interest in theoretical physics.<br/>(4) To further investigate the behavior of Kodaira dimension under smooth morphisms, especially several related conjectures by Campana-Peternell and by Popa.<br/>(5) To continue the study of degenerating complex variations of Hodge structure in higher dimensions, in particular the precise local behavior of the Hodge metric, and its relation with the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras.<br/>(6) To continue the ""Mixed Hodge Module Project"" (joint with Claude Sabbah), whose aim is to write an accessible treatment of the theory of mixed Hodge modules with complex coefficients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this field, known as number theory, the prime numbers play a central role.  Fundamental questions revolve around patterns in the primes, gaps between primes, and how primes of special types are distributed.  Since the early 20th century, sieve methods have been one of the chief tools we have for analyzing these problems, but the limitations of these methods are poorly understood, and discovering the limitations is a major open problem in the field. This award will enable the PI to continue his work understanding and exploring sieve methods and the distribution of primes. Success in this endeavor will help unlock many of the mysteries of prime numbers and have a significant impact on many areas of mathematics and information theory.  Grant funds will also be used to train and mentor graduate students working in number theory. <br/><br/>The PI will develop new methods of probing the limitations of sieve methods for detecting primes in a general sequence of integers. The emphasis will be on developing a new, unified theory of sieves that allows one to say if the main hypotheses on the sequence, known as Type-I bounds and Type-II bounds, are sufficient to show that the sequence contains many primes. The strength of these hypotheses are governed by three parameters. In particular, we will prove, for the first time, that in a certain range of these parameters, there are sequences which satisfy the Type-I and Type-II bounds yet contain no primes.  The primary goal is to determine precisely in which range of the parameters the main hypotheses imply that the sequence always contains many primes. We will also investigate in finer detail the problem of counting primes in short intervals.  The PI will also continue his investigations into further understanding the concentration of divisors of integers.  The primary goal is to determine precisely the measure of the concentration function of divisors of typical integers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project builds on the investigator?s previous work on signaling pathways involving insulin and other neuropeptides in insects, and more generally contributes to a better understanding of insect physiology. The research will expand knowledge of how insects use hormones and neurotransmitters to determine how to store energy, when to devote resources to growth and reproduction, and how to balance these needs with inevitable aging and death. Because this bug is a pest of several crops, a better understanding of its physiology may lead to improved strategies for protection of the food supply. The educational plan for this project includes creation of an insect physiology course, a much-needed addition to University of Nevada Reno?s current course offering, particularly for the scattered disciplines housing students studying insect science at the university. Results from the insulin signaling research will feed directly into course content as students research methods to design experiments to answer physiological questions emerging from the project. In addition, outreach to farmers and the public will provide information about how the research results can be applied to improve farming practices, and to demonstrate basic principles of insect physiology. In addition to course development and outreach activities, the project provides laboratory research opportunities for undergraduates to be recruited from an existing university program aimed at low-income, first-generation students.<br/><br/>Insulin signaling is widely conserved among metazoans and is a central nexus for several physiological processes, including metabolism, lifespan, development, reproduction, and immunity. Insects are a diverse, species-rich group, and explorations in non-model organisms suggest that much remains to be understood about the roles of insulin signaling outside of traditional models such as Drosophila melanogaster. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to gain greater insight into the functions of insulin signaling in Heteroptera, the true bugs. With this goal, L. hesperus, a pest insect capable of feeding on more than 100 species of host plants as well as other insects, was selected as a representative heteropteran to study insulin signaling. Multiple molecular approaches will be utilized to elucidate details of insulin signaling dynamics and their impacts on organism-scale physiological processes. The objectives of this project are to: (1) explore the role of insulin-like-peptide (ILP) signaling in carbohydrate storage in the L. hesperus fat body, (2) determine the roles of ILP signaling in reproduction, and (3) elucidate the dynamics of ILPs in regulating diapause. Ultimately, nutritional inputs and storage in L. hesperus must be finely balanced with the need to reproduce against the need to conserve resources during periods of low temperature and food scarcity. This project explores these dynamics and will provide a foundation for the investigator's career goal of understanding fundamental functions of neuropeptides and peptide hormones in insects and other arthropods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies have often linked the rise and fall of societies to improvements and deterioration in climatic patterns. Understanding these issues is critical as climate change affects countries worldwide in modern times. However, these studies tend to underestimate human and social resilience to climatic and environmental changes due to the lack of localized, fine-grained data. In this regard, environmental archaeology is particularly enlightening since it involves the collection and interpretation of environmental data in close proximity (both geographically and temporally) to archaeological discoveries. In sensitive and fragile environments such as wetlands, climate change reshapes the landscape even by a small fluctuation of precipitation and temperature. From the long-term perspective of archaeology, people adapted to the new environments through technological innovation and food diversification. This human adaptation also causes environmental consequences. This project sheds light on the complex feedback loop between human adaptation, environmental consequences, and the long-term sustainability of human-environmental interactions. The researchers aim to facilitate knowledge exchange between themselves and today's residents, deepening their understanding of managing the local environments and promoting environmental sustainability. <br/><br/>The student investigates how human behavior and settlements evolved with changing environments, particularly the fluctuating lake levels in one study area. The archaeological site is located on the edge of a highland lake, and it is one of the earliest human settlements in the region. The site was continuously occupied for over a millennium, between ~3600 and 2300 cal. BP, providing a unique opportunity to explore environmental changes before, during, and after human occupation. Due to active sedimentation and tectonic activities in the study area, archaeological deposits are buried deeply underground. To reconstruct the environmental conditions, the researchers use coring to retrieve soil samples from the past and analyze them in the laboratory. By comparing the environmental data with findings within the site, the researchers can distinguish whether changes were induced by human or climatic events and whether the changes were significant enough to render the site uninhabitable. This research fills in the gap of environmental archaeology in this part of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This basic fact gives a relationship between the topology of one dimensional figures and algebra. Mathematicians have built an elaborate machine based on the original work of Pontryagin and Thom from the middle of the 20th century, extending this correspondence to higher dimensions. This project aims to formulate notions of algebraic structures on the geometric side of this correspondence, with intended applications in the study of topology. The project will also support the training of graduate students in the subject.<br/><br/>The project's new formulations are centered around the notion of a flow category which has become central to modern approaches to symplectic topology, as well as to its interactions with other mathematical fields, such as algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, and dynamical systems, as well as mathematical physics, because the output of Floer's theory exactly provides such a structure. The PI plans to formulate algebraic structures (algebras, modules, etc.) geometrically at the level of the underlying flow categories. In this way, the PI expects to make substantial advances in three areas: (i) Floer homotopy theory and its applications to symplectic topology, (ii) the study of Fukaya categories and its applications to mirror symmetry, and (iii) the interaction between differential and algebraic topology, via a geometric model of Waldhausen's A-theory, with intended applications to the study of Lagrangians embeddings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many reactions, two different products known as enantiomers or mirror images can be formed. For applications such as pharmaceuticals, sometimes only one of the enantiomers is beneficial while the other may have no benefit or may even have deleterious effects. Traditional methods based entirely on experimental studies to find a means to selectively generate only one enantiomer are slow and expensive. They make use of largely trial-and-error approaches often requiring hundreds of experiments to be performed with expensive reagents and catalysts and, in the meantime, generate unnecessary chemical waste. In contrast, the computational methods that are the basis of the current project are a fast and cost-efficient means to predict specific catalysts that will produce the desired enantiomeric outcome. These predictions accelerate and support follow-up experimental studies. This work will likely have a significant broader impact because it is performed in close collaboration with AstraZeneca, a major international pharmaceutical company. They not only incorporate the Notre Dame methods into their process research to foster innovation, but also provide unique professional development opportunities for the students working on the project through industrial internships, interdisciplinary training at AstraZeneca in Sweden, and regular interactions with industrial researchers. The two lead investigators are strongly committed to broadening participation with a long track record of offering undergraduate research opportunities to students from underrepresented groups, as instructors in the Galvin Scholars Program for students from less well-prepared educational backgrounds, and by serving as mentors in the Building Bridges Program for underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>Professors Helquist and Wiest at the University of Notre Dame continue the development of a virtual screening tool for enantioselective catalysis (CatVS) that uses transition state force fields (TSFFs) derived using the quantum-guided molecular mechanics (Q2MM) method. This includes several new methods for the optimization of TSFFs that improve the accuracy of TSFF combinations with literature force fields, the semi-automation of the fitting procedure using a hybrid epsilon-constraint/PSO method; improved workflows for the generation and screening of virtual libraries (LibGen), new interfaces to other programs for conformational searching and TSFFs for new reactions selected by the team in collaboration with their industrial partners. Once tested and validated, all new developments will be incorporated in the Q2MM/LibGen/CatVS code that will continue to be available to the scientific community free of charge at github.com/q2mm. The impact of this method will be demonstrated in applications ranging from Ir-catalyzed hydroaminations of unactivated alkenes through novel nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to the computer-assisted design of new ligand classes for enantioselective synthesis. The combined computational and experimental approach, combined with the close collaboration with AstraZeneca, provides a unique interdisciplinary training environment for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These equations can be studied algebraically (e.g. solving the equation to find all solutions) or geometrically (e.g. graphing the shape defined by the equation) and algebraic geometry uses the tools from both perspectives to analyze varieties.  An overarching goal of the field to be explored in this project is to classify all possible varieties, which is done through the construction of moduli spaces, or parameter spaces for varieties of a given type.  The study of moduli spaces has a rich history and these spaces arise naturally in algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, differential geometry, enumerative geometry and combinatorics, mirror symmetry, number theory, and physics.  The  work involved with  this project has connections to each of these fields. The PI will mentor both undergraduate and graduate students and continue with a variety of activities that encourage the participation of women in mathematics.<br/><br/>The main objective of the PI is to research moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic varieties, specifically to study degenerations of hypersurfaces (varieties defined by a single polynomial equation).  The PI will approach two related questions: studying smooth limits of hypersurfaces from a moduli-theoretic perspective, focusing on when such limits are again hypersurfaces, and also an explicit classification of singular varieties appearing in these moduli spaces, focusing on degenerations of projective space, Fano varieties, and log Calabi-Yau pairs.  The main tools used to accomplish these goals will be wall crossing in K-stability and KSBA moduli, the minimal model program, geometric invariant theory, and interpolation between these different perspectives on moduli spaces.  The projected outputs of this project include several theoretical results, such as (non-)existence of particular degenerations of projective space, techniques for constructing moduli of log Calabi-Yau varieties, and some classification of smooth limits of hypersurfaces.

This research project focuses on the combinatorial ?invariants? of polytopes. For example, count the number V of vertices, E of edges, and F of facets of an arbitrary 3-dimensional polytope. Then no matter which polytope we choose, we always end up with getting the identity ?V-E+F=2?.

This project is dedicated to new methods to study polytopes and manifolds with particular geometry or topology. One goal is to investigate various combinatorial models such as the Stanley-Reisner ring and the stress spaces, and how the algebra translates into combinatorial relations among the face number. Another goal is to investigate how preset geometry and topology (for example, central symmetry) affects the combinatorics of polytopes or polyhedral complexes, and vice versa.

However, achieving reliable healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) technology is challenging due to the scarce annotation problem caused by the cost of professional labeling, heterogeneity of human labels, and concerns over healthcare information privacy. To overcome this scarce annotation problem, there are currently two solutions. One solution is enabling multi-institutional collaboration to train a dedicated model. Another is obtaining multi-scale features from training a shareable model to fine-tuning multiple tasks. The first method involves huge computation and communication costs to train a dedicated model for only one type of task; while the second method is currently only applied to the autonomous car where a rich amount of data is collected and processed frequently on a single node. This project seeks to fill this gap by innovatively training multiple medical imaging tasks together with a cache mechanism to build an efficient and effective multi-institutional collaborative system. The goal of the proposed research is to design a multi-task learning model for medical imaging tasks, design a cache mechanism for the system to active relevant portion when interpreting a specific task, and develop a prototype distributed multi-task learning system for medical imaging to evaluate the model and system performance of the proposed solutions. <br/><br/>Building a one-for-all collaboration system for medical imaging will constitute a significant technological breakthrough toward achieving practical AI in clinical practice. By facilitating the model sharing within and among institutions, the proposed system can address the scarce annotation problem and accelerates clinical detection, diagnosis, and treatment, to benefit healthcare professionals. Furthermore, as a general-purpose framework, the proposed system will also be deployed to other fields with similar application requirements, such as connected autonomous driving and other mobility systems on land, in the air, and at sea, where multiple nodes work as a unit for a series of tasks. From the education aspect, the proposed system will be developed as a basic experimentation platform for healthcare AI and can be easily transplanted to other scenarios, such as smart homes and smart transportation.

However, there exist numerous reasons the theory is unsatisfactory and incomplete. In order to gain insight into these issues, the group led by PI Prof. Lawrence Lee at the University of Tennessee studies the particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN outside of Geneva, Switzerland. As the facility able to probe the largest energy densities in the world, the LHC is able to probe the smallest length scales in controlled experiments. In careful analysis of the data from the collisions at the LHC, the group searches for deviations from Standard Model predictions, particularly in the form of new unknown particles. Finding such a new particle would help explain the shortcomings of our current understanding and guide us to a more complete theory of the universe. Given that no significant deviation from the Standard Model has been observed at the LHC yet, finding any new physics phenomena will require new techniques and new data. This project comprises data analyses searching for new particles Beyond the Standard Model in new and innovative ways, upgrading the CMS experiment at the LHC to continue to collect data for decades to come, and communicating this work to the public through fun and educational outreach programs. This educational component includes reaching the public with physics-inspired electronic music through Lee's ColliderScope project and the development of a particle physics educational exhibition in collaboration with a local college of design.<br/><br/>PI Lee's group works primarily as members of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at the LHC. This project has four main objectives. In the search for new physics phenomena, the group will search for new long-lived particles at high masses that travel macroscopic distances into the CMS detector before decaying. Directly looking for the interactions of these particles with the detector, they can be discovered via anomalously large ionization signatures. This work will focus on currently existing data and new data as it's collected. To continue to take increased data in the environment of the High-Luminosity LHC, the group will also work on upgrading the CMS detector itself in the context of the silicon tracker upgrade that provides new track-based triggering abilities to CMS. In particular, the group is involved in the construction, readout, and control software for this upgrade. To communicate the goals of the LHC with the general public, the educational components to this project involve engineering ""lissajous"" music in which particle physics imagery is encoded in audio waveforms that can be visualized on oscilloscopes, and an educational exhibition explaining cosmic ray physics to K-12 students as well as training students of design in the technical skills common to particle physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Certain charged polymers are interesting in this area because they both conduct electricity and undergo electro-chemical reactions to bind ions from solutions. Theoretically, with improved understanding and refinements, charged polymers in this class could conduct electricity as well as metals, and store as much charge as materials used in lithium-ion batteries. But currently, these materials fall short of these theoretical limits. To date, scientists do not fully understand the fundamental factors limiting these polymers from achieving their theoretical potential. In this project, researchers at the University of Missouri will work to understand the molecular origins of electronic and ionic conductivity in these charged polymers. To accomplish this, University of Missouri researchers will use a new way of making these polymers that allows for the rapid generation of precisely controlled sequences of molecular building blocks (monomers) within the polymer chains.  They will measure how different monomer sequences lead to interaction effects between monomers and drive changes in the flow of electrons and ions. This research will fill a critical gap in understanding the molecular-scale origins of electronic and ionic conductivity in charged polymers and is expected to help researchers develop improved materials for a range of applications including water treatment, chemical sensors, and battery technologies. These research activities will be complemented with the development of hands-on interactive learning modules to make the concepts surrounding the flow of electrons and ions through polymers tangible and engaging for elementary school students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project will establish structure-property understanding connecting local and short-range (<5 nm) structure of conjugated hetero-atom-containing copolymers with their electronic and ionic conductivity.

Ex situ synchrotron and electron microscopy measurements will provide further insights into molecular structure origins of observed electronic and ionic transport properties.

Understanding that motion allows materials to be produced that have less resistance, better heat conductivity, and that can model fluid and air flows in ways that are less costly than current methods.

Hydrodynamic material systems exhibit novel thermoelectric properties that violate the Wiedemann-Franz law, and have been predicted to display vortical or even turbulent electron and heat flow.  Combined STP and STST measurements are used in this project to determine the degree to which heat and charge flow becomes uncorrelated in such systems, and this project also utilizes engineered potential barriers that affect heat and charge flow differently, with an aim of further decoupling the two.  Moreover, by probing how heat is dissipated in viscous electronic phases, this project explores the mechanisms that limit the conductivity of such phases and provides data that allows the complete problem of thermoelectric flow to be solved self-consistently in hydrodynamic materials.  STP measurements of charge motion in magnetic fields, meanwhile, explore how weakly bound states and snake states can perturb the values of quantum hall conductance plateaus and precipitate the formation of vorticies of circularly flowing charge as the viscosity of the system is increased.   These measurements also test predictions that electron viscosity itself should become quantized in quantum hall systems.

Compared to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) has a much shorter residence time in the atmosphere approximately 9-12 years compared to  300-1000 years for CO2. However, the global warming potential of methane is 28 times larger than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. In the United States, several federal and state agencies have set goals for reducing methane emissions. However, there are large uncertainties in the current knowledge and accounting of CH4 emissions and how these emissions are changing over time. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to quantify how methane emissions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico have changed over nearly two decades from 2007-2026. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to leverage an expanding network of atmospheric methane observations (collected from airplanes, atop TV towers, and satellites) and recent advances in inverse modeling (algorithms and software) that enable the estimations of previously unaccounted sources of CH4 emissions in North America using massive satellite datasets. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge that could be used to (1) better understand and quantify CH4 emissions in North America, and (2) guide the implementation and evaluation of policies and solutions designed to reduce the global emissions of a potent GHG such as methane. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University.<br/><br/>Methane (CH4) emissions in North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico) have changed significantly during the past twenty years driven to a large extent by a substantial increase in oil and gas production. This CAREER project will address critical knowledge gaps in the current level of understanding and quantification of CH4 emissions in North America.  The specific objectives of the research are to: (1) quantify how anthropogenic methane emissions in North America have changed over two decades (2007-2026) using a combination of ground-based and satellite observations, (2) evaluate the changing contribution of large and super-emitters of methane in North America using satellite observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), (3) estimate the distribution and year-to-year variability of CH4 fluxes from wetlands in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and 4) quantify the relationships between CH4 fluxes from wetlands and key environmental drivers with the goal of developing more accurate and robust process models of methane emissions by wetlands.  The successful completion of this research has the potential for transformative impact through the leveraging of an expanded network of atmospheric methane observations and new approaches to inverse modeling that could enable the identification and quantification of previously unaccounted sources of CH4 emissions in North America using massive satellite datasets. To implement the educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to leverage existing programs and resources at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) to develop and deliver two integrated educational activities focused on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change (CC). For the first educational activity, the PI will work with the JHU Center for Educational Outreach to create hands-on activities about GHG emissions and CC for Baltimore City middle school students enrolled in the Barclay Summer Academy.  For the second educational activity, the PI proposes to develop an interdisciplinary undergraduate course on GHG emissions and climate policy at JHU that will include discussions with scientists, engineers, and policy experts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses a fundamental question: How does genetic variation (within and across a species range) influence species' ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change? The research studies the response of a widespread, foundational plant species to increasingly hotter and drier conditions associated with climate change. Multiple approaches including field observations, greenhouse experiments, population genetics, and species distribution modeling are employed. Species often vary greatly across their ranges in the traits of individuals such as drought tolerance, longevity, and the number of seeds produced per year. The investigators aim to improve predictions regarding species persistence in the face of climate change, including expected migrations, informed by how individual plants differ across landscapes. California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) is an ideal study species because it is widespread, displays individual variation across its range, and is often planted in restoration. It is also an iconic spring-blooming wildflower, garnering public interest in conservation activities. Broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate training, outreach to multiple stakeholders, and development of conservation strategies to enhance adaptive potential in species responding to climate change.<br/> <br/>With the accelerating pace of both climate change and habitat loss, conservation efforts will need to understand adaptive mechanisms that maximize the chances for species? persistence. Species distribution models are a critical tool in the conservation ?tool box."" This research aims to improve predictions of future species responses to climate change by using a mechanistic process incorporating traits, demography and evolutionary processes across scales, using Integral Projection Models (IPMs). The investigators integrate population genetic and phenotypic differentiation mechanisms of adaptation into predictions of range shifts, via IPMs parameterized by experimental data and informed by demographic trade-offs. A key aspect of the intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of demographic distribution models (DDMs), a new class of species distribution model that can incorporate evolutionary mechanisms into ecological and biogeographic predictions. Although developed for the focal species, California poppy, these models will be broadly transferable to other widespread, foundational species with conservation, habitat restoration, and/or economic significance. Training of graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research aimed at promoting professional development and broadening participation of groups traditionally under-represented in STEM is an integral part of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project explores the postsecondary trajectories of persons with conviction histories to investigate whether access to college courses while in prison is associated with postsecondary persistence and completion of a certificate or degree. The research is timely, given increased interest by national, state, and local policymakers in providing access to higher education to incarcerated or formerly incarcerated, persons and those who have conviction histories. In 2014, California passed SB 1391, a law allowing for equal per-student funding of college courses in prison and on campus. This CAREER research uses administrative data from California between 2012 and 2021 and regression analysis to measure the likelihood of re-enrollment, persistence, and completion of a community college certificate or degree for formerly incarcerated persons in California who took community college courses while incarcerated. Given the legislation and challenges concerning college access and success for many students from working-class backgrounds and students of color, study findings are expected to inform policy, approaches to expanding postsecondary education, and the body of knowledge on educational access and success for individuals with conviction histories. <br/><br/>A college degree serves as a pathway to economic mobility for persons from working-class families in the United States. Fiscal returns to education are highest for those students earning science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) degrees. This CAREER project also explores the types of degrees earned by persons with conviction histories, the number of degrees that are earned in STEM fields, and the characteristics of formerly incarcerated persons who earn these degrees. Given the importance of the structural context for learning, institutional conditions associated with higher rates of persistence and completion for students with conviction histories are also being examined.

Catalysis is estimated to contribute approximately 35% of the global gross domestic product. Heterogeneous catalysis is a sub-class of catalysis, and is a process by which very small metallic nanoparticles (of only a couple of nanometers in size) that are supported on non-reactive substrates are used for chemical conversions. Because these particles are microscopic, nearly all their atoms are on the nanoparticle's surface. Surface atoms have a higher energy than atoms that are present in the nanoparticle bulk because they are not fully bonded. This lack of full bond is essential as it allows them to act as catalysts, but it also leads to problems. Because catalysis occurs in highly reactive environments (including high temperatures and aggressive environments), the atoms at the surface can be driven off of the nanoparticle. These atoms can migrate around and can lead to arrangements that reduce their ability to be effective at further catalysis. This project uses real-time, high-resolution imaging to see these processes directly and tightly couple these observations with computer simulations to determine the fundamental physical mechanisms that degrade catalytic performance. The work is being performed primarily by graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania and Northwestern University. This project incorporates undergraduate students at both institutions in the research efforts, as well as students from minority-serving institutions such as the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. The research outcomes provide scientists with the needed understanding to help stabilize heterogeneous catalysts during reactions, potentially leading to substantial savings in both cost and energy usage.<br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>One of the most critical applications of metal nanoparticles is in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where their small size leads to a prevalence of under-coordinated surface sites that facilitate the conversion of reactants to products. However, a high concentration of under-coordinated surface sites increases the total surface energy, which drives particle evolution via coarsening, coalescence, and evaporation. These processes eventually lead to a decrease in overall catalytic activity. While these phenomena are understood generally, existing theoretical descriptions are mean-field and are under debate. This project uses high-throughput, quantitative image analysis to analyze in-situ transmission electron microscopy data at the University of Pennsylvania. This data is tightly linked to large-scale simulations at Northwestern University. Through the resulting iteration between the ?ground truth? of experimental observations and simulations, this research is determining 1) how rough surfaces affect the dynamics of contact lines and thus nanoparticle evolution, 2) how particle size and placement affect nanoparticle growth, and 3) the role of surface energy anisotropy. In addition to providing an improved fundamental understanding of these processes, these studies suggest new routes to mitigate unwanted coarsening in technologically relevant systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through presentations by leading experts in the field, this 4-day workshop will provide a broad but thorough overview of recent technical advances in mathematical topics around stochastic processes, control, and games, as well as many different application areas of these theoretical approaches. Indeed, beyond the historical focus on financial engineering, there are now many new fields of application, including machine learning, fintech, economic, financial policy and regulation, epidemic management, and even climate change. These applications are undeniably at the heart of current social and economic challenges and studying them in a quantitative way can contribute to informing public policy. The objective of this workshop is therefore to strengthen the links between mathematics, especially as it pertains to random processes and its applications to the above-mentioned areas. We expect this meeting to help initiate new interdisciplinary collaborations that will help tackle various issues currently facing the world and anticipate future economical and societal challenges. The award funds will help defray travel and local expenses of the participants, emphasizing the support of a diverse group of junior researchers (Ph.D. candidates, postdoctoral fellows and other early-career researchers). More precisely, the award will allow to sponsor approximately 30 junior researchers, including 10 for oral presentations and a dozen for poster sessions.<br/><br/>The theory of stochastic analysis and control is constantly developing, and recent advances include, among others, rough paths theory, optimal transport, stochastic partial differential equation and more. Considering the interactions between economic and financial agents has also required the development of new mathematical tools, and in particular the implementation of the mean field game theory into the mathematical framework. As an illustration, one of the tools associated with stochastic control, namely the Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDE) theory, has been strongly impacted by the development of stochastic differential games, and we can particularly notice recent results on second-order, mean field or McKean-Vlasov BSDEs. The field is obviously positively impacted by the technological era in which we live, and recent developments in machine learning allow for example to numerically solve many stochastic control problems and games in a very efficient way. But it should be noted that the reverse is also true: stochastic control methods and techniques are key to the investigation and assessment of advanced numerical approaches such as deep or Q?learning and neural networks. Hence, at the theoretical level, the workshop will feature talks and discussions on stochastic PDEs and (McKean?Vlasov, second-order) BSDEs, stochastic approaches to the master equation and to deep learning, as well as pathwise stochastic analysis and signature processes. Furthermore, as the mathematical theory of stochastic control and games is, by nature, application-oriented, this workshop will also have a strong focus on applications to finance (rough volatility models, but also newer models for cryptocurrencies and robot advising) as well as social policy issues such as systemic risk, epidemic management, among others.

Light is a powerful tool for probing the brain and can be used to monitor the firing of neurons or directly activate neurons using optogenetics. Optical wavefront shaping techniques can enable deeper light penetration in the brain. However, these techniques are stymied because it is challenging to deliver the shaped light to the brain. This project addresses this challenge by developing a new system which leverages fiber bundles and optical wavefront shaping to reliably deliver shaped light to the brain, even when the fiber bundle is moving. The outcomes of the research will provide new tools for neuroscientists to deliver shaped light to the brain, enabling better experiments in the research laboratory and paving the way for future clinical applications. The broader impacts of the project include research opportunities for undergraduate students at Harvey Mudd, providing tightly integrated educational opportunities in scientific research methods, optical system design, and neurophotonics. In addition, the PI will develop new educational resources to broaden access to optics through wavefront shaping simulations in Python-based Jupyter notebooks and low-cost lab experiments exploring optical fibers and light matter interactions in scattering media.<br/> <br/>Multicore fibers offer an attractive way to deliver light to regions of interest in the brain but are challenging to use in practical applications due to core-dependent phase delays which are impacted by a variety of physical and environmental factors such as movement and temperature fluctuations. The project will address this challenge by developing methods to correct the phase distortion of the multicore fiber without requiring access to the distal end, enabling shaped wavefronts to be flexibly delivered into deep tissue even when the core-to-core phase delays are dynamically changing. The research plan is divided into two major tasks: (1) developing a low-coherence interferometry system to measure the phase distortion of the multicore fiber and characterizing key performance metrics such as temporal response and phase sensitivity and (2) using the low-coherence interferometry system with wavefront shaping to correct for the phase delay in the multicore fiber and create desired wavefronts beyond the distal tip of the fiber.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These very high-pressure methods are used widely to create materials with very specific properties on the inside and at their surface. However, all these operations are generally studied after the events have been completed. This award supports a fundamental quantitative study of these processes while they are occurring and is focused on finding new laws that relate the severe stretching of metal, their evolution at a very fine scale, on the order of a human hair, and the accompanying changes in the metal, called phase transformations. In this project, Titanium, a mixture of Titanium and Zirconium, and an alloy of Aluminum-Iron-Cobalt-Nickel-Copper are being studied under high pressures and strain rates typical of current and future materials technologies. In addition, the project provides opportunities to educate and train undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoc in the areas of materials, high-pressure sciences and materials processing. This is being accomplished through special courses and research at the PI?s institution, experiments at an extremely high-powered x-ray facility called a ?synchrotron? and interaction between experimental and computational efforts, all with an emphasis on underrepresented students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to perform a fundamental in-situ quantitative study and find new laws for coupled severe plastic deformation, nanostructure evolution, and phase transformations in Ti, a mixture of Ti and Zr, and a AlFeCoNiCu high entropy alloy. These metals will be explored over a broad range of straining programs under pressures up to 65 GPa, and strain rates in the range 10-5-103/s. Experiments will be conducted using a dynamic rotational diamond anvil cell and the intellectual merit will be derived from the quantitative checking of our hypotheses, including: (a) Are crystallite size and dislocation density of all phases getting pressure-, strain- and strain-path-independent, steady-state values before and after phase transformations, and does this depend on the volume fractions during phase transformations and/or the strain rate? (b) Does each phase behave like a perfectly plastic, isotropic, and strain-path-independent material for each strain rate and what is the pressure and strain rate dependence of the yield strength? (c) Are phase transformation kinetics independent of strain path? (d) Does a high strain rate promote phase transformations due to increased yield strength? And (e) Will phase transformations in each material in the Ti-Zr mixture be promoted in comparison to single material studies due to additional obstacles for dislocation pileups?<br/><br/>Methods to determine the evolution of highly heterogeneous fields of stress, plastic strain, strain rate tensors, volume fraction of phases, crystallite size, dislocation density, and concentration of species in a dynamic rotational diamond anvil cell will be developed, all in real time, using in-situ X-ray diffraction and other diagnostics in a feedback loop. In addition, simulations including a microscale phase field and physics-based macroscale model as well as a finite-element simulation of the experiments are being developed. Parameter identification, machine learning, model refinement, and all material properties (e.g. viscoplastic, evolution of phase transformations, crystallite size, dislocation density) are being determined, and quantitative models are also being finalized. <br/><br/>For broader impacts beyond the technical contributions, a graduate course is being developed, and mentoring opportunities in research for undergraduate students, graduate students and a post-doc are being carried out in conjunction with this project.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The particular class of ""fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems"" is especially important from this perspective. For instance, such equations and systems turn up in the theoretical study of composite materials. This project contributes to a better understanding of fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems, thereby providing scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the quality of consumer products manufactured from composites. As part of the project, the principal investigator trains Ph.D. students, many of whom are expected to continue their careers as educators. They, in turn, will convey to even younger generations both their mathematical knowledge and the long-term value of mathematical research not only to science and engineering but also, in the end, to society.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the PI has made valuable contributions in the areas of the project and the work supported by this award is a natural continuation of his earlier work. One part of the project concerns a long-standing open problem on the existence and compactness of solutions to a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem. This is equivalent to solving, on a Riemannian manifold, a fully nonlinear elliptic (but not uniformly elliptic) partial differential equation of second order. Closely related work includes a fully nonlinear Nirenberg problem and a fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem. There has not been enough understanding for such type of equations, especially comparing to that available for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations of second order where the theory is much more mature. The study of the open problem should lead to better understanding of these elliptic, but not uniformly elliptic, equations. It will also lead to a better understanding of degenerate elliptic fully nonlinear equations of second order. This will provide new tools in the study of this and other important nonlinear partial differential equations arising from geometry and physics. Another part of the project concerns elliptic equations and systems arising in the study of fluids and composite materials. In particular, new tools are developed to study a long-standing open problem on the existence of smooth solutions to the incompressible stationary Navier-Stokes equations on a flat torus of dimension sixteen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most research has focused on situations in which borders are already defined and present, as well as interactions involving at least one state or empire. This research trend leaves several issues poorly understood, including: the influence of already existing forms and contexts of interaction on the development of a border, the role of borderlanders, and the entanglement of social groups through interaction in zones of contact. This project leverages archaeology?s unique access to data on human actions over long periods of time to investigate the fluid creation and deconstruction of borders as scales of social interaction change. By focusing on a pre-state context, this project highlights conceptual tension in the social sciences between what is and is not a border, encouraging reflection on cross-border interactions in the strictly bordered world of today. The results of the project are shared with inhabitants of the nearby modern communities as well as the international academic community, providing the vital data needed to reconsider our understanding of long-term borderland interactions.<br/><br/>In this doctoral dissertation project the research team investigates the intersection of social interaction and the formation and deconstruction of borders in in a region in which interaction has persisted for centuries. The boundary persists until the current time. However the sharing of technologies and styles of decoration of material culture, across both regions suggests cross-border interactions must have occurred with some frequency. This project examines recently excavated public architecture, ceramics, and non-local materials to test models of the intersection between the creation and maintenance of borderlands and cross-border interaction. The multi-scalar, multi-disciplinary approach emphasizes the union of archaeological expertise and specialized analysis: the project weaves together stylistic and technological analysis of ceramics and architecture; petrographic and chemical sourcing of ceramics; aDNA and isotopic analysis of camelid remains; radiocarbon dating of organic remains; and chemical and habitat sourcing of other non-local materials to clarify the presence or absence and characteristics of the border as well as its manifestation at a local scale during its first supposed appearance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Instead of focusing on using mmWave for data communication, this project outlines a challenging research plan on exploring, implementing, and evaluating novel mmWave-based sensing techniques for cyber security applications. The project?s novelties are the development of mmWave-based biometrics to defend against more advanced attacks and to respond faster to potential data breaches. The project's broader significance and importance are that the research will help us to gain a fundamental understanding on adopting the mmWave-based sensing techniques for potential security applications. A successful outcome of the research will lead to new biometrics techniques that can provide stronger access control for device and data protection.<br/><br/>The project consists of three parts. The first part is to develop mmLock, a user-leaving detection system by analyzing the mmWave signal reflections from the user body. It can help lock device automatically to prevent data theft when the user is unknowingly away from his/her device. The research will explore and address the challenging scenario of having multiple moving objects simultaneously. The second part investigates a liveliness detection technique by checking the consistency between the user?s head movement pattern extracted from vision analysis and the pattern from the corresponding mmWave data for more secure facial authentication. It has the potential to defend against the most advanced attacks such as 3D projection attack and can work in any lighting conditions. The third effort will implement a prototype system and evaluate its performance with regards to security and usability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The definition of convexity is elementary: a set is convex if it contains the straight-line path between any two of its elements. Yet the study of such sets leads to a rich and intricate branch of modern geometry, exhibiting unexpected connections to diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics, including probability, number theory, linear programming, computational geometry, and tomography. Significant parts of the project will rely on new techniques for constructing convex bodies and exposing their geometric properties using the Fourier transform, which represents mathematical objects via their frequency decomposition. The project will provide research opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows. In addition, the principal investigators will continue their organization of seminars and other meetings including the Informal Analysis Seminar, a twice yearly meeting where researchers from around the world present lectures aimed at early career researchers.<br/><br/>The project involves the study of questions in convex geometry using tools from harmonic analysis and differential geometry. Some of the proposed research questions arose in the context of earlier work of the principal investigators, where Fourier analytic approaches were used to study inequalities involving volumes and mixed volumes. These approaches have proved indispensable in the solution of longstanding problems in convex geometry and geometric tomography. Many natural questions in convex geometry involve relationships between volumes of pairs of convex sets; among these is an open question posed by K. Mahler in 1939.  Another source of inspiration is the so-called `Scottish Book?, an informal collection of about 200 problems in mathematics which originated in the 1930s. Stanislav Ulam?s 19th Problem, taken from the Scottish Book, asks for a characterization of the convex sets of a fixed density (less than one) which float in an equilibrium position in every orientation (in water, of density one). Surprisingly, round balls are not the only such sets, due to a recent result of one of the principal investigators of this project. Part of the current project involves a further study of Ulam?s 19th Problem in relation to the properties of sections and projections of convex bodies. A second research direction involves the Mahler conjecture for volumes of three-dimensional convex bodies. This conjecture is known to hold under an additional symmetry assumption, and the project will consider the general version of this conjecture in three dimensions. The project will provide ample opportunities for participation in research by early-career researchers, including graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has long been known that Earth?s ice sheets expand when atmospheric CO2 is low and shrink when CO2 rises. The underlying climate mechanisms that regulate CO2 levels however, remain unclear.  One possibility is that changes in ocean circulation influence air-sea gas exchange.  It has been hypothesized that expansion of deep waters from the Southern Ocean limited the release of carbon during the last ice age (~20,000 years ago).  Reconstructing ocean circulation in the past is therefore essential to understanding what regulates atmospheric CO2 over long time periods. In this study, we will use a new method to reconstruct the ocean circulation using oxygen isotope analyses of microscopic fossils from marine sediment cores. Students from all levels, high school to undergraduate to graduate, will participate in this research.<br/><br/>Earth?s climate during the LGM (Last Glacial Maximum ~20,000 years ago) was characterized by lower atmospheric CO2 levels, cooler surface temperatures, and lower global sea level.  The Atlantic Ocean circulation was also likely marked by shoaling of deep waters that emanate from the North Atlantic and incursion of abyssal waters from the Southern Ocean. Our understanding of the circulation is based mainly on carbon isotope analyses of microfossils that suggest southern source waters replaced northern source waters in the North Atlantic.  The image of southern source waters dominating the deep Atlantic has become a defining feature of the LGM, as familiar as well-known changes in pCO2, surface temperature, and sea level.  More recently, however, results from neodymium isotopes imply the deep North Atlantic was influenced primarily by northern source waters, challenging the canonical view of the LGM circulation.  The goal of the proposed work is to determine which of these two scenarios is most likely correct using oxygen isotopes as a circulation tracer.  The oxygen isotopic composition of microfossils is conservative because it varies mainly as a function of temperature.  Once the oxygen isotope ratio is set at the sea surface, it changes only through ocean circulation and mixing.  The carbon isotope composition of microfossils, on the other hand, is non-conservative because it is also influenced by biological processes that compromise its utility as a circulation tracer.  The proposed work will benefit the paleoclimate community by creating the first section for the LGM Atlantic based on a conservative water mass tracer.  The oxygen isotope results will also facilitate validation of other circulation proxies and lead to improved model simulations of the ocean circulation and its role in the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fusion-based metal additive manufacturing employs a high-energy heat source to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) metal and metal-based parts through a layer-by-layer process. Despite the high density, additive parts have inherent limitations in mechanical properties such as anisotropy and low ductility, which will significantly hinder their use in critical structural applications. To address these limitations, this project will perform fundamental research to enable a transformative manufacturing process?HI-RAM. This new process incorporates an in-situ thermomechanical hot rolling process in the additive manufacturing process, in which a micro-roller trails the heat source and rolls the deposited metal bead. The high-performance structural parts fabricated by HI-RAM could increase the adoption of 3D printed metal parts by many industries, and thus HI-RAM could significantly enhance U.S. manufacturing leadership. This project will build partnerships with colleges, high schools, local manufacturers, and manufacturing organizations to deliver professional training related to HI-RAM, aimed at motivating and preparing a high-quality manufacturing workforce. The project involves multiple disciplines, including advanced manufacturing, materials science, structural mechanics, and applied mathematics, and also expects to broaden the participation of women and underrepresented minorities and strengthen education in STEM. <br/><br/>The HI-RAM technology could drastically improve the mechanical properties of additive metals by eliminating anisotropy, improving ductility, and increasing strength, through the mechanism of recrystallization-induced texture elimination and grain refinement. A new 3D multi-physics simulation platform will be established to study the dynamic recrystallization mechanisms, which will be the first model to accurately and efficiently capture the thermal-mechanical-metallurgical relationship in deformation-enhanced 3D printing. The project will address gaps in knowledge about the relationships between dynamic recrystallization and additive manufacturing?s non-equilibrium features and in-situ plastic deformation. It will explore strategies to obtain homogeneous recrystallization in the as-printed textured microstructure, using rolling parameters, roller profiles, and the cyclic and accumulative process conditions. Additionally, this project will investigate the critical multi-physics phenomena to guarantee process performance, such as laser?material interaction, solidification, crystal plasticity, and recrystallization. While this research focuses on the promising in-situ hot rolling and laser-directed energy deposition process, the research outcomes and manufacturing methodology will inform different metal additive manufacturing processes and microscopic forming processes.

Groups are fundamental objects in mathematics and ubiquitous in real life; for example, the numbers on a 12-hour clock form a group of 12 elements. The addressed problems are of combinatorial nature; for example, if we take any subset of a group, then as long as the subset is ''large'' in some sense (without any assumption on its structure), we predict that some pattern will emerge. Graduate students will be trained as part of this proposal. The PI will also be involved in K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>The groups studied in this project are: (1) The integers and their polynomial ring analogs, for which techniques from number theory apply, (2) finite groups, including vector spaces over finite fields, for which techniques from algebra apply, and (3) more general amenable groups, for which techniques from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory apply. Problems studied in this proposal include the following: If a subset A of a group G is large in some sense (e.g. A has positive density, or comes from a finite partition of G), then can one find structures in sumsets such as A-A and A+A-A? This question is intimately related to various notions of recurrence in ergodic theory and topological dynamics.

The project focuses on developing theoretical tools to understand large classes of diphantine equations.  Applications of understanding these equations, and their related shadows over finite number systems, abound, e.g., in cryptography and coding theory.  The PI has experience working on the latter applications.  The project will also fund mentoring and outreach efforts, with particular attention to increasing retention of students and researchers from underrepresented backgrounds in Mathematics, including leading small research project groups outside his primary institution, and organizing research conferences that specifically foster a sense of community and belonging.  The PI currently advises five PhD students and two postdoctoral scholars, and expects to maintain a vigorous research and training group.

It is expected that these ideas will have wide application in other problems of arithmetic geometry around Galois groups.  In a related direction, the PI will systematically study the behavior of rationality over number-theoretic bases, by leveraging the connection between certain kinds of fourfolds and surfaces twisted by Brauer classes.

Given sufficient time and instructional support, students can demonstrate a high level of achievement for a set of skills. Industry demand for skilled technicians in advanced manufacturing continues to grow as manufacturers adopt new technologies to improve productivity and product quality. This project will implement mastery learning in a core set of courses to address industry?s need for advanced manufacturing technicians who have the necessary foundational skills and hands-on experience to be successful in the technician workforce. A dual enrollment program based on mastery learning for regional high school students will provide a pathway for students into the advanced manufacturing program. The project team will assess the impact of mastery learning on student learning outcomes and the effectiveness of recruiting activities for high school students. Project results will be disseminated regionally through the state?s community college system to instructors in other manufacturing programs. Lessons learned from implementing mastery learning will be presented at national conferences focused on technical education.<br/><br/>Regional manufacturers recently collaborated on identifying foundational skills for students in an existing advanced manufacturing program at Piedmont Virginia Community College. The goals of this project are to: 1) improve student learning outcomes for foundational skills in advanced manufacturing; 2) increase the number of graduates from the advanced manufacturing program; and 3) help students understand the workplace environment at regional manufacturers. Mastery learning will be implemented in six core courses using a flipped classroom approach with hands-on learning for advanced manufacturing technologies. Courses will be structured as a sequence of modules that students complete at their own pace. Each module builds on the content of previous modules while introducing more advanced concepts. Students must achieve the learning objectives for a module before moving to the next module. This project will provide professional development for high school teachers to implement the modules in four dual enrollment courses. The project team will partner with existing clubs, organizations, and programs to develop recruiting activities that will focus on broadening participation in the advanced manufacturing program. Students will have opportunities to engage with regional industry through structured activities such as site visits and job shadowing so that students can learn about workplace practices. Project results will provide insights for the technical education community on the effectiveness of mastery learning in advanced manufacturing programs. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation?s economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In computational imaging systems, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and phase microscopy, indirect measurements of an object are taken with specialized hardware, and software is used to compute a final reconstruction. For example, the measurements in CT are projection images, and software post-processing results in a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the object. The object is the input of the computational imaging system, such as biological cells on a microscope slide or a brain in a CT scan. The drawback of computational imaging systems is that they generally require a large number of measurements per object, which may be costly and slow to collect, making them prohibitive for many applications. This program develops data-driven, probabilistic methods for computational imaging to reduce imaging time. The developed algorithms will not require a ground truth or reference training dataset, unlike many other machine learning methods. Success of this program will allow scientific advances in biology and medicine by imaging in previously inaccessible spatiotemporal regimes. The broader impact is wide-ranging, including: lowered dose in CT and electron microscopy, reduced acquisition time in MRI, reduced photobleaching in fluorescence localization microscopy for live cell imaging, and real-time microscopy in surgical procedures. Developed methods can be applied to make medical imaging faster, improving patient comfort, reducing radiation exposure, and lowering costs. Complementary educational programs will be developed in tandem with the research plan to broaden participation from underrepresented groups in engineering. Initiatives include summer experiences for high school students from nearby underserved communities and early college research involvement for undergraduates.<br/> <br/>The proposed work improves the temporal resolution of light-emitting diode (LED) array microscopy, a modality that allows reconstruction of quantitative amplitude and phase (i.e., permittivity) in two and three dimensions with high resolution and high field-of-view. Algorithm development for LED array microscopy will build the foundation for research on other computational imaging methods such as micro-computed tomography and x-ray nano-holographic tomography. Measurements in computational imaging are taken with varying hardware parameters; in the case of LED array microscopy, the illumination pattern is varied to collect a stack of images. The key innovation in this work is to jointly reconstruct similar objects, each with a low number of measurements taken with hardware parameters that vary from object to object. By pooling information from measurements across the set of objects and incorporating the forward physics model, prior and posterior distributions can be jointly inferred. To efficiently solve this problem, this program creates a novel technique through a reformulation of variational autoencoders. Crucially, no ground truth dataset is assumed: only noisy, sparse measurements on each object. The probabilistic formulation considered in this work permits uncertainty quantification, in contrast to reconstruction algorithms that only yield a point estimate. Simulated and experimental data will be used to explore the impact of measurement parameter diversity on accuracy, stability, and robustness. A novel adaptive measurement technique will be evaluated, in which the hardware parameters for object measurement are chosen based on the object data previously collected. High memory management techniques and considerations for video reconstruction will be created and assessed, with the significance of allowing developed frameworks to be applied to real experimental problems of high scientific interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Schomaker of the University of Wisconsin is studying the development of new earth abundant and inexpensive catalysts to transform feedstock chemicals from petroleum and biorenewable sources into valuable building blocks for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymers, and fuels. The carbon-hydrogen (C?H) bond is the most common type of chemical bond in organic compounds and it can be transformed into more valuable bonds, including carbon-nitrogen (C?N) bonds. However, it is challenging to achieve selectivity for a desired reaction at only one specific C?H bond when there are multiple different C?H bonds in a molecule. In this project, Professor Schomaker?s group is expanding the design of low-cost silver catalysts to transform C?H bonds into C?N bonds in high yields and using this knowledge to develop even less expensive catalysts based on the earth abundant metals iron and copper. These catalysts generate less waste, deliver several useful products from a single starting material, and streamline the preparation of selected commercial drugs that contain at least one C?N bond. In terms of broader impacts, Professor Schomaker participates in outreach programs to educate and engage the general public, especially young women, in science. Her studies are aimed at making her laboratory?s research and new catalysts appealing to industry by showing how water can be used as an environmentally sustainable solvent, exploring efficient electrochemical methods to reduce waste streams, and collaborating with industry partners. Graduate and undergraduate students benefit from these broader impacts through exposure to real world applications of their chemistry and by receiving co-mentoring from industrial colleagues.<br/><br/>The work being carried out in this project is expected to lead to the development of low-cost, modular catalysts based on silver, iron and copper for the tunable functionalization of C?H bonds to upgraded C?N bonds. To address this issue, Professor Schomaker is pursuing both the fundamental understanding and the practical applications of new catalytic systems able to achieve predictable catalyst control of the chemo-, site-, and stereoselective transformations of C?H bonds to C?N bonds through metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer processes. She also plans to extend the utility of these catalysts to selectively transform C?H bonds into more valuable C?C and C?O bonds. These investigations will combine mechanistic, spectroscopic, and computational studies (density functional theory and higher-level ab initio methods such as CASSCF) to understand how the features of diverse and easily prepared N- and P-donor ligands influence: 1) the electronic structures of the resulting metal nitrenes and carbenes, 2) the dynamic behavior of reactive intermediates, 3) non-covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst to control site-selectivity of the C?H functionalization, and finally, 4) the ability to develop general, modular, and readily accessible catalysts for enantioselective nitrene transfers. Ultimately, this work aims to establish universal design principles to sustainably facilitate non-directed C?H functionalization that overrides innate reactivity preferences. The scientific broader impacts of this work will be expanded by applying these principles to a diverse range of transition metal-catalyzed C?H bond oxidations. Additional broader impacts include the ability to use non-chlorinated solvents for these transformations, the employment of electrochemical methods to replace stoichiometric oxidants, and the collaboration with industrial partners in targeting late-stage modifications of drug scaffolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bringing together experts in the areas group theory and number theory, this conference will provide new networking opportunities and stimulate important research collaborations between researchers in these two branches of mathematics. Group theory is motivated by the study of symmetries of objects found in many areas of science, art, and technology, from molecular structures, to the spin of particles, to the patterns in cryptosystems, to the structure of musical chords. Number theory is motivated by the study of the integers, prime numbers, integer-valued functions, and generalizations of these objects, and has applications to the same areas as group theory. In many of the key problems in group theory, one sees natural relationships to number theory, and vice versa. Recent advances and open conjectures in the two areas have made it clear that there is a strong benefit to being able to combine the techniques from both. This conference will inspire progress on important questions, while also broadening the tools and ideas available to researchers in both areas, and fostering a new generation of researchers studying interactions of group theory and number theory. Students, early-career researchers, and mathematicians who identify as women and other underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to participate. <br/><br/>One of the most well-known examples with a clear relationship between group theory (and, more specifically, representation theory) and number theory is the Langlands program.

These low-dimensional systems exhibit unique dynamics that are sensitive to nanoscale chemical variations, which are difficult to observe using existing microscopic techniques. The Li group is developing a new microscopy called hyperdimensional scanning tunneling microscopy (HD-STM) to study these materials with Angstrom spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution.

Climate projections indicate that the Arctic will continue to warm, but uncertainties arise due to questions about the future behavior of Arctic clouds.  An area of primary uncertainty is the properties of clouds that form during cold-air outbreaks, where very cold airmasses over the Arctic ice move southward over the relatively warm open ocean.  This award will help to analyze observational data of these clouds (and precipitation) and the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere during the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR), which will be conducted in Spring 2024 out of northern Scandinavia.  The observations collected during CAESAR will be used to better understand the characteristics of the cold-air outbreak system, and the Arctic climate system more broadly, to inform climate models and projections.  The project will also help to improve forecasting of weather hazards with significant relevance to naval operations, commercial shipping, and coastal communities.

Sets of solutions to polynomial equations give rise to what we call algebraic varieties, which are the central object of study in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. In order to answer such types of questions, one needs to detect and compute various invariants of the algebraic variety that reflect its algebraic and geometric properties. This project is concerned with the study of an invariant used for higher dimensional varieties, called the Chow group of zero-cycles, which can be used for classification of algebraic varieties, and relates to the question of existence of rational solutions to polynomial equations. On the broader impact of this award, the PI will support one graduate student and continue her various service and outreach activities including conference and seminar organization and the Bridge to the doctorate program at the University of Virginia. <br/><br/>This project focuses on four conjectures for zero-cycles. The first conjecture concerns the construction of motivic filtrations for the Chow group of zero-cycles. The PI has prior work on this subject for abelian varieties using some K-theoretic techniques, which she now plans to extend to some special classes of K3 surfaces. The second conjecture, due to Colliot and Thelene, concerns algebraic varieties over p-adic fields, and in particular establishing this conjecture for abelian varieties using various techniques including formal group laws and integral p-adic Hodge theory. The PI also plans to study two conjectures over algebraic number fields, and the compatibility between them.

Chemical transformations will first be utilized to prepare polymers and copolymers containing carbon-boron bond along the main backbone.  The synthesized macromolecules will then be diversified by converting these bonds to corresponding alcohols, chlorides and simple alpha-olefins.  The synthesis of these historically inaccessible polymers is expected to uncover new structure-function relationships and enable systematic evaluation of physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of these systems. Additionally, since the prepared polymers will contain polar and nonpolar functionalities, improved adhesion and oxygen permeability is expected.  Both properties are very important in several applications or relevance to commercial plastics.  The involvement in the Summer Undergraduate Research Excellence (SURE) program between Johns Hopkins University and Trinity Washington University, a minority-serving institution and women?s college in Washington, DC, will enable training of minority and first-generation undergraduate students in polymer science research.  Additional outreach and educational activities related to polymer science and sustainability will be conducted at a college preparatory high school with a diverse student body in Olney, Maryland.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the development of new polymer modification chemistries using borane-substituted polyolefins as precursors to access (co)polymers that are otherwise difficult to obtain. Specifically, the synthesis of copolymers that are formally derived from allylic monomers such as allyl chloride and allyl alcohol, as well as propene, will be conducted using Matteson homologation followed by hydrogenative, oxidative, and/or chlorinative deborylation.  The insertion of a methylene or chloromethyl group into a carbon?boron bond via Matteson homologation is a particularly compelling application of organoborane chemistry because it can be applied iteratively and stereospecifically, while yielding few byproducts.  This research is targeting (co)polymers of allyl alcohol, allyl chloride, and alpha-olefins; polymers that are elusive and highly desired materials that cannot be accessed directly from polymerization of allylic monomers due to competitive chain transfer, catalyst poisoning, or mismatched reactivity ratios. Polymers synthesized as a result of this work is anticipated to open up new chemical space for systematic structure-property studies of relevance to the synthetic organic and polymer communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By relating these symmetries to geometry, the program creates a powerful way of obtaining arithmetic information. The project is particularly concerned with obtaining such information in an algorithmically computable way. Deep and explicit knowledge of the arithmetic of numbers is essential for many technological advances over the last decades that we take for granted today, including encryption and digital security. Part of this work involves mentoring of young scientists.<br/><br/>More precisely, the project aims at deepening our understanding of the refined Arthur-Langlands conjectures for general connected and disconnected reductive groups, in particular the internal structure of local and global packets and the character identities satisfied by them. The study of disconnected groups, while of interest in its own right, is also essential for the study of connected groups. The special case of disconnected groups over the real numbers will serve as a first step. An important role in obtaining the refined conjectures beyond the case of discrete parameters is played by self-intertwining operators acting on parabolically induced representations, and the project seeks to obtain natural normalizations of these and a precise statement of the intertwining relation. The project will also construct non-generic Arthur packets for local and global unitary groups, and obtain a description of the full discrete automorphic spectrum of global unitary groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As there is typically no explicit description of the distribution, in order to make effective use of the data, one must develop efficient methods of determining which salient properties are held by the underlying distribution. Such distribution testing tasks are fundamental to scientific analysis, and recent years have seen a leap in our understanding of how to design such algorithms. However, the amount of sample data needed to successfully achieve many of these tasks can be prohibitively large. This project aims to develop algorithms which capitalize on known structures in the data in order to give significantly more efficient solutions. In addition, this project will develop sample-efficient methods of ascertaining whether the data indeed has the claimed structure. This project will include the organization of an annual Workshop on Local Algorithms (WOLA) and will produce publicly available educational material based on current research. The project will also include co-chairing a postdoctoral program specifically aimed at broadening participation and other mentoring activities. The project will engage with high school students in local public schools by giving presentations and serving on advisory committees.<br/><br/>This project studies the role of structure in distribution testing. This research will lead to tools for understanding the tradeoffs between the sample complexity required to test properties of distributions and the strength of the assumptions made a priori on the distributions being tested. In a first thrust, algorithms will be developed which capitalize on known (or assumed) existing structural properties in the sample data to give significantly more efficient solutions for estimating information-theoretic quantities and determining whether the data additionally satisfies other structural properties. In a second thrust, new techniques will be developed for designing algorithms to determine whether the data in fact has the assumed structural properties. Unfortunately, for many natural structural properties, the task of testing whether data satisfies these structural properties can be expensive. Fortunately, in many important settings, it can be the case that testing whether the precise structural properties hold is unnecessary. Thus, in a third thrust, this project will consider techniques that bypass the difficulty of testing for structure by testing only that the data has enough structure to make it amenable for use in the settings for which the data is intended. Specifically, such methods allow one to safely use (possibly modified versions of) agnostic learning algorithms that depend on a weaker distributional assumption on the data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional on campus technician programs can create barriers for potential students who have time constraints due to commuting in a rural environment, jobs, or family obligations. New training strategies are needed to increase accessibility to technical education programs for students who need greater flexibility in their schedules and current workers who need upskilling. This project will implement competency-based education for a core set of courses in electronics and controls that will allow students to complete a certificate program at their own pace. Instructional materials, competency assessments, and simulation tools will be available for students online to address the need for greater accessibility and flexibility. Competency-based assessments will provide meaningful feedback allowing students to practice, refine their techniques, and improve their performance until they achieve the necessary competency for a module in a course. Simulation tools will help students understand how to work with technologies without requiring a physical lab space. The results of this project will be made available to technical education programs at other community colleges.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase the number of skilled technicians to address the need of regional manufacturers. Four objectives will guide the execution of this project. First is to increase program accessibility and improve alignment with employer needs by implementing competency-based modularized hybrid course modules. Second is to expand the role of the current foundational Business and Industry Leadership Team to guide the development of the modules. Third is to provide professional development for faculty to develop and implement modules in their courses. Fourth, and finally, is to recruit and retain students for the certificate program with an emphasis on broadening participation. The project will use the Backward Design Process to develop competency-based modularized hybrid content for each technical course in the Electronics Technology program. Hybrid delivery options include online, on or off campus, simulations including virtual reality, and physical simulations. Remote delivery and open industrial labs will be available during times that are convenient for industry partners and employees. Hands-on skills assessment will be conducted in an open industrial lab environment on campus or at industry sites. The impact of the competency-based modules on student enrollment, engagement and retention will be assessed using institutional data and student surveys.

In many problems in these areas, identifying an underlying cluster structure reveals hidden combinatorial structures and symmetries, thereby leading to explicit, constructive proofs of deep results. This research program will closely involve early career researchers, with plans to disseminate both the necessary background ideas and cutting edge results from the project through the organization of mini-schools aimed at graduate students and postdocs in adjacent areas of research.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project focuses on the quantum geometry of moduli spaces of local systems on surfaces, and the problem of quantizing Lagrangian submanifolds of these symplectic moduli spaces. Constructing such a quantization amounts to producing a canonical vector in the Hilbert space associated to the surface, and in accordance with the philosophy of topological quantum field theory, these quantized Lagrangians are closely related to the geometry of three-manifolds. The PI will systematically study this quantization problem, developing along the way new structures on the underlying moduli spaces of local systems based on their connection with representation theory. New directions to be explored include the construction of integrable systems providing higher Teichmueller-theoretic analogs of the classical Fenchel-Nielsen Hamiltonians on Teichmueller spaces, as well understanding the behavior of the cluster structure for moduli spaces of local systems with non-generic monodromy data at punctures, which is intimately connected with the theory of double affine Hecke algebras and their higher genus analogs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, US coastal regions experience hurricanes and other extreme wind events that affect the performance and safety of cable-stayed bridges during construction, service, and long-term conditions. Taking advantage of the digital revolution and the continuous improvement of computer-aided simulations and data-driven design methods, this research will recast the design method for cable-stayed bridges currently used in the bridge industry based on heuristic experience-based design strategies that have relied only on wind tunnel testing or in-situ performance evaluation.

This project aims to study several classes of moduli spaces which lie at the crossroads of central areas in mathematics and physics. The investigator will develop new tools concerning these varieties, attack long standing questions, and explore new connections.

By contrast, current infrared technology is mainly based on expensive materials that are incompatible with silicon and sometimes even toxic. The grant enables the formation of a team, which consists of investigators from three different universities, to pursue key scientific challenge for the integration of heterogeneous materials is accommodating the difference in size between the atomic blocks that make up their crystal structures. This size mismatch can induce atomic misplacements that degrade the performance of detector devices. The solution requires collaborative work between physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and device engineers. The multidisciplinary character of the team provides a unique educational experience for the future workforce by integrating many different perspectives around the co-design ideas of the FuSe program. The team members have a very diverse and complementary expertise, from circuit design to fully microscopic quantum-mechanical simulations, including the development of new synthetic strategies beyond conventional methods. <br/><br/>PART II: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The team is building research collaborations aimed at overcoming the very large lattice mismatch between silicon and infrared GeSn or SiGeSn alloys (which exceeds 4% and limits the critical thickness for defect-free growth to one or two atomic monolayers) for monolithic integration of detectors and readout components, understanding the ultimate dark current limits of diodes based on GeSn or SiGeSn, and designing readout circuitry matched to these diode characteristics and to the growth of the infrared devices.  Within these general research targets, the initial team-building effort is carried out with the purpose of determining the structure of misfit dislocations between GeSn alloys and Si substrates, performing detailed spectroscopy of point defects, understanding dislocations and point defects using first-principles calculations, and eliminating surface defects that contribute to the dark current. During the FuSe Teaming Grant period the team addresses these challenges using a multidisciplinary approach by fully characterizing the structural properties of the alloys and their interface with Si by performing Rutherford Backscattering, Raman, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and electron microscopy studies. In particular, the latter makes it possible to determine the nature of the dislocations that control the strain-relaxation progress. The team also evaluates electrical and optical properties of novel passivating dielectrics, antireflection layers and oxides for GeSn or SiGeSn alloys, and the researchers perform systematic spectroscopy studies of defects that can be associated with observed dark currents in GeSn and SiGeSn diodes.

Owing to their ultimate thinness, such materials hold tremendous promise as a platform for future energy-efficient nanoelectronic and energy devices, which may enable extremely dense integrated circuits, and wearable and multifunctional electronics. Electronic and thermal properties of materials are not only mutually coupled but strongly interdependent: electrical resistance increases drastically with temperature, which, in turn, increases heat dissipation, creating hot spots that waste energy and limit performance. This is particularly pronounced in 2D materials, whose atomic thinness and relatively weak coupling to the environment may present a bottleneck to heat removal. In this project, the PI will develop and release a code that treats the dynamics of charge and heat carriers concurrently in various 2D materials of scientific and technological relevance. The code to be developed will be disseminated freely to the community, along with maintaining a dedicated website for forums and documentation. <br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities, which include training and mentoring the next generation of computational materials scientists and introducing computational science to students across levels, by redesigning core materials courses, recruiting underrepresented students in science, math, and engineering disciplines, and creating free online educational modules to teach undergraduate students high-performance and parallel computing.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports computational research for the development and applications of a simulation tool to solve the coupled Boltzmann transport equations for electrons and phonons in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Simulating thermal dissipation inside 2D nanostructures requires a two-way coupled treatment of electrons and heat, the latter being transported by phonons. Computing electron-phonon coupling from first principles and solving the electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations using ab initio inputs has now reached full maturity. However, there is a critical need for a platform that will enable studying non-isothermal transport, where electron and phonon populations are simulated concurrently so that phonons generated by electron-phonon coupling are tracked and their distribution/temperature fed back into electron transport and vice versa. To address this need, the PI will develop and release a code, called CelphonBTE2D, for two-way coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport simulation of 2D materials and heterostructures. The code will build on first-principles data to enable predictive simulation for realistic applications. <br/><br/>The code to be developed will be disseminated via the nanoHUB, which will host source code and track usage, along with a dedicated website for forums and documentation.

The theory was initiated by Francis J. Murray and John von Neumann in the 1930s, and since then researchers have discovered a vast number of applications to mathematics as well as biology, physics, and engineering. The von Neumann algebras that occur naturally in physics (e.g. quantum statistical mechanics or relativistic quantum field theory) are typically what are known as non-semifinite von Neumann algebras. This makes them more difficult to study, and in particular they lie outside the scope of the majority of techniques developed for so-called semifinite von Neumann algebras over the past few decades. This project seeks to adapt some of these semifinite techniques to almost periodic von Neumann algebras, which straddle the boundary between semifinite and non-semifinite von Neumann algebras.  The project will also involve training and professional development for graduate students and postdocs.  <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to study von Neumann algebras that admit almost periodic weights, with a focus on the non-semifinite case. Specifically, the PI will develop a notion of von Neumann dimension for almost periodic von Neumann algebras and use this to generalize free Stein dimension and l^2-Betti numbers to the almost periodic case. These invariants would shed light on the structural properties of such von Neumann algebras, and an extended notion of l^2-Betti numbers has potential applications to non-unimodular groups and non-measure preserving equivalence relations. Additionally, the PI proposes to extend the notions of rigid and co-rigid inclusions from finite von Neumann algebras to von Neumann algebras equipped with almost periodic states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polaritons are unusual states that are produced by coupling the surface plasmons created by optical excitation in metals to the excited states of molecules or semiconductors.  Polaritons have very short lifetimes and move very quickly, making them difficult to study using conventional techniques.  Professors Hartland, Kuno and their students will use sophisticated light scattering and ultrafast microscopy techniques to measure the lifetimes of exciton-plasmon polaritons, as well as the distances they travel along individual semiconductor-metal nanostructures.  Discoveries from this project could lead to a better understanding of the properties of polaritons in nanomaterials, and new strategies for solar energy generation.  High school teachers and students will be recruited for this project from the Penn-Harris-Madison School Corporation, a local school district with a population of approximately 12,000 students.  They will  participate in the light scattering experiments, as well as a proect to develop a low-cost microscope for detecting and characterizing microplastics in the environment. The project will contribute to the development of the Nation's scientific workforce in this way as well as by providing research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>To understand the properties of exciton-plasmon polaritons, and whether they can be used for applications such as solar energy conversion, it is important to understand their dynamics.  Because the lifetimes of these states are typically very short (<100 fs), they are challenging to measure.  In this project the lifetimes of polariton states created by coupling propagating surface plasmons (PSPs) of single metal nanostructures to the exciton transitions of semiconductors will be investigated by light scattering and ultrafast transient absorption microscopy.  In the light scattering experiments a combination of real space and back-focal plane imaging will be used to measure the propagation lengths and group velocities, respectively, of the exciton-PSP polariton states.  These two quantities give the polariton lifetime.  Importantly, these experiments can be used to interrogate systems with very short lifetimes.  For systems where the dynamics are relatively slow (50-100 fs), the lifetimes will also be directly measured by ultrafast single-particle transient absorption experiments.  Measurements will be performed for different semiconductors coupled to Ag or Au nanostructures, as well as for non-traditional plasmonic systems, such as titanium nitride (TiN).  There are several technological broader impacts of the proposed work. For example, the propagation lengths for SPPs (surface plasmon polarities) are much longer than those for exciton states. Thus, coupling excitons to SPPs can significantly increase their propagation lengths, and potentially improve the performance of solar energy conversion devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Slow slip has been seen before large earthquakes, but it is usually different from what the theories predict. Dr. McLaskey and his team will use laboratory experiments and computer models to measure and understand slow slip and tiny earthquakes that happen along faults before a large earthquake.  In the laboratory experiments, a ten-foot slab of rock with a cut (fault) embedded in it is compressed and sheared using a giant press, making the fault creep and then slip suddenly in ""laboratory"" earthquakes. The experiments can test how realistic, non-uniform fault properties?like rough versus slippery sections, or bumps and bends?can play a role in providing warning signs of an impending earthquake. Computer models will be developed to understand and explain data collected during the laboratory earthquake experiments. To check how well these computer models perform, they will be tested against a large collection of data on slow pre-earthquake slip and earthquakes that are ocurring beneath a glacier in Antarctica. As part of this project, three graduate students and at least two undergraduates will receive training in earthquake science (experiments, modeling, and data analysis).<br/><br/>Heterogeneous fault properties?bumps, bends, differing lithology, and heterogeneous loading conditions that exist at a variety of scales?are generally not considered in earthquake nucleation theories, but have been shown to strongly influence the way an earthquake initiates. On a heterogeneous fault, neighboring fault patches reach failure at different times, often resulting in the propagation of slow slip fronts that may only be detectable as a gradual decrease in seismic coupling, such as that observed prior to the M 9 Tohoku Earthquake, or from the migration and coalescence of microseismicity. This project explores the behavior of heterogeneous faults late in the earthquake cycle including the propagation of slow slip fronts and their interaction with strong/unstable asperities. These mechanisms may transform models of the way earthquakes initiate and better inform the interpretation of precursory activity. This project employs meter-scale laboratory experiments, where heterogeneous fault properties are imposed at specific locations and the effects on earthquake nucleation and triggering by slow slip fronts are studied in detail. Additionally, theoretical and numerical models for slow slip propagation on heterogeneous faults are developed to extend the laboratory results to length scales and conditions more relevant to natural earthquakes. The models are then tested against a field-scale glacial stick-slip cycle at Whillans Ice Stream, an Antarctic glacier, where aseismic transients affect 100 km-scale glacial stick-slip events and exhibit behavior similar to that observed in the lab.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Competing chemical dynamics processes such as energy transfer, isomerization, and dissociation are not well understood in the high-pressure collisional regime. Current computational methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and computational cost for studying vibrational energy relaxation and reaction dynamics in the high-pressure collisional regime. Professor Rivera and his students will apply canonical approaches to develop molecular dynamics simulations that are highly accurate, computationally inexpensive, and, more importantly, with broader applicability to condensed phase dynamics. Their studies could lead to a better understanding of fundamental chemical dynamics processes under extreme conditions of high pressure and temperature, which is otherwise a challenge to achieve by current theoretical and experimental methods. The intended outreach activities with middle school students will prepare and inspire the next generation of young scholars and scientists.<br/><br/>Understanding the mechanisms of vibrational energy transfer within and among molecules is fundamental to understanding many physical and chemical processes. The goal of this RUI project is to understand gas-phase fundamental chemical dynamics processes, such as energy transfer, isomerization, and dissociation in the high-pressure collisional regime. This project will also address the need for efficient approaches for generating accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) by application of canonical approaches. Canonical approaches demonstrate that for a class of molecules, their PESs have the same shape. What appears to be different shapes on the PESs is a matter of scaling. Canonical approaches will allow for computationally inexpensive and highly accurate molecular dynamics simulations, which are essential to study fundamental chemical dynamics processes. The insights gained from this project will take us a step closer to unifying models for gas and condensed-phase chemical processes. The outcomes of this work will give a fundamental understanding of the collisional energy transfer and chemical reactions where the isolated binary collision approximation breaks down.

These measurements will be useful for developing accurate and efficient computational methods for larger systems relevant to the catalytic and technological applications of the d- and f-block elements. Dr. Morse will examine the broad trends in chemical bonding as one moves across the periodic table in this work, and will investigate whether the dissociation energies of metals bonded to chemically related p-block elements, such as silicon and germanium, are strongly correlated. Professor Morse and his students will use resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy to study neutral d- and f-block molecules, and cryo-cooled ion photodissociation experiments to study metal-containing cations. In addition to training the graduate students who are directly involved in this project, Dr. Morse also organizes a biannual workshop for high school chemistry teachers, where he presents on physical chemistry topics that they have selected. Other speakers also present on chemical education research and educational psychology.<br/><br/>In this project, the Morse group will employ laser ablation of a metal sample in a pulsed supersonic expansion of helium with small amounts of a reactant gas to generate a molecular beam of the species of interest. They will then use a one laser pulse, which is scanned, to excite the molecule electronically and a second laser pulse to ionize the molecule.  Ions will then be detected using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Molecules with a high density of electronic states, such as the open d- and f-subshell molecules, fall apart on a subnanosecond time scale when they are excited above their dissociation energy, causing a sharp drop in ion signal. This provides a highly precise measurement of the bond energy. The Morse team is also able to use the high density of electronic states in these species to measure ionization energies to high precision. Employing a different instrument, the research team is using similar methods to measure the threshold for dissociation in a range of d- and f-block cryo-cooled ions. The bond dissociation energies of the neutral molecules and their cations can then be combined with the ionization energies of the neutral molecules and of the metal atoms using a thermochemical cycle to confirm the accuracy of all four measured values. These studies are likely to be particularly useful for the development of density functional theory methods for accurate computations of molecules containing the d- and f-block elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrocarbon functionalization is the cornerstone of the chemical industry and the energy economy, but methods for generating value-added commodity chemicals and fuels today typically rely on high temperatures, high pressures, and environmentally hazardous reagents. This has the consequence of dramatic energy usage, as steam reforming and related processes account for 1-10% of global energy consumption.  Motivated by biological systems that efficiently use special molecular cofactors containing metal-oxygen active sites, this project will investigate the manner in which interactions with light can actuate these motifs to selectively mediate the catalytic conversion of inert hydrocarbons to products. As the director of LSU?s ChemDemo program, Dr. Chambers will actively engage communities and provides hands-on science experiences to underserved and underrepresented K-12 students throughout the region. This project has potential long term broader impacts related to sustainable catalysis of relevance to the chemical industry.<br/><br/>Matthew Chambers and his group will investigate the factors that underpin early transition metal oxo photochemical properties (light absorption, emission energy, and lifetimes) and reactivity patterns. Photochemical characterization will be achieved via steady-state and transient luminescence spectroscopy and product distributions will be determined by NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis. An emphasis will be placed on more oxophilic platforms as, upon excitation, these systems may efficiently activate C?H bonds while allowing the activated substrate to undergo a diverse array of follow-up reactivity to achieve a broad range of products. The selectivity of these transformations is related experimentally and computationally to the M?OH bond dissociation energies of the intermediates as this is thought to be the critical parameter influencing product selectivity.

Kinetic studies will aim to identify the key steps during the reoxidation of the metal oxo photocatalyst while ancillary ligand field variations are directed at developing an understanding of the critical features impacting photocatalysis. Collectively, these aims are expected to lead to enhanced understanding of metal oxo photochemistry and the parameters that underpin selectivity.

Recently, there has been a major shift in the way materials in condensed matter physics are classified: the properties of many materials can now be understood in terms of their topological classification.  Topology is a fundamental characteristic of objects and materials.  Two seemingly disparate objects may belong to the same topological class: a donut and a coffee cup may seem to be entirely different objects, but both have a single hole, and hence are topologically similar.  Many groundbreaking scientific discoveries of the past century such as the quantum Hall effect have now been reinterpreted in terms of the topological properties of their constituent materials, and in doing so, new insights have been gained.  Designing materials and devices with specific topological properties also has potential technological advantages: for example, quantum computers based on topological qubits may be especially resistant to errors due to quantum decoherence.  However, synthesizing materials and devices with specific topological properties has proved messy and difficult.  This project explores a new way to develop devices with topologically important characteristics using superconducting hybrid devices, devices in which a superconductor is placed in contact with a material like gold or graphene.  The properties of such devices mimic those of real crystals, and by appropriate design, analogs of topologically interesting crystals can potentially be fabricated, enabling the study of topologically distinct systems.  The devices themselves are fabricated using sophisticated nanolithography techniques and measured at temperatures a few millidegrees above absolute zero.  The underlying physics and experimental techniques used in this proposal are applicable to a wide range of scientific research, ensuring that the students engaged in this project will be well trained for future careers in either academia or industry.     <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Materials with topologically non-trivial band structure are being studied intensively at the moment due to their potential applications in a number of areas, including in topological quantum computation.  The focus of this project is to create analogs of topologically non-trivial crystals using superconducting hybrid devices, or devices in which superconductors are placed in contact with a normal material such as gold or graphene.  The energy levels of quasiparticles in a normal metal in contact with two superconductors depend on the phase difference between the superconductors in much the same way as the energy levels of electrons in a crystal depend on the crystal momentum.  With more than two superconductors, analogs of higher dimensional crystals can be fabricated.  The goal of this effort is to search for signatures of non-trivial topology in specifically designed devices using electrical transport measurements at millikelvin temperatures, with the devices being fabricated by sophisticated nanolithography techniques.  In addition to furthering our understanding of topological systems, the knowledge and understanding gained in this project about the nature of the superconducting proximity effect, particularly in the ballistic devices, will improve the understanding of superconducting correlations in proximity effect devices targeted to topological quantum computing.  The nanolithography and low temperature experimental techniques required are similar to the techniques needed in emerging fields in quantum information science, ensuring that students involved in the project are well trained in skills required for the quantum workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials have been leading to deeper knowledge of important topics in physics, and display a kaleidoscope of novel electronic properties with great promise for technology applications, such as very high mobility or even dissipationless transport for energy-saving devices. The ability to manipulate these properties, particularly using electrical approaches to switch on and off, enhancing or suppression, is expected to enable a new generation of technology. This project aims to develop such ability to provide insights to implement those novel materials in technology applications. Integrated into the research activities is a broad scope of educational and outreach efforts to prepare a multi-talented and diverse quantum material workforce, including implementing a scalable approach to train an inclusive group of students of various levels, creating interdisciplinary courses to enhance material science education and prepare students for career paths, and partnering with a historically black college or university and a local underrepresented community to enhance research and education opportunities.<br/> <br/>Technical abstract:<br/>This project pursues the electrical control of topological electronic states by engineering lattice and time reversal symmetries in layered topological semimetals. Topological phase control is performed by electrostatic electron and hole doping and electrochemical intercalation in all-solid electrical double layer devices, which is based on the hypothesis that electron density acts as a tuning knob to modify these symmetries and drive topological phase transitions. This research aims to topological phase transitions between Dirac nodal-line semimetal, topological insulator, normal insulator, and Weyl semimetal phases. The obtained knowledge and developed techniques further enable the spatially selective control of topological phases to form lateral heterostructures, leading to a versatile platform to explore exciting quantum physics. Based on that, this project also targets to establish and demonstrate concrete strategies for realizing completely confined topological fermions and creating fundamentally new insights for novel confinement-induced phenomena in topological quantum materials. Finally, the education plan is closely integrated and leverages the research activities by training a diverse workforce with a broad mix of quantum-related skills, and in the long term, continue to benefit the condensed matter and materials science research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project combines numerical simulations and data analysis to better understand these processes. A graduate student and undergraduate students will be supported and mentored.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed investigation is to substantially narrow down the list of processes that have been suggested for energizing plasma along both closed and open magnetic field lines in the outer solar atmosphere. This work designs a forward-modeling framework that includes as many of the processes as possible, all on equal footing and takes advantage of the available ?multi-messenger? data (i.e., both remote-sensing and in situ) to put constraints on the relative contributions of the physical processes responsible for coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. Specifically, the investigation consists of four core tasks: (1) Constructing line-of-sight forward models of EUV and X-ray emission for the low corona, corresponding to as broad a range of proposed heating theories as possible. (2) Implementing six different field-line extrapolation models to compute the coronal magnetic field from photospheric lower boundary conditions. (3) Determining what levels of coronal flux-tube structure can survive to be detectable in interplanetary space, through high-resolution simulations of the formation of corotating interaction regions (CIRs) and turbulent field-line random walk.

Slow slip has been seen before large earthquakes, but it is usually different from what the theories predict. Dr. McLaskey and his team will use laboratory experiments and computer models to measure and understand slow slip and tiny earthquakes that happen along faults before a large earthquake.  In the laboratory experiments, a ten-foot slab of rock with a cut (fault) embedded in it is compressed and sheared using a giant press, making the fault creep and then slip suddenly in ""laboratory"" earthquakes. The experiments can test how realistic, non-uniform fault properties?like rough versus slippery sections, or bumps and bends?can play a role in providing warning signs of an impending earthquake. Computer models will be developed to understand and explain data collected during the laboratory earthquake experiments. To check how well these computer models perform, they will be tested against a large collection of data on slow pre-earthquake slip and earthquakes that are ocurring beneath a glacier in Antarctica. As part of this project, three graduate students and at least two undergraduates will receive training in earthquake science (experiments, modeling, and data analysis).<br/><br/>Heterogeneous fault properties?bumps, bends, differing lithology, and heterogeneous loading conditions that exist at a variety of scales?are generally not considered in earthquake nucleation theories, but have been shown to strongly influence the way an earthquake initiates. On a heterogeneous fault, neighboring fault patches reach failure at different times, often resulting in the propagation of slow slip fronts that may only be detectable as a gradual decrease in seismic coupling, such as that observed prior to the M 9 Tohoku Earthquake, or from the migration and coalescence of microseismicity. This project explores the behavior of heterogeneous faults late in the earthquake cycle including the propagation of slow slip fronts and their interaction with strong/unstable asperities. These mechanisms may transform models of the way earthquakes initiate and better inform the interpretation of precursory activity. This project employs meter-scale laboratory experiments, where heterogeneous fault properties are imposed at specific locations and the effects on earthquake nucleation and triggering by slow slip fronts are studied in detail. Additionally, theoretical and numerical models for slow slip propagation on heterogeneous faults are developed to extend the laboratory results to length scales and conditions more relevant to natural earthquakes. The models are then tested against a field-scale glacial stick-slip cycle at Whillans Ice Stream, an Antarctic glacier, where aseismic transients affect 100 km-scale glacial stick-slip events and exhibit behavior similar to that observed in the lab.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While effective in correcting the reduced flow of blood to the heart tissue, these interventions also cause tissue damage categorized as ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). A pharmacologic treatment is critically needed to address this residual injury that is a major cause of rehospitalization, prolonged hospital-stay, heart failure, and mortality. By deploying the proposed technology of heart-targeted vehicle for drug delivery, it will be possible to achieve effective cardioprotection, which will reduce patient distress and economic burden on the healthcare system for patients undergoing reperfusion procedures. This disruptive technology will impact myocardial reperfusion injury market worth $1.6 billion and influence the standard of care for over 1 million coronary artery disease patients that are treated by angioplasty or bypass surgery each year in the United States.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop Cardiotropic Atorvastatin Liposomes (CATLIP) to deliver cardioprotective benefits of atorvastatin to the heart, safely and effectively. The innovative CATLIP technology will deliver therapeutic amounts of atorvastatin to the heart tissue for treatment of IRI. Current methods of administration are inadequate in reaching the drug concentration needed for clinical efficacy. Serving a long-term goal of developing a myocardia-targeted treatment to mitigate IRI, the research objective of this proof-of-principle project is to attain effective delivery of atorvastatin in the heart tissue. CATLIP?s targeting approach is based on a small molecule targeting vector that selectively binds to the cardiomyosin exposed in the injured heart tissue. The research team will prepare and characterize liposomes loaded with atorvastatin and modified on the surface with the cardiotropic targeting vector. This preparation will be tested in an animal model of myocardial infraction to determine atorvastatin delivery in the heart tissue. Successful implementation of this project will create a proprietary product for treatment of IRI of the heart and demonstrate the potential of a targeting technology for application with other drugs for the same medical condition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While no single cause of their decline has been identified, one suggestion is that warming has resulted in the growth of more, larger shrubs that are less nutritious for caribou than plants they prefer such as grasses and forbs (smaller flowering plants). We have been studying caribou near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland since 2002, and in that time their numbers in the area have dropped steadily. Moreover, in 2022 they produced no calves in the area for the first time in the past 20 years. We will revisit the area in the summer of 2023 to survey the number of caribou there, assess calf production, and collect shrubs, grasses, and forbs for analysis of their nutritive content. These measures of caribou food quality will be compared to similar measures taken in the area in 2005 when it was cooler, caribou were more abundant, and shrubs were smaller and less common. This will help determine whether warming has reduced food quality for caribou near Kangerlussuaq, and whether this has contributed to their decline. Caribou are important for hunting and tourism in the Kangerlussuaq area and results of this project will be shared with the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources who oversees monitoring and management of caribou in Greenland. Results might also contribute to understanding of factors influencing declines of caribou and reindeer in other parts of the Arctic where they are important to traditional livelihoods.<br/><br/>Across the Arctic, caribou and wild reindeer (both Rangifer tarandus) are in decline, with more than 50% of the species? total abundance having been lost over the past 30 years. Simultaneously, the Arctic has warmed at a rate 2-3x the global average. While no single factor likely explains the species? decline, some evidence links it to a warming-related increasing dominance of arctic tundra by shrubs that are less palatable to caribou and wild reindeer than the grasses and forbs they prefer. Near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland our annual surveys of caribou that began in 2002 have revealed an 80% decline in their numbers since 2005 and a complete reproductive failure (i.e., a lack of calves) for the first time in summer 2022. We hypothesize that this decline and reproductive failure might relate to an increase in shrub abundance at the site coincident with summer warming. We will return to the site in summer 2023 to assess the status of caribou there through surveys of total abundance and calf production, and to assess the nutritive status of vegetation through sampling and analysis of carbon and nitrogen content of shrubs, grasses and sedges, and forbs. This will facilitate a test of our hypothesis through comparison to similar data collected at the site in summer 2005, when caribou were more abundant, calf production was near maximal, shrubs were smaller and less abundant, and mid-summer mean temperature was nearly 1oC cooler. Caribou and wild reindeer are important to traditional livelihoods and cultural integrity throughout the Arctic, and their decline has been associated with declines in traditional knowledge transfer, emotional well-being, and social cohesion in some local communities. Additionally, caribou in the Kangerlussuaq area are important to subsistence- and trophy hunting as well as being vital to the local non-consumptive tourism economy. Data and results deriving from this project will be shared with the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, which oversees monitoring and management of caribou throughout Greenland. Moreover, efforts will be made to use results of this project to raise public awareness of the decline of caribou and wild reindeer across the Arctic through educational and outreach events at UC Davis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research is designed with the goal of achieving an improved understanding of the fundamental fluid physics underlying surface wave interactions with a rigid wall. The three-phase liquid-air-solid boundary influences the liquid behavior, which is important in laboratory studies and also in industrial applications, for instance, the dynamics of drops attached to a solid wall, liquid oscillations in closed basins, liquid globes and lenses attached to thin wire loops, liquid cylinders stabilized by helical wires, and wave propagation and flows in open narrow channels. The understanding provided by this research will enable the development of new designs and models that will lead to more efficient liquid management involving minimal solid contact. The results will be applicable to engineering areas including condensation heat transfer, liquid-gas contacting processes, and chemical engineering applications, as well as applications in biology and biotechnology. The approaches developed from this project will also provide new methods for measuring and modeling fluid behavior involving three-phase boundaries. The project will also contribute to the preparation and diversification of the STEM workforce involving undergraduates, graduate students, and a mid-career stage faculty member.  <br/> <br/>The proposed research will use laboratory and computational experiments to improve the understanding of the fundamental fluid physics underlying the scattering of travelling capillary-gravity waves from a surface-intersecting rigid barrier, where contact lines pin the free surface of the liquid at a barrier's edge. The laboratory experiments will use an acoustic method of airborne ultrasound reflected out the water surface to measure the amplitude of capillary-gravity waves. The computational experiments will concern inviscid linear waves in incompressible and irrotational flow by finite-element simulations using commercially available software. Specifically, the project will study (i) contact line effects in the transition from gravity wave scattering to capillary wave scattering, (ii) the dependence of wave scattering on the barrier's geometric parameters, and (iii) the effect of menisci near the barrier walls where the liquid surface is curved. Understanding how contact lines at three-phase boundaries influence the dynamics of a free liquid surface is essential in surface-tension dominated fluid dynamics. Prior studies involving contact line effects on capillary dynamics focused mainly on the frequency dependence and the damping of standing-wave modes. In contrast, the proposed research will fill the gap of knowledge in capillary-gravity wave scattering from rigid structures with contact line effects.  Since the 1960s theoretical studies have attempted to predict the contact line effects on capillary-gravity wave scattering, but progress has been hindered by the limitation of ideal assumptions made in the models, and by the lack of experimental data for the understanding of the fluid physics. The proposed laboratory experiments will provide the first quantitative results on the effect of contact lines on the scattering. The laboratory and computational experiments should systematically improve the knowledge on the fluid physics of the scattering and yield new insights on the influence of contact lines and menisci, and on the dependence on wave and structure parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This 18th conference in the FACM meeting series will be devoted to promising recent research in the field of computational wave propagation and imaging.   Wave scattering and imaging problems are pervasive in a variety of engineering and industrial applications. These include, for instance, the design of optoelectronic devices such as lasers and solar panels, stealth technology, medical imaging, and nondestructive testing of materials (in which a prescribed incident electromagnetic wave is used to illuminate a sample and identify the location and shape of cracks or defects).  Another important example comes from microchip design, which involves challenging wave propagation problems in multilayer materials that call for new numerical methods.  Despite numerous successes, challenges remain in, e.g., high-frequency problems, wave scattering in complex media, design of fast algorithms, and the application of new techniques based on machine-learning, among others. The conference brings together a diverse group of mathematicians, statisticians, scientists, and engineers to present their research in an environment that promotes significant interaction and cross-fertilization among the participants. <br/><br/>The FACM 2023 conference theme is ``New trends in computational wave propagation and imaging,?? and will focus on several problem areas that have either been established as areas of major significance in applied mathematics, or as emerging research fields with exceptional potential. These are: (1) inverse problems and imaging, (2) integral equation and high-frequency methods, (3) optimal transport in optical design, and (4) applications of machine learning in PDE's and inverse problems. The field of computational wave propagation and imaging has grown rapidly in the past two decades, fueled by industrial applications and supported by rapid development in mathematical theory and novel approaches stemming from advances in, for example, nonlinear optimization, randomized and fast linear solvers, and machine learning/data science. Despite the progress, numerous challenges remain, for instance, in treating high frequency problems with multiple scattering effects, computational inversion with limited (sparse, incomplete, or both) data, and high dimensional problems, among many others. In addition, there is a strong need for fundamental theory that can lead to a better understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of the new algorithms.

The resulting simultaneous changes in prices (or taxes) and preferences make it difficult to estimate policy effects of tax or price changes. Panel data, which are repeated observations on individual agents, can help isolate policy effects of price (or tax) changes. If prices change over time while preferences are stable then variation in choices over time can be attributed to price changes. The proposed research will use three projects to develop panel data methods to estimate the effect of price and tax rate changes on economic outcomes and welfare. One project will use big data methods to flexibly model the relationship between preferences and prices while imposing few constraints. The results will be applied to estimate welfare effects of price changes. The second project will estimate a panel data model of taxable income choice given the tax schedule that allows more general heterogeneity than in previous work. This approach will be applied for tax policy evaluation. The third project will develop new methods that can be used to check sensitivity of results from other projects. <br/><br/><br/>With panel data, the distribution of individual preferences given prices (or tax rates) in all time periods is an important, unknown nuisance function that is high dimensional when the number of time periods T is moderate or large. However, time invariance of individual preferences restricts the size of coefficients needed to approximate the nuisance function, suggesting that restricting the size of the coefficients could be useful in practice. The proposed research will use such restrictions to estimate panel data models for moderate to large T. Also, the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) with respect to the net of tax rate is a key parameter for predicting the effect of tax reform and designing income taxes. Recent evidence points to substantial heterogeneity in the ETI across individuals. The proposed research will use panel data to estimate and analyze individual specific ETI?s.

COP problems have broad applicability across manufacturing optimization, semiconductor wire routing, logistics planning and execution, and financial portfolio management. However, COP problems are notoriously difficult or even impossible to solve via classical computers on a scale suitable for commercial application. Current state-of-the-art COP solvers need tremendous computing power, are unsuitable for edge computing, rely on undeveloped technology, or use similar algorithms to classical computers. The goal of this project is to provide consumers with a drop-in replacement COP solver that is faster, more precise, more mobile, and more energy efficient than state-of-the-art classical computers and COP solvers. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a complementary metal?oxide?semiconductor (CMOS) based parallel combinatorial optimization problem (COP) computing cluster accessible through a cloud interface. The proposed solution will directly solve COP problems, increasing the speed, precision, and power efficiency compared to classical computers or current quantum-based COP solvers. Additionally, the cluster uses all standard semiconductor technology allowing for near-term hardware manufacturing, unlike current quantum computing competitors. The device also works at room temperature, making it the only suitable edge device for directly solving COP problems. A hybrid computing algorithm combining the custom and classical methods will parallelize the COP solving across numerous custom chips. Many custom chips will be combined into a single cluster to maximize the speed and efficiency of the hybrid algorithms. An introductory cloud service interface will be incorporated with the custom computer cluster to facilitate outside access.

Using the proposed technology, nematicide may be applied at 1/100th or less its current commercial rate and provide significant reduction in nematode populations and a dramatic increase in crop yield.  In addition, it may be possible to deliver other crop production moieties in concert with nematicide, including fertilizer, biologicals, insecticides or fungicides. PPN infection of cash crops causes an excess of $125 billion in worldwide crop damage annually, and PPNs are regarded as the most damaging biotic crop stressor where there is no viable management option, straining global food security. PPN impact every crop plant in every agricultural setting and industry including smallholder and organic farming, forestry, field and truck crops, ornamentals, and turf. For some crops, such as soybean, nematodes are recognized as the major pest. For other crops, nematodes contribute significantly to a net reduction in yield. Achieving safe and effective nematode control is a key part of the movement toward environmentally sustainable agriculture.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform enabling a field deployable paper-like seed treatment (nematicide-treated banana paper) to combat plant parasitic nematodes (PPN).  Reducing PPN infection of crops will increase crop yield and quality and reduce soil populations of nematodes. The proposed technology combines the ancient art of papermaking with expertise in nematology and fibrous materials, enabling targeted delivery of beneficial small molecules during crop establishment. Incorporation of active ingredients into a lignocellulose matrix, such as banana paper, allows for effective distribution of crop protection agents without interfering with farming practices. The shelf-stable lightweight material may be applied at planting. The prototype under development is an ?active? paper sheet with perforated sections to simply wrap and protect the seed (piece). The localization of the active ingredient, either adsorbed directly or embedded in the paper, specifically targets PPN versus beneficial organisms. Nematodes are primarily a seedling disease, so root protection early is critical to the successful establishment of the crop. Early season control translates into reduced post-harvest losses for root and tuber crops as well. Results from multi-year on-farm trials indicate that the proposed technology protects tuber crops from significant infections that lead to both in-season and post-harvest losses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Facing increasing disease pressure and a changing climate, growers around the world spend $80 billion on nearly six billion pounds of pesticides each year, and yet still experience yield losses of 20-40% due to pests and disease. Broad-acting, chemical pesticides - currently the industry standard - are losing both efficacy and public support as resistance to pesticides spreads and the negative environmental impacts become clear. There is a pressing need to fundamentally redesign crop treatments to create a more sustainable and efficient food system. Leveraging synthetic biology, CRISPR, and data science, this SBIR Phase I project addresses this need by developing a new class of microbial biopesticides that precisely target and kill crop pathogens without adversely affecting beneficial microbes, insect pollinators, or humans. With an initial focus on treating tomatoes (320,000 acres in the US, $32 million addressable market), this project sets the stage for providing solutions for major global markets like citrus ($600 million), olives ($1.8 billion), and rice ($2.7 billion). <br/><br/>The project provides targeted solutions for bacterial diseases in agriculture. Historically overlooked and underserved by the agricultural community, bacterial diseases have become increasingly devastating over the past 10 years due to a lack of effective treatment options, growing antimicrobial resistance, and climate change driving higher disease pressures. Building from a prototype system, this SBIR Phase I project aims to engineer improvements that will increase the efficacy and tractability of the microbial biopesticide in outdoor agricultural environments. This includes applying molecular biology techniques to increase microbial colonization within complex microflora to increase product efficacy, extend microbial persistence in plants to provide longer protection, and reduce the rate of resistance to extend product lifetimes. Furthermore, this project will develop a bioinformatics algorithm to better program the microbes to specifically target only the disease-causing pathogens. Finally, the team will demonstrate product efficacy in lab-grown tomato plants with the goal of surpassing the industry standard of 70% efficacy and will compare performance to two industry standard chemical pesticides. Successful completion of this project will result in a novel method to introduce protective traits to crops without genetically modifying the plant itself.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ligaments are tissues that connect bones together at joints and help guide the motion of the joint. Despite the critical importance of understanding ligament tension for a wide range of clinical applications (e.g., ligament repair and total knee replacement), there are no devices to directly and non-invasively measure ligament tension in vivo.  Measuring ligament tension using the proposed device may help surgeons to better personalize treatments, which may reduce the need for costly follow-up procedures to correct improperly tensioned ligaments that often cause pain, stiffness, and/or instability. In addition, the proposed device may be used as a diagnostic and pre-operative planning tool as well as in orthopedic and rehabilitation clinics.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a device to determine ligament tension based on the propagation speed of shear waves in the ligament.  This phenomenon is similar to the variation in a guitar string?s vibration frequency with tension (i.e., a tighter string has a higher shear wave speed and frequency). Alternative technologies (e.g., buckle transducers and optical fibers) measure ligament tension, but require invasive implantations preventing their translation into the clinic. The proposed sensor technology, called a ligament tensiometer, is placed against the skin superficial to the ligament of interest and the device excites a shear wave and tracks its propagation through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It has been shown that the speed that the wave travels along the ligament accurately predicts the tension in the ligament. The proposed initial target application is total knee arthroplasty because the technology may enable surgeons to identify and correct individual structures that may be improperly tensioned, which could mitigate post-operative pain, stiffness, and instability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A well-known physical signal is the interstitial fluid pressure in the tumor region, and existing tumor models have difficulties regulating such a volumetric pressure. It is known that tumor regions with high interstitial pressure typically resist the delivery of the anti-cancer drugs and therapeutics. The goal of this project is to create and study how interstitial pressure can regulate the tumor cell response in a biomimetic (biology mimicking) tumor model. Bioprinting technology and hydrogel engineering will be used to construct the model. The tumor microenvironment will be introduced using the controlled formation of cell spheroids. Physical forces will be induced by acoustic waves, and their role in drug mass transport and the metastatic behavior of tumor cells will be studied. Successful development of such a model will represent a paradigm shift in the cancer community by improving patients? quality of life, potentially prolonging survival, and opening up new clinical trials to test various new drug formulations. The educational objective is to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. This will be accomplished through various educational activities by integrating the research into project-based educational activities for undergraduate students and summer internships for underrepresented students. <br/><br/>The tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly complex, with a distinct extracellular matrix composition and leaky vasculature that regulate the tumorigenic function of tumor cells. The investigators hypothesize that acoustic-driven, flow-induced pressure, hydrogel bioprinting, and theoretical simulation could be employed to replicate TME-associated pressure gradients and hypoxic conditions for an invasion behavior in tumor cells. A novel way is proposed for regulating biophysical pressure using the acoustic field in cell-laden microtissue models. A tumor-spheroid-laden microfluidic device equipped with interdigital transducers that generate surface acoustic waves will be developed and used to test the hypothesis. Through digital light processing bioprinting, the project aims to create a high-resolution vascular microtissue with spatial gradients of stiffness and pore sizes. Then, a wide range of acoustic fields (in the megahertz regime) will be made to induce pressure fields onto the tumor spheroids and characterize the tumor cells' invasion markers. Finally, a multi-physics theoretical and numerical approach will be developed to help quantify the variation of acoustic radiation forces within a fluid-saturated poroelastic environment and estimate the induced pressure field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this award is to study what happens when such an object collides with a larger star: would such a collision be observable, would the remnant of the collision form a new type of star, or would it collapse to form another black hole, possibly in an unusual mass range?  Answers to these questions will help shed light on the abundance of compact objects, including very small black holes that may have formed in the early Universe and that may contribute to its dark-matter content, and will help understand recent observations by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors of black holes with unusual masses.

Other work will be directed at probing the validity of Einstein's theory of gravity by exploring the theoretical and observational consequences of certain modifications of that theory, particularly as that affects the behavior of black holes. A different component of the research will address questions about the behavior of magnetized plasma around astrophysical bodies like neutron stars and black holes, taking into account the effects of curved spacetime. This work could contribute to a better understanding of observations of these objects and their surroundings made with radio telescopes. Finally, in collaboration with an experimental atomic quantum fluid research group, research will be directed at exploring and exploiting the analogy between physics of quantum fluids and fields in curved spacetime, such as in the expanding universe.

Under 2) the aim is to further understand the operators and states in the algebraic quantization found previously, including their implications for entropy and Hamiltonian (time evolution). One approach to this will be to determine the relation to the alternative, covariant phase space approach, and to the so-called corner symmetry algebra, on which much work has been done by others. Further, we may extend the treatment to allow for conical singularities, handles, or a black hole in the spatial domain. Under 3) an attempt will be made to improve understanding of the relation between gravitational anomalies and Hawking radiation, and its connection to the puzzle of the origin of the outgoing black hole modes.

Understanding how these structural arrangements occur during a change from one phase of matter to another is critical to understanding self-organization processes in nature and to designing and making new materials that build themselves ? predictively, reliably, and inexpensively -- from the bottom-up. By controlling the assembly process, novel materials that combine unique properties in important, unprecedented ways become possible, impacting everything from protective coatings and light-sensitive paints to materials that store and convert energy to stealth technologies and sports equipment.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop and broadly disseminate powerful scientific software to aid researchers in tracking, analyzing, studying, and eventually engineering phase transition ?pathways? that a system of material building blocks follows as it self-assembles and changes from one phase to another.  The envisioned toolkit -- Microscopic Pathway Analysis Toolkit for High-Throughput Study (MPATHS) -- will be accessible, be easy to use, and exploit the fastest available computer architectures. It will make possible systematic, high-throughput studies of different types of phase transition pathways in ways that will make cross-system comparisons easy and will interoperate seamless with other open-source packages used by researchers who study phase transitions via simulations or experiments.<br/><br/>Because MPATHS will reveal microscopic, mechanistic details of how order emerges from disorder during assembly processes, MPATHS will be of immediate interest to the nanoparticle and soft matter communities who can use it to study thermodynamic self-assembly of colloidal crystals and other complex structures, as well as swarming processes in active matter systems. MPATHS will also be of immediate and even broader interest to the materials, engineering, and chemistry communities interested in atomic and molecular self-assembly processes. An emphasis on accessibility to researchers outside of scientific computing fields will facilitate the adoption of MPATHS by a broader community.<br/><br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>Phase transitions in which the structure of a multi-particle system changes from one state to another are ubiquitous in nature and have been widely utilized for industrial purposes, such as the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and the fabrication of materials, including metals, ceramics, plastics, nanocomposites and more. Therefore, understanding the mechanistic details of exactly how these structural transitions occur (i.e., the transition pathway) is crucial for a wide range of potential applications, including predicting and designing novel materials with desired properties as well as increasing yields or driving down costs for ones already in use. Hence, considerable research is devoted to the study of such phase transitions, especially from the point of view of thermodynamics and kinetics, including the study of such bulk quantities as free energy barriers to nucleation of ordered phases and nucleation rates. Such studies are informative but do not reveal the microscopic, particle-level details of how a particular sample changes from one state to another. For example, structural transitions such as crystallization, where a liquid solidifies into an ordered solid phase, are driven by a change in thermodynamic quantities such as temperature or pressure, which triggers changes in local structure involving a subset of particles (atoms, molecules, nanoparticles) that eventually spans the entire system. Microscopic details of how the local structure changes along the transition pathway controls the quality of the resulting crystal, as well as whether the resulting crystal is the thermodynamically preferred one or a metastable polymorph. However, despite the recent advances in computational power and experimental approaches, automated, system-agnostic tracking of structure evolution and detection of local and global changes in particle organization is largely nonexistent in materials and other fields of science and engineering, hindering the studies needed to predictively link processing parameters and particle attributes (such as shape and interaction patchiness in the case of nanoparticles) to final product. With such microscopic information in hand, researchers could precisely tailor not only processing parameters but also nanoparticle attributes to stabilize certain polymorphs over others, improve structural quality of the product, and optimize yield.<br/><br/>This project will develop a generalized computational toolkit that will enable the systematic study and cross-system comparisons of structure evolution across a wide range of self-assembling materials. The system-agnostic nature of the toolkit will eliminate error- and bias-prone manual intervention, thereby accelerating the discovery, understanding, and engineering of pathways for multiple classes of materials. Using particle positions, orientations, and properties from either experimental or computational raw data as input, the Microscopic Pathway Analysis Toolkit for High-throughput Studies (MPATHS) will enable users to identify and label local structural motifs and track their development across the entire transition pathway. The project team will develop and package within MPATHS powerful and system-agnostic routines for finding neighbors, calculating per-particle order parameters and their cross-correlations, detecting local and global structural events using methods from information theory, and visualizing systems based on this information. MPATHS will enable expert workflows by non-experts and be system-agnostic so it can be used intuitively and with little-to-no computational expertise by researchers working on structural transitions across many disciplines. MPATHS will incorporate easy-to-use interfaces that abide by TRUE (transferable, reproducible, usable by others and extensible) principles, including a python scripting interface to facilitate the scripting of customized MPATHS analyses, a graphical user interface to foster accessibility, and a powerful command line interface. MPATHS will be made widely available and usable as either an offline or online tool to enable either post-analysis or on-the-fly control of simulations or experiments.<br/><br/>MPATHS will permit the study of fundamental processes that only now are able to be studied due to advances in computing power that allow for detailed molecular simulations of complex structural transitions over long times with fine temporal detail, and exciting developments in in-situ electron microscopy that allow, for the first time, the visualization of dynamic nanoparticle rearrangements during the self-assembly of colloidal crystals of nanoparticles. MPATHS will be used to discover the microscopic processes driving two different structural transitions in simulated systems as exemplars: (i) assembly pathways of isostructural complex crystals from atoms and nanoparticles and emergence of ordered structures such as three-phase coexistence in active matter systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the drive towards less pollution and the adoption of electric technologies such as electric vehicles, battery demand is predicted to increase along with battery waste. The proposed process may help to ensure the reliable supply of essential resources to the local lithium battery market as well as the safe and effective treatment of lithium battery waste. In addition, the process may allow for cost savings during the metal recovery process and aid in supplementing the local supply of metals for lithium-based energy storage technology manufacture.  The proposed efficient battery waste process may serve to prevent improper lithium battery waste management and foster sustainability within the lithium battery market.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a recycling process for the recovery of metal-based materials from waste associated with lithium batteries. The proposed process applies a hydroiodic acid-based solution for the selective recovery via leaching of critical metals from lithium battery cathode material.  In conventional hydrometallurgical lithium battery recycling operations, elevated temperatures are used to improve process kinetics and a reducing agent is added to the leaching media to improve cathode metal recoveries. However, this results in costs associated with energy requirements to achieve high temperatures and the purchase of reducing agents. In addition, these systems result in the production of toxic gaseous compounds such as chlorine, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The proposed process has been shown to recover metals, on average, nine times faster, at temperatures close to ambient in the absence of a reducing agent, and without toxic gas production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the context of defense medicine, severe muscle trauma often occurs in environments where external factors such as sterility are not well-controlled. This project is expected to demonstrate antimicrobial properties of this novel muscle-regenerating biomaterial to enable use in these environments. If successful, the broader societal and economic impacts of antimicrobial muscle-regenerating biomaterials are staggering. Volumetric muscle loss affects tens of millions of victims each year. Sixty percent of patients are left untreated, 30% receive a muscle flap transplant, and 10% of injured limbs are amputated. Total average lifetime costs for amputation now total over $700,000. Improved clinical outcomes resulting from the implementation of this technology could lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings over the course of each recipient's lifetime.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates significant advances over the existing standard of care for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss, for which no treatment currently exists. The joint loss of cells and extracellular matrix creates an environment where muscle regeneration cannot occur, leading to muscle collapse and atrophy over time. This project effectively replaces the extracellular matrix lost in volumetric muscle loss and creates an environment where satellite cells may proliferate and differentiate into new muscle tissue. A technical concern raised by clinicians, especially those who work in austere environments in military medicine, is the risk of infection caused by implanting a foreign substance into a wound bed. To address this, Technical Objective 1 will focus on incorporating antibacterial agents to optimize the scaffold?s ability to promote muscle regeneration while also having an antibacterial effect. Structural and mechanical properties will be assessed, cellular viability ensured, muscle cell quality evaluated, and antibacterial properties measured. Technical Objective 2 aims to investigate these outcomes with a pilot porcine model of muscle trauma. It is anticipated that the proposed antimicrobial biomaterial will both combat the risk of infection and effectively regenerate functional muscle in traumatic muscle injuries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this reliance on mobile phones has raised serious privacy concerns, as mobile network operators (MNOs) have the ability to track and profile users. While the 5G system offers some privacy protection through the use of concealed and temporary subscriber identifiers, those with access to MNO databases can still track and profile users. This project addresses this problem by developing a fully functional anonymous mobile access architecture that allows legitimate mobile subscribers to access the network without revealing their real identity. The architecture is designed to disable mobile tracking and profiling using anonymous identifiers ensuring that connections made by the same user at different times cannot be linked. The design also supports critical incumbent mobile network functions, including the identification of a user equipment (UE) and recovery of its mobility history under legal intervention, while giving users control over the level of privacy they risk under their own mobile phone use contexts.<br/><br/><br/>The research team aims to achieve the above goal by integrating decentralized identifiers (DID) and anonymous verifiable credential (VC) schemes into the 5G authentication and key agreement (5G-AKA) protocol. Key research tasks to realize this anonymous mobile access architecture include developing a novel secure callee discovery mechanism leveraging DID to handle the voice call function, supporting user accountability and ensuring compatibility with existing lawful interception requirements, enabling flexible billing and rate control by service network, disabling robocall scams, quantifying privacy risks and developing identifier refreshing strategies, and conducting experiments and validation. Successful results for this research will enable anti-tracking capabilities while using mobile networks and offer a new way of thinking about privacy enhancement technologies in the digital world.

These protein networks react to internal and external signals and define how the cell functions within the context of a multicellular organism. A major obstacle in the field is that mechanisms that govern cell identity are remarkably complex, such that identifying the contributing factors remains a challenge. Identifying the missing components is critical for generating an integrated view of how specialized cell types develop. This project will fully integrate bioinformatic and experimental life science focused Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) within the research activities to identity novel factors involved in establishing cell identity. Overall, the CURE efforts will offer undergraduate students equitable access to research and will help them develop the skills required to become competitive in their future life science careers.<br/><br/>In Caenorhabditis elegans, the DREAM (for Dp, Retinoblastoma(Rb)-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex suppresses the differentiation programs in somatic (non-reproductive) cells, preventing them from activating the germ (reproductive) cell program, and also preserves the normal specification of vulval cell fate. DREAM represses genes through direct binding to their promoter regions, but no evidence indicates that the complex targets genes known to be associated with cell identity. These observations lead to the hypothesis that loss of the DREAM complex likely activates transcriptional components that drive breakdown of somatic cell identity. By creating improved reporter strains using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in the laboratory with reverse genetic screens performed in the classroom, this proposal aims to reveal key components that contribute to normal germline and vulval development. In addition, the central role the DREAM complex plays in the regulation of cell identity in C. elegans offers an opportunity to explore how such developmental programs are conserved across multicellular organisms. Using bioinformatic conservation analyses and molecular genomics, this proposal will explore DREAM co-conservation with the intent of building a manual gene curation pipeline for identifying and annotating genes-of-interest in published but under-annotated genomes. Overall, this research will contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which transcriptional regulatory networks determine cellular and organismal diversity.<br/><br/><br/>This proposal was co-reviewed and will be co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Developmental Systems Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Warming four times faster than elsewhere on Earth, the higher temperatures melt sea ice, thaw permafrost, and even increase winter snowfall. This also encourages moose, spruce, beavers, and shrubs to move into tundra. Of all the climate-driven changes, the recent degradation of stream water quality may be most alarming. The Brooks Range has long been known for its crystal-clear waters. The abrupt change to orange-colored, murky waters is startling and likely threatens the abundant Arctic grayling, Dolly Varden trout, and chum salmon that live there. No one currently knows why the streams are changing or what it means in the near or long term for fish, wildlife, and the people who depend upon them. The researchers are a group of geologists with extensive experience in ?acid-rock drainage? joined by ecologists with extensive Brooks Range knowledge. They plan to visit an area with numerous degraded streams during the summer of 2023, spending a month and a half in the field collecting rock, soil, and water samples for laboratory analysis. What they find will help us understand what is happening now and what to expect in the future. Thousands of people depend on clear and productive streams for drinking water and subsistence fish harvest in Arctic Alaska. People there are already alarmed about the degradation in water quality they can see. To share what they learn, the researchers will present their findings in public presentations in Kotzebue, the regional hub and largest population center. They will provide interviews for the region?s largest public radio station, so that residents of smaller surrounding villages can learn about the changes to their local streams, regional rivers and how those changes are already impacting local ecologies. They will also speak at meetings of the Northwest Arctic Regional Subsistence Advisory Council to share their results directly with regional managers of subsistence resources and concerned members of the public.<br/><br/>Historically characterized by pristine streams that support robust populations of Arctic grayling, Dolly Varden, and chum salmon, the southern slopes of the Brooks Range provide valuable economic and subsistence resources for local communities. However, since 2019, more than 30 clear-running streams have turned turbid and orange with iron precipitates. Seeps have been identified in the tundra and in upland rock formations. Limited data show very low pH in seep water (<3.0), downslope vegetation mortality, and dramatic declines in juvenile fish abundance in affected headwaters. The causes of this rapidly spreading degradation of pristine streams remain unknown. The goal of this project is to identify the terrestrial biogeochemical processes causing the recent and widespread proliferation of turbid orange streams throughout the western Brooks Range. Through field sampling and laboratory analysis, the researchers will test two hypotheses to explain the mobilization of metals within affected watersheds. Their two hypotheses, which may both prove relevant, have divergent implications for stream water quality and the spatial extent of areas at risk of future stream degradation. By identifying the causes of orange stream proliferation, the researchers will be able to inform land managers and residents of local villages of the potential consequences for drinking water, subsistence resource availability, and the growing commercial salmon fishery in northwest Alaska now and in the future. This research on the causes of stream degradation in the western Brooks Range is highly relevant to Alaska Native villages in the region, which depend on these streams for drinking water and subsistence fish harvest. The villages of Kiana and Kivalina are especially at risk because of nearby degraded tributaries of the Wulik, Squirrel and Kobuk Rivers. The researchers will deliver public presentations in Kotzebue and arrange to be interviewed by Kotzebue Public Radio to share their findings with residents of smaller surrounding villages. They also plan to share their findings during meetings of the Northwest Arctic Regional Subsistence Advisory Council to communicate their results directly to regional managers of subsistence resources and concerned members of the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Texas, total water demand is predicted to increase by 17% between 2020 and 2070. Texas A&M University-San Antonio (TAMU-SA) is a burgeoning Hispanic-Serving university, with a rapidly increasing enrollment despite decreasing national trends. It has a unique water resources program that aims to generate graduates capable of responding to the region's water security challenges. This project will help increase student recruitment to this signature STEM program supportive of diverse students, including those currently employed in the water sector, to tackle water-related issues in the region. Importantly, this project will generate data that will be broadly useful in understanding factors that can increase enrollment in these types of degrees across the country. This data will be of use to other programs with a focus on water across the country as well as those serving a post-traditional student population.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to address three challenges associated with the Water Resources Science and Technology (WaTR) program at TAMU-SA. First is low enrollment in the program, particularly of women. Second is the opportunity to integrate consideration of local water issues into the existing WaTR and STEM curricula. Third is limited access to opportunities for pre- and in-service professional and career development for students and current water professionals. This project will promote water workforce readiness and advancement for those currently employed in the water workforce. It will improve recruitment by working with admissions personnel and through outreach activities at high schools and community colleges. The project team will work alongside local water utility providers and stakeholders and utilize peer mentoring by current students and alumni of the program, and current graduate students enrolled in the M.S. degree component. The project leaders will develop a sustainable educational pathway of enhanced courses that is amplified through connecting coursework to issues of local concern; student engagement with cutting-edge and emerging water science technology; culturally relevant, context-based pedagogies; field experiences and tours of local plants; and internships with water-related collaborators. Lastly, the project will promote readiness for all students, through community science programs, high-impact projects, classroom-based undergraduate research experiences, and new or revised research-intensive courses to lay the groundwork for research careers and training. Through recruitment, relevance, and readiness, the project seeks to diversify the pre- and in-service professionals addressing water issues in regional, state, national, and international contexts, and to respond to the local pressing issues of water access, protection, and conservation. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity of transformational improvement at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) on developing understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many ancient structures have withstood aggressive seawater environments for over 2000 years testifying to their high durability and resilience, while most modern structures tend to deteriorate slowly under similar environments. However, modern concrete technology enables the design of concretes for specific applications with impressive properties that were not possible in the ancient era. The performance and durability of concretes are known to be strongly linked to the chemistry and microstructure of the hardened matrix, and recent studies have disclosed the mineral phase assemblage and microstructure of existing Roman structures, wherein the distribution of tobermorite-like calcium silicate hydrate and stratlingite phases are postulated to be contributory to their durability and resilience. This project will harness the chemistries of ancient concretes and modern ones to facilitate the design of StraCem that features at least 50% lower carbon footprint than Portland cement, while ensuring superior performance, chemical resilience, and durability in land and marine environments. The lower carbon footprint of the materials contributes to the mitigation of climate change. The program integrates educational activities to help inspire, train, and equip future cement material scientists and engineers through local K-12 outreach activities, provision of experiential learning opportunities for underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students, and the outcome of the study will enrich new and existing courses on the chemistry of cement-based materials. <br/><br/>The specific research goal of this project is to investigate the pathways and energetics of stratlingite nucleation and growth together with tobermorite-like calcium silicate hydrate gels in cementitious systems. The effort will unlock the compositional drivers, including aqueous pore solution chemistries, and the energy landscapes to facilitate rapid coprecipitation of stable stratlingite and Al-tobermorite-like calcium silicate hydrate gels. The study will be curated with relevant nucleation and growth theories, and the insight thereof will be applied to design a novel low-carbon StraCem clinker that will yield an optimum balance of stratlingite and calcium silicate hydrate gel during hydration, mimicking reported beneficial mineralogy of ancient Roman concretes, while minimizing less beneficial hydrate phases. The performance and durability of the designed StraCem-based pastes, mortars, and concretes will be investigated in air and simulated marine conditions. It is hypothesized that StraCem will feature superior performance and durability than Portland cement under terrestrial and marine environments, due to the space-filing properties of strätlingite and binding ability of calcium silicate hydrate gel. Also, the new cement will present significantly lower CO2 emissions due to its lower calcareous content and clinkering temperature than Portland cement. To actualize the objectives, a combination of wet chemistry, solid-state chemistry, in-situ and ex-situ multiscale characterization, and thermodynamic computation will be employed. This project will establish multi-disciplinary research and mentorship at the intersection of chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, and civil engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the promise of 3D printing technology, it is still far from meeting its full potential.  Although it offers low-cost, accessible part fabrication with geometric accuracy sufficient for many applications, polymer 3D printed parts often have poor strength (less than 20% of that of injection molded parts) and are not yet ready to be used as load-bearing parts. Poor filament-to-filament adhesion is at the heart of such problems in polymer 3D printing.  To address this key technological challenge, a print-head has been developed containing additional metal pre-heater and post-heater components, which provide additional thermal energy in a highly localized manner to delay the cooling curve and improve filament-to-filament adhesion. The proposed print head is an add-on or plug-and-play device that may result in a simple add-on that can be fitted into almost any existing filament-based 3D printer.  If successful, the improved quality and reduced cost of polymer 3D printing enabled by this technology will help print high-performance parts that may go into a variety of engineering systems. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an in situ metal heater integrated with the regular filament-dispensing nozzle in a polymer 3D printer to improve the mechanical strength of printed parts. The additional thermal energy provided by the heater helps improve the filament-to-filament adhesion through reduced rate of cooling during the printing process. This has been shown to lead to improved mechanical strength and other properties of the printed part. Parts printed with the proposed technology may be suitable for challenging and complex engineering systems where the parts are expected to withstand significant load. This will help elevate polymer 3D printing technology from being able to print prototypes to one that can produce real-life parts. If successful, parts printed with this product may enable applications that are not possible with the current manufacturing technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast, the proposed bracelet employs a self-powered two-step energy conversion method that continuously transforms pulses into high-fidelity, analyzable electrical signals without requiring a power source. This allows for uninterrupted monitoring.  Currently used devices are not continuous and inconvenient to use because they require the patient to measure their pulse deliberately.  The proposed device's continuous data collection feature eliminates the problems of battery drainage and intermittent charging periods. Additionally, this device may be used as a non-invasive and continuous diagnostic tool.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a device to monitor atrial fibrillation.

The proposed textile wearable magnetoelastic generator (MEG) consists of two types of fibers and operates on a two-step energy conversion, including mechanical-to-magnetic and magnetic-to-electrical conversions. A weaving of those fibers will complete the cycle of mechanical-to-electrical conversion. This makes the device self-powered and eliminates the need for an external power source such as a battery. In addition, since magnetic fields can pass through water without significant performance loss, the device is intrinsically waterproof. Previous research testing the efficiency of the materials and reliability of the MEG in-vitro compared favorably with traditional blood pressure monitors with a 1.2% difference.

Warming four times faster than elsewhere on Earth, the higher temperatures melt sea ice, thaw permafrost, and even increase winter snowfall. This also encourages moose, spruce, beavers, and shrubs to move into tundra. Of all the climate-driven changes, the recent degradation of stream water quality may be most alarming. The Brooks Range has long been known for its crystal-clear waters. The abrupt change to orange-colored, murky waters is startling and likely threatens the abundant Arctic grayling, Dolly Varden trout, and chum salmon that live there. No one currently knows why the streams are changing or what it means in the near or long term for fish, wildlife, and the people who depend upon them. The researchers are a group of geologists with extensive experience in ?acid-rock drainage? joined by ecologists with extensive Brooks Range knowledge. They plan to visit an area with numerous degraded streams during the summer of 2023, spending a month and a half in the field collecting rock, soil, and water samples for laboratory analysis. What they find will help us understand what is happening now and what to expect in the future. Thousands of people depend on clear and productive streams for drinking water and subsistence fish harvest in Arctic Alaska. People there are already alarmed about the degradation in water quality they can see. To share what they learn, the researchers will present their findings in public presentations in Kotzebue, the regional hub and largest population center. They will provide interviews for the region?s largest public radio station, so that residents of smaller surrounding villages can learn about the changes to their local streams, regional rivers and how those changes are already impacting local ecologies. They will also speak at meetings of the Northwest Arctic Regional Subsistence Advisory Council to share their results directly with regional managers of subsistence resources and concerned members of the public.<br/><br/>Historically characterized by pristine streams that support robust populations of Arctic grayling, Dolly Varden, and chum salmon, the southern slopes of the Brooks Range provide valuable economic and subsistence resources for local communities. However, since 2019, more than 30 clear-running streams have turned turbid and orange with iron precipitates. Seeps have been identified in the tundra and in upland rock formations. Limited data show very low pH in seep water (<3.0), downslope vegetation mortality, and dramatic declines in juvenile fish abundance in affected headwaters. The causes of this rapidly spreading degradation of pristine streams remain unknown. The goal of this project is to identify the terrestrial biogeochemical processes causing the recent and widespread proliferation of turbid orange streams throughout the western Brooks Range. Through field sampling and laboratory analysis, the researchers will test two hypotheses to explain the mobilization of metals within affected watersheds. Their two hypotheses, which may both prove relevant, have divergent implications for stream water quality and the spatial extent of areas at risk of future stream degradation. By identifying the causes of orange stream proliferation, the researchers will be able to inform land managers and residents of local villages of the potential consequences for drinking water, subsistence resource availability, and the growing commercial salmon fishery in northwest Alaska now and in the future. This research on the causes of stream degradation in the western Brooks Range is highly relevant to Alaska Native villages in the region, which depend on these streams for drinking water and subsistence fish harvest. The villages of Kiana and Kivalina are especially at risk because of nearby degraded tributaries of the Wulik, Squirrel and Kobuk Rivers. The researchers will deliver public presentations in Kotzebue and arrange to be interviewed by Kotzebue Public Radio to share their findings with residents of smaller surrounding villages. They also plan to share their findings during meetings of the Northwest Arctic Regional Subsistence Advisory Council to communicate their results directly to regional managers of subsistence resources and concerned members of the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this reliance on mobile phones has raised serious privacy concerns, as mobile network operators (MNOs) have the ability to track and profile users. While the 5G system offers some privacy protection through the use of concealed and temporary subscriber identifiers, those with access to MNO databases can still track and profile users. This project addresses this problem by developing a fully functional anonymous mobile access architecture that allows legitimate mobile subscribers to access the network without revealing their real identity. The architecture is designed to disable mobile tracking and profiling using anonymous identifiers ensuring that connections made by the same user at different times cannot be linked. The design also supports critical incumbent mobile network functions, including the identification of a user equipment (UE) and recovery of its mobility history under legal intervention, while giving users control over the level of privacy they risk under their own mobile phone use contexts.<br/><br/><br/>The research team aims to achieve the above goal by integrating decentralized identifiers (DID) and anonymous verifiable credential (VC) schemes into the 5G authentication and key agreement (5G-AKA) protocol. Key research tasks to realize this anonymous mobile access architecture include developing a novel secure callee discovery mechanism leveraging DID to handle the voice call function, supporting user accountability and ensuring compatibility with existing lawful interception requirements, enabling flexible billing and rate control by service network, disabling robocall scams, quantifying privacy risks and developing identifier refreshing strategies, and conducting experiments and validation. Successful results for this research will enable anti-tracking capabilities while using mobile networks and offer a new way of thinking about privacy enhancement technologies in the digital world.

The U.S. nuclear power industry requires enriched lithium-7 hydroxide to prevent corrosion in its present fleet of pressurized water reactors.  Currently, this strategic material is supplied outside the U.S. and recent supply disruptions jeopardize 20% of the U.S. electrical generation capability. Longer term, the development of safer, lower-impact, new technologies for nuclear power generation is critical to meet the U.S. and global goals of reducing carbon emissions. One of the most promising technologies, molten salt reactors, will require commercial production of large quantities of enriched lithium-7. Even longer term, many of the fusion energy technologies in development will require enriched lithium-6. The planned production of lithium isotopes will enable the development and commercialization of safer, lower-impact nuclear energy.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project proposes the implementation of a liquid/liquid extraction method for lithium enrichment in a pilot-scale production system.  To date, this type of extraction has not been employed for commercial lithium isotope enrichment. The Phase II work will result in the design of the first commercial-scale production process. The innovative approach to lithium isotope enrichment will also have applicability in the purification of other stable isotopes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, intergroup interactions can carry racial overtones and incorporate distrust. One context where this distrust might be especially problematic involves interpersonal conflict situations. If left unresolved, these conflicts can jeopardize people's relationships, home and work environments, and physical and psychological health. Although decades of research have demonstrated that an apology is often the key to resolving these conflicts, apologies are only effective if they are perceived by victims as sincere acts of remorse -- a perception that suffers under low levels of trust. Thus, apologies from majority group transgressors to minority group victims might be less effective at promoting reconciliation because they are perceived as untrustworthy and insincere. The current project systematically examines how interpersonal apologies function in intergroup situations. <br/><br/>This program of research examines when apologies are more effective at promoting intergroup reconciliation, whether trust in the apologizer and perceived apology sincerity help explain intergroup differences in apology effectiveness, and whether the benefits of cross-group apologies can be increased by contextual features that reduce victims' expectations of racial bias. This work studies whether majority group transgressors can convey apology sincerity, and in turn enhance cross-race conflict resolution, by offering sincere apologies. This research sheds light on whether, when, and why apologies function differently in cross-race dyads, thus contributing to our understanding of barriers to reconciliation in important intergroup contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this reliance on mobile phones has raised serious privacy concerns, as mobile network operators (MNOs) have the ability to track and profile users. While the 5G system offers some privacy protection through the use of concealed and temporary subscriber identifiers, those with access to MNO databases can still track and profile users. This project addresses this problem by developing a fully functional anonymous mobile access architecture that allows legitimate mobile subscribers to access the network without revealing their real identity. The architecture is designed to disable mobile tracking and profiling using anonymous identifiers ensuring that connections made by the same user at different times cannot be linked. The design also supports critical incumbent mobile network functions, including the identification of a user equipment (UE) and recovery of its mobility history under legal intervention, while giving users control over the level of privacy they risk under their own mobile phone use contexts.<br/><br/><br/>The research team aims to achieve the above goal by integrating decentralized identifiers (DID) and anonymous verifiable credential (VC) schemes into the 5G authentication and key agreement (5G-AKA) protocol. Key research tasks to realize this anonymous mobile access architecture include developing a novel secure callee discovery mechanism leveraging DID to handle the voice call function, supporting user accountability and ensuring compatibility with existing lawful interception requirements, enabling flexible billing and rate control by service network, disabling robocall scams, quantifying privacy risks and developing identifier refreshing strategies, and conducting experiments and validation. Successful results for this research will enable anti-tracking capabilities while using mobile networks and offer a new way of thinking about privacy enhancement technologies in the digital world.

The technological advancement addresses a fundamental issue that limits conventional bio-fermentation, which is that producing cells suffer limited health and viability in exchange for higher yields. In this proposal, genetic tools will be used to divide the labor of cell reproduction and product synthesis into two different cell types, called stem cells and factory cells. As older factory cells become exhausted, productivity is maintained by new factory cells, which are born from the stem cell population. The approach may be particularly well suited to biofuels and other molecules that are difficult to produce in large quantities by conventional bio-fermentation because the product is toxic to the cells that make it. It could be applied toward increasing the profitability of existing bio-processes and also for bringing new products to market, which are currently too difficult to produce. In this project, the team seeks to demonstrate the benefits of producing a fuel (limonene) and a dairy enzyme (chymosin), as proof of its application in biofuel and agricultural sectors. Broad industrial implementation will advance bio-manufacturing toward the ?green? revolution, contributing to the development of cleaner industries and decreasing US and global reliance on fossil fuels.<br/><br/>This project aims to solve two major limitations of microbial fermentation processes: metabolic exhaustion and genetic drift. These are nearly universal problems in the industry. Highly producing cells can become inactive due to the lack of metabolic resources, cytotoxic effects of products, and mutations that break the biosynthetic pathway. In this project, Microbial Stem Cell Technology (MiST) uncouples growth and production by establishing a multicellular system. One cell type is dedicated to product synthesis (factory cells), while another (stem cells) is responsible for cell division and the generation of new factory cells. As older factory cells lose productivity, the bioreactor is continuously replenished with new factory cells, derived from the stem cell population. By maintaining an active factory cell population, MiST-supported cultures are expected to exhibit increased production longevity and higher overall yield than conventional bio-fermentations. This project aims to validate the technology in E. coli engineered to produce limonene, a precursor for biodiesel and other useful chemicals. In the factory cells, T7RNAP will drive high-level expression of a suite of biosynthetic enzymes. Since limonene has a cytotoxic effect on producing cells, MiST-supported factory cell replenishment is expected to increase productivity by more than 2-fold compared to the conventional limonene-producing strains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it remains poorly understood due to its inherent physical complexity and the random nature of vapor bubble formation on hot surfaces, preventing meaningful performance enhancements. Advanced high-speed optical and infrared imaging techniques have recently become available to experimentally study the dynamic and thermal behavior of growing bubbles. The problem, however, is the experimental difficulty in focusing on an individual bubble growth event amidst a huge mass of randomly forming and mutually interacting bubbles. By studying the physics of ultra-fast microscale liquid-vapor transitions, this project seeks to develop a novel laser-based technique to generate a controlled vapor bubble that is identical in its thermal and growth characteristics to randomly forming bubbles in nucleate boiling. This will enable ground-breaking parametric and phenomenological studies in boiling, potentially leading to large scale energy efficiency and throughput improvements in many thermal systems critical for the nation?s defense, infrastructure, and energy security. The project also encompasses significant educational and outreach activities, including research training of diverse undergraduate and graduate students at CSULB, development of a web-based engineering applications platform to promote scientific computational and programming skills, and outreach to local high school and community college students.<br/><br/>The goal of this research study is to develop and characterize a novel laser-based controlled bubble generation technique and to illuminate the physics underlying laser pulse-induced homogeneous nucleation at a solid-liquid interface. The mechanism of this ultra-fast non-equilibrium nucleation, which acts as an artificial nucleation site for the controlled bubble, has largely been unexplored, both experimentally and theoretically. This project undertakes rigorous experimental studies and theoretical/CFD analysis to implement the laser-based phenomenological-boiling-studies platform and fill significant scientific gaps in the understanding of near-wall non-equilibrium homogeneous nucleation in two specific aims: (i) Demonstrate laser-induced artificial bubble generation and characterize the key laser parameters and (ii) Identify the critical near-wall homogeneous bubble nucleation temperature using parametric nucleation experiments and modeling. On the experimental side, optical high-speed imaging studies will be performed using a focused-laser setup and an advanced pool boiling facility. Theoretical analysis and CFD simulations will be used to model the thermal evolution of the laser hotspot in nucleation. Results of this study will lay the groundwork for a new theory on near-wall non-equilibrium homogeneous vapor nucleation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this success, many potential applications remain untapped. One major barrier to more widespread adoption of machine learning is that machine learning methods must be manually tuned to each new learning task. This tuning requires high levels of both computational resources and user skill, which excludes many potential machine learning users. Furthermore, even leading machine learning practitioners make costly tuning mistakes. This project aims to make the tuning process simpler and more computationally efficient.<br/><br/>This project focuses on eliminating parameter tuning from the stochastic optimization algorithms that power machine learning. Toward this goal, two novel strategies will be employed. First, instead of using online-to-batch conversion, a standard technique in stochastic optimization, this project will develop algorithms for noiseless optimization and then lift them to the stochastic setting via powerful time-uniform concentration of measure results. Second, the project will develop algorithms based on trajectory cues: quantities directly observable from the optimization trajectory (such as the distance between iterates and the initial point) that serve as stand-ins for unknown problem parameters. These two new strategies will enable this project to tackle outstanding theoretical problems in parameter-free optimization and design practical algorithms that reduce the burden of parameter tuning. The project will also examine parameter-free methods for particular problem classes such as deep learning. All software resulting from this research will be open source. Algorithms from this project will be integrated into optimization and machine learning curricula at both the undergraduate and graduate level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology uses machine learning to identify patterns in the land, atmosphere, and ocean that help determine how the climate system will evolve on timescales of one month to one decade. These climate forecasts will then be translated into realistic possibilities of future weather patterns on daily timescales. These daily weather patterns can then be used to inform renewable energy power production forecasts and extreme weather event risk for numerous industries, including the energy sector and the general insurance industry.

Sophisticated computer models to predict red cell motion in capillary vessels have emerged over the past decades. However, such models often require extensive computing time and resources and are not feasible for organ-scale prediction over many cardiac cycles. To overcome such limitations, this proposal will consider the application of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the prediction of blood flow and cell trafficking. The broader impact will be accomplished through the proposed research, training of graduate and undergraduate students, and K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>Specific research objectives include the developments of (i) ML models to predict vessel cross-sectional variation of the blood velocity, and red cell concentration, (ii) ML models coupling the blood flow, cell volume fraction and a single-parameter measure of cell deformation, (iii) ML models to predict full 3D deformed cell shape, and (iv) models for high-accuracy long time-series prediction. Models will be trained using high-fidelity simulation data of cell flow in bifurcations and vessels of varying geometry and hemodynamic parameters, creating a model bank. The trained ML models will then be validated against high-fidelity simulations of red cell flow in physiologically realistic vascular geometry. Finally, the capability of the ML models will be demonstrated by considering large-scale cerebral vasculatures for which high-fidelity simulation is not feasible. The translational aspect of the proposal involves the development of similar ML models for predicting cancer cell trafficking. The proposed ML models may provide a significant improvement in patient-specific (precision) diagnosis. PhD and undergraduate students will be mentored. The outreach component will involve coding and computing for middle and high school female students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will investigate new machine learning methodology to make machine learning generalizable and deployable. If successful, the project will accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence in manufacturing plants and lower the entrance barrier to Industry 4.0 for small and medium manufacturers.

It is not only the source of life, but also the key ingredient controlling a wide range of solid earth processes, such as the operation of plate tectonics, the formation of volcanoes, and the emergence of continents. Plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions lead to the active exchange of  surface water and interior water, regulating the variation of ocean volumes and continent areas throughout the Earth?s history. Despite its importance, in present-day the Earth?s surface water accounts for only 0.02 percent of the planet?s total mass. Most of the Earth?s water is instead thought to be present in the Earth?s deep interior,  but the exact amount of water stored in the Earth?s interior remains largely unknown. This proposal will rigorously study the water solubility in bridgmanite, the most abundant material of the deep mantle. This will be accomplished by using large-scale computer simulations of bridgmanite and fluid in coexistence, using the latest innovations in machine learning. The calculations will be referenced to results derived from high-precision calculations based in quantum mechanics. This work will support the training of graduate students in cutting-edge computational techniques using high-performance computing centers. <br/><br/><br/>Water solubility in the mantle is a fundamental material property that quantifies the maximum amount of water that can be hosted within the Earth. Large-scale two-phase simulations of bridgmanite and fluid coexistence driven by machine learning potentials of ab initio quality will be carried out to rigorously study the water solubility in bridgmanite. These simulations will reveal: 1) the solubility of water in bridgmanite and the effects of Fe and Al across the entire lower mantle; 2) the hydrogen incorporation mechanisms as a function of pressures, temperatures, and bulk chemistry; 3) the bridgmanite-water (pseudo)-binary phase diagrams; and 4) the evolutionary history of the water storage capacity of the lower mantle over the past 4.5 billion years. <br/><br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences to support AI/ML advancement in the geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, the undergraduate engineering curriculum emphasizes purely technical topics, but real engineering problems involve complex social issues and require both technical and social expertise. Most engineering instructors have been educated with a deep technical focus, they have little experience outside of engineering, and they feel ill-equipped to integrate non-technical topics. This project aims to help engineering instructors integrate sociotechnical issues into their courses by developing four modules for an introductory circuits course. Each module is linked to technical circuits topics, and each emphasizes a different sociotechnical issue such as the conflict minerals (minerals sourced from an area with armed conflict that impacts the trade of those minerals) needed for electric circuits components and repurposing of electric vehicle batteries. Circuits is typically the first course in the EE curriculum, and it enrolls students from many disciplines. Thus, inspiring engineering instructors to implement these sociotechnical modules in introductory circuits courses has the potential for far-reaching influence on the field. The modules are intended to be implemented in the middle years of the college experience, when students are forming their engineering identities, and they should help students achieve key accreditation outcomes related to social and global perspectives. This project hopes to impact the professional formation of over 900 students in 14 courses across six institutions. Including sociotechnical issues in a fundamental course such as circuits sends a powerful message to students about what is valued by the field, and that message can have a significant impact on students, particularly those who have been historically marginalized in EE including women and students of color.<br/><br/>A sociotechnical module on conflict minerals has already been developed by one of the Principal Investigators (PIs) and tested in a circuits course taught by that PI. A cohort of EE graduate students will be recruited to assist in developing other modules using principles of backwards course design to create learning objectives, instructional activities, and post-class assessments with homework and exam questions for each module. These graduate students will be better prepared to teach EE courses that promote a sense of social responsibility. After pre-piloting each module at a small private institution (University of San Diego) and piloting it at a large public research institution (University of Michigan; UM), the use of these modules will be scaled up to other large circuits courses at UM and at four other institutions. Student feedback will be used to refine the modules and explore the experiences of the engineering instructors and students who engage with them. Assessment will focus on the effectiveness of the modules at reinforcing technical content, promoting students? sense of social responsibility, and disrupting students? adherence to normative cultural beliefs. Successfully implementing these sociotechnical modules in a range of different contexts should enhance the likelihood of widespread adoption and will provide a model for development of sociotechnical modules in traditional engineering classes which can be adapted by other instructors.

Commensal microbes in the gut play an important role in immunity, and both microbes and microbial genes involved in host defense can be acquired from the environment. Microbes that colonize hosts carrying zoonoses (diseases which can be transmitted to humans) may evolve defenses against these pathogens that can be transmitted to other hosts in the same ecosystem. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the transmission of commensal microbes (and their genes) between three groups of organisms known to play roles in zoonotic transmission: bats, baboons, and fruits. The results of this study can have important implications for primate health and conservation, scientific understanding of the ecology and evolution of pathogen transmission and immunity, and global health efforts for humans and animals. The project supports K-12 science outreach and undergraduate training and mentoring opportunities in STEM.<br/><br/>The ecology of Kinda baboons, a species that often serves as a model system for understanding human evolution, provides a natural experiment for examining microbial transmission. The home range of one habituated Kinda baboon troop overlaps with swamp forest within which 5-10 million straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) roost during their seasonal migration between late October and December. During this roosting period, both Eidolon and Kinda baboons feed on local swamp figs and waterberries. Due to Eidolon?s aerial position during roosting and flight, feces, saliva, and urine are dropped to the ground creating opportunity for exposure to these bodily fluids by Kindas either directly or indirectly via the consumption of contaminated fruits (which may act as vectors). The researchers analyze the gut microbiomes of Kinda baboons and fruit flesh microbiomes before, during, and after the migratory arrival of Eidolon, and assess Eidolon gut microbiomes during their roosting period, to address three specific questions: Q1: Does the migratory arrival of Eidolon into KNP alter Kinda baboon gut and fruit flesh microbiomes? Q2: Does the migratory departure of Eidolon from KNP (January-early February) alter Kinda baboon gut and fruit flesh microbiomes? Q3: Do host evolutionary relationships or the environment better explain Kinda baboon gut microbiome structure during the Eidolon roosting period? Both the variety of microorganisms that comprise the microbiomes of each host as well as the functions of microbial genes utilized by the microbes are assessed. The research team then tests for differences in microbiome taxonomic and functional diversity??as well as differences in microbiome structure??across time, across host species, and across Kinda baboon troops with different proximity to Eidolon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

About thirty years ago, it was discovered that powerful lightning strokes can cause spectacular Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) in the earth?s upper atmosphere. Sprites are one of the TLEs.  Subsequent research has found that sprites share similar physical characteristics as those commonly known spark discharges near the ground. They, however, are much larger and last much longer, because they occur in an environment with greatly reduced air density. Sprites can cause significant modifications of the physical and chemical properties of the upper atmosphere, capable of affecting the propagation of certain radio frequency bands for long-range communications. High-resolution images of sprites have revealed that they consist of a large number of plasma filaments known as streamers. It has been recognized that understanding streamer physics holds the key to learning sprite dynamics and effects. This project will utilize an advanced computer simulation tool to study various poorly understood streamer processes. It will greatly advance our understanding of the physics and effects of sprites.  The study will advance knowledge of dielectric breakdown and transient plasma discharges and improve lightning forecast and safety. The software developed in this project will be open source.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be supported and involved in this research project, thus contributing to STEM workforce development.  <br/><br/>This project will investigate streamer branching, collisions between streamer heads, collisions between streamer heads and streamer channels, effects of neutral density perturbations on streamer dynamics, and interaction between streamers and the lower ionosphere. Various three-dimensional simulations will be performed using a high-performance plasma discharge fluid code called AMPLIFI (Adaptive Modeling of PLasma Initiation, Filamentation and Interaction), which was recently developed, to understand the physics of these processes, their roles in sprite dynamics, their electrical and optical effects, and their dependence on the ambient environment. This project will also provide critical information for interpreting high-speed images of sprites and understanding the implications. Concrete knowledge of the dependence of sprite streamer dynamics on ambient neutral or electrical conditions will be obtained, and this will enable the development of potentially powerful remote sensing approaches to studying the mesosphere/D region ionosphere by observing sprites.  The study of the neutral density perturbation effects on sprite streamer dynamics will also reveal a novel neutral-ion coupling mechanism enabled by a strong electric field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, commercial AI assistants respond to user requests reactively. The technologies developed in this project would provide AI assistants with the situational awareness to understand users? lives and predict their needs.  The technology will also enable social intelligence to take the initiative to support users in appropriate ways. This SBIR Phase I project will apply these technologies to a consumer product for assisting users with time management and meeting goals while establishing and strengthening healthy, desirable habits in their daily lives. Proactive personal AI assistants have the potential to improve productivity, convenience, and quality of life for every person, as well as to promote aging in place with greater independence and wellness. Fundamental scientific advancements will also enable a new generation of potential applications for AI assistants across sectors, fueling economic growth and creating jobs. <br/><br/>This project addresses two central technical challenges for enabling proactive AI assistants: contextual awareness of users and agent-initiated interaction. Contextual awareness includes the AI agent?s real-time understanding of current user state and activity, as well as a long-term understanding of past user habits. The project proposes to develop hybrid computational models combining machine learning of multimodal user observations from visual, acoustic, and geolocation data with probabilistic graphical models that perform long-term inference and prediction over historical user observations. A virtually-embodied AI agent will leverage these contextual awareness representations to conduct real-time, face-to-face collaborations with users. The project proposes to research and develop a dynamic scheduling approach to proactively enable the agent to communicate with users.

There is a direct link between high-dose noise exposure to the high stresses, high blood pressures, speech interferences, hearing losses, sleep disruptions, etc. Noise mitigation and control are mandatory requirements at all levels of governments and industries. The proposed technology will play a key role in tackling various noise issues at sources, which is the most cost-effective approach. It is applicable to all industries ranging from transportation such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, trains, aircrafts, etc. to household appliances such as vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, washing machines, etc. where noise is of a primary concern, and it can supplement artificial intelligence and enhance the visual and hearing senses of robots to mitigate noise issues.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology to determine the root causes of noise and vibrations of complex machines. The proposed may fundamentally change the notions of holography, optical holography, acoustic holography, near-field acoustic holography, photo-acoustic holography, etc., which limit holography to be done in a homogeneous and uniform medium; and it enables one to visualize a 3D acoustic field without bounds because visualization of the sound field may be done across different elastic media. Together with other proprietary algorithms, it is possible for engineers to see all vibroacoustic quantities, including the acoustic pressure, the acoustic intensity, the operational deflection shapes of a vibrating structure at any frequency, visualize the excitation forces acting behind and inside solid enclosures, establish the interrelationship between sound radiation and structural vibration, and mitigate noise and vibration issues in the most cost-effective manner. Using these innovative technologies, engineers will be able to conduct the targeted noise control to reduce noise emission without adding masses to complex machines, thus lowering the fuel consumption and overall costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to perform computations using density functional theory (DFT) and other computational methods to model catalytic reaction pathways and investigate factors that control reactivity and selectivity. These computational studies will provide mechanistic understanding of various carbon hydrogen bond functionalization reactions catalyzed by transition metal complexes and bioengineered enzymes. In addition, new computational approaches to investigate catalyst?substrate interactions and their impacts on reaction outcomes, including data-driven approaches to rationally design problem-specific descriptors in regression models for reactivity and selectivity predictions, will be explored.

This project aims to explore three types of new computational strategies to provide robust and meaningful insights into the origin of catalyst effects on reactivity and selectivity. Professor Peng Liu and his research team will (1) apply energy decomposition analysis calculations to analyze non-covalent interactions between catalyst and substrate and use ring strain energies to analyze transition state distortion; (2) use mechanistic insights to select and design problem-specific descriptors for predictive regression models; and (3) perform hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study stereoselective reactions catalyzed by bioengineered enzymes.

McMurry University, a four-year Hispanic Serving Institution, provides a small campus environment for students who come primarily from economically disadvantaged areas of rural West Texas. Over its 6-year duration, this project will provide scholarship support to 15 students pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, or Computer Science. This project will provide a comprehensive program of academic advising, peer assisted learning support, academic coaching, leadership development, career preparation, and access to other high impact practices. This set of supports is designed to increase students' retention, sense of belonging, professional identity, and college and career success. A cornerstone of the project will be an innovative ?near peer? mentoring program pairing students in their first two years of study with peer mentors in their third and fourth years of study, and those in their third and fourth years with peer mentors who are recent McMurry University alumni. Another key facet is leadership development through service projects.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. This project leverages an array of student support programs, including ?near peer? mentoring; peer assisted learning for attrition hot spots; engagement in experiential learning through research and/or professional internships; a first-year seminar focused on STEM identity and career exploration; and STEM fun days and service projects. Collectively, these support programs are intended to foster a sense of belonging and professional identity that in turn will increase resilience and persistence. Predicted outcomes are an increase in freshman to sophomore retention to 75%, an increase in 4-year graduation rates to 60%, and a minimum of 90% of graduating seniors securing employment in a STEM career or admission into graduate or professional schools within one year of graduation. Broader impacts include: potential expansion and institutionalization of the ?near peer? mentoring program for all McMurry STEM students; enhancement of pedagogical competencies of McMurry STEM faculty aimed at better supporting first-generation and other historically excluded students; and expansion of servant leadership opportunities and STEM engagement opportunities across the McMurry campus. Formative and summative evaluation will include collecting data related to retention rates, graduation rates, and post-graduation behavior as well as surveys on the effectiveness of activities on sense of identity and belonging.

This variability includes more frequent cold snaps. This increase in temperature fluctuation may create challenges for birds and other animals. Birds can adjust their physiology to respond to fluctuating temperatures. It is uncertain, however, if birds can respond fast enough to match these fluctuations. This uncertainty makes conservation planning for winter birds difficult. This project will study how birds respond to fluctuations in winter temperatures. The study will also identify costs of adjusting physiology that might limit how well birds can respond to fluctuating temperatures. Both natural and laboratory studies will be used to answer questions about how birds are able to adjust to temperature fluctuations. These studies will also determine what levels (tissues, cells, sub-cellular) are involved in these adjustments. The project will provide a broad view of the ability of birds to respond to temperature fluctuations expected under future climate change. The project will involve early-career and established faculty and students at various stages in their careers. The studies will also engage Indigenous and African-American college students. Another goal of the project is to involve a diversity of people to help improve scientific literacy. The project targets activities for elementary and high school students and the general public for this purpose. Data from the project are also expected to assist development of modeling approaches to predict bird responses to climate change to better assess conservation impacts. <br/><br/>Mean winter temperatures are increasing rapidly in the north-central U.S. but superimposed on this trend is more temperature variability, including more frequent cold snaps. Such punctuated cold periods will require flexible adjustments of thermoregulatory physiology of birds to match environmental conditions and could lead to physiology-environment mismatches. Flexible physiological responses allow birds to better match metabolic phenotypes to variable climates and can produce fitness benefits. The costs of such flexibility, however, are poorly known, are recommended targets of future research, and are critical elements to understand the capacities of organisms to respond to increasing climatic variability projected by climate change models. This project examines avian metabolic flexibility in response to fluctuating temperatures at organismal, cellular and molecular levels, including studies examining responses to natural seasonal and within-season temperature variation and experimental temperature acclimation studies with warm, cold, and fluctuating cold temperatures. These integrative studies will provide an unprecedented view of the mechanisms, costs, trade-offs, and fitness consequences of flexible metabolic responses of birds to increasing temperature variability expected under future climate change scenarios. The collaborative project will involve senior and junior-level faculty, a postdoctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also engage Indigenous and African-American undergraduate students and will involve K-12 students and the general public in scientific activities related to project goals to help improve scientific literacy.

Typically, the undergraduate engineering curriculum emphasizes purely technical topics, but real engineering problems involve complex social issues and require both technical and social expertise. Most engineering instructors have been educated with a deep technical focus, they have little experience outside of engineering, and they feel ill-equipped to integrate non-technical topics. This project aims to help engineering instructors integrate sociotechnical issues into their courses by developing four modules for an introductory circuits course. Each module is linked to technical circuits topics, and each emphasizes a different sociotechnical issue such as the conflict minerals (minerals sourced from an area with armed conflict that impacts the trade of those minerals) needed for electric circuits components and repurposing of electric vehicle batteries. Circuits is typically the first course in the EE curriculum, and it enrolls students from many disciplines. Thus, inspiring engineering instructors to implement these sociotechnical modules in introductory circuits courses has the potential for far-reaching influence on the field. The modules are intended to be implemented in the middle years of the college experience, when students are forming their engineering identities, and they should help students achieve key accreditation outcomes related to social and global perspectives. This project hopes to impact the professional formation of over 900 students in 14 courses across six institutions. Including sociotechnical issues in a fundamental course such as circuits sends a powerful message to students about what is valued by the field, and that message can have a significant impact on students, particularly those who have been historically marginalized in EE including women and students of color.<br/><br/>A sociotechnical module on conflict minerals has already been developed by one of the Principal Investigators (PIs) and tested in a circuits course taught by that PI. A cohort of EE graduate students will be recruited to assist in developing other modules using principles of backwards course design to create learning objectives, instructional activities, and post-class assessments with homework and exam questions for each module. These graduate students will be better prepared to teach EE courses that promote a sense of social responsibility. After pre-piloting each module at a small private institution (University of San Diego) and piloting it at a large public research institution (University of Michigan; UM), the use of these modules will be scaled up to other large circuits courses at UM and at four other institutions. Student feedback will be used to refine the modules and explore the experiences of the engineering instructors and students who engage with them. Assessment will focus on the effectiveness of the modules at reinforcing technical content, promoting students? sense of social responsibility, and disrupting students? adherence to normative cultural beliefs. Successfully implementing these sociotechnical modules in a range of different contexts should enhance the likelihood of widespread adoption and will provide a model for development of sociotechnical modules in traditional engineering classes which can be adapted by other instructors. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The risk of surgical site infection across all surgical procedures is estimated at over 2%, with higher-risk procedures estimated to be up 22%.  Surgical site infections (SSIs) are one of four healthcare-associated infection (HAI) metrics of interest. Data on SSI occurrence is reported publicly, and informs hospital rankings and performance. Individual hospitals carefully track SSIs related to certain high-risk procedures and will implement projects to help reduce infection rates. Hospitals also cover any medical costs associated with patient treatment and re-admittance associated with resolving an SSI. Cost of hospitalization increases by more than $20,000 per patient, and extends hospital stays by an average of 9.7 days. Overall, there is a $3.3B additional cost to the healthcare system annually to resolve SSIs. SSIs also represent a severe complication for patients, leading to increased healthcare system utilization, additional time for medical treatment, and associated increases in morbidity and mortality. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology to prevent bacterial surgical site infections (SSI).  The proposed technology is a material that consists of a long polymeric backbone inclusive of quaternized nitrogen.  This material is designed to be applied to the surface to be sterilized and forms a uniform coating. The quaternary nitrogen is positively charged and includes an acyl chain of optimized length. Bacteria are pulled to the material via electrostatic interaction, and the bacterial cell membrane is disrupted by the acyl chain.  A bactericidal material may offer several advantages including longer protection time, more durable coverage of the sterile area, and no small-molecule compounds present that may be allergens or skin irritants.  There have been no significant technological advancements in surgical infection prevention since the 1980s.

Moreover, underserved Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) student populations are more likely to leave school without a degree. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased financial insecurity and mental health challenges have negatively impacted student learning. This project aims to develop a student learning dashboard platform that acts as a co-pilot during students' higher education learning journey by delivering targeted, personalized, and real-time actionable assistance. The solution holistically identifies each student's unique learning motivation challenges (e.g., subject difficulty, relevance to career goals, social and economic constraints, etc.) and provides specific recommendations to overcome barriers. Coaching students to learn how to learn more effectively based on their own context fosters a growth mindset, grit, and agency to help them become successful lifelong learners.  The application also significantly improves diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education, especially in STEM, and thus increases effective workforce training. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses machine learning to understand each student's unique learning challenges, map how barriers affect learning motivation, and influences coursework engagement. Machine learning is applied to analyze qualitative and quantitative learning motivation and behavior data to identify gaps so real-time, targeted, and relevant guidance can be delivered while the students are still progressing through the courses rather than waiting until it might be too late for intervention. This project provides descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive recommendations to simulate one-on-one, personalized advising at scale and at a lower cost. The technology also acts as an early detection system when students show the first sign of academic and non-academic struggles affecting their mental state of readiness to learn.

Beyond the practical operational forecasting aspect of this project, the field campaign will provide 15-20 students with the opportunity to participate in the collection of data.<br/>   <br/>This award is for the Targeted Observations by Radars and UAS of Supercells Left-flank-Intensive Experiment (TORUS-LItE), an observational study of specific processes in the left flank of supercell thunderstorms and how they relate to tornadogenesis.  The research team will deploy UAS, radar, sounding, and mobile Mesonet assets during a three-week period in May and June 2023 in the Great Plains to directly sample boundaries and coherent structures.  The investigators believe that advancing understanding of the relationship between supercell tornadogenesis and left/forward flank boundaries and coherent structures requires cross-sectional datasets that enable characterization of the structure and evolution of these boundaries and associated coherent structures in the context of supercell/mesocyclone strength and proximate evolution of near-surface rotation.  The science questions to be studied are:  A)	How often are left/forward-flank boundaries coincident with enhanced vorticity and how does the magnitude of this vorticity relate to the characteristics of the associated boundaries and environmental/ambient state?  B) Do the characteristics of streamwise vorticity currents (SVCs) and associated boundaries attendant to tornadic storms differ significantly from those associated with non-tornadic storms?  C) Can the dense-side airmasses of left-flank boundaries be characterized as density currents and are SVCs the attendant Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) billows?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conspiracy theories often arise in response to large-scale, surprising, negative events as an attempt for people to satisfy epistemic and existential needs for order, certainty, and control that are triggered by the event. Although conspiracy theory beliefs often the result of mundane psychological and strategic processes, they can have negative consequences for democratic governance/accountability, national security, and national health, prosperity, and welfare. Conspiracy theories center on blame attribution and can motivate attitudes and behavior in response to the attribution. As such, they are particularly problematic for democratic governance and accountability.  To examine the effect of public perception of conspiracy theories on electoral outcomes in the aftermath of a major natural disaster, this project surveys a nationally representative sample of 1,000 citizens in a region that has just experienced a major earthquake prior to a national election and 1,000 citizens shortly after the national election. The study advances understanding of the assertion that people who perceive themselves to be on the losing side of politics are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than their counterparts on the winning side of politics.  <br/><br/>The project will survey a nationally representative sample of 1,000 citizens prior to a national election and a second nationally representative sample of 1,000 citizens shortly after the national election. The surveys will be comprised of questions aimed at assessing the extent to which respondents endorse a series of earthquake-related conspiracy theories as well as the antecedents and consequences of conspiracy theory beliefs. A stratified probability sampling frame based on the random selection of districts and neighborhoods/villages as primary sampling units will be used for both the pre- and post-election surveys. Both samples will be weighted to national demographic benchmarks. The proposed project advances our understanding of these consequential beliefs in three ways: (1) it argues that different conspiracy theories can satisfy different motives, and that, therefore the strength of association between commonly-studied antecedents and each conspiracy theory will vary depending on the characteristics of the conspiracy theories themselves, (2) it explores  whether the antecedents and consequences of conspiracy theory beliefs differ before and after a hotly contested, ideologically-charged election, (3) the project's pre/post-election design will enable a direct test the assertion that people who perceive themselves to be on the losing side of politics are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than their counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The innovation will use a robot to provide quantitative condition and emissions data for an estimated 150,000 floating roof tanks in the nation?s aging infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar agencies across the globe, require tanks to be routinely inspected, but companies also want to remove personnel from confined spaces and avoid exposure to poisonous gasses, asphyxiation, heat exhaustion, falling accidents, etc. Confined space entries caused 1,300 U.S. deaths between 2011 and 2018. The autonomous robot reduces expenses related to maintenance and repair and allows better quantitative assessment of the seal integrity, which allows companies to perform maintenance based on the asset condition and not frequency-based schedules. An industry trend in recent years is to recreate the state of their assets digitally - both visually and quantitatively. The high-resolution data provided through this effort supports these 'digital twins.' Also, once the robot is certified for explosive environments, design features can be reused to produce other robots which further improve development cost and safety. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project will create an autonomous robotic inspection system which eliminates manual, confined-space inspection methods and requires only one technician to deploy the robot from the top of the tank wall. The wall-climbing robot is capable of inspecting both the floating-roof storage tank?s upper (weather) and lower (primary) seals using a bifurcated (inverse periscope) geometry which places sensors in the gap between the seals while prime movers, adhesion elements, and a controller are above the seals. The bifurcated design simplifies safety feature design by minimizing the size and complexity of device components between the seals. The bifurcated design enables the continuous use of a tether for isolating the power source and provides a positive pressure surge system. After insertion, the robot proceeds to circumnavigate the inner tank shell in a stable manner, overcoming the large frictional forces that exist between the tank wall and the upper seal. The robotic system gathers real-time, high-resolution, and continuous data about the state of the seals. High-resolution visual data characterizes the top of the seal, and a proprietary physical ?feeler? mechanism characterizes the seal gap. This information results in a fast, safe, and accurate inspection of the tank?s seal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology uses artificial intelligence to analyze pig locomotion in order to spot subtle patterns indicative of lameness. Early detection of lameness will enable farmers to take corrective actions rather than waiting for lameness to deteriorate to sow death or culling.  Early culling or sow death is a major economic cost to farmers and a large fraction of death and culls is due to animal lameness.  Successful application of the technology being developed in this project promises to reduce early sow mortality and culling, leading to additional litters per sow and so provide a significant economic boost to farmers.  With patent applications for key components of the sensing system, farmers will install sensors in hallways and obtain health measures for each sow when she moves between rooms. The projected annual revenue is $3.0 million.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes combining an imaging sensor with artificial intelligence to create a unique sensing system to unobtrusively and remotely diagnose lameness in sows (adult female swine) as they traverse hallways.  This project seeks to validate two key technical contributions. First, precise 3D animal posture and locomotion are estimated for sows moving beneath a ceiling-mounted sensor.  High accuracy is achieved through a novel annotation technique that overcomes difficulties in inaccurate manual location of skeletal landmarks.  Second, a data-driven approach is used to train a deep neural network to learn the most discriminating combinations of posture and gait for determining lameness in walking sows.  A self-supervised neural network sidesteps the need for extensive manual annotation and expert annotation is only required for lameness assessment.  Together, these two contributions will enable a transformative technical capability of a remote sensor that can automatically diagnose early-stage lameness in sows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Texas, total water demand is predicted to increase by 17% between 2020 and 2070. Texas A&M University-San Antonio (TAMU-SA) is a burgeoning Hispanic-Serving university, with a rapidly increasing enrollment despite decreasing national trends. It has a unique water resources program that aims to generate graduates capable of responding to the region's water security challenges. This project will help increase student recruitment to this signature STEM program supportive of diverse students, including those currently employed in the water sector, to tackle water-related issues in the region. Importantly, this project will generate data that will be broadly useful in understanding factors that can increase enrollment in these types of degrees across the country. This data will be of use to other programs with a focus on water across the country as well as those serving a post-traditional student population.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to address three challenges associated with the Water Resources Science and Technology (WaTR) program at TAMU-SA. First is low enrollment in the program, particularly of women. Second is the opportunity to integrate consideration of local water issues into the existing WaTR and STEM curricula. Third is limited access to opportunities for pre- and in-service professional and career development for students and current water professionals. This project will promote water workforce readiness and advancement for those currently employed in the water workforce. It will improve recruitment by working with admissions personnel and through outreach activities at high schools and community colleges. The project team will work alongside local water utility providers and stakeholders and utilize peer mentoring by current students and alumni of the program, and current graduate students enrolled in the M.S. degree component. The project leaders will develop a sustainable educational pathway of enhanced courses that is amplified through connecting coursework to issues of local concern; student engagement with cutting-edge and emerging water science technology; culturally relevant, context-based pedagogies; field experiences and tours of local plants; and internships with water-related collaborators. Lastly, the project will promote readiness for all students, through community science programs, high-impact projects, classroom-based undergraduate research experiences, and new or revised research-intensive courses to lay the groundwork for research careers and training. Through recruitment, relevance, and readiness, the project seeks to diversify the pre- and in-service professionals addressing water issues in regional, state, national, and international contexts, and to respond to the local pressing issues of water access, protection, and conservation. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity of transformational improvement at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) on developing understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The growing demand for satellite launches is currently limited by a bottleneck of low availability, flexibility, and high cost of existing orbital launch services. Orbital delivery services enabled by this advanced in-flight separation system will enable a new level of launch responsiveness leading to lower costs, much greater contractual flexibility, and the availability of daily launches without the need for costly launch infrastructure, greatly accelerating time-to-market for satellite service providers and increasing their profitability. Low cost and frequent access to Low Earth Orbit will enable ubiquitous internet access, 5G capabilities, and valuable Earth observation technologies. The flexibility and reduced cost of these launch services will help maintain the United States' position at the forefront of space technology development and space research. The technology will provide the US Armed Forces access to a responsive, secure, flexible, and available gateway to space that will boost reconnaissance, observation, communication, and intelligence capabilities. Moreover, it will represent the most ecofriendly launch delivery service available, able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by three times (3x) compared to ground launch.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project seeks to demonstrate an innovative concept of in-flight aircraft/rocket separation in which the rocket is launched from the top of the carrier aircraft, instead of the widely used launch from beneath. This new separation system is the core innovation enabling an advanced air-launched orbital delivery system that will dramatically reduce the cost of dedicated satellite launch, minimize propulsion and structural requirements, and enable orbital delivery flexibility and precision, while significantly reducing the carbon footprint of space launch operations. The proposed concept will be the first top-carry air-launch service commercially available. The goals of the Phase I project are focused on building a prototype of the separation system and validating it in a sub-orbital test flight. The main technical challenge is to ensure that the design of the improved separation system will work under a broad range of real flight conditions. This technology will be achieved by research leading to a better understanding of aerodynamic behavior at the separation event and the development of an improved design methodology that considers all relevant design parameters and their aerodynamic effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While machine-learning methods have achieved success in real-world applications, they often suffer from biases and show discrimination towards certain demographics especially in high-stakes applications, which risks significant harm to both society and individuals. Existing work focuses on ?model-centric? computational approaches that build models while overlooking the importance of data quality. To tackle the challenges raised by the lack of high quality data and the lack of a comprehensive understanding of fairness in all its respects, this project will integrate model-centric with ?data-centric? modeling, which systematically engineers the data needed for a fair decision-making process. The successful outcome of this multidisciplinary research will lead to effective and efficient algorithms that enhance the generalizability and trustworthiness of learned models, and improve the fairness of algorithms deployed in real-world systems in health informatics and disaster resilience. The education programs of this project will play an integral part in training the next generation of the U.S. workforce with critical Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) technologies and attract and retain diverse members of the future workforce in STEM. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to develop a computational framework for tackling data challenges in fairness through data-centric fairness mitigation solutions that explore and exploit data and prior knowledge. Complementing existing studies focusing on model-centric or data-driven approaches, this project investigates a novel research direction that systematically explores a data-centric fairness mitigation framework. Specifically, the research objectives include: (1) to explore and extract data characteristics on instances, features and a representative subset of examples in terms of fairness, allowing that fairness definitions and metrics may vary across real-world applications; (2) to expand and refine prior knowledge to guide the discrimination-mitigation process via instance augmentation, feature set expansion, and measurement redefinition perspectives; (3) to leverage interpretable and interactive data and prior knowledge as a key element for further improving fairness modeling; and (4) to demonstrate effectiveness on real-world applications including healthcare informatics and disaster resilience. The educational objectives are: (1) to incorporate responsible artificial intelligence (RAI) into curriculum design via integrating research findings and case studies into current and new courses; (2) to enhance public interest in and awareness of RAI by organizing data challenges and broadcasting information on social media platforms; and (3) to attract and retain women and underrepresented minorities to ensure a diverse future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nature and the sources of randomness underlying these optimization tasks vary and are mostly domain specific. Yet a remarkable and fairly generic theme has emerged recently across many of these application areas, dubbed the Statistics-to-Computation gap. This gap refers to the discovery that for many optimization problems the state-of-the-art tractable algorithms (those which can be run in a reasonable time) significantly underperform when compared to algorithms without any computational limits. How fundamental is this gap and what classes of algorithms achieve the best performance within reasonable computational time limits? These are two fundamental questions to be addressed in this project.<br/><br/>Recent research activity in this area led to the discovery that tractable algorithms achieving state-of-the-art performance, while on surface are different and problem specific,  can be coded as variants of the same algorithm, one based on computing low degree polynomials of the input data. We call this class of algorithms the Low Degree Method (LDM). The first research goal of this project is to investigate this discovery systematically. Specifically, the work will be conducted on (a) Verifying whether LDM-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance for a broad spectrum of problems, beyond those already known, and identifying candidate problems for which LDM can in fact provide algorithms improving the state-of-the-art, (b) Identifying the potential computational advantage of the LDM based methods, including the speed and parallelism, and finally (c) Establishing the limits of what is achievable by the LDM, and specifically verifying that LDM-based methods provably cannot overcome the Statistics-to-Computation barrier. A concrete, but not exhaustive, class of problems to be considered within the goal (a) includes the problem of finding a largest clique in an Erdos-Renyi random graph, the sparse linear regression problem and the problem of finding a satisfying assignment of a random constraint satisfaction problem, known as random K-SAT problem. The goal (c) is also a segue into the second research goal of this project: establishing a barrier for the LDM-based methods for the problems of high dimensional statistical inference by means of the so-called Overlap Gap Property (OGP) methodology. OGP has been established already as an algorithmic barrier for a wide class of problems of optimization in random structures. Broad classes of algorithms have been ruled out by the OGP-based methods, including local algorithms, various iterative schemes, online algorithms and Boolean circuits. At the same time, OGP-based methodology does not extend to models involving noisy signal, which is unfortunate, since these models arise in a broad variety of important modern statistical and machine learning applications. The second goal of the project is establishing the presence of OGP in high dimensional statistical inference models exhibiting the Statistics-to-Computation gap and establishing that it is a barrier for the same classes of algorithms that have been ruled out in prior models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This acoustic method wastes no material and, most importantly, makes it possible to reuse the substrate, which is currently wasted using standard approaches such as mechanical back grinding. As the single largest cost in manufacturing next-generation devices based on gallium nitride, the substrate material plays a key role in achieving higher performance and efficiencies compared to silicon devices.

But now there is a concern that many commonly used hard problems can be solved efficiently by rapidly developing quantum computers. This has prompted a search for problems that resist quantum attacks, and one promising candidate is that of finding short vectors in a lattice from a given basis. Indeed, there are many newly proposed cryptosystems whose security hinges upon the hardness of lattice reduction, specifically ideal lattice reduction, where the lattice corresponds to the so-called Minkowski embedding of an ideal in a number field. It is at this intersection between cryptography and number theory where a large part of this project lies. The PI is investigating a new algorithm for finding short vectors in ideal lattices as well as a separate family of lattices that might be efficient to work with (like ideal lattices) yet possess a hardness guarantee (unlike ideal lattices). These pursuits have the potential to further our progress toward a post-quantum secure cyberspace, and they come with many coding and computational components that provide opportunities for student involvement.<br/> <br/>The new algorithm under investigation generalizes a complex continued fraction algorithm recently introduced by the PI, which is novel in that it functions over non-Euclidean imaginary quadratic rings. The generalized (to arbitrary number fields) version finds nonzero elements of an input ideal that have a relatively small absolute field norm. This reduces the task of finding short ideal lattice vectors to the task of approximating with Dirichlet's log unit lattice, which is independent of the input ideal. Both the speed and output quality of the PI's algorithm depend crucially on an initial choice of some finite set of integers from the associated number field. The existence of a ""good"" initial set likely depends on the field, and the PI intends to determine which fields are more amenable to the algorithm than others. Multiquadratic and cyclotomic fields are of particular interest. (It is already known that a theoretical quantum computer can efficiently find ideal elements that are small with respect to the field norm; the PI's algorithm is classical, not quantum.) Another main goal of this project is to scrutinize the potential use of ""simultaneous approximation lattices"" for cryptography. The PI has shown that the problem of finding short vectors in an arbitrary lattice reduces to finding short vectors in simultaneous approximation lattices. That is a hardness guarantee not currently possessed by ideal lattices. The benefit of simultaneous approximation versus generic lattices is the number of integers needed to define them: just one more than the dimension of the lattice. This may lead to increased efficiency for lattice-based cryptosystems, but the PI must first determine how much larger the integers defining a simultaneous approximation lattice must be in order to maintain the same level of security as one of its generic counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over 250,000 patients die of sepsis each year in the U.S., which results in hospitalization costs exceeding $20 billion. A sepsis patient?s risk of death has been demonstrated to increase by 4-7% per hour, where timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is expected to improve patient survival. Unfortunately, the standard of care approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility requires overnight culturing that can take a day or more. Currently, broad spectrum antibiotics are administered within the first hour of treatment with the hope that the pathogen will be susceptible, while waiting for antibiotic susceptibility results. The growing landscape of antibiotic resistance severely undermines the efficacy of the standard approach, as many pathogens are increasingly resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics. This project seeks to advance development of a novel optical approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility results within 1 hour to support the use of appropriate antibiotics, which has significant potential to improve patient mortality outcomes and reduce hospitalization costs.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves an optical technology for the rapid determination of antibiotic susceptibility results from a blood sample for patients suspected of bacteremia.

It happens quickly and almost automatically. Decades of theory and research in social psychology have helped to uncover how and why this common facet of social cognition occurs. Social categorization has important consequences, and often contributes to social bias including prejudice, discrimination, and societal inequities. As racial diversity in the United States increases, and the importance of race as an attribute by which people group themselves and others, it is especially important to understand the factors that determine how people perceive race. Some of the information that people use in perceiving race comes from physical characteristics of others, including skin tone, hair texture, and facial features. Other information is independent of the person being perceived, including historical and societal factors or qualities of the perceiver themselves. This project focuses on the role of facial features, and how attention paid very early in the processing of facial features helps to shape racial categorization of faces. It also considers how the social context influences attention to those facial features. The research extends understanding of how and when early attention to race is beneficial or harmful to downstream consequences of racial categorization, and informs potential interventions aimed at reducing negative consequences of race perception.<br/><br/>The attention to racial information in faces happens very early in the perceptual process, typically within 200 milliseconds of seeing a face. It is less clear how this early attention to race contributes to the way in which those faces are ultimately racially categorized. The studies in this project measure quickly occurring and distinct neurocognitive processes as racial categorization of faces unfolds. The studies consider two contributing factors to racial perception: physical features and social context. Past research has focused primarily on Black and White faces. This project expands on that to include Latinx faces. Not only is the Latinx population the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, the historical fluidity of racial categorization of Latinx people is unique. Inclusion of Latinx populations strengthens the opportunity to address the project?s aim of considering both phenotypicality and social context. It is clear from research that racial categorization of others results in bias, even among those who are motivated to be egalitarian in their behavior. Focusing on earlier, up-stream cognitive perceptual processes that may contribute to spontaneous racial categorization will help to identify mechanisms or interventions that can facilitate intentional control and ultimately mitigate the bias that results from social categorization. These issues are central to the science of broadening participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One context for promoting early mathematical development is the home environment. Informal activities and interactions with adults can provide children with extensive mathematical information through the communication about math that families provide to their young children. Additionally, numerous factors can influence children?s early math-related experiences at home. For example, parents? mindsets and beliefs about child development can impact how frequently they engage in math-related activities with their children. The goal of the project is to examine the benefits of parent-focused math-related communication trainings to improve children?s math skills. The focus of the research is on families from lower-income backgrounds because children from higher-income households consistently outperform their peers from lower-income households in mathematics, even as early as preschool. The family trainings will build on the strengths of families by enhancing the math-related talk and gestures that families use during their daily routines and play with their children. Findings from the research will provide insight into whether and how math-related communication at home can promote learning and will produce low-cost tools to benefit early mathematical development for young children. <br/><br/>The proposed study will examine the benefits of math-related communication trainings with low-income families from diverse backgrounds (n = 300). The central aims are to examine: 1) whether home-based trainings over a 3-month period that focus on the benefits of math communication (with and without gesture) will promote the math talk and gestures used by parents and their preschool-age children; 2) whether the home-based trainings improve preschool children?s math skills and whether these improvements are stable 3 months later; 3) whether the effects of the math communication trainings differ for families where parents hold different mindsets about the malleability of math skills. In the study, families will receive one of three trainings that focus on promoting both math-related talk and gestures, math-related talk only, or talk during play. The first two trainings will provide families with tools and information through a video and materials for incorporating math communication into play and daily activities with their children. The changes in math talk and gesture use for parents and children over the 3-month intervention period will be examined during parent-child interactions. Children?s early math skills also will be assessed prior to the training, after the 3-month intervention period, and again in a 3-month delayed posttest. Moreover, an individual differences approach will be taken to determine whether the effectiveness of the trainings differs for parents (and children of parents) who hold varied mindsets about the malleability of math skills. Overall, this research will advance knowledge by enhancing the mathematical engagement of families in the home environment to improve the mathematical knowledge of young children, and by examining the benefits of resources for parents to help incorporate math talk and gestures into their play and routine activities with their children. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF?s EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

Widespread adoption of the sensor could support cost-effective and improved N fertilizer management, which may increase farmers? productivity and profitability. Low-cost, instantaneous nitrate testing readouts from plant stalks will provide more actionable information to guide farmers? fertilization decisions than current methods to test N levels in soil (e.g., collect soil samples, ship them to lab, and then wait ~1 week for lab analysis). The improvements in fertilizer-management decisions, enabled by more accessible and more actionable data, have the potential to reduce total N fertilizer applications in the US by some 2 million tons annually. This large reduction in N fertilizer applications would decrease the energy footprint of agriculture, reduce emissions of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide, and improve water quality through reductions in N runoff, improving ecosystem services and human health through improved rural water quality and the reduction in hypoxic dead zones.  <br/> <br/><br/>The proposed project represents an innovation in the function and application of an in planta nitrate sensor. The project goals are to: i) improve the sensor for reliable deployment in field measurements; ii) conduct research in farmers? fields to develop predictive models that input nitrate levels from sensor measurements of corn stalks and other data to output N fertilization recommendations; and iii) build a lab-based multi-probe nitrate sensor that extends the work to other crops in the existing plant and soil testing market. Anticipated results are that the data from the sensors will be used to build predictive models that output optimum N fertilization recommendations that will outperform conventional models. The accomplishment of this goal will lead to the commercialization of rugged low-cost sensors that provide rapid measurements of plant sap nitrate. This ability will make it possible to provide farmers with low-cost fertilizer recommendations based on data-driven, predictive modeling of N demand.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This variability includes more frequent cold snaps. This increase in temperature fluctuation may create challenges for birds and other animals. Birds can adjust their physiology to respond to fluctuating temperatures. It is uncertain, however, if birds can respond fast enough to match these fluctuations. This uncertainty makes conservation planning for winter birds difficult. This project will study how birds respond to fluctuations in winter temperatures. The study will also identify costs of adjusting physiology that might limit how well birds can respond to fluctuating temperatures. Both natural and laboratory studies will be used to answer questions about how birds are able to adjust to temperature fluctuations. These studies will also determine what levels (tissues, cells, sub-cellular) are involved in these adjustments. The project will provide a broad view of the ability of birds to respond to temperature fluctuations expected under future climate change. The project will involve early-career and established faculty and students at various stages in their careers. The studies will also engage Indigenous and African-American college students. Another goal of the project is to involve a diversity of people to help improve scientific literacy. The project targets activities for elementary and high school students and the general public for this purpose. Data from the project are also expected to assist development of modeling approaches to predict bird responses to climate change to better assess conservation impacts. <br/><br/>Mean winter temperatures are increasing rapidly in the north-central U.S. but superimposed on this trend is more temperature variability, including more frequent cold snaps. Such punctuated cold periods will require flexible adjustments of thermoregulatory physiology of birds to match environmental conditions and could lead to physiology-environment mismatches. Flexible physiological responses allow birds to better match metabolic phenotypes to variable climates and can produce fitness benefits. The costs of such flexibility, however, are poorly known, are recommended targets of future research, and are critical elements to understand the capacities of organisms to respond to increasing climatic variability projected by climate change models. This project examines avian metabolic flexibility in response to fluctuating temperatures at organismal, cellular and molecular levels, including studies examining responses to natural seasonal and within-season temperature variation and experimental temperature acclimation studies with warm, cold, and fluctuating cold temperatures. These integrative studies will provide an unprecedented view of the mechanisms, costs, trade-offs, and fitness consequences of flexible metabolic responses of birds to increasing temperature variability expected under future climate change scenarios. The collaborative project will involve senior and junior-level faculty, a postdoctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also engage Indigenous and African-American undergraduate students and will involve K-12 students and the general public in scientific activities related to project goals to help improve scientific literacy.

By exerting control over the relative rates of reversible dynamic reactions that are competitive with chain-growth propagation, highly versatile multi-state polymerization processes are being programmed to deliver a spectrum of different products from a single initiator under otherwise identical conditions.  Different controlling elements of the system being explored include: the structure and chirality of the amidinate ligands, the effect of coordinative groups installed on the amidinate ligands, as well as reaction mixture temporal control over polymer composition.

Many diseases are caused by abnormal levels of a specific gene, which can have harmful effects. Current technologies can overcompensate by delivering genes at extremely high levels, causing unwanted effects. This proposed technology aims to activate specific genes in the human genome in a controlled and reversible manner. By using the cell's own machinery, the proposed technology may precisely control gene expression to treat diseases where the molecule is delivered. If successful, the proposed technology may provide a new therapeutic approach for a variety of diseases, leading to better health outcomes for patients. In addition, the proposed technology may provide a new platform for drug development. This could lead to the development of new drugs for a wide range of diseases, improving quality of life for patients, and reducing healthcare costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new genetic medicine platform that uses CRISPR/Cas-based epigenome editing to treat diseases by upregulating therapeutic genes. Current existing methods are not efficient at targeting specific non-coding regions of the genome. In contrast, the proposed technology is designed to target regions of the non-coding genome in human cells that are implicated in certain disease states and restore their function. In addition, the proposed technology enables the delivery of these molecules efficiently with reduced cytotoxicity and off-target effects while retaining function. This may overcome existing hurdles in delivering these therapies in vivo to reach higher levels of therapeutic targeting efficacy. The proposed technology has the potential to treat a variety of monogenic and complex diseases that previously were not accessible to current therapeutic approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, the task is modeled as a computational problem and algorithms are designed in order to perform the task. This project investigates fair clustering models, essential for computing and society, that can train machine learning systems in an unbiased or fair manner for each protected group (defined based on a sensitive feature, say gender). However, designing algorithms with provable guarantees for fair clustering has been frustrating, as the fair versions pose novel challenges. In particular, the classic techniques that have been used to solve regular (or vanilla) clustering problems have fallen short in handling the fair versions. Accordingly, the project aims to bridge this gap of understanding and design tools and techniques to achieve guarantees matching those of vanilla clustering. Additionally, the project supports research by graduate students and outreach activities to create awareness among local school/college students about ongoing research in Theoretical Computer Science. <br/><br/>This project highlights a collection of fundamental fair clustering problems with the fairness notion of balance. This notion requires that each protected group is well-represented in every cluster. Balanced clustering has emerged as one of the most popular, but difficult clustering models in recent times. For example, it is widely known that k-median (or k-means) clustering admits polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithms, but a similar approximation is not known for the balanced versions. This project investigates the limitations and applicability of generic techniques from the area of approximation, such as relax-and-round and metric partitioning. As a part of the project, new tools and techniques will be designed that would help solve a broader class of problems. The study will also examine the trade-offs between quantities such as time complexity, approximation guarantee, and the extent of fairness satisfaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus of the learning community?s efforts will be on inclusive teaching practices and concepts centered on serving student needs while taking into account students? complex experiences; these practices will engage students, across their differences, in learning activities. Faculty adoption of inclusive teaching practices is key to realizing students? academic success, and this project will address challenges faculty face in implementation of inclusive teaching practices by determining the necessary support they need to achieve this vision. Faculty learning community members will collect data in their classrooms to investigate how their students' backgrounds and classroom context influences the implementation of evidence-based educational practices relating to inclusiveness and servingness. This process will result in faculty translating education research results into teaching practice, both to improve local outcomes and to disseminate broadly to other STEM faculty. A faculty learning community built around the process of inquiry focused on student learning will empower faculty to explore, adopt, and use evidence to refine teaching practices. This project will contribute novel findings and knowledge through the faculty's research projects on inclusive teaching, as well as through the work of the research team who will investigate how this systematic inquiry into student learning can be a mechanism for supporting faculty change towards inclusive teaching.<br/><br/>The specific aims of the project at Florida International University (FIU) are to develop a three-year faculty learning community in which faculty will learn educational theory regarding inclusiveness and servingness and Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) skills to investigate their application of these practices. Through interviews, observations, and analysis of learning community documents, the research team will investigate questions related to SoTL as a mechanism for building faculty-level support for teaching initiatives. This research will provide insight into ways in which implementing a faculty learning community could enable HSI administrators to build local support for their institutional vision. The project will also explore the articulation of the complementary roles of scholarly inquiry and discipline-based education research (DBER) at FIU, and additionally determine the contributions SoTL and DBER make to each other, in the classroom, to a department, and to the university. The project?s faculty SoTL investigations will likely result in improved classroom experiences for students and significant change in faculty teaching practices that could improve the classroom experiences of their future students. In addition, the project will create structures and resources for other faculty to conduct SoTL investigations and to build relationships with DBER faculty. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity for institutional transformation at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves understanding of how to increase institutional capacity at HSIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large capital projects, such as infrastructure and energy, have long-term benefits to economies, affect local communities, and have geopolitical implications. Projects in important sectors such as defense, science, and healthcare often suffer massive cost and time overruns, making efficient and verifiable project execution highly beneficial. These projects are very complex and challenging to manage; they require multiple internal stakeholders to work together and affect many external communities. The proposed solution is a platform that enables self-regulating project networks and integrates schedules, contracts, and information flow across companies. This platform will be based on distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, making them transparent, efficient, and secure. The proposed solution will create a new, reliable, measurable paradigm for capital projects and allow multiple companies to collaboratively plan and collectively build them. It will also aid regulatory oversight, and projects will include all stakeholders. The platform will be revolutionary for complex projects planning and building, significantly improving cost and schedule performance, and bringing greater accountability to the multi-trillion dollar capital project market.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform using blockchain technology that improves the performance and accountability of capital projects.

This project is a collaboration of two institutions, San Jose State University and Michigan State University. The project aims to address the urgent need to support community college transfer students of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields by transforming the receiving baccalaureate granting institutions. Changing this racialized transfer function requires understanding and transforming the institutional culture around transfer in STEM at both the sending and receiving institutions. By partnering with transfer students of color as design partners, the goal of this project is to craft support for new-to-campus transfer students of color in STEM by engaging in university institutional change efforts.<br/><br/>This project will create Transfer Advocacy Groups (TAGs) which are collaborations of faculty, students, and advisors working to implement interventions to support transfer students of color in STEM and promote a transfer receptive culture. The project focuses on transfer students of color majoring in physics as well as  students of color taking introductory physics classes at both institutions. The scope of the project includes documenting the experiences of transfer students of color, a population that is largely absent from the literature on racialized experiences in undergraduate STEM. The data collected will allow the lived experience and perspectives of transfer students of color to be centered in the work of the TAGs and provides an understanding of the extent to which institutional change addresses their needs and realities. Analyses of research conducted in collaboration with transfer students of color as well as research with respect to institutional policies and practices will inform the work of the TAGs at each institution. TAGS will collaborate with key stakeholders to implement changes in the universities. Through these activities, the project aims to transform culture at both departmental and college levels so it is more transfer-receptive and supportive others partnering with transfer students of color on institutional change efforts. <br/><br/>This collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EDU Racial Equity). The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. This program aligns with NSF?s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation's diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity program in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.  <br/><br/>This collaborative project is co-funded through the Division of Physics. The Division of Physics (PHY) supports physics research and the preparation of future scientists in the nation?s colleges and universities across a broad range of physics disciplines that span scales of space and time from the largest to the smallest and the oldest to the youngest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These p-divisible groups break up into three pieces: an etale part, a multiplicative part, and a local-local part.  In previous work, the PI proved under very general hypotheses that the etale and multiplicative parts exhibit regular and predictable behavior in any such tower. While the local-local part can in many ways be as wild as the imagination allows, the PI and his collaborators have recently formulated several conjectures which posit striking regularity and predictability, and have proved some fundamental instances of these conjectures by leveraging ideas and tools from Dwork theory.

One context for promoting early mathematical development is the home environment. Informal activities and interactions with adults can provide children with extensive mathematical information through the communication about math that families provide to their young children. Additionally, numerous factors can influence children?s early math-related experiences at home. For example, parents? mindsets and beliefs about child development can impact how frequently they engage in math-related activities with their children. The goal of the project is to examine the benefits of parent-focused math-related communication trainings to improve children?s math skills. The focus of the research is on families from lower-income backgrounds because children from higher-income households consistently outperform their peers from lower-income households in mathematics, even as early as preschool. The family trainings will build on the strengths of families by enhancing the math-related talk and gestures that families use during their daily routines and play with their children. Findings from the research will provide insight into whether and how math-related communication at home can promote learning and will produce low-cost tools to benefit early mathematical development for young children. <br/><br/>The proposed study will examine the benefits of math-related communication trainings with low-income families from diverse backgrounds (n = 300). The central aims are to examine: 1) whether home-based trainings over a 3-month period that focus on the benefits of math communication (with and without gesture) will promote the math talk and gestures used by parents and their preschool-age children; 2) whether the home-based trainings improve preschool children?s math skills and whether these improvements are stable 3 months later; 3) whether the effects of the math communication trainings differ for families where parents hold different mindsets about the malleability of math skills. In the study, families will receive one of three trainings that focus on promoting both math-related talk and gestures, math-related talk only, or talk during play. The first two trainings will provide families with tools and information through a video and materials for incorporating math communication into play and daily activities with their children. The changes in math talk and gesture use for parents and children over the 3-month intervention period will be examined during parent-child interactions. Children?s early math skills also will be assessed prior to the training, after the 3-month intervention period, and again in a 3-month delayed posttest. Moreover, an individual differences approach will be taken to determine whether the effectiveness of the trainings differs for parents (and children of parents) who hold varied mindsets about the malleability of math skills. Overall, this research will advance knowledge by enhancing the mathematical engagement of families in the home environment to improve the mathematical knowledge of young children, and by examining the benefits of resources for parents to help incorporate math talk and gestures into their play and routine activities with their children. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF?s EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

The discovery that the supposedly massless neutrino actually has a mass, inferred through the observation that the three types of neutrinos, electron, muon, and tau can change flavor, i.e. spontaneously change from one to another, is one of those phenomena. This unexpected and unexplained observation suggests that the study of neutrinos will yield additional discoveries. The PI of this project aims to explore neutrinos in yet uncharted territories and contexts to make precision measurements of neutrino interactions and discover new physics. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole allows studying neutrinos whose center-of-mass energy is comparable to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Switzerland, and whose traversed distance from production to detection can be as large as gigaparsecs (one gigaparsec equals 3.26 billion light years). Using these unique neutrinos, the PI will study neutrino flavor changes in astrophysical scales by measuring the appearance of tau neutrinos, which can be differentiated from other neutrino species by their characteristic light emission and will search for the production of heavy particles in neutrino interactions. The measurement of tau neutrinos from distant, high-energy astrophysical sources demonstrates that neutrino flavor change, which is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon, operates on cosmic scales. Additionally, the PI will perform the first measurement of heavy particles produced in high-energy neutrino interactions, which has implications for the quark content of the proton and the existence of new neutrino species. During the implementation of this project, the PI will additionally make significant contributions to physics education and underserved communities. First, the PI will extend his current undergraduate particle physics class to incorporate elements of computational physics. These activities complement data analysis classes and expose students to modern simulation and reconstruction techniques. Second, taking advantage of his fluency in Spanish, the PI will expand existing work with a local middle school to expose Hispanic students to neutrino physics. The project includes a plan to deliver introductory lectures in Spanish to middle school students and instructors. Spanish-speaking undergraduate and graduate students will be incorporated in outreach activities and educational videos in Spanish about the physics of our project will be developed.<br/><br/>With this award the PI plans to significantly improve the selection efficiency of astrophysical tau neutrinos and measure for the first time the production of D-mesons in high-energy atmospheric neutrino interactions. The observation of tau neutrinos is crucial as they are predominantly of astrophysical origin and prove that neutrino oscillations operate at cosmic baselines. Measuring D-meson production will constrain the proton's strange quark content. Additionally, the PI will perform the first search for heavy neutrinos produced in atmospheric neutrino interactions in the sub-TeV energy range. These heavy neutrinos are one of the leading explanations for the unexplained excess of events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment. These analyses are tied together by their common double cascade signature in IceCube, which the PI proposed to identify by developing a graph neural network. This project also prepares the PI to perform follow-up analyses on the NSF-funded and currently under-construction IceCube-Upgrade and, on a longer timescale, optimize the IceCube-Gen2 design so that it continues to have a strong particle physics program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mini-school and workshop will take place at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Macaulay2 is a leading computer algebra system for supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. It is open source, and researchers can extend its functionality by contributing their own code in the form of packages. The workshop will be an opportunity for new users to learn from experienced programmers how to develop high quality packages that will be made publicly available to support future research. The first two days, which will be targeted at graduate students and postdocs with limited Macaulay2 experience, will consist of introductory lectures and computational problem sessions to facilitate a smooth onboarding process for less-experienced participants to the projects of the following week. The workshop will also include professional development activities for early career mathematicians, including the opportunity to present on their research, and a panel discussion on jobs.<br/><br/>Workshops that support the intensive development of Macaulay2 packages have an immediate impact on the research programs of both package developers and researchers worldwide. A cursory search for ""Macaulay2"" as a reference in MathSciNet shows 1643 matches, with 123 from the year 2022 alone. This is just one highlight of the importance of computer experimentation to current work in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and adjacent research areas, as well as the role of Macaulay2 in advancing the state of knowledge in these subjects. Maintaining this status requires developing new software packages, enhancing the performance and usability of those that already exist, and training new generations of mathematical scientists.

In most US states (39 states), it is the state lawmakers themselves who draw the new electoral map. Beyond producing ?bizarrely-shaped? districts that are not geographically compact or cohesive, gerrymandering appears to impact policy-making (both the ideological slant of actual policies and the allocation of public resources) through a variety of channels. This project claims that geographic disparities in turnout are key to understanding gerrymandering practices; and these disparities may be explained by differences in the share of the population eligible to vote (e.g., due to age or immigration status), the propensity to vote, or the easiness of registration and voting. The investigators will answer specific, policy-relevant, questions: Are there patterns of gerrymandering observed in practice that our theory helps understand and detect? What are the implications for policies and governmental resource allocation? <br/><br/>There are three components to this research project. First, the project will develop a theoretical model of strategic redistricting in which voters differ not only in partisanship, but also in turnout rates. Existing models and measures of gerrymandering focus on difference in partisanship across individuals, ignoring other dimensions of heterogeneity. However, in practice, differences in turnout rates are substantial and cannot be ignored. Indeed, existing theories of gerrymandering cannot explain some patterns observed in practice. From the model, we will characterize the optimal map from the gerrymandering party's viewpoint and identify clear testable implications for the map that each party should draw. Our theory could help explain some puzzling redistricting patterns observed in practice. The second part of the project will test these implications using the proposed maps by legislators of both parties for the same state in the 2020 redistricting cycle in the U.S. Finally, in the third project, we focus on policy implications and the inequality in the allocation of governmental resources. How does gerrymandering affect the choice of policies or allocation of public resources across the space and the population? If gerrymandering affects the allocation of resources, how do future choices in terms of resource allocation affect the incumbent?s electoral map design? The authors will use their theory to guide empirical tests and policy recommendations on gerrymandering, which is a topic of great general interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The material of interest is a thin film made up of alternating layers of two types of complex oxides that exhibit different electric polarization properties but are structurally similar. The resulting thin film has a highly periodic pattern of polarization domains with typical sizes in the range of 10 nanometers. By shining laser pulses on the material, the investigators dynamically modify the spatial order of these patterns. Studying the temporal evolution of these patterns by stroboscopic measurements with a temporal resolution fast enough to observe electron movements provides an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pattern formation. Finding routes to optically control polarization patterns could have far-reaching applications. These patterns can encode information that can be rapidly changed by light. This reduces the amount of energy used compared to conventional electronics while enabling many orders of magnitude faster switching in non-volatile memories or computation devices.

The research focuses on a ferroelectric/paraelectric heterostructure composed of alternating strontium titanate and lead titanate layers (STO-PTO). These heterostructures exhibit a variety of topological arrangement of local electric polarization forming long-range orders of polar vortices and skyrmions near equilibrium. While traditional tuning knobs like composition, strain, and temperature only affect near-equilibrium properties, rapid improvements in ultrafast laser technology presents a new opportunity to dynamically manipulate these spatially-complex polarization properties. Ultrafast pump-probe schemes specific to parts of the intrinsically complex STO-PTO system is used to investigate the temporal evolution of out-of-equilibrium phases and local topology. Novel experimental tools, including ultrafast broadband extreme-ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UBXAS) and extreme ultraviolet second harmonic generation (XUV-SHG), are  used to measure superlattice order parameters, trace energetic relaxation processes following photoexcitation, and detect proximitized broken-symmetry states at the interface in real-time. Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) is applied to unravel real-space dynamics of the polar skyrmion order and the impact of topological defects on long-range order. The project provides novel insights into interface and defect-mediated correlations in mesoscale systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key components of climate such as temperature and precipitation determine what organisms can occur where, and change in those factors can drive changes in the distribution and abundance of everything from plants and insects to fish and trees. Changes in temperature, including that caused by anthropogenic inputs to the atmosphere, are now challenging organisms and changing the physical environment in which species live. It is not clear whether species can adapt to these shifts in temperature, or whether we can predict the outcomes of changing temperature. Such understanding and ability to forecast the consequences of climate change, however, are important because climate change could undermine the provisioning of ecosystem services, such as the production of harvestable fish, or promote the emergence of economically important species, such as agricultural pests or mosquitos. These processes depend, in part, on adaptation to changes in climate, and our ability to respond to change in time depends on our ability to anticipate the change. Our research directly examines both the question of how/whether species can respond to changing climates by adapting to different temperatures and whether we can predict such change using the most widely embraced tool in thermal ecology (the thermal performance curve). We will engage with a wide range of basic and applied researchers to critically assess the use of this tool and try to make our own predictions for the outcomes of experiments we will conduct in the laboratory.<br/><br/>A critical question for climate change research is whether biotic interactions alter thermal performance curves (TPC) and thereby alter eco-evolutionary responses to warming. The goals of this project are to: 1) evaluate the effect of predation on the multivariate trait response underlying thermal adaptation, 2) determine how predation and thermal adaptation combine to alter predator-prey dynamics, and 3) critically evaluate the utility of TPCs as a forecasting and management tool in the context of climate change and biotic interactions. We will achieve these goals by subjecting genetically diverse populations of Paramecium spp. to predation risk and warming and measuring underlying trait and thermal niche evolution in response to these selective pressures. We will assess how this evolution affects predator-prey dynamics and evaluate whether TPCs measured at the beginning of the experiments can accurately predict the overall outcomes of our warming treatments. The experiments will evaluate the community-level consequences of evolution by evaluating how the stability of the predator-prey system changes from the initial establishment of our communities to 500 generations post-evolution. By contrasting thermal niches across genotypes and predator-prey dynamics in different climate scenarios pre- and post-evolution, the research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how climate change interacts with predation to drive thermal adaptation and impact the stability of ecological systems. The project will advance training at the interface of data and theory, broaden research participation, and establish a working group to assess the efficacy of the TPC framework for predicting organismal responses to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project hopes to advance understanding of ways in which undergraduate students, in partnership with instructors, can help to implement evidence-oriented teaching practices that support students? basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The satisfaction of these basic psychological needs in turn should foster the creation of student-centered, autonomy-supportive learning environments that increase student engagement, motivation, and ultimately success. This partnership between undergraduate students and instructors has the potential to bridge the gaps between these two groups. The significance of this project lies in the potential for such partnerships to implement pedagogical practices rooted in particular classroom, disciplinary, institutional, and cultural contexts. Students serving as partners and advocates are able to contribute their experience and knowledge to the process of generating, collecting, and interpreting feedback on teaching interventions rooted in evidence-based practices. This project will advance understanding of factors that lead to successful implementation and effective integration of research-based teaching practices in STEM to help foster student success.<br/><br/>The goals of this project will be to study the factors leading to the effectiveness and successful implementation of pedagogical practices fostering autonomy-supportive learning environments, as taught in Purdue University?s IMPACT (Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course Transformation) initiative. The Student Pedagogy Advocates (SPA) program, drawing on the student-faculty partnership model, pairs faculty with undergraduate students (SPAs) not enrolled in the class. The SPAs attend and observe class sessions and meet weekly with faculty members to offer insights and perspectives on the classroom environment. The semester-long partnership between the student and faculty member creates an ongoing feedback loop to empower faculty to create and foster autonomy-supportive learning environments (ASLE) and support their students? basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The research team will investigate the conditions under which the SPA model creates ASLE in large introductory STEM courses at a large public institution. The scope of this investigation will include classes across numerous STEM disciplines. The research team carry out its work by identifying underlying principles that make such partnership programs effective through a study of how the program fosters the satisfaction of basic psychological needs for instructors, SPAs, and students enrolled in these STEM classes.

Presently, when collecting data on forests, surveyors must choose between slow, laborious methods, or quick but inaccurate ones. This project uses recent advances in sensors and machine learning to greatly improve data collection speed without sacrificing accuracy. The resulting rich datasets enable the construction of true ?digital twins? of forests and open the door for higher fidelity modeling of forest growth trajectories. This information is useful both for timber firms seeking to maximize the potential of their assets and environmental groups projecting how changes today could impact a forest?s performance as a carbon-sink over the long term. The impacts on United States citizens are widespread. Here are two examples: improved efficiency in the timber industry brings down the cost and improves the quality of raw materials and turning forests into denser carbon sinks helps meet climate change goals. The availability of such broad and deep data on forests could also drive a boom in research and understanding about the more complex and nuanced relationships that drive forest health and productivity, launching entirely new sub-industries around forestry.<br/><br/>The key technological innovations explored in this STTR Phase I project are in constructing the most high-fidelity forest model (digital twin) by combining disparate information sources, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) and camera sensors on backpacks provide high-quality inventory metrics nearly 1000 times faster than manual measurements, but still require someone in the forest to wear the backpack. Satellite imagery scales almost instantly to entire forests and also through time with historical data but is limited by the top-down nature of satellites and the resolution they offer, especially when historical and free data sources are considered. Drone-based imagery sits in-between, with advantages and disadvantages of both. In practice, combining information sources that measure in such different ways can be very difficult. In this project, the team explores how to express LiDAR-based metrics to best associate them with top-down imagery from satellites and drones. From these associations, one can then build powerful machine learning models and specialize them to individual forests. This ability may enable the company to provide forest inventories and forest management recommendations to timber companies at any scale: with satellite imagery only or with a combination of backpack-LiDAR and satellite for the highest accuracy over the entire forest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting explosion in data that must be processed and communicated requires extraordinary bandwidth and network ubiquity, which in turn demands supporting electronics that is high performance, power efficient, and low cost. This proposal targets advancements in the most critical link, the wireless power amplifier, that is essential to realizing a vision of ubiquitous, high-speed, transparent mobile communication. Power amplifiers are among the most critical elements in any communication system as they dictate the overall efficiency of the system. GaN-based HEMTs are especially promising for high-performance power amplifiers, but current GaN-based systems suffer from limited frequency coverage, efficiency and linearity due to a combination of factors, including device design and materials issues.  In this program, we leverage transformative advances in both GaN-based transistor design and novel circuit topologies to dramatically improve the efficiency, bandwidth, linearity, and cost of the key wireless elements of a communication system, through co-design. The technology is based on polarization-engineered graded channel GaN HEMTs that show a substantial improvement in linearity in comparison to conventional HEMTs. By combining with thorough investigation of their underlying device physics including trap states and thermal management, we address major effects that degrade the performance of GaN at increasing frequencies (i.e. Ka band up to 40 GHz) by optimizing device design and fabrication. We will design harmonically terminated amplifiers based on our new class of contiguous modes, that allow designers wider choice of impedances for desired characteristics of efficiency, linearity and output power.  This will greatly enhance the promise and potential of future communication systems, such as 6G wireless communications.<br/><br/>The proposed technology development will be based on recent advances in polarization engineering in III-N materials and devices.  We will demonstrate high-linearity, high-efficiency polarization-engineered GaN transistors, with performance sufficient to eliminate the need for external linearization in wireless power amplifiers.  This program targets third-order intermodulation products below -30 dBc under large-signal conditions, sufficient to support a PAE > 50% under operational (rather than saturated) conditions. At this performance level, the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is anticipated to be sufficient to meet regulatory performance mandates without complex and costly linearizers.  We will also demonstrate high-linearity broadband amplifiers with PAE > 50% and high tolerance to impedance mismatch, through the use of our new class of contiguous mode amplifiers to provide designers a flexible design space for optimizing linearity, output power and efficiency.  To advance physical understanding, an in-depth study of the underlying device physics of polarization engineered GaN HEMTs, with nanometer scale resolution.

PFAS chemicals are widely used in firefighting foams and consumer goods. However, they are incredibly recalcitrant environmental pollutants, highly toxic to humans, and very hard to destroy. Widespread contamination of soil, groundwater, and drinking water at sites near airports, military bases, and manufacturing sites is driving a global effort to remove and destroy PFAS toxins. PFAS are poorly broken down by incineration and they do not have a natural half-life. The environmental remediation industry needs effective technology for on-site, end-of-life destruction of PFAS. The technology being developed in this SBIR Phase II project is energy efficient, scalable, pairs with existing technologies, and can be deployed at-scale for the destruction of PFAS-rich wastes. <br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project seeks to reduce technical risks related to system corrosion and chemical consumption in the development and scale-up of the hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT) process for the destruction of PFAS. Hydrothermal processing has historically been plagued by challenges with corrosion and low component lifetimes, and/or has requiring the use of expensive alloys, replaceable system components, and/or elegant chemical corrosion prevention strategies. This said, hydrothermal processes are some of the most effective and efficient technologies for destroying hazardous wastes, such as PFAS. This project will focus on measuring and mitigating the material corrosion challenges to enable more widespread adoption of hydrothermal processes for waste disposal. Additionally, HALT processing requires the use of alkaline chemicals as process additives.

The current detection methods are outdated and risky, requiring physical on-site presence, and they are also costly. Therefore, the proposed project aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective solution by utilizing genetic engineering, microbiology, and biochemical approaches.

The project's potential benefits extend beyond landmine detection and clearance, as it can enhance our understanding of bio- and nano-technology in explosive detection. It can also contribute to socioeconomic development by providing a cost-effective solution for detecting landmines globally, where there are currently an estimated 100 million landmines in the ground, and mine action costs exceed $500 million annually.

These initial impressions are formed instantaneously, and although they are typically inaccurate, they strongly guide people's behavior and predict real-world outcomes (e.g., job offers, prison sentences). Recently, researchers have mapped specific facial features that drive particular impressions (e.g., downward-turned lips are untrustworthy) with incredible precision, but this work has focused on homogenous targets (e.g., White male faces) and generally ignored gender, race, and other group memberships. Separately, researchers have long known that stereotypes related to gender, race, and other group memberships strongly bias impressions regardless of any role of facial features. These group-based biases have profound consequences and can drive social inequities such as gender and racial disparities in society. However, little is known about how people?s mappings of facial features to specific impressions change across group boundaries, such as when encountering individuals who vary in gender, race, or are members of an ingroup or an outgroup. By examining the mutual roles of both facial appearance stereotypes and group stereotypes, this project develops an integrated model of how social judgments are initially formed and the neural mechanisms underlying these judgments. By integrating insights and techniques from across social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and vision science, this project can help identify effective interventions to reduce harmful social biases.<br/><br/>In this project, explicit ratings, speed of judgment, and brain activity measures test how people cognitively integrate facial appearance stereotypes and group stereotypes, which results in their social judgments reflecting trade-offs between the two factors. Brain imaging helps identify the neural basis of this integration process with a hypothesized role of the anterior temporal lobe, a region of the brain involved in storing and retrieving social concepts. These findings advance new theoretical perspectives of a dynamic, rather than fixed, cognitive and neural architecture for forming impressions of others that varies by context, who is judging and who is being judged, and it is sensitive to social learning and experience. Facial appearance stereotypes determine real-world outcomes in many domains (e.g., legal, business, social), and group stereotypes foster a variety of societal inequities. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a precise understanding of how specific facial appearances, together with learned stereotypes about gender, race, or ingroup and outgroup membership, bias people?s behavior toward others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Labor economists argue that this wage differential is due to differences in non-wage amenities across firms as firms compensate for low non-wage amenities with higher wages.  Existing methods do not allow researchers to estimate the value of amenities that are not ?compensated for? by lower wages.  To estimate the total value of non-wage amenities provided by firms, the researchers have conducted a large-scale worker survey that asked workers to rank hypothetical job offers provided by specific firms.  Workers? choices reveal the total value of non-wage amenities provided by each firm.  The researchers will link these values to the wage and wage premia offered by firms and use the resulting data to estimate the relationship between wages and amenities.  If high wage firms provide more non-wage amenities than low-wage firms, existing estimates of inequality (based only on wages) may understate the overall level of inequality in the labor market; the reverse may also be true.  The results of this research will provide guidance on policies to reduce labor market inequalities as well as help to establish the US as a global leader in reducing wage inequalities across firms.  In so doing, the research results could also help improve the efficiency of labor markets.<br/><br/><br/>This project examines whether heterogeneity in firms? provision of non-wage amenities dampens or magnifies total labor compensation inequality, using data from a large-scale survey of employees in Germany.  The survey asked workers to rank offers from specific firms with researcher-provided wage offers.  One set of questions focused on offers from researcher-specified firms while another set of questions focused on firms the worker said they would consider.  Workers were also asked to re-rank offers under the assumption firms did not vary in commuting or in the value of future wage growth.  The survey results allow the PIs to apply standard tools from the industrial organization literature to estimate the value of non-wage amenities provided by firms.  The PIs link these values to inked employer-employee data of those firms to estimate the relationship between non-wage amenities and the wage premia offered by such firms.  The researchers will then examine the extent to what measures of inequality based only on wage premia understate or overstate inequality in the total value of compensation provided by firms.  The results of this research will provide guidance on policies to reduce labor market inequalities as well as help to establish the US as a global leader in reducing wage inequalities across firms.

The proposed technology may lead to advanced manufacturing techniques for Li-ion batteries that are well suited for consumer and wearable electronics ? fields that are growing rapidly. Longer lasting high-performance batteries may help reduce e-waste by increasing device life. Supply of low-cost energy storage options also may lead to equitable access to energy that is critical for the use of technology. Additionally, these batteries potentially may be utilized in electric vehicles, which is a high growth industry attracting significant investment. Enabling the growth of electric vehicles through high performance batteries may have a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions. This innovation may shift the approach to battery development from materials discovery to process and manufacturing.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of ultra-thick electrodes (UTEs) using advanced aerosol jet (AJ) three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. Increasing electrode thickness reduces non-active components (e.g., current collectors, separator, etc.), resulting in large gains in energy density and a significant cost reduction. Increasing electrode thickness, however, delays the Lithium transport, causing poor power performance and capacity loss. Using 3D printing allows creation of UTEs without a loss of performance. UTEs created using the proposed process have been used to demonstrate improved charge times (7.5 minutes for 80% state-of-charge) and increased energy density (up 50% to 450 Wh/kg), by taking full advantage of the energy storage capability of the active materials.  In addition, preliminary results using the AJ printed battery show improved performance compared to conventional laminated structure. The silver-based 3D structured electrodes showed a 400% increase in specific capacity, 100% increase in areal capacity, and a high electrode volume utilization compared to a thin, solid silver block electrode.

For instance, timely inference about the trajectories of nearby vehicles and pedestrians is imperative in autonomous driving, and real-time knowledge about the movements of surgical robots is essential for remote surgery. In these examples, the freshness of information is tightly related to its significance for the application. ""Freshness"" is an example of the ""semantic"" properties of the information. ""Semantics"" are properties that relate to the ""goal"" and ""purpose"" of information, which is to improve the performance of systems using the information. In semantic and goal-oriented status updating, the design objective is no longer sending as much as possible (i.e., increase throughput), or as fast as possible (i.e., reduce delay), without regard to the intended use of information. Instead, the transmitter should choose the right piece of information that is important for the system operating at the receiving end, and try to deliver the information to the receiver when it is most useful. This project provides innovative and foundational approaches to interpreting the freshness and semantics of information in a way that is both rigorous in theory and meaningful in practice, by characterizing the significance of such information in real-time inference, monitoring, and decision-making. Application-centric communications and scheduling techniques are developed to optimize the performance of these real-time systems. The research outcomes are expected to significantly impact numerous applications, ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) and robots to health, safety, and security, all of which are of paramount importance for the Nation's future. This project will also provide AI education and research experiences to K-12 students, undergraduate students, and students from underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>This project develops novel semantic and goal-oriented status-updating techniques for a broad range of real-time inference, monitoring, and decision-making systems. The main goals of this project are (i) to use information-theoretic analyses and experimental studies to interpret how the freshness and semantics of information affect the performance of these real-time systems, (ii) to design new communication techniques and networking protocols for optimizing freshness/semantic measures and the system performance, and (iii) to explore the benefits of signal-aware status updating that goes beyond Age of Information to realize additional performance gain. The new status-updating techniques will be implemented to evaluate their practical performance. These research efforts are likely to lead to far-reaching impacts in the relationship of networking, machine learning, communications, and information theory at a fundamental level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary objective of this meeting is to bring together researchers interested in immune responses in a wide range of organisms.  Although the field of immunology has long benefitted from studies in model organisms, recent technological advances have enabled scientists to pursue research questions in previously unavailable organisms. Furthermore, in the face of a changing global climate the prevalence of emerging infectious diseases is increasing and posing additional threats to the health of both humans and agriculture.  Studying organisms that are either directly threatened or species used in industry can provide unique insight into immunobiology, medicine and evolution and the potential for novel therapeutics.  NACI 2023 will provide a forum for researchers studying immune systems in a broad array of organisms to discuss conceptual advances and experimental techniques in comparative immunology.  Specifically, NSF funding will be used to make this meeting accessible to trainees by defraying travel costs for junior researchers and attendees from local universities particularly those from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  <br/><br/>NACI meetings provide a forum to foster collaborations among scientists interested in immune function from an evolutionary perspective. Researchers will present cutting-edge work in hematopoiesis, antimicrobial peptides, antiviral responses, mucosal immunity, phagocytosis, microbial recognition, antigen presentation, affinity maturation and microbiome analysis. However, unlike more traditional immunology meetings, this work has been performed in a diverse range of taxa (e.g., corals, snails, sea urchins, tunicates, lungfish, fish, frogs, and mammals).  NACI meetings provide a small venue that encourages student participation and fosters networking among scientists at all career stages.  The meeting consists of plenary and poster sessions that enable students to receive feedback on their work from this international community.  By offsetting registration and travel costs, the proposed funds will enable researchers at all levels to attend this meeting. Through intentional recruitment and targeted advertising to institutions throughout the southeastern U.S. and offsetting costs for historically-excluded populations, funds will introduce new researchers to the field of comparative immunology.  A planned workshop will provide all attendees with novel strategies to improve mentoring skills.  Results from NACI 2023 will be disseminated by posting abstracts on the NACI website and inviting students to publish a meeting report in an appropriate journal. We will also designate a social media team of postdoctoral fellows or junior faculty members who will ?live-tweet? talks during the meeting. By complementing the breadth of scientific diversity at this meeting with gender, racial and ethnic diversity of its participants, NACI 2023 will directly contribute to broadening participation in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, in order to decide whether two formulas like x*x-y*y and (x+y)*(x-y) are equivalent, one can merely plug in random values for x and y and verify whether the two formulas yield the same value. Even for complicated formulas, this is a reliable strategy, easier than manipulating the abstract formulas. A more involved use of randomness consists of a way to spot-check computations that requires significantly less effort than performing the computations themselves---a feature of paramount importance in the day and age of delegating computations to the cloud. This project investigates the potential of achieving similar efficiency in decision and verification without randomness. It incorporates graduate and undergraduate training and education, and includes the development of a textbook that makes computational thinking and the area of quantum algorithms more accessible to a broader public.<br/><br/>The project explores two new directions in the area of derandomization. In the setting of polynomial-time decision procedures with bounded error (i.e., bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time class, BPP), the investigators propose a principled approach towards derandomizing Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) based on the notion of a vanishing ideal. PIT captures the above formula equivalence problem and plays a central role in the area of derandomization as known results suggest that derandomizing PIT may enable derandomizing all of BPP. The investigators already characterized the vanishing ideal of a widely used pseudorandom generator for PIT, plan to develop the approach for other generators, and to research the ramifications. In the setting of polynomial-time interactive verification processes known as Arthur-Merlin (AM) protocols, the investigators want to further develop the connections between lower bounds and derandomization, in particular by adapting to the setting of AM the instance-wise connection that was recently established for the setting of BPP.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed project will enable the U.S. team to build a wireless federated fog (WFF) platform that is robust and scalable in accommodating different types of Industry 4.0 applications in remote areas where there is shortage of access to cloud resources, i.e., it offers the illusion of accessing infinite cloud-like resources. To this end, a cross-layer communications-computing framework will be developed during the project years with novel solutions for: live container migration; deep learning (DL) partitioning and approximation; and serverless workflow development and deployment. The anticipated outcomes of the project will be the following artifacts: (1) Methods for seamless migration of containerized services across autonomous fog systems; (2) Methods for latency-aware partitioning of micro-service workflows across WFF; (3) A serverless framework for declarative and reliable workflow development (workflow as a code) on WFF; (4) Methods for robust and latency-aware distributed DL inference atop uncertain WFF; (5) Methods using approximate inference for on-premises execution of sensitive DL services. <br/><br/>This project will provide a unique opportunity for U.S. students to gain international cross-disciplinary experience at a world-class research institute. Every year, graduate and undergraduate students will be selected via a well-defined procedure to visit the Global Computing research group at IMDEA for 8 summer weeks. The project will expose the students to both analytical and practical challenges of the communication-computing systems at a reputed research institution, and train them to become a globally-engaged and cultured workforce with world-class skills.

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will build innovative technologies to enable a robot to manipulate unfamiliar objects for difficult tasks, e.g., goods packing, drilling, waste sorting, and small part assembly. The advantage of the technologies is the capability of manipulating an object in accordance with the task requirements and the perceived object properties including shapes and materials. This project has great potential to benefit numerous industries by improving productivity, deskilling robot programming, simplifying robot planning, and lowering the technical boundaries. This project will support the national strategy in bringing manufacturing back to the US while benefiting many industries and increasing their economic competitiveness. <br/><br/>The project will establish a holistic framework of Context-Aware Task-Oriented Manipulation (CATOM) to address three cornerstone challenges in dexterous manipulation: object affordance perception, dexterity modeling, and manipulation planning and learning. An object affordance refers to actions that match with the physical properties of an object, such as shapes, mass, and friction. The object affordances are obtained from object characteristics measured by multimodal sensors. For this purpose, a knowledge-driven model will be designed, which fuses heterogenous sensing and incorporates human experience. The object affordances will be represented by potential contacts under each grasp taxonomy. A topology-based modeling method will be used to align potential hand postures with the contacts for a proper grasp. With the topology-based modeling, a complex task will be represented as a spatial-temporal sequence of hand topologies and operations. A hybrid learning and planning mechanism will be implemented to deploy hand topologies and perform actions under contextual constraints. The research of these perception, planning, and learning methodologies will advance the knowledge in dexterous robotic manipulation for complex tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This tool is scalable, brief (~5 minutes), accessible and automated for no/low provider effort, easily usable (no language barriers for users as it is tone/beep-prompted), with underlying models and biomarkers validated in published peer-reviewed research. Providing annual endpoints satisfies parental and provider interest in longitudinal tracking of childhood mental health, subsequently decreasing the number of children overlooked during this vulnerable age phase (4-10 years old) without greatly extending annual well-visit appointments. The outcomes of this work would be revolutionary in its availability, as there is no other technology-based routine mental health assessment tool for young children currently on the market. There is no other research or commercial institution that has aggregated as much data on early childhood mental health behavioral assessments and associated biomarkers. These specifics give a competitive edge over any potential forthcoming competitor in this space.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of routine screening of young adults and children to lay the necessary foundation for better clinician connectivity. The significant technical innovations include the development of novel, machine learning based algorithms for robustly gathering quantitative information about pre-adolescent children?s physiological responses during structured mood induction tasks using only data from a mobile phone. This approach leverages numerous studies to demonstrate the feasibility of this digital screening method and in so doing collected one of the largest pre-adolescent mental health physiological response datasets.

However, the success of the service depends on the effective and efficient management of thousands of electric vehicles (e.g., bikes or scooters). Existing management frameworks mainly focused on balancing demand and supply considering energy recharging. However, most of them, if not all, ignored human interactions with systems (e.g., how users select and use vehicles), which leads to a significant gap between experimental and real-world effectiveness. The objective of this project is to develop an interaction-aware management framework for mobile cyber-physical systems.<br/><br/>This project leverages and innovates machine learning and CPS techniques to fill the critical gap of interaction-aware management, thereby providing an integrated framework for human-in-the-loop CPS. The project tasks include: (1) designing new prediction algorithms based on adaptive spatial-temporal correlations to predict the real-time demand of micromobility vehicles, (2) designing new prediction models to imitate human interactions and new control algorithms to rebalance and charge vehicles considering human interactions, and (3) testing the approaches in a real-world testbed of a micromobility service provider. The success of this project could lead to a paradigm shift in CPS with human-in-the-loop by explicitly incorporating human interaction modeling and prediction. The proposal is timely due to the increasing interest in micromobility services and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as the proliferation of computing artifacts that interact with or monitor the physical world.

A century after their discovery, however, the origin of these remarkable particles, and the process responsible for giving them these energies remains unknown. A first glimpse at these sources has come over the last decade from the Antarctic's IceCube Neutrino Observatory, revealing the approximate locations of a number of them, but without the precision to identify what they are. This award supports new approaches to analyze existing IceCube data to untangle this mystery as well as the first steps to develop a next-generation observatory, P-ONE, at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean off the Washington coast that will provide much higher-precision measurements and fully open the new window on the universe provided by IceCube -- as well as providing a unique platform for studying the deep ocean. As part of this effort, the award will also support work to improve teaching in physics to improve accessibility and emphasize the subject as an experimental science rather than as only a mathematical exercise and to better align coursework with the skills needed for both academic and industry careers.<br/><br/>Neutrinos, able to pass through obstacles opaque to light, provide a unique view of the high-energy and distant universe. Over the last eight years, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has provided the first glimpse of these high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical objects, with the first detection of a bright, diffuse background (2014) and of the first source (2018). These results present something of a puzzle: The neutrino sky is more isotropic than light at any wavelength except the cosmic microwave background and the first (and presumably brightest) source is both a vast distance from Earth and otherwise unremarkable. Together, these observations strongly suggest that neutrinos are telling us something fundamentally new about the universe, something that we have not anticipated and have no other way to see, but we do yet have the data to understand what it might be. This award approaches this problem on two paths: new methods for analysis of existing IceCube data, notably by cross-correlation with millimeter-band observations of active galaxies, of which hints have been reported, and by development of the electronics for a new neutrino telescope in the northeast Pacific, P-ONE. P-ONE is expected to achieve angular resolution 4-5 times better than IceCube, increasing the expected number of detected sources by an order of magnitude and allowing the first population studies of neutrino sources. Moreover, P-ONE's peak sensitivity will be in the southern sky, unlike IceCube, which makes it well-matched to studies of our galaxy and the fields of view of most next-generation electromagnetic observatories (Rubin, ELT, CMB-S4, SKA, SWGO, etc.). Anticipated education and outreach aspects of the award include outreach in Michigan schools, a pair of programs to increase diversity at the undergraduate to graduate transition, and new programs for teaching experimental physics at the graduate and undergraduate level. In addition, the award supports the installation of a new exhibit on cosmic rays and particle physics at the Impression Five science center, a major center for science education in mid-Michigan attracting nearly 200,000 visitors a year.<br/><br/>The award is aligned with the NSF Big Idea of Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-messenger Astrophysics as it coordinates the use of multi-messengers observations utilizing long wavelength (mm/cm) photons with high energy neutrinos from IceCube and will improve the interpretation of data especially through improving the understanding of diffuse sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water deficits are made worse when snowpack depths are in error, potentially resulting in devastating damage to agricultural economies and vulnerable populations. The proposed technology will be able to scale from storm events to seasonal snowpack estimations and provide accurate mappings of snowpack depths and water equivalents for watershed areas needing water management.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops algorithms for determining snowpack depth and water content.

The proposed system comprises nondestructive tissue anchors and a spring that pushes against them to stretch the intestine and force it to grow. Having previously developed the tissue anchors, this project develops a delivery method that will allow the system to be implanted in the intestine through a minimally invasive procedure. Feedback will be gathered from pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons about the delivery method, and device performance will be measured in pre-clinical large-animal studies.

Today, thanks to advances in machine learning, genomic data bases, and the large number of known structures, we have the ability to accurately predict a structural model for the folded state of a protein given only this amino-acid sequence.  But the sequence encodes more than just the structure; the protein is an ensemble, constantly sampling other conformations. Small changes in sequence, through mutation or evolution, rarely change the folded structure, yet they can have dramatic effects on behavior and function. The conformational diversity and the dynamics associated with this diversity play an important role; this ensemble view of proteins explains how small genetic changes can alter phenotype and drive evolution. Therefore, in spite of the recent advances in predicting structure, we still cannot predict the behavior of a protein from sequence.  In order to harvest all of the information encoded in the genome, it is imperative that we understand this relationship between protein sequence and the entire ensemble (referred to as the energy landscape). A critical example of this is the variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are continuing to arise in the population ? the lack of a molecular understanding of the effects of these changes has impeded our understanding of the effects on the viral lifecycle and the evolutionary pressures on the virus. The proposal has broader impacts beyond the proposed research outcomes.  The PI will continue to grow her career development program, establishing a dedicated post-doctoral affairs program for the >300 postdoctoral fellows at Berkeley (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology).  The PI and her lab will provide access to HDX-MS instrumentation and expertise to the local scientific community and the methodological developments will enhance the resolution of HDX-MS studies beyond the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  <br/><br/>The objective of this award is to develop and use new hydrogen exchange approaches (HDX-MS) that will allow facile and rapid characterization of a protein?s energy landscape and determine the effects of sequence variation.  Amide Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange is uniquely suited to characterizing a protein?s energy landscape; it is ?blind? to the folded-state and sensitive to high-energy conformations and fluctuations. By deconvoluting the information in the time-dependent changes of the isotope envelope of a protein, the Principal Investigator (PI) will define a rate profile (fingerprint) - a set of individual amide exchange rates accounting for the entire sequence of a protein.  This fingerprint is a unique reflection of the energy landscape for a protein under the given conditions. Then, using a combination of intact protein and peptide-level HDX-MS, the investigators will carry out experiments to characterize and quantify the distribution of conformations accessible from the native conformation. The PI and her team will use these new developments together with conventional HDX-MS to look at the effect of sequence variants in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the isolated receptor binding domain to directly compare the changes in its ensemble of conformations to observed changes in fitness and function.  The results will provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 variants and their effects on the virus and its lifecycle. The methodological developments will enhance the resolution of HDX-MS studies and the PI and her lab will provide access to HDX-MS instrumentation and expertise to the local scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A long-standing barrier in using this therapy to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes for deeper cancers is the need to use high energy ultrasound to achieve deeper ultrasound penetration, leading to detrimental heating of the neighboring wave passage regions. One potential method to overcome this barrier is to introduce microbubbles in the target region, while using moderate energy ultrasound, to generate higher temperature elevations in the target region without elevating the temperature of the neighboring healthy tissues. The main aim of this project is to elucidate through numerical simulations, the fundamental understanding of how microbubbles can help in efficient ablation of tissues without causing damage to surrounding tissues. The project will also encompass significant education activities including undergraduate research projects and outreach activities for high school students.<br/><br/>The technical goal of the proposed research is to simulate and quantify the bubble-acoustics-thermal field interaction phenomenon in microbubble assisted focused ultrasound based thermal ablation therapy. To address this goal a numerical model will be developed that can simulate non-linear ultrasound propagation through tissues, its interaction with a microbubble cloud and the resulting thermal field. The model will be validated using both in vitro and ex vivo experimental data. The validated model will then be used to answer two previously unanswered questions: (i) what is the fundamental mechanism through which microbubbles enhance heat transfer from ultrasound to the tissues? (ii) what combination of microbubble parameters and ultrasound parameters can give rise to an optimal heat deposition in the target region without causing damage to the surrounding tissues? The proposed research will help in achieving a breakthrough in using microbubble assisted ultrasound therapy for cancer treatment by accurately characterizing the acoustic and thermal fields in the presence of microbubbles. This will enable researchers to explore a wide range of therapeutically relevant parameters and optimize design settings with confidence when developing focused ultrasound-based therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) engineered on T cells, a type of white blood cells, have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers and have shown promise for treating solid tumors, as well as auto-immune diseases and chronic viral infections. The main goal when engineering CAR T cells is to generate T cell phenotypes capable of effective and durable tumor clearance with increased anti-tumor cytotoxicity, T cell persistence, and lower exhaustion. CAR intracellular domains play a key role in converting antigen recognition into these anti-tumor effector functions. Selecting among a plethora of candidate receptor domains and ordering them on a receptor, to optimize their effect on cellular function, presents both tremendous opportunities and considerable design challenges. A large-scale systematic computational exploration and recommendation of CAR signaling domains has the potential to transform the field of CAR-based immunotherapy by producing novel CAR T cell behaviors leading to safer, more effective therapies. At the same time, such studies offer excellent interdisciplinary training, bridging synthetic biology explorations and fundamental biology knowledge with innovative computational approaches.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, this EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will explore a radically different CAR T cell design methodology, a hybrid artificial intelligence approach that integrates experimental data, through data-driven learning and inference methods, with knowledge sources, through knowledge-driven mechanistic network assembly and analysis. This project will systematically study the steps in the receptor design pipeline, and their full automation: retrieval of relevant information from literature and pathway databases, intracellular T cell network assembly, knowledge-based constraint generation and use in data-driven deep learning methods. With these explorations, this project will determine the most effective methods to address the uncertainty and training runtime of previous approaches, while providing reliable recommendations and explanations of CAR designs. Ultimately, this project would advance the knowledge and contribute novel research strategies in synthetic biology, systems biology, biosensing, and immunotherapy.

Flows become complex when polymer molecules crosslink, or gel, transforming the fluid into a soft solid. Crosslinking can result in intermittent flow or complete flow stoppage, resulting in clogging of small channels, nozzles, or vessels, and eventual failure of the system. The ability to predict flow regimes is key to assessing, controlling, and preventing intermittency and clogging. This award will advance our fundamental understanding of crosslinked polymer flows through small channels to enable such control. The outcome of this award could result in advances for a variety of applications including in bioprinting and 3D printing by enabling efficient printing of a wider variety of polymers. It will also help designing polymers to flow through small spaces, ranging from fluid fertilizers to biomedical and pharmaceutical products. Education and outreach activities are planned to engage and train high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in emerging topics in complex fluids. Curriculum development, engaging the general public, and supporting underrepresented populations in STEM are also planned.<br/><br/>The goals of this award are twofold: (1) to understand the range of system parameters that lead to intermittency and clogging in crosslinking polymer flows through microchannels, and (2) to provide quantitative descriptions of intermittency and the rheological and material properties of intermittent flows. Video microscopy and in situ rheology combined with theoretical transport models will be employed for this purpose. Polymers can be crosslinked by chemical or physical methods, both of which are found in bioprinting. In chemical crosslinking, gelation proceeds quickly, as in alginate crosslinked by calcium. Gelation rate is controllable in physical crosslinking, as in gelatin crosslinked by lowering temperature. Both types of gelation will be investigated to determine the importance of reaction rate and mechanism. Dependence of flow regimes on chemical concentrations and flow rates will be studied. The outcome will provide parameters to predict and control flow regimes in a broad range of crosslinking polymer systems. The intermittent flow regime will be investigated by in situ rheological measurements to determine gel strength and viscoelasticity in flow, which will be compared to bulk rheological characterization of comparable systems. This will facilitate strategies to prevent and overcome intermittent flows in practical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is important because disasters and health emergencies are becoming more frequent and more severe. Therefore, gathering data on how the health care work force responds emotionally to prolonged crisis conditions can aid in designing more effective responses.

The central question of this research is: Did health care workers' experiences during and after Hurricane Maria transform their ethics of care? The ethics of care refers to the practices and self-understanding that guide and motivate those who do the work of caring for others. The investigators hypothesize that health care workers developed a new ethics of care that drew upon pre-existing cultural features, but reflects a new sense of solidarity, greater efficacy, and shared purpose forged in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The investigators anticipate that this new ethics of care has evolved or transformed through compounding disasters including earthquake swarms and COVID-19. The research design includes data collection through individual interviews, remote focus groups, and on-site participant observation. The project contributes to the scientific understanding of the underlying cultural processes through which disasters transform communities; whether compounded disasters have a geometric or exponential impact on these communities; and also, if the ethics of care fundamentally change under these circumstances.

Eventually these skeletons are cemented together to form coral reefs. Coral reefs are important ecosystems that are threatened by climate change. Lab experiments have shown that the coral skeleton-building process is negatively impacted by ocean warming and acidification. Ocean warming and acidification are caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) released to the atmosphere by humans since the  mid-19th century. Lab experiments often test these impacts over weeks to months, but climate change affects wild corals in the ocean over decades to centuries. One of the only ways to study how wild corals have been affected by these changes is to measure past growth rates in their skeletons. Corals develop annual bands much like tree rings creating a record of their growth over time. This award will support a combined research and educational program focused on student training, improving coral data access, and public engagement. Specifically, the program will improve methods for coral skeletal analysis and build a virtual coral core repository. The project will also create an interactive app in which students or the public can interact with coral data and contribute to crowdsourced data analysis.<br/><br/>Research conducted under this CAREER award will address the drivers of long-term changes in coral calcification rates during the industrial era. The first stages of the project will focus on developing new tools for growth-rate analysis from coral cores and building the virtual core repository to make all existing coral core CT scans publicly accessible. This will enable a big-data approach in which several hundred cores from across the tropics can be processed for past growth rates with optimal analysis and statistical methods, providing the most comprehensive test of whether coral growth rates in the wild have changed under the past century or more of ocean warming and acidification. The measurement of growth rates in these cores will be transparent, with the traceable analysis files saved in the virtual repository alongside each core, enabling multi-observer analysis by researchers across the globe. Subsequent analysis of interannual variability of coral growth, or reconstruction of past climate variability from growth rates, will be enabled by the virtual repository, including continued addition of new cores collected during this project.

Lower back pain is the leading cause of global disability and up to 80% of Americans will experience lower back pain in their life. The diagnosis and treatment pathways for these patients are complex, expensive (ranging between $10,815 to $87,000 for non-surgical and surgical interventions), and often ambiguous. For the 1.62 million Americans who undergo fusion procedures each year, their treatment is plagued with complication rates as high as 50% and revision rates upwards of 36%. Despite this, rates of these procedures are growing. Between 1998 and 2008, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar fusions rose by 90%, 61%, and 141%. Recent studies have found that up to 17% of spine fusions performed were on patients who should not have been recommended surgeries. The proposed technology may allow for longitudinal tracking and functional quantitative assessment of musculoskeletal disorders and provide personalized care and decreased complications.  In addition, the proposed technology may be applied to pain management, the orthopedic extremity market, and sports training.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a remote monitoring and assessment tool to provide dynamic metrics and guide personalized treatment for spine care patients. The proposed technology uses a three-part system that consists of a wearable array, a motion analysis and calibration algorithm that models the spine in 3D, and a clinical report that translates recorded data into clinical metrics.  The goal is to analyze dynamic movement, muscular compensation, and pain over a 48-hour window, providing spine surgeons and pain management practitioners with objective measurements of their patients outside of the clinic.  The technology builds on recent studies that show that the average spinal curvature may drastically differ from standing radiographic images, which can lead to significant errors in surgical planning when not considered. The proposed sensing array will be placed on the patient in a controlled environment at the end of a standard consultation.  Developed sensor calibration methods will be used to increase accuracy and reduces placement error, providing a predictive pose estimation system. Advancements in this field may enable previously uncaptured functional assessments of patients in a natural environment and lead to substantial improvements in remote monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 1 in 50 children and hundreds of adults enrolled in clinical trials (particularly in oncology) experience a fatal drug interaction, largely attributed to lack of trial details at time of clinical encounter. This innovation has the potential to improve the well-being of individuals by support and inform current policy initiatives aiming to expand availability of clinical trial opportunities for adult and pediatric patients, such as by easing travel burdens associated with clinical trial visits and procedures. As a mobile, bridging technology that can span any distance and be accessed by any provider, this innovation can bolster expanded clinical trial access for individuals and communities in rural settings, who may otherwise be unable to participate (or risk injury by accessing care in an uninformed setting) and will thus broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in science. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new product that addresses the challenges of clinical trial management by leveraging wearable technology and embedded software to provide real-time safety information for participants. This use-inspired solution represents the <br/>convergence of disparate fields, including engineering (human factors, ergonomics), computer science (user experience, human-centered computing), and nursing models of patient care (clinical outcomes). Preliminary data demonstrate that clinical nurses have a high knowledge deficit related to the unique care needs of clinical trial participants and do not screen for such needs during assessments. This innovation catalyzes opportunities for open information exchange that will broaden healthcare providers? knowledge of drug testing safety and improve clinical care outcomes. Through the integration of trial safety information (drug interactions with standard of care treatments, side effect profiles, research team contact information) and related increase in trial participant retention, this product will accelerate the scientific understanding needed to develop novel therapeutics while positively altering the pharmaceutical industry research paradigm related to equitable, inclusive, and accessible safety management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The authors will study situations where norms, or a lack thereof, damage a society?s welfare: discriminatory norms, norms that curtail female labor force participation, norms that support unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking or drinking), or the absence of environmental norms. Understanding how norm change can occur spontaneously and how policy can help such processes is essential for addressing global challenges such as economic inequality, global warming, or public health issues. The social tipping framework developed and tested in this research project will provide an inexpensive way to evaluate policy interventions that aim to alter social norms, such as taxing harmful practices, dispensing information, and incentivizing agents of change who hold prominent social positions and can spread positive change. Another aim of the research project will be to improve how social scientists and large survey companies conduct surveys on socioeconomic issues. Traditional surveys ask for a person's opinion on a topic, but responses may not be truthful. Traditional surveys also ask static questions that are uninformative about whether or not norm change can occur. This project will develop a new method to design surveys with dynamic and incentivized questions, allowing researchers to understand the potential for norm change across different social issues. The project?s results will be socially and economically beneficial because they can contribute to a better allocation of resources.<br/><br/>The authors will empirically validate a theoretical and experimental framework to advance our understanding of social tipping points and norm change. The framework combines a theory of tipping points, large-scale lab experiments, and incentivized representative surveys. The main objective will be to organize societal and economic factors affecting norm change in a unified framework. This framework will enable researchers to study social tipping points and norm change depending on a society?s structure, e.g., people?s tolerance toward norm deviations, diversity, social networks, social fragmentation, information and filter bubbles, political institutions, individual beliefs, risk and fairness preferences, and behavioral biases such as the sunk cost fallacy. The framework will serve as a tool to evaluate policy interventions, helping to answer questions like, ?Which interventions can raise people?s willingness to get vaccinated?? and ?Are more diverse societies more likely to experience positive norm change?? The authors will further leverage the social tipping framework to design a new type of representative survey to determine whether or not a particular society, e.g., Californians, Texans, racial groups, or religious groups, is ripe for change for different social issues such as affirmative action, immigration, or climate change. A crucial methodological contribution of these surveys will be to allow researchers to detect the potential for norm change rather than focusing on static societal beliefs and expectations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, salt marsh ecosystems serve as critical transition zones at the land-sea interface and provide key ecosystem services such as improving water quality via removal of excess nutrients from terrestrial run-off and mitigating coastal erosion via shoreline buffering. This project leverages a combination of field surveys, lab experiments, and mathematical models to predict how the geographical distribution of organisms responsible for these critical ecosystem services is influenced by biological interactions (e.g., competition and predation) as well as environmental factors (e.g., temperature and physical disturbance) that vary with oceanographic currents across a range of New England salt marsh locations. The broader impacts of the project include cross-training of graduate students in biology, statistics, mathematical modeling, and computer programming. In addition, the results of this project will be shared with the Plum Island Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network and will be integrated into undergraduate courses in biostatistics, mathematical modeling, and experimental design in order to demonstrate the importance of quantitative and interdisciplinary STEM training for addressing important questions in community and ecosystem ecology. Finally, multiple interactive web modules will be created to enhance the dissemination of the results of this research beyond traditional academic circles, including Northeastern University?s K-12 outreach programs.<br/><br/>The overall aim of this project is to determine whether understanding and predicting the dynamics of multi-trophic salt marsh ecosystems across multiple scales hinges upon the integration of physical oceanographic processes and their influence on the supply of allochthonous inputs. This project will be conducted at NSF?s Plum Island LTER and consists of four objectives: (1) repeated surveys of permanently established study plots across three nested spatial scales to quantify the magnitude of allochthonous inputs and the community structure of both marine and terrestrial food webs, allowing an assessment of whether the spatiotemporal distributions of allochthonous inputs and food web architectures are consistent with their putative physical oceanographic drivers; (2) a field experiment that manipulates a gradient in the magnitude of detrital input as well as top-down control by marine fish across three nested spatial scales, enabling an assessment of whether observed survey patterns are driven by bottom-up vs. top-down processes; (3) a fully factorial lab experiment to further disentangle the role of the top-down control by marine fish vs. terrestrial spiders on key ecosystem processes such as primary production, decomposition, herbivory, and predation across a gradient of detrital inputs; and (4) development of a field-parameterized, spatially-explicit mathematical model to determine the independent and joint influences of bottom-up forcing and top-down control on the salt marsh community structure across scales. By combining models and field experiments in a biophysical-allochthonous input framework, this project will leverage the mechanistic insights traditionally associated with community ecology to reveal the joint influence of local and broad-scale processes on the hierarchically organized dynamics of open ecological systems. This project will help inform resource management for New England salt marshes and promote public education by highlighting the importance of quantitative and interdisciplinary STEM training for addressing important questions in biology.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Biological Oceanography and the Ecosystems Science Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current laminar-flow diagnostic tests do not target the pathogen directly, but instead detect macromolecules produced by the bacteria, mainly lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in urine. However, not all TB patients excrete this molecule into the urine, and LAM concentrations can be affected significantly by the infection sites. This may explain the low sensitivity (~50%) of such assays. TB is the world?s second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. In 2020, 10 million people were infected, and 1.8 million died. It is recognized that the high mortality is attributed to lack of TB testing affecting 3-6 million people per year, as well as misdiagnoses, late diagnoses, co-infection with HIV and malaria, and lack of adherence to treatment strategy. The proposed technology may overcome the limitations of current tests, especially for developing areas where medical resources are limited.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a point-of-care sensor for bacteria detection in biological fluids. The proposed sensor is built on the interactions of silver (Ag+) and bacteria. It is established that Ag+ can enter various bacterial species through outer membrane proteins, particularly the OmpF?a 39 kD transmembrane protein with a trimeric ?-barrel structure, and binds to cytoplasm components, including proteins and nucleic acid.  The proposed method is based on detecting the loss of free [Ag+] added to a sample with bacteria, and determining the bacteria number. The detection limit may be as low as 80 bacteria per milliliter sample. Moreover, an open-source potentiometer provides a low-cost and customizable opportunity for such sensor development and translation, especially in under-developed areas with limited budgets. The sensor also allows for wireless data transfer and storage in smartphones, which may allow for large-scale screening and remote healthcare. For TB detection, antibodies that are specific to m. tuberculosis will be integrated in the sensor for selective diagnosis of the presence of the bacteria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems are processes that can be modeled mathematically by a set of states that evolve over time according to fixed rules. Dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, arising in the context of weather prediction, macroeconomics, mechanics, and neural networks, to name just a small selection of application domains. Topics of interest in this area include making predictions about the future state of a system based on present conditions, understanding how sensitively future states depend on initial states, and characterizing the full array of eventual states. Dynamical systems given by polynomial or rational formulas constitute an important and interesting special class and are a focus of study in this project. Such systems are natural from a mathematical standpoint, and also arise in various scientific and mathematical applications including interior point methods in linear programming, thermodynamics, and root-finding algorithms. The study of rational dynamics in several complex variables draws on tools and techniques from a range of mathematical areas, and advances in multivariable complex dynamics in turn yield new insights in those areas. In addition to the expected research advances, the project contributes to the development of human resources via the support of doctoral students and STEM outreach activities at the Riverbend Community Math Center, a local non-profit organization devoted to working with K-12 mathematics students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project involves the dynamics of rational mappings in the setting of several complex variables. One major thrust of the proposed work concerns the difficult problem of constructing measures of maximal entropy for rational maps on complex projective surfaces.  Of particular interest are rational maps on complex surfaces that do not admit algebraically stable models. It is anticipated that any such map must preserve additional geometric structure, such as a fibration onto a curve or an invariant meromorphic canonical form. Progress towards this conjecture is an important goal of the project. In addition, the project aims to develop analytic tools tailored to such structures, with an eye towards producing invariant currents and measures, as were previously constructed in the setting of algebraically stable maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But how does this approach extend to the sentence level and beyond? According to an inference-centered view, a significant part of a sentence?s meaning can be understood in terms of the ?inferential halo? of each sentence.  The ?inferential halo? is all the inferences, i.e., implied meanings, that a sentence has. Comparing the semantic similarity of two sentences or text would then be accomplished by comparing all the inferences that each sentence or text implies.  However, current Natural Language Processing approaches to detecting sentence and text similarities  are limited to measures based on word or substring similarities which do not capture adequately the meaning of a text. <br/><br/>This project addresses the limitations of previous approaches a) enriching the notion and representation of inference and b) learning how people naturally reason about semantic relations of texts.  The novelty of our approach draws on established work in Cognitive Psychology. For the enrichment of the notion of inference, we introduce the distinction between a) quick and automatic reasoning, known as Type 1, and b) slower and more deliberate reasoning, known as Type 2.  Type 1 reasoning applies when for example we recognize a face and Type 2 when we calculate the tip for a bill. To learn how people naturally reason, we collect data using data collection protocols established in Cognitive Psychology for quick and slow reasoning. For data collection, we experiment with a novel level of granularity to better capture the range of inferences made by humans and train new computational models of detecting semantic inferences. The proposed research will yield results, guidelines, and new computational models that will lead to a) a novel way of studying informal reasoning in language processing and b) improved metrics of textual similarity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A well-known physical signal is the interstitial fluid pressure in the tumor region, and existing tumor models have difficulties regulating such a volumetric pressure. It is known that tumor regions with high interstitial pressure typically resist the delivery of the anti-cancer drugs and therapeutics. The goal of this project is to create and study how interstitial pressure can regulate the tumor cell response in a biomimetic (biology mimicking) tumor model. Bioprinting technology and hydrogel engineering will be used to construct the model. The tumor microenvironment will be introduced using the controlled formation of cell spheroids. Physical forces will be induced by acoustic waves, and their role in drug mass transport and the metastatic behavior of tumor cells will be studied. Successful development of such a model will represent a paradigm shift in the cancer community by improving patients? quality of life, potentially prolonging survival, and opening up new clinical trials to test various new drug formulations. The educational objective is to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. This will be accomplished through various educational activities by integrating the research into project-based educational activities for undergraduate students and summer internships for underrepresented students. <br/><br/>The tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly complex, with a distinct extracellular matrix composition and leaky vasculature that regulate the tumorigenic function of tumor cells. The investigators hypothesize that acoustic-driven, flow-induced pressure, hydrogel bioprinting, and theoretical simulation could be employed to replicate TME-associated pressure gradients and hypoxic conditions for an invasion behavior in tumor cells. A novel way is proposed for regulating biophysical pressure using the acoustic field in cell-laden microtissue models. A tumor-spheroid-laden microfluidic device equipped with interdigital transducers that generate surface acoustic waves will be developed and used to test the hypothesis. Through digital light processing bioprinting, the project aims to create a high-resolution vascular microtissue with spatial gradients of stiffness and pore sizes. Then, a wide range of acoustic fields (in the megahertz regime) will be made to induce pressure fields onto the tumor spheroids and characterize the tumor cells' invasion markers. Finally, a multi-physics theoretical and numerical approach will be developed to help quantify the variation of acoustic radiation forces within a fluid-saturated poroelastic environment and estimate the induced pressure field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to explore the characteristics of these metal ion containing polymers and to exploit them for the development of optoelectronic devices, such as transistors for nanoelectronics.  The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  This group is also well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students will also be part of the project.<br/><br/>The new polymers, called metalloporphenes, consist of porphyrin macrocycles fused on all four sides into a planar square array similarly as benzene rings are fused into graphene.  The centers of the macrocycles may contain two protons (?free base porphene?) or a divalent metal cation (?metalloporphene?), and the metal atom may carry two, one, or no axial ligands, such that a vast number of finely tunable derivatives are possible.  Free-base porphene has been synthesized by oxidative polymerization of a bilayer of zinc porphyrin on the surface of water in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough under controlled surface pressure, using an oxidant contained in the aqueous subphase.  The current focus of the project is the unravelling of the kinetics and the mechanism of the formation of a regular polymer, whose single crystalline domains have a coherence length of at least 120 nm, from the preorganized bilayer of monomers, with a simultaneous loss of the zinc cations.  A series of techniques will be used to monitor the kinetics of the gradual disappearance of the characteristic spectral signatures of the starting zinc porphyrin, such as its UV-visible (Soret band) and CH stretching absorption and its XPS signals, as a function of surface tension, oxidant nature and concentration, solution pH, substrate deuteriation, etc.  It is expected that an understanding of the mechanism of porphene formation will contribute to the development of procedures that will yield larger patches of metalloporphenes containing larger single crystalline domains with fewer defects.

Understanding the rational solutions to polynomial equations is a classical and fundamental problem, with advances such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the proof of the Mordell Conjecture being among the most celebrated examples of progress in modern mathematics. These questions find analogues as well as broader frameworks in the area of dynamical systems. The project funded through this proposal focuses on dynamical systems on projective varieties defined over number fields and function fields. A key aim is to extend knowledge on the arithmetic of points of small canonical height with respect to rational functions to more general polarized dynamical systems. The funding for this project will support the infrastructure of a growing group at UIC specializing in questions at the intersection of number theory, dynamics, and logic. It will also support collaborations between the PI and other researchers whose work applies non-archimedean analysis and Arakelov geometry to number-theoretic problems. The PI plans to organize a workshop at BIRS and to be a project leader for a future Women in Numbers research team.<br/><br/>Three types of problems will be investigated. The first centers on the arithmetic of points of small canonical height for polarized dynamical systems in dimension larger than 1. Specific directions include the Torsion Conjecture for abelian varieties, along with its function field analogue, as well as a sparseness conjecture for torsion points on abelian varieties that are S-integral relative to a non-torsion ample divisor. Under this heading also falls a project studying certain distinguished local canonical heights on abelian varieties and their relation to the global Neron-Tate height. The second thread connects Arakelov invariants on higher genus curves to key Diophantine conjectures about their rational points, capitalizing on recent work linking these invariants to dynamics and analysis on Jacobian varieties. A central component of this thread focuses on the self-intersection of the admissible relative dualizing sheaf introduced by Zhang, and links this quantity to metric invariants of the underlying curve.

This CAREER project investigates how parental messages facilitate the resilience of girls and women from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds in STEM career development. The project explores the idea that family support is critical for encouraging interest in STEM and sustaining career progress through adulthood. However, parents may also communicate messages (e.g., pressure, marginalization, disengagement) that make it difficult for girls and women to persist and thrive in STEM careers. The results of this study will be integrated with education goals to teach families about effective communication and STEM career options. The study will include a conversation-based card game that engages the family in discussion and stimulate learning about career trajectories, support, and messages in a workshop for parents of high school girls interested in pursuing STEM.<br/><br/>This project will consider intersectional identities and diverse lived experiences to understand how different types of family STEM communication influence STEM interests and persistence. Three mixed-methods studies will employ in-depth interview and survey methodologies to identify effective parental messages that facilitate STEM interest and support underrepresented women in STEM throughout their careers. Interviews with Black, Hispanic, and White STEM and non-STEM majors and a survey of parents will identify types and predictors of family STEM communication.

While most compounds feature carbon atoms that form four chemical bonds, there are a handful in which carbons form three or fewer bonds. The isolation of such new carbon species has been impeded by the belief that they are inherently unstable. This project will use methods developed by the PI to prepare compounds called carbenes, which contain only two bonds to carbon. In this project, these methods will be extended to previously unknown carbenes where the carbon atom is bonded to two boron atoms. The availability of these species has the potential to add to our understanding of how chemical reactions of carbon take place, permitting control of the reactivity of carbon-containing compounds. Ultimately, results derived from these studies are expected to advance the manufacturing of fine chemicals and materials by providing more selective approaches to synthesis.

The project investigates problems in: (1) online algorithms, (2) resource allocation, (3) random-acess memory (RAM) and external-memory dictionary data structures, (4) load balancing, and (5) scalable concurrent data structures.  The researchers have already shown how to use HI to crack a four-decades-old open problem in list labeling and to make substantial progress on a well-known load balancing problem.  This work promises to broaden the scope of HI to both sequential and concurrent settings.  The team will continue community-building efforts to introduce randomized algorithms to the undergraduate curriculum, as well as running workshops that can expose junior researchers to these techniques.  The team will also continue its efforts to engage members of underrepresented groups in research earlier in their careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the state-of-the-art photopolymer additive manufacturing technologies still suffer an intractable issue of overcuring, which is detrimental to the structural integrity of printed parts. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant supports research to elucidate the fundamental science of light propagation and photochemistry reactions for establishing a smart dual-wavelength photoinhibition aided PAM process. This new process allows to manipulate cure and curb exposures of the PAM processing so that the geometrical fidelity and functional integrity can be enhanced. If successful, this project will impact numerous applications including biochips, electrodes, soft robots, metamaterials, and others that demand precision manufacturing of parts with complex shapes and strengthened performance. This project will provide educational activities aimed to train future leaders to pursue manufacturing-related careers and improve the diversity of the STEM workforce by reaching out to historically underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to realize Rapid, Intelligent, Precise, Extensive, Sustainable, and Transformative (RIPEST) PAM. The primary research objective is to establish a novel digital light processing method - DLP2Curb that capitalizes on photoinhibition induced by a second wavelength light to curb curing parts, via a holistic cyber-physical approach that combines physics-guided surrogate modeling with real-time sensing and control. Thrust 1 elaborates the DLP2Curb process dynamics and materials behavior through multiple physical regimes, temporal stages, and spatial scales to unravel the causes of overcuring and the curb reaction paths by constructing a digital twin.  Thrust 2 aims to achieve non-contact, full-field operando characterization of PAM in real time. In-process part properties will be measured by deploying in-situ interferometric and ultrasonic monitoring systems along with physical sensor models and data analytics methods.  Thrust 3 develops a real-time control method via deep reinforcement learning of model predictions and in-situ measurements feedback. With case studies such as micropillars and lattices, this project will demonstrate the potential ability of DLP2Curb to unlock efficient precision manufacturing of sophisticated parts with exact geometry and exquisite details.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, transmitting each quantum bit requires generating many single photons. As a result, the current quantum bitrates in long-range networks are often in the kHz range and below, which is insufficient for most practical applications. This project will explore the physical limits to the speed of single-photon generation by coupling quantum emitters in nanometer-sized diamond particles to metallic structures much smaller than the wavelength of light. It will create the basic knowledge allowing quantum optical circuits to operate at practical MHz- and GHz-scale quantum bitrates and at non-cryogenic temperatures, with applications extending into classical optical communication links. The project includes a plan for developing educational modules to teach high-school and undergraduate students about quantum mechanics and the nascent quantum technology. Furthermore, the outreach activity for low-income middle-school students will increase their access to STEM content and scientific careers.<br/><br/>The proposed research project will investigate the fundamental speed and efficiency limits of plasmon-enhanced spontaneous emission. By coupling group-IV color centers in nanodiamonds to hybrid-mode plasmonic nanostructures made from low-loss crystalline metals, the project targets three major challenges. First, coherent spontaneous emission will be achieved on the sub-picosecond timescale. Second, the hybridization of dissimilar modes in nanostructures will unlock a giant field enhancement and near-unity radiative efficiency. Third, the project will achieve on-demand emission of indistinguishable photons into on-chip waveguide modes at near-THz repetition rates and at non-cryogenic temperatures. The proposed research will transform how future quantum photonic circuits operate. By increasing the light-matter interaction rates to the THz range, the project aims to outpace GHz-scale quantum dephasing and inhomogeneous broadening. The project will address the long-standing trade-off between electromagnetic field confinement and ohmic losses in plasmonic nanostructures and unlock the potential for high-bandwidth optical communication links. The project will create basic knowledge enabling practical MHz- and GHz-scale quantum bitrates, operation at non-cryogenic temperatures, and multipartite interaction of quantum dipoles for future quantum networks. The PI will develop education modules for middle-school and high-school students and provide research opportunities for at least two undergraduate researchers per semester.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the research team uses ancient calcified dental plaque to reconstruct the history of microorganisms that were part of Ancestors? human oral microbiome and estimate how these microorganisms changed over time with shifts in lifestyle and environment. The research advances understanding about how past histories, exposures, and arrivals in new areas around 1,000 years ago may have contributed to human health.

Community-engagement and student exchanges throughout the project ensure that findings from this study are translated into practice in academic journals and local outlets.  <br/><br/>This research team reconstructs ancient human microbiomes using ancient DNA sequencing from calcified dental calculus. They test how shifts in diet, (i.e., the use of new food sources), changes in environment or landscape (i.e., settlement in high or low altitude), and interactions with new people (i.e., arrival of other populations to the area) influenced the diversity of microorganisms in these Ancestors. More detailed analyses identify the specific genomic adaptations and rearrangements in individual microbes that accompanied these community-based shifts.

This variability includes more frequent cold snaps. This increase in temperature fluctuation may create challenges for birds and other animals. Birds can adjust their physiology to respond to fluctuating temperatures. It is uncertain, however, if birds can respond fast enough to match these fluctuations. This uncertainty makes conservation planning for winter birds difficult. This project will study how birds respond to fluctuations in winter temperatures. The study will also identify costs of adjusting physiology that might limit how well birds can respond to fluctuating temperatures. Both natural and laboratory studies will be used to answer questions about how birds are able to adjust to temperature fluctuations. These studies will also determine what levels (tissues, cells, sub-cellular) are involved in these adjustments. The project will provide a broad view of the ability of birds to respond to temperature fluctuations expected under future climate change. The project will involve early-career and established faculty and students at various stages in their careers. The studies will also engage Indigenous and African-American college students. Another goal of the project is to involve a diversity of people to help improve scientific literacy. The project targets activities for elementary and high school students and the general public for this purpose. Data from the project are also expected to assist development of modeling approaches to predict bird responses to climate change to better assess conservation impacts. <br/><br/>Mean winter temperatures are increasing rapidly in the north-central U.S. but superimposed on this trend is more temperature variability, including more frequent cold snaps. Such punctuated cold periods will require flexible adjustments of thermoregulatory physiology of birds to match environmental conditions and could lead to physiology-environment mismatches. Flexible physiological responses allow birds to better match metabolic phenotypes to variable climates and can produce fitness benefits. The costs of such flexibility, however, are poorly known, are recommended targets of future research, and are critical elements to understand the capacities of organisms to respond to increasing climatic variability projected by climate change models. This project examines avian metabolic flexibility in response to fluctuating temperatures at organismal, cellular and molecular levels, including studies examining responses to natural seasonal and within-season temperature variation and experimental temperature acclimation studies with warm, cold, and fluctuating cold temperatures. These integrative studies will provide an unprecedented view of the mechanisms, costs, trade-offs, and fitness consequences of flexible metabolic responses of birds to increasing temperature variability expected under future climate change scenarios. The collaborative project will involve senior and junior-level faculty, a postdoctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also engage Indigenous and African-American undergraduate students and will involve K-12 students and the general public in scientific activities related to project goals to help improve scientific literacy. Data from the project are also expected to benefit next-generation models of bird responses to climate change by facilitating incorporation of physiological flexibility and temperature variability into such models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific goals include (1) increasing calculus placement of incoming engineering undergraduates; (2) providing students with desirable soft skills and understanding of engineering in society; and (3) building community among pre-engineering students. A primary research question is how community-centered supports can increase the interest and improve the preparedness of pre-engineering students. An external evaluator will use a mixed methods approach that includes participant interviews and institutional data on math success and retention. Research findings will be shared internally among partners, at higher education meetings (such as the American Society for Engineering Education), and in scholarly publications.

For example, finding solutions to climate change requires understanding the economics of energy production systems, the possibilities of emerging technologies, and methods for building social and political acceptance. Improving cybersecurity and privacy requires deep technical knowledge of encryption and trust models, as well as philosophical and anthropological understandings of values like safety and autonomy. All of these problems are fundamentally sociotechnical, demanding both social and technical knowledge. However, researchers who span boundaries too often are trained at the margins of their fields. Trans-disciplinary researchers infrequently find models of success, mentorship, or support in their home institutions and fields. Without such support, interdisciplinary efforts cannot be expected to thrive. The Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems Summer Research Institute provides this support by bringing together senior Ph.D. students, post-docs, industry researchers, and early career faculty with experienced, senior boundary-spanning researchers, providing a critical intellectual and professional support system that enables boundary-spanning researchers to succeed. <br/><br/>The central function of the yearly summer research institute is to sustain and develop a densely connected research community of scholars.  An initial cohort of approximately 10 mentors are recruited each fall, with additional mentors recruited as needed to support the particular needs of mentees in the spring.

Professor Vanegas develops state of the art computational tools to investigate two fundamental questions in the area of nano-scale biomechanics.  The first question is ""What is the role of fat (lipid) structure in a model biomembrane?""  The second question is, ""How does a protein sense external physical stimuli such as pressure?"" Answering these questions is essential to understanding how biological systems function during membrane fission and fusion, organelle and cellular shaping, cardiovascular control and development, osmotic regulation, and touch and pain sensing. The open-source computational tools and methods developed by Professor Vanegas? group are enabling a broad range of studies on other areas of biochemistry, biophysics, and materials science.  The educational component of this CAREER proposal focuses on transitioning introductory physics courses at the University of Vermont to an active learning studio/workshop environment designed to significantly improve understanding of core concepts and increasing participation from women and underrepresented minorities. Professor Vanegas is also actively participating in student recruitment and developing new curriculum to support the newly-established Ph.D. program in physics at the University of Vermont. <br/><br/>Mechanics of biomembranes and mechanosensitive channels are investigated through the development and application of state of the art molecular simulation tools in steered molecular dynamics and local stress/elasticity calculations. This CAREER proposal by Professor Juan M. Vanegas pivots around two independent yet highly complementary research objectives aimed at understanding the connection between the molecular structure of biomolecules such as lipids and membrane proteins and mechanically-coupled, biological functions. The research component focuses on two main tasks.  These include the direct estimation of local and macroscopic elastic moduli from molecular dynamics simulations, and force transduction and energetics of gating in mechanosensitive proteins through non-equilibrium simulations. Professor Vanegas is developing innovative computational methods to capture mechanical properties from molecular models through calculation of the microscopic stress and elasticity tensors which measure the local balance of forces and elastic response within a material. These continuum-like fields provide a unique connection between molecular structure, mechanical properties at the nanoscale, and large scale mechanical behaviors. Complimentary steered simulation methods developed by Vanegas further allow efficient exploration of mechanically-driven biological processes in mechanosensitive channels to establish a general framework for their function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Development of this technology will provide a pathway for direct utilization of CO2 in everyday products. For example, implemented at scale, the proposed process has potential to sequester about 20 million metric tons of CO2 annually, equivalent to the emissions from 4.3 million cars. This project also has significant commercial potential. By delivering a lower-carbon product at lower cost than the current technology, the proposed innovation has the potential to become the de facto standard for manufacturing this commodity chemical. Annual licensing and ancillary revenue from a single plant is estimated at $30 million, and at 70-80% market share, typical for the dominant process, annual revenue could grow to over $1.5 billion. The success of this project will also provide a scientific and entrepreneurial blueprint to spur similar efforts thus advancing the state of the art of CO2 utilization technologies.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a light-driven chemical technology that enables the use of CO2 as a raw material in large scale chemical production of terephthalic acid. This project abates CO2 emissions by converting CO2, captured from point sources such as industrial flue stacks or direct air capture, to useful chemical and consumer products. Carbon dioxide is a stable compound and is typically unreactive and therefore incompatible with traditional heat-driven processes. The proposed project will help mature the technology of CO2 activation by photocatalysis, which has been shown to be effective in inducing CO2 reactivity. The first step is to demonstrate the feasibility of using CO2 to produce the target chemical at bench scale. Next, the reaction performance will be optimized using high-throughput experimentation techniques. Finally, the process will be scaled up in a photo flow photoreactor. In this part of the project, engineering scale up issues will be addressed as a precursor to realizing a production plant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific focus is on prior authorization processing, where payers and prescribers must reach a consensus on medical necessity. The project delivers a solution to optimize prescription authorization and provide more comprehensive patient histories for clinical authorization criteria fulfillment than other available products on the current health technology market. Lack of efficient access to reliable patient histories is the principal reason for delayed authorizations, resulting in delayed care access. A 2022 survey showed 93% of physicians reported that prior authorization often or always creates care delays; 82% reported delays that led to treatment abandonment. A secure yet progressively decentralized patient data transfer protocol would heighten transparency of clinical decision-making processes and also increase opportunities for patient engagement during prior authorization of medical prescriptions. Further, since administrative costs increase the cost of benefits, which in turn increases the cost of care access, the potential commercial impact is that payers who lower administrative costs will be better positioned to offer higher reimbursement rates for a greater range of quality treatment options, at increasingly lower cost.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to deliver a distributed ledger with smart contracts specific to the domain of pharmaceutical benefits. Since the cause of processing inefficiency lies with siloed and incomplete patient histories, this protocol resolves administrative inefficiencies through distributed ledger technology supporting fast and compliant encrypted health data sharing among prescribers, payers, and patients. Research objectives include: 1) automating criteria fulfillment to reduce administrative waste; 2) leveraging machine learning to automate simpler case reviews; and 3) designing a shared interorganizational processing protocol capable of adapting to an introduction of revised clinical standards. Smart contracts will be deployed to a distributed ledger infrastructure to formalize and enforce clinical standards as well as contractually specified financial rules and actuarial analyses at an interorganizational level. With smart contracts embedded in the authorization process to automatically curate more robust clinical histories over each prescription lifecycle, available real world data meeting contractually specified quality standards for clinical review will increase. Historical authorization data will feed back into incrementally complex cases, advancing artificial intelligence for authorization decision support. The expected result is improved real-time insight into clinical risk, affording payers the ability to financially and strategically adapt to patient needs with increasing precision and agility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It requires using expensive molds that severely limit the flexibility in the design and fabrication of complex composite structures. Additive manufacturing provides a promising alternative for rapidly creating desired composite structures without needing molds; however, additive manufacturing of high-quality fiber-reinforced composites is challenging, mainly because it is difficult to mix the matrix polymer with solid fiber reinforcements uniformly prior to deposition and then rigidize them in place along the desired print path. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support fundamental research that will enable additive manufacturing of composites containing a high concentration of carbon fibers by instantaneously rigidizing the composite material during the printing process. If successful, this project will lay a theoretical foundation for rapid manufacturing of composites without molds or even in midair. This project will provide hands-on activities to encourage Colorado?s middle and high school students, particularly women and Hispanic/Latinx students, in STEM education. New courses and experiential activities will be developed to train the next generation of composites workforce.<br/><br/>Current approaches for the additive manufacturing of continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites are mainly focused on using thermoplastic polymers or photocurable resins as the matrix polymer of composites, which typically have poor mechanical properties and/or are hard to process with a high volume-fraction of fibers. This project will investigate the manufacturing science of a new composite additive manufacturing method based on in-situ thermal polymerization of the matrix resin of composites. Central to this project is a new composite manufacturing platform that uses a remote stimulus to locally heat the thermo-responsive liquid resin of the composite filament to instantaneously polymerize and rigidize the printed composite. This project will elucidate the intrinsic interplay between process parameters, spatiotemporal variations in material composition and properties, and multiscale performance of printed composites. The proposed research is expected to uncover the mechanisms of interface formation and bonding control between adjacent layers. Experimental and numerical studies will be used to understand the viscoelastic deformation behavior and fiber distribution within filaments along multilayered, curvilinear paths during the manufacturing process. Finally, a new sensing and control framework will be developed to determine multiscale physical and thermochemical properties of materials during the manufacturing process and update the processing parameters on the fly to manufacture high-quality complex composite structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a processing constraint prevents metal AM from being a viable alternative for large-scale production of parts in transportation, construction and many other applications. To overcome the challenge, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research for an untested metal AM process, whereby a whole layer is first printed at once by curing a mixture of photopolymer and metal powder using digital light projection, followed by debinding and sintering, resulting in high-speed production. The new process hinges on a unique photopolymer with tunable properties, to balance the print-layer curing depth and homogeneous mixing of metal powder in a photopolymer suspension. If successful, this metal AM system, first of its kind, will be beneficial to heavy industries such as transportation, machinery and construction, and provide a competitive edge to U.S. industries in the global market. The project team will also organize webinars and workshops tailored for engineers to learn how the new metal AM system can be incorporated into practices, as well as introduce basic AM principles to K-12 students, offering hands-on activities (i.e., LEGO 3D printing) to inspire their interest in STEM professions.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to understand the process mechanism of a metal AM system that utilizes photopolymerization of a photopolymer and metal-powder mixture based on light projection rather than scanning, with emphases on challenges in metal powder sedimentation, curing capacity and possible oxidation-related defects. The project will first investigate the combination of thermoset-thermoplastic polymers to comprehend and control the viscosity of photopolymers. Numerical models of curability and powder packing will then be utilized to characterize the curing depth and the packing density as a function of particle size distributions in a photopolymer-powder mixture. Thermal gravimetric and microstructural analyses will also be employed to study debinding and sintering behaviors of photopolymer-powder mixtures. Moreover, a solid-state sintering model will be developed to evaluate the final part quality. The research findings will reveal principles that influence the rheological properties as well as behaviors during the curing, debinding, and sintering of photopolymer-powder mixtures. The new AM approach has the potential to allow fabrication of fully-dense, complex, and large metal parts at a high speed without oxidation or deformation. The new knowledge obtained is expected to also support advances in other AM processes, such as binder-jet 3D printing of ceramics, to improve the fabrication speed as well as the part quality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Weber of Brown University is using x-ray scattering techniques to observe how electrons orbit the atomic nuclei of molecules. Electron orbitals are the places where electrons are preferentially located and have distinct shapes that depend upon the arrangement of the nuclei and the electron energy. In molecules with more than one electron, repulsions between the electrons affect the orbital shape. In short, the motion of an electron depends upon the motion of all the other electrons, giving rise to correlations in electron motion that profoundly affect all molecular properties. For example, when molecules absorb light, an electron is promoted to a higher energy state and the distributions and correlations change, resulting in a multitude of photochemical phenomena. Observing these changes are difficult though, given the speed with which electrons move.  Professor Weber and his students will use time-resolved x-ray scattering methods to measure precise excited state molecular structures, electron density distributions and electron-electron pair correlations that are central to molecular properties. Their discoveries could lead to new benchmarks that aid the continued development of quantum chemistry computer programs. Since quantum chemistry calculations are used throughout the molecular sciences, the project could have far-reaching ramifications and impact in many related fields. The project will train students in advanced experimental methodologies and complex computer simulations.<br/><br/>Time-resolved X-ray scattering experiments will be conducted at the Linac Coherent Light Source X-Ray Free Electron Laser of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Femtosecond laser pulses will be used to excite molecules to excited electronic states. After a short time-delay, an ultrashort x-ray pulse from the free electron laser is scattered off the molecules. The measured scattering signals are compared to theoretical ones derived from computed electron density distributions and correlations. The project will extend the x-ray methods used to determine molecular structures and electron densities of ground states to the excited state and include electron-electron correlations. The studies will focus on a selection of model systems with different p-electron characters and electron correlations. Codes for simulating scattering patterns directly from computational methods and an iterative refinement process have been developed and will be applied. The experimentally measured densities, correlations and structures are compared to the results of high-level computational chemistry methods and serve as benchmarks for the quantum chemistry calculations.

The potential societal impact of this technology is to provide a method to screen individuals quickly (under a minute) for the presence of infections. Screening at ports of entry and in appropriate community settings will minimize disease transmission and allow for the quick identification and treatment of any infected individuals at US borders. In addition, beyond this immediate application, the technology may also enhance scientific understanding of normal genetic sequences in any organism.

Tunneling is a well-known quantum mechanical effect, and it is quite sensitive to the electrical configuration of the object (here a given specific nucleotide base) present between its electrodes.

There is a subsequent drop-off over the ensuing academic years, and this results in small numbers of women occupying these types of roles in their adult careers. The assessment analysis and personalized roadmap will help clarify, support, and nurture the individual?s journey in their growth and development towards their career choices including careers in STEM and entrepreneurship.

It is hypothesized that early identification of these innate interests preempts identity stereotypes. To combat confirmation bias that girls aren?t good at the fundamental skills needed for these careers, machine learning and AI-enabled data aggregation is used to correlate these innate traits with resources that foster associated job skills, offer opportunities and challenges that are suitable to the user, and provide opportunities to connect with successful role models to address the lack of representation of women in these areas.

The impacted students (majority Hispanic, Native American and female) are among those targeted by NSF for increasing representation in STEM. This project will advance the mission of NSF by training and fostering research for underrepresented students and serve NMHU's mission to provide student research opportunities. A distinctive scheme of the International Research Experience for Students (IRES) Phase II is that it involves supporting a Fine Art and/or Media Arts graduate student each year to travel with the cohort to document the geologic activities and cultural aspects of the travel. The mixing of these students into the scope of the project will bring a fresh perspective to fully realize the scientific aspects and to visually communicate the societal impacts of IRES Phase II. The work plan balances the needs of scientific inquiry and student training. It will further the reputation of NMHU ? New Mexico's premier Hispanic serving institution. The research collaboration capitalizes on the expertise of the PIs and mentors to study earth system process using a diverse tool set. The proposed activities will explore creative and transformative concepts advancing our knowledge of the ancient volcanic systems and understanding how the natural environment is intertwined with the cultural heritage of the region. The physical and digital media products will be shared with the general public to detail how and why geologic research is conducted and document the excitement of geologic discovery.<br/><br/>The objectives of the IRES Phase II research endeavors are to scrutinize the roots of the magmatic-plutonic system, aspects of the driving tectonics, and resultant sedimentation. IRES Phase I investigations (2017-2022) provided important constraints on the growth, evolution, and deformation of the shallow magmatic systems (<1 km). IRES Phase II focuses on windows of exposure into the deeper magmatic plumbing and emplacement system (<2-10 km depth) along with clastic, lacustrine, and fluvial sediments deposited due to the volcanic-tectonic activity. Our methods include: 1) primary field observations of igneous and sedimentary fabrics, structural measurements, and sample collection for petrologic, paleomagnetic, and rock magnetic analysis and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure and inform overall interpretations. Each mentor's expertise and the laboratory facilities at NMHU, Czech Republic, and Poland will be accessible to support the U.S. IRES students. The proposed activities will explore creative and transformative concepts advancing our knowledge of the magmatic-plutonic system by asking: Do we see vertical or lateral magma flow in the ""deep"" part of the magmatic system? Do we see a change in fabric orientation from magmatic to tectonic and at what structural level(s)? Questions related to tectonics and sedimentation include: What are the tectonic and depositional settings of the post Variscan basins during the early Paleozoic? What is the nature of Neogene sedimentation associated with the Eger graben in Czech Republic? Do clast compositions indicate a local provenance or a more regional source rock? Can depositional facies be used as piercing points for constraining fault offset? IRES Phase II will provide critical data on these and other research topics. The project will expose students to multidisciplinary approaches to geologic research, build the next generation of geoscientists poised with important transferable skills (critical thinking, communication, multivariate data analysis, and global competency), and involve students in collaborative research that challenges long-standing models of orogeny, igneous activity, and select depositional histories in parts of Bohemia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The chemical processes studied by Richerme and Iyengar play central roles in the reactive chemistry of most biological, materials, and atmospheric systems. For instance, quantum chemical dynamics likely underlie catalytic transformations of global importance, including the reduction of CO2, which is critical to converting this greenhouse gas to useful feedstocks, artificial photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation. Classical approaches toward modeling these processes have been unsuccessful, since they would require exponentially large computing resources to accurately describe the large numbers of quantum-mechanical electrons and nuclei within the system. Instead, Richerme and Iyengar will use fundamentally quantum hardware, whose design mirrors the geometry of the molecules under study, to emulate the dynamics of these chemical systems. This may allow them to directly calculate wavepacket dynamics and vibrational spectra for these systems without the significant overhead of gate-model quantum computation. In addition, this project will provide a rich training environment for experimental and theory graduate students ? both at the MS and PhD levels ? and will enable the development of a Quantum Chemistry track within the Indiana University Quantum Master?s degree program, addressing the nationally-recognized need for workforce development in the area of Quantum Information Science.<br/><br/>Richerme and Iyengar will develop a new approach to mapping the microscopic quantum interactions of chemical systems to engineered quantum hardware. Their central insight is that the relative geometry of quantum objects drives their connectivity, and hence, behavior and offers significant simplifications when designing quantum hardware to emulate natural processes. Drawing inspiration from the geometry of the molecules themselves, they arrange the geometry of trapped-ion qubit arrays to natively replicate the interactions and timescales of entanglement propagation between the various nuclear degrees of freedom. This approach is motivated by the observation that closely-spaced trapped-ion qubits interact strongly, while interactions decay quickly as the ion-ion distance is increased. This difference in coupling strengths, emerging from the relative ion positions, provides a framework in which multiple nuclear dimensions are simulated in parallel within multiple closely-spaced groups of ions; weak couplings across these ion clusters then generates correlations among the effective nuclear degrees of freedom. The spacing between ion clusters is controllable to sub-micron precision by changing the confinement voltages applied to ion-trap electrodes, similar to prior work which controls the trap voltages to achieve equally-spaced ion strings. Once these native interactions are encoded through the system geometry, analog quantum simulation methods should enable propagation of the molecular dynamics and extraction of the vibrational frequencies in the system, without requiring exponential numbers of quantum gates.  Success in this approach has the potential to be transformational in the fields of quantum dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, ADS also efficiently divert excess water and agricultural wastes from fields into natural river networks, causing adverse environmental impacts including streamflow regime change, water quality deterioration, and aquatic habitat degradation. Understanding and managing regional scale hydrologic and environmental impacts influenced by field scale agricultural drainage systems has remained elusive. The overarching goals of this CAREER project are to 1) identify the coupled natural and engineered drainage networks (CNEDN) including natural rivers and agricultural drainage channels, and 2) investigate the role of CNEDN in upscaling field-scale agricultural water management practices to enhance regional water sustainability. The successful completion of this project will benefit society by advancing the fundamental understanding, prediction, and management of coupled natural river and engineered drainage networks with the goal of enhancing regional agriculture and water sustainability. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student at Arizona State University.<br/><br/>Agriculture in the Midwest is experiencing rapid changes including the switching from food production to biofuel production, expansion of irrigation to mitigate drought impacts, and adoption of resource recovery techniques including nitrogen and phosphorus recovery. However, there are critical knowledge gaps in identifying and characterizing the agricultural drainage systems thereby hindering understanding of hydrologic impacts from farm scale to regional scale and limiting the capability of re-engineering the agricultural infrastructure for environmental sustainability under changing climate and socioeconomic drivers. This CAREER project will address these knowledge gaps. The specific objectives of the research  are to (1) delineate agricultural drainage networks by developing efficient and validated algorithms to capture drainage channel features from high resolution terrain data, (2) improve the capability of hydrologic models to simulate the hydrologic effects of agricultural drainage by incorporating engineered drainage channels into natural river networks, and 3) assess the local and regional hydrologic variability and water resource reliability under re-engineering strategies of agricultural drainage infrastructure. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new models and fundamental knowledge of hydrologic dynamics of coupled natural river and engineered drainage networks to enhance the prediction capability for hydrologic processes under human interferences. To advance the educational goals of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to develop and implement project-based education modules for the undergraduate/graduate curricula at Arizona State University to educate the next-generation of engineers about the  impacts of increasing human interferences on the hydrologic cycle. In addition, the PI plans to develop a toolbox for engineered channel delineation and modeling with user-friendly interfaces to encourage adoption by water resources practitioners.

Cellulose is used to make paper, clothing, and building materials. It is composed of chains of glucose molecules.  Cellulases are enzymes that cut these chains into their sugar building blocks. One approach for reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is to digest abundant, non-food plant materials like switchgrass and discarded corn stalks into sugar molecules. These can be fermented into renewable biofuels. The objective of this project is to use cutting-edge light microscopy to better understand how cellulases work.  The knowledge generated would be used to design and test enzymes that may be more efficient, lowering the cost and increasing the availability of renewable energy. In parallel with research, educational materials to expose plant biology students to single-molecule biophysics and biophysics students to plant biology will be developed and delivered. To strengthen and increase the diversity of the bioeconomy workforce, students from underrepresented populations will be actively recruited to participate in the research project.<br/><br/><br/>The ability of cellulases to break down plant cell walls is hindered by the crystallinity of cellulose.  The presence of other polymers such as lignin and xylans are thought to coat cellulose and thus block access by cellulase enzymes. This project will combine single-molecule fluorescence tracking, computational modeling, and protein engineering to investigate cellulase mechanisms. The proposed experiments build on ongoing work in which the investigators constructed a custom multimodal microscope and used it to track cellulases moving along cellulose with nanometer-scale precision. The work is divided into three Aims that explore specific aspects of cellulase activity. The goal of Aim 1 is to uncover the key principles that regulate substrate binding and threading of the cellulose polymer strand into the catalytic tunnel of the cellulase enzyme to initiate cellulose deconstruction. The goal of Aim 2 is to uncover how the substrate affinity and turnover rate of cellulases are tuned to maximize the enzyme?s catalytic activity while minimizing product inhibition and premature substrate release. The goal of Aim 3 is to identify mechanisms by which cellulases navigate complex mixtures of biopolymers, while achieving specific digestion of their cellulase substrate, avoiding off-target binding, and overcoming roadblocks imposed by cell wall complexity that hamper cellulose degradation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrolytes are a critical component of these devices, as these materials are the media for selective transport of the target electroactive species. However, safety, stability, and selectivity issues are an on-going concern in many state-of-the-art electrolytes. A unique focus of the current project is the investigation of novel approaches to enhance charge transport in polymerized ionic liquids by taking advantage of confinement and interfacial interactions, which would make them suitable as electrolytes. The fundamental understanding obtained from the planned research will provide a basis for deliberate and optimal design of polymers for many sustainability-relevant technological applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors, where interfaces play a significant role in determining the overall functionality. In addition, the knowledge gained from this project concerning the impact of the chemistry of solid surfaces in contact with polymers, the type of polymer, extent of confinement and sample preparative conditions will be of benefit to the polymer science and engineering communities. An important component of this project also involves several integrated educational activities. The project will contribute to training and education of specialists in polymer nanotechnology and materials science through active involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in this research. The proposed program emphasizes work with underrepresented groups and research experiences for high school students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polymerized ionic liquids are a class of novel functional polymer electrolytes that combines the unique physicochemical properties of molecular ionic liquids (e.g. non-flammability, wide electrochemical windows, negligible vapor pressures, and ionic conduction) with the outstanding mechanical characteristics of polymers. These materials are promising for a variety of clean-energy applications including dye-sensitized solar cells, portable batteries, actuators, field-effect transistors and electrochromic devices. However, their ionic conductivity, which is one of the most critical properties in the context of electrochemical energy applications, drops by many orders of magnitude in comparison to their low molecular weight counterparts upon polymerization. In the proposed project, a new approach to developing fundamental understanding for rational design of polymerized ionic liquids with high ionic conductivity and other desirable electrochemical properties will be investigated. The overall goal of the planned research is to employ nanoscale confinement and interfacial forces to develop a fundamental framework for designing polymerized ionic liquids with enhanced ionic conduction. The major objectives of the planned work are to: (i) develop a fundamental understanding of the impact of the extent of nanoscale confinement (as reflected by the mean pore diameters and polymer film thicknesses) on polymerization kinetics, ion transport and dynamics in confined polymerized ionic liquids, (ii) unravel the role of polymer/pore-wall interactions on polymerization kinetics, ion dynamics and charge transport, (iii) investigate the effect of molecular structure (chemistry) of polymerized ionic liquids on their ion dynamics and charge transport in nanopores, and (iv) elucidate the impact of the dimensionality (type) of confinement on polymerization kinetics, ion transport and dynamics in confined polymerized ionic liquids. The detailed fundamental understanding of the impact of nanoscale confinement gained from this project will provide a scientific framework for the design of functional polymers with relevance to sustainability and unique properties for numerous technologies, including polymer electrolytes suitable for use in electrochemical power sources and devices.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The enzyme RuBisCO is responsible for this chemical capture of carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, it carries out this process only very slowly ? to the extent that carbon dioxide capture often limits plant growth. Moreover, RuBisCO regularly and mistakenly reacts with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, wasting energy and further limiting plant growth. An improved Rubisco, if translated into agriculture, would lead to a significant increase in crop yields, improved food security, and better climate resilience, and improving Rubisco function has long been viewed as an agricultural technology holy grail. With the potential value of such an enzyme in mind, researchers have asked whether it is possible to substantially improve these areas of RuBisCO function, since natural evolution has failed to do so thus far. One widely touted possibility is that RuBisCO is caught in an evolutionary trap and cannot be improved. An alternative view is that subjecting the enzyme to new-to-nature types of selection pressures and environments would enable evolutionary innovations that actually can unlock a better RuBisCO. The goal of this project is to test the latter idea, by integrating fundamental biophysical concepts with state-of-the-art techniques for laboratory evolution. The proposed research will also help to train the next generation of scientists and engineers by involving high school interns each summer in the work. <br/><br/>Molecular chaperones interact with and assist other proteins (clients) in the cell and, in doing so, can profoundly influence the evolutionary trajectories accessible to their clients. In plants, RuBisCO requires nearly a dozen of these molecular chaperones to assist its production, regulation, and maintenance. How do the sequences and activities of these chaperones impact the evolution of plant RuBisCO, and are there ways to optimize the chaperones to open new regions of sequence space for RuBisCO? By applying laboratory evolution to RuBisCO and its chaperones in a microbial host, this project will seek to answer these questions. Next-generation mutagenesis technologies and novel screening systems will be used to achieve two key goals: (1) Demonstrating high-throughput in vivo directed evolution of plant RuBisCO and its chaperones and (2) Testing the idea that co-evolution of RuBisCO and its chaperones can lead to better evolutionary outcomes and enhanced enzymatic properties relative to evolving just RuBisCO alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, natural resource and conservation organizations have had difficulties mapping their targeted ecosystems, whether due to high costs of manual surveys or poor resolution of imaging technologies. Annually, organizations spend more than $27 billion on geospatial monitoring and analysis. This Phase II project will decrease the cost of ecosystem mapping while increasing resolution, allowing for the best quality vegetation health tracking available. Additionally, this project will result in a 50-90% reduction in work hours for natural resource mapping. By saving time, stakeholders can allocate effort to other aspects of natural resource management. By mapping land use over time, managers and conservationists can track land changes and determine if currently-implemented programs are having intended impacts on the ecosystem. This project will also improve monitoring and managing of vegetation across watersheds that provide roughly 80% of US drinking water - systems where water quality relies on healthy and biodiverse vegetation to filter pollutants. Lastly, this project will improve the ability of government agencies to rapidly monitor environmental impacts of natural disasters and inform responses.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a comprehensive software system that can provide unparalleled spectral and spatial detail on diverse landscape scenes. Compared to current labor-intensive field testing, this project?s outputs will offer scene characterization at comparable, or better, levels of detail, while surmounting the time, cost, and accessibility constraints that have historically precluded comprehensive and repetitive monitoring. Accomplishment of these Phase II goals will yield a user-friendly land cover mapping system that will enable high-resolution environmental monitoring. System outputs on population dynamics, climate change-induced vegetation shifts, and disease assessments can facilitate data-driven decision-making for precision ecosystem management and climate action. The framework of the innovation consists of three main components: 1) image pre-processing and alteration, 2) image segmentation, and 3) resolution recovery. This approach provides rapid replicability between ecosystem types and versatile scalability due to processing efficiency, while providing currently unavailable ecosystem health indicators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every year, 12 million hectares of arable land are lost due to soil degradation, erosion, and urban commercialization.  At the same time, fertilizer prices have increased by 260% since November 2020. With land becoming more unusable, increasing fertilizer prices, and a changing climate, crop growers are struggling to produce sufficient yields reliably and are searching for potential solutions. The proposed wireless sensor nodes address these issues by providing crop growers, crop consultants, municipalities, regulators, and others with valuable information to improve efficiency, profitability, and resilience.  A controlled environment agriculture (CEA) producer adopting the proposed technology may obtain an estimated 15-20% increase in net profit according to a techno-economic analysis. In addition, this technology may be expanded by creating sensors for other signals (such as pH, microbial/enzymatic activity, electrical conductivity, and/or temperature), fluids of interest (river water or groundwater), and by expanding to additional markets outside of industrial agriculture, such as consumer gardening, environmental monitoring, and/or chemical processing.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of low-cost, biochemical sensors that measure concentrations of critical factors influencing plant growth, such as nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK). Currently, high-temperature silicon manufacturing methods are employed to produce biosensors with limited material compatibility.  The proposed technology uses nanoparticle-based inks that contain polymer binders printed onto plastic substrates.  In addition, scalable printing technologies are used to fabricate the ion-selective sensor array into a single replaceable sensor strip.  The replaceable sensor strips are connected to an integrated circuit (IC) unit where a battery and an antenna for wireless data transfer are placed.  These sensor nodes are programmed to take sensor measurements at regular intervals and wirelessly upload the data to the cloud.  Previous results demonstrate that the sensors may accurately measure chemical concentrations in hydroponic solutions and several soil types. The nature of the sensors enables the collection of soil data at high spatial and temporal densities, which in turn enables an understanding of the relationships between agricultural inputs and soil health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the ways that languages encode the negation of sentences and smaller phrases varies quite a lot between languages and even between different types of utterances in the same language. This doctoral dissertation project enhances linguists' understanding of this variation by documenting the use of negation strategies in an endangered and under-documented language. Using this documentation, the co-PI describes and analyzes how various types of clauses and phrases in the language are negated and compares this with other negative strategies that exist in the world's languages. The project helps linguists to understand variation in negation and how negation interacts with other aspects of the language being documented. This analysis and documentation of a central but poorly understood and unusual aspect of the language's grammar provides an important resource for the community to preserve its language. The project also trains community members in documentation and data processing techniques, empowering them to study their own language and diversifying the field of linguistics.<br/><br/>Using established methods for language documentation and fieldwork, both naturalistic and elicited speech are recorded in the target language. These recordings are transcribed, translated, and analyzed in consultation with native speakers. Data from related languages as well as other languages from around the world are used for a comparative analysis, contributing to the typological study of negation strategies. The language under study has clausal negation makers that show agreement with the subject of the clause, so the research advances linguists' understanding of how agreement and negation are connected.

This is important to note because global food demand is increasing due to population growth. Similarly, millions of tons of petroleum-based paper dry strength agents used in the paper making industry have raised environmental concerns, motivating efforts toward developing alternatives. Soybean flour is a cheap complex polysaccharide compared to starch, modified starches, or petroleum-based strength agents, and may be a suitable substitute. But the main problem associated with using soybean flour is that it poses a bacterial digestion problem that can produce bad odors and fouling, vital issues to consider for use in paper industries. The goal of this project is to stop the bacterial decomposition of soybean flour by an environmentally sustainable chemical modification in order to benefit paper sizing/strength applications in the paper and paper packaging industries. The key research activities of this work include: 1) synthesis of quaternary positively charged functionalized soybean flour by a specific chemical pathway modification in which modified soybean flour will ultimately demonstrate the antimicrobial activity to overcome bacterial decomposition, 2) investigation of the biological decomposition of modified soybean flour and unmodified soybean flour to determine antimicrobial performance, and 3) characterization of the physical properties and antimicrobial activities of the modified soybean flour and modified soybean flour-treated sized paper. The goal is for these materials to be used as an alternative to starch-based sizing/strength agents in the paper and paper packaging industries. The proposed modified soybean flour has the potential to address low-cost, high-performance, biodegradable, and food-grade requirements for non-toxic paper products. Additionally, the project holds the potential to lead to the replacement of non-biodegradable and polluting petroleum-based paper dry-strength agents such as polyacrylamide used in the paper industries and thus address environmental and health concerns. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be members of the project team. In addition, K-12 outreach is planned as part of the total project deliverables.<br/><br/>The project approach is based on exploiting an innovative reaction mechanism for introducing a quaternary cationic charge into soybean flour such that the functionalized soybean flour will exhibit bactericidal activity and overcome biologically-induced decomposition. Preliminary results support the hypothesis that the introduction of this quaternary cationic charge in soybean flour plays a key role in stopping biological digestion and inhibiting soybean flour contamination by bacteria, mold, and fungi. This hypothesis will be further examined by testing reaction conditions in pursuit of enhancing targeted performance. Modified soybean flour will be analyzed by FTIR, NMR, XPS, SEM, TGA, DSC, and XRD to confirm modification and thermal stability. Cationic charges in cross-linked modified soybean flour will be determined by a charge analyzer and antimicrobial activity will be evaluated by standard AATCC 100 and FTTS- FA-002 test methods. The biological digestion of soybean flour and quaternary cationic charged-functionalized soybean flour will be evaluated by ASTM test methods. Preliminary lab results have shown that the quaternary cationic charged-functionalized soybean flour significantly enhances the antimicrobial properties of itself and with a sized paper sheet as well as significantly contributing to the tensile strength of paper. The work will probe not only the chemical transformations but also explore a range of reactants and crosslinking agents, and optimize reaction conditions to make functionally competent and application-motivated antimicrobial soybean flours to potentially replace daily food starch. Likewise, preliminary results indicate that the functionalized soybean flour can be used as a surface sizing agent in paper to change absorption properties and increase the strength of sized paper, potentially replacing starch-based sizing agents. The project will further confirm these preliminary results. The absorption, strength, stiffness, printability, and other properties of modified soybean flour-treated sized paper will be evaluated and compared with starch-treated sized paper properties. The antimicrobial properties of modified soybean flour-treated sized paper will be evaluated to confirm the inhibition of bacterial decomposition of soybean flour. Additionally, modified soybean flour will be blended with pulp slurry to fabricate additive-treated paper sheets to characterize physical properties, especially strength compared to commercial petroleum-based strength additive (polyacrylamide)-treated papers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For each class, an application-specific chip will be developed which will harness certain unique properties of 2-dimensional materials. The low-to-medium volume production line of the proposed business will enable the flexibility to meet the targeted needs of a large variety of customers who will not be reliant on the rigid tape-out schedules of foundries.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a dedicated emerging materials foundry for producing novel chip designs using unconventional materials with a quick turnaround time. With the continued scaling of transistors in silicon chips, Moore?s law has reached a phase of stagnation. To overcome this challenge, novel semiconductor materials have been used to experimentally demonstrate superior performance in ultra-scaled transistors. Despite their fascinating properties, there has been very little progress in transitioning these state-of-the-art technologies from the lab to the marketplace. As a result, there are hardly any foundries today which manufacture chips based on novel and emerging semiconductors. All this while, the growth of 2-dimensional materials on a large scale, which is crucial in mass producing transistors, has been drastically improved. This is a unique opportunity to commercialize an emerging materials semiconductor foundry at a time when the US wants to regain its leadership in semiconductor and chip manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monitoring of the partitioning of freshwater in the eastern Eurasian Basin allows researchers to study the role of different atmospheric regimes in distributing freshwater to different parts of the basins and further downstream to the central Arctic Ocean. The current project will support the recovery of nine existing moorings  and the design, fabrication, shipping, and deployment of nine new moorings to support an additional period of time-series observations. <br/><br/>The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution?s (WHOI) Mooring Operations and Engineering (MOE) group will provide expertise and technical services to accomplish the design and fabrication of nine (9) deep-water, under-ice, subsurface moorings for use by the Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observation System (NABOS) Project. These moorings will be deployed in the Arctic Ocean during a cruise that will take place in the late summer of 2023. This award will facilitate the mobilization of nine moorings onto the designated vessel at the departure port. The moorings will be available for rapid deployment during a cruise to the Eastern Eurasian Basins of the Arctic Ocean. The mooring locations provide an east-west array of observations designed to better understand the role of fresh waters in regulating vertical ocean mixing across and along this region and the transport of heat from the ocean interior towards areas of sea ice in the Eurasian and Makarov basins and the northern Laptev and East Siberian seas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cells in our bodies rely on this intrinsic polarity to orient themselves within a tissue. For example, to function properly, cells in our intestines need to know which side of the cell is facing the luminal space, where food is being digested, and which side is facing the underlying blood vessels, where nutrients need to be absorbed. This project uses new, highly sensitive techniques to study how molecules inside cells can interact to produce spatial patterns that polarize a cell. To ensure that the results are generalizable, polarizing cell types from both worms and mice will be studied in parallel. The results are expected to shed light on how animal cells orient themselves within a developing embryo and in the adult body. Much of the work required for this project will be carried out by undergraduate researchers recruited from the diverse student body at the University of Texas at Austin. Freshman undergraduate researchers will learn genome editing technologies while conducting a large-scale search for new polarity genes, as part of a course-based undergraduate research experience. A subset of these students will participate more deeply in the research as upperclassmen, by taking on independent projects within the lead scientist?s lab. As a result, this project will contribute to training and developing a diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Cell polarity is the asymmetric localization of molecules and activities within a cell, and is essential for the development and homeostasis of animal tissues. The scaffold protein PAR-3 is a key regulator of polarity across animals and in many different polarized cell types. This research group has previously shown that in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, PAR-3 forms oligomeric complexes containing the central polarity kinase aPKC, and these complexes are carried to the anterior of the zygote by actomyosin cortical flows. The goals of the present project are to determine 1) how PAR-3 complexes are assembled and disassembled in C. elegans zygotes, and 2) whether these mechanisms are conserved in mammalian cells. To address these questions, the group has developed and will apply an innovative single-cell, single-molecule biochemistry approach that allows direct extraction and quantification of protein complexes from polarizing cells. By measuring the composition and dynamics of PAR-3 complexes in polarizing C. elegans zygotes, the project will shed light on the biochemical basis for PAR-3 complex assembly. These experiments will incorporate both known players and new molecules identified from proteomic screens. This approach will then be extended to mouse embryonic stem cells, a mammalian epithelial polarity model that will enable the findings to be generalized across animal systems. Together, this work will elucidate how oligomeric PAR-3 complexes are assembled and controlled to enable proper cell polarization in vivo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The seismometers should detect all aftershocks with magnitudes greater than 1, and over the ten-month deployment around 100,000 are likely to be recorded. It is important that these seismometers be installed and making measurements soon after the major quakes because the number of aftershocks per day decreases over time. The recorded earthquake data will be uploaded to a website and freely shared with other scientists and the interested public. Using these data, Peng, Sandvol, and other scientists can estimate the geometry of all active faults in the region, image properties of the crust in 3D, and develop models to help with forecasting earthquakes. The data will also be used to map out where local soils amplify shaking, so building codes can be improved in these areas.

The instruments will include ten broadband seismometers with a high dynamic range, 100 5 Hz SmartSolo three-component seismometers, and six short-period instruments, all from from Earthscope?s RAPID pool. The PIs expect to record about 100,000 aftershocks and the catalogue should be complete down to M = 0.5 to 1. Machine learning and template matching techniques will be applied to the new aftershock catalogue to delineate the geometry of the East Anatolian and Dead Sea faults, the Cyprian Arc, and intraplate faults in this tectonically complex region. These data can also be used to image the crustal velocity structure, using body wave travel time data and surface wave dispersions analysis from large aftershocks and ambient noise. Data from nodal instruments will also be used to quantify site amplification for a range of frequencies. This project will strengthen ties between US and Turkish scientists at TUBITAK.

The Undergraduate Biology Education Research GRC is the first in the GRC family to focus exclusively on investigating how attention to social justice issues can inform improvements in undergraduate biology learning and teaching. This conference will bring together students, postdoctoral scholars, researchers, educators, administrators, policy makers, and publishers, providing a forum to share emerging research and practices that promote inclusion, diversity, equity, access, and social justice in undergraduate biology education across disciplines and sectors. <br/><br/>The undergraduate biology education research community has witnessed significant changes in its discourse since the last Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar in 2019. Two key drivers for such changes include disruptions to the educational system by the COVID-19 pandemic and intensified conversations about the important role that learning environments informed by a social justice lens can play in leading to improved biology learning and teaching. A renewed recognition emerged from these disruptions: The community of undergraduate biology education researchers and practitioners values partnering with students and scholars from different communities and intersections of identities to create inclusive learning environments. This recognition compels renewed conversations on research that may reshape institutional practices and policies, propelling further action to implement changes at institutions across the nation. Specifically, the conference invites on-going scholarship that strives to center people and communities, foster collaborations and systemic changes, and create new visions toward social justice.

Algorithms aggregate data and build predictive models that become more accurate as they aggregate data from many different parties. Such large-scale aggregation raises security and privacy concerns. Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is an approach that allows two or more parties to perform a computation on their private data without revealing information about their data. Long in the realm of theoretical cryptography, MPC has seen advances in programming technology. It has been deployed in practice in scenarios such as sealed auctions, benchmarking company performance, privacy-preserving machine learning, and biometric matching. Unfortunately, programming technology is still nascent and building systems requires significant expertise in theoretical cryptography, as well as compilers. The goal of this project is to bring programming technology to a level where programmers from different domains can write secure and efficient algorithms without commanding extensive knowledge of cryptographic primitives. <br/><br/>This project focuses on a new intermediate representation (IR) for MPC and advances the idea of backend-independent optimization, in a close analogy to machine-independent optimization in the classical compiler. It builds a compiler framework that takes a Python-like program and produces low-level cryptographic code. The first thrust of the project develops intra-procedural optimizations over the IR. It builds novel SIMD-vectorization, divide-and-conquer, scheduling, protocol mixing and other optimizations, extending classical analyses to the unique setting and constraints of MPC, as well as developing new MPC-specific cost models and optimizations (e.g., protocol mixing). The key premise is that the linear structure of the IR is highly amenable to program analysis, accurate cost modeling, and program synthesis and therefore these techniques can give rise to aggressive and provably optimal transformations. The second thrust builds a theoretical foundation for proving correctness of transformations over the IR. The third thrust extends intra-procedural reasoning to the inter-procedural setting. In addition to its technical contribution, the project will contribute to the education of students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. It will train a new generation of computer scientists in secure computation, compilers, and system building.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While connectivity forms the backbone in realizing SM, it has opened new cybersecurity risks and challenges, requiring a fundamental rethink and foundational efforts to tackle these challenges. Recent National Science Foundation-sponsored workshops have underscored a compelling need for a research infrastructure that can bridge the traditional divide between manufacturing and cybersecurity professionals and foster a community of CISE experts in manufacturing cybersecurity. Creating such an infrastructure is essential to understand the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and to develop solutions tailored to SM systems. This project envisions the creation of a vibrant CISE research community for data-driven cybersecurity for SM by launching a community research platform integrating three elements: (1) A web infrastructure that enables virtual ?playgrounds? to share data, codes, resources, and tools, mostly contributed by the research community? (2) a data infrastructure for curating diverse cybersecurity datasets? and (3) a SM machine infrastructure that will leverage established national resources, including the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform from the Department of Energy. Taken together, this infrastructure will help CISE researchers to collaborate with the SM community ?spanning academia, industry, and government? to create and share data for understanding the vulnerabilities of a network of SM machines and other components of a manufacturing enterprise, and facilitate the development of AI-driven cybersecurity innovations for SM. This infrastructure will enable CISE-relevant, data-driven research thrusts spanning five key SM system elements: (1) Cybersecurity by design; (2) compiler optimizations for SM process plans and toolpaths; (3) forensics and watermarking of SM machines; (4) protections against SM process-unique side-channels; and (5) fingerprinting and securing SM networks. The community will be able to contribute their SM equipment, relevant hardware and software components, data, and innovations to grow this networked cyber-physical platform infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Emerging manufacturing enterprises are increasingly adopting advanced sensor and AI technologies and transforming themselves into smart manufacturing systems. These smart systems can connect multiple manufacturers, designers, and businesses to efficiently meet customer demands. A SM network is noted by IBM as the largest target for cybersecurity attacks among all industry sectors. Securing such a network is a daunting task. This project aims to create an online resource consisting of web infrastructure, data, and machines to bring together professionals from the manufacturing and cybersecurity communities. This infrastructure will enhance collaborations among these communities to enable a deeper understanding of current and emerging cybersecurity threats to smart manufacturing environments and enable the development of innovations to assure cybersecurity within the smart manufacturing sector. It will particularly benefit diverse researchers, practitioners, and students from cybersecurity, AI, and manufacturing disciplines. For example, the project will leverage the Inclusive Engineering Consortium, a network of 20 Underrepresented Minority serving engineering colleges to enable broad-based impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These weather extremes are closely related to the location and intensity of midlatitude jet streams, which blow from west to east and often shift to the north and south. As Earth?s climate gets warmer, the jet streams are affected by the tug-of-war between the rapid surface warming over the Arctic and the enhanced upper-tropospheric warming in the tropics. The investigators will examine several interrelated dynamical mechanisms for midlatitude-Arctic interactions and the associated weather extremes. The first theme is the linkage between the planetary waves in the stratosphere and the risk of cold events. This task will test the hypothesis that extreme wave events in the stratospheric polar vortex serve as a source of intraseasonal predictability for cold events over North America. This linkage between the stratosphere and surface temperature will be analyzed in observations and climate models. Secondly, the investigators will examine a hypothesis that a weaker jet stream under rapid Arctic warming would lead to more frequent weather extremes in mid-latitudes. This task will perform idealized numerical simulations to examine the effect of jet speed or jet structure on the north and south shifts of a jet and thus attempt to reconcile different views on the changes in midlatitude circulation waviness in response to climate warming. The third task is on atmospheric rivers, the narrow intense moisture transport associated with midlatitude cyclones. Atmospheric rivers dominate the poleward moisture flux in the middle and high latitudes, which contribute to Arctic warming. Intense moisture transport can be influenced by either wind speed or temperature, and the two factors will be studied in an atmospheric transport model of water vapor and cloud tracers.<br/><br/>Midlatitude weather extremes have profound socioeconomic impacts. Predictive skills from extreme stratospheric events could improve the sub-seasonal forecast of winter cold spells over North America, with important implications for energy consumption and transportation. A better understanding of extreme cold events in a warming climate can foster better communications of global warming science between the scientific community and the public. Improved predictions of the intense moisture transport by midlatitude cyclones into the Arctic help better adapt to the changing Arctic. Besides supporting an early career scientist at Penn State University, the proposal will train two graduate student researchers at UCLA in the analysis of observations and climate models. Several UCLA undergraduates will be trained in statistical analysis of climate data, particularly for STEM majors and underrepresented minorities. The idealized models developed in this study will be made available on a GitHub website with sample python scripts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alkenes are widespread among natural and artificial chemical substances with properties of value to medicine, engineering, agriculture, electronics, and materials science. The method being used to generate alkenes differs from traditional approaches in that the molecule is formed directly from two so-called 'carbenoid' building blocks, which assemble in such a precise fashion that potentially any kind of alkene can be targeted with complete control of structure. Molecules to be prepared during this renewed period of support include vitamin D2, a representative member of the D vitamin family with a range of therapeutic indications (e.g., cancer, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease), and pumiliotoxin 251D, a defense alkaloid from a tropical frog species, and related compounds with cardiotonic properties. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to benefits accrued to society as the principal investigator and his research team provide summer research experiences for high school students under the auspices of the STEM academy at Oregon State University. This education and outreach program promotes interest in science and engineering from a diverse array of young learners and it includes mechanisms designed to foster participation from individuals belonging to traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The award supports continued research and development of the carbenoid eliminative cross-coupling (CEXc) concept for carbon-carbon double bond synthesis. By contrast to conventional methods for connective alkene synthesis, CEXc does not rely on substituent effects to control stereochemical outcome; rather, absolute stereochemical information encoded in two stereodefined sp3-hybridized carbenoid substrates wholly determines the relative configuration of the alkene product via a three-stage stereospecific mechanism (ate-complex formation, 1,2-metalate rearrangement, and beta-elimination). The funded research focuses on extending the concept of CEXc to classes of targets not previously investigated (cyclic styrenes, conjugated trienes, and non-conjugated alkenes) and it encompasses the use of more reactive types of carbenoids (e.g., alpha-chloroalkyl-lithiums and -boronates) and new reaction modalities (e.g., intramolecular). In the context of conjugated alkene synthesis (research thrust 1), specific goals are: assembly of conjugated trienes about the cental olefin, semi-synthesis of vitamin D2 via generation of the C7-C8 double bond (distal bond disconnection), and formation of macrocyclic styrenes by intramolecular CEXc triggered by sulfoxide-metal exchange. The work on non-conjugated alkenes (research thrust 2) focuses on generating challenging targets with subtle stereogenicity, including: chirotopic 4-cyclohexylidenes, isotopomeric olefins, and pumiliotoxin 251D. Pursuit of the highlighted research agenda is anticipated to lead to fundamental and broadly applicable advances both to chiral carbanion chemistry and to the practice of advanced stereoablative synthetic techniques for the control of molecular configuration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the importance of bacterial glycans in bacterial survival, their systematic study and perturbation remain challenging. The proposed experimental procedures will develop new sugar probes for tracking utilization, uptake, and processing of sugars by bacteria. Identifying which glycan structures are present on which bacterial cells could reveal fundamental insight into the role of these structures, as well as aid in antibiotic and vaccine development.

More broadly, the project has the potential to broaden the visibility of women and people of color in the chemical glycobiology community through a series of symposia at national meetings of the American Chemical Society. Taken together, this work could spur the next generation of students to persist and thrive in science.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to leverage bacterial monosaccharide analogs to yield insight into optimal parameters for probe design, monosaccharide uptake, and glycan tailoring enzymes present within bacteria. Correlating monosaccharide-based reporter usage and esterase activity levels in a range of bacteria provides incisive tools for probing bacterial glycans. Developing fluorescent monosaccharide analogs to track uptake by live bacteria could allow a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling monosaccharide penetration into bacterial cells. Generating fluorogenic glycoside substrates facilitates the analysis and identification of glycan-processing enzymes in live bacterial cells and lysates. The creation of enabling tools has potential utility for glycoscientists pursuing basic and applied research in a range of bacterial systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even individuals in highly satisfied relationships can readily recall negative interactions with their partner. Both theory and intuition assume that feelings about significant others are complex. Yet, there is scant evidence that this complexity exists implicitly (i.e., knowledge that people often cannot deliberately bring to mind but that still impacts behaviors). Recent work shows that in the first milliseconds of perceiving a significant other, both positive and negative information is triggered. Clearly, the single individual most liked in a person?s life strongly activates immediate positive evaluations, but this same person also activates some negative evaluations immediately as well. The current studies investigate this early signature of implicit bivalence (i.e., immediately activated positivity and negativity). Specifically, is implicit bivalence triggered only by significant others with whom one has a long history of affectively-complex experiences? Alternatively, might a stranger with whom one has no past experience trigger implicit bivalence because interactions with any person have the potential to be rewarding but also costly? Importantly, what are the consequences of implicit bivalence for psychological functioning and behavior in relationships? Understanding the evaluations that immediately come to mind when one encounters or thinks about others informs how people quickly make sense of the rewards and costs of social dynamics, with implications for flexible and adaptive social functioning.<br/><br/>Mental representations of others are the cognitive building blocks of human behavior and color perceptions and interpretations of a person?s actions and social interactions with them. One way in which mental representations help people to interpret and react toward others is through enabling rapid and spontaneous evaluations of them. These implicit evaluations are triggered effortlessly and unintentionally whenever one encounters, or simply thinks of, another person. Implicit evaluations deliver immediate information about the positivity and negativity of another person, influencing how we think and behave toward that other person. But initial research has revealed that rather than other people triggering either positivity or negativity, they in fact trigger both positivity and negativity, even for significant others. The current work investigates how this affective complexity develops, for whom it emerges, and what consequences it has for behavior. In so doing, the research examines the plausibility of two theoretical accounts for why implicit bivalence emerges. One account suggests that bivalence emerges whenever the information about the attitude object is affectively complex, which would suggest that bivalence occurs toward a wide range of objects and people but not for newly encountered others. The other view suggests that bivalence prepares the perceiver to react to all people because of their potential to behave in a positive and negative manner, which would suggest that bivalence might emerge for others regardless of any past history. The work utilizes a range of research designs to assess implicit evaluations for people and for everyday objects (e.g., tempting foods, cigarettes), increasing the generalizability of the findings, as well as for people and objects for which implicit evaluations are experimentally created in the lab (e.g., by associating a person or object with rewarding or aversive experiences). The findings will inform models of social cognition, with implications for theory and research on ambivalence, attitudes, implicit cognition, and relationship science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An estimated 2.8 million people in the US sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) annually which contributes 30.5% of all injury-related deaths and costs an estimated $60 billion annually. To develop effective prevention and intervention strategies, it is critical to understand how the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-bathed brain responds to sudden external impacts and what mechanical and cellular mechanisms drive the pathological development of concussive brain injury. However, due to the brain?s forbidding complexity, the small confines of the subarachnoid space (SAS) between the skull and the brain, the extremely transient feature, and the skull?s opacity preventing direct visualization of any complex physical interactions between the CSF flow and the compliant brain, the mechanism of brain concussion remains unclear. The proposal is aimed to tackle this challenging problem by integrating innovative analytical, numerical, and biomimetic approaches with concussion animal models to reveal, for the first time, the crucial roles of transient CSF flow during brain concussion. The project will fill a glaring knowledge gap, with high-payoff feature ensuing from its potentials to guide the creation of effective head protection, reduce the incidence of concussion, lead to significant cost savings, and benefit the society by saving lives. The project will also encompass significant educational activities, including curriculum reform, multi-year undergraduate research program, and outreach programs for Annual Girl Scouts day and High School Academy for Underrepresented Minorities at Villanova University (VU), the VU Athletic Department and the local public libraries. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to examine the transient cerebrospinal fluid flow in the porous subarachnoid space (SAS) filled with arachnoid trabeculae (AT), as the head is exposed to rapid external impacts, and hence to elucidate the critical role of the CSF flow in transmitting and mitigating external impacts. The proposal integrates analytical, numerical, experimental (biomimetic and biomechanical) investigations, built upon solid and encouraging preliminary study results. Analytical and numerical models, capturing the key CSF flow physics that have been neglected to date, will be tested using a novel biomimetic experimental platform, and further evaluated by in vivo biomechanical study. The proposal is the first, and so far, the only study of its kind to attempt to uncover a long-standing mystery in brain biomechanics. It is expected to yield highly transformative results  and provide the platform for future study in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dr. Biyu He, New York University Title: Neural Mechanisms of Conscious Awareness in Humans<br/><br/>The nature and basis of conscious awareness in humans is one of the oldest and deepest mysteries in philosophy and science. We go to sleep every night and enter an unconscious state and then wake up every morning and return to consciousness. How does consciousness arise? The origin of conscious awareness is a question that has puzzled philosophers for thousands of years. How does brain activity give rise to consciousness? Recent insights from neuroscientists into the nature and neural basis of consciousness have arisen thanks to the rapid development of new behavioral paradigms, neuroimaging techniques to measure brain activity, and both descriptive and quantitative theories. The field of consciousness science, exploring the neural basis and correlates of consciousness, has seen explosive growth over the past three decades and this relatively young scientific discipline promises to have an enormous potential impact on neuroscience, medicine, society, and technology. <br/><br/>The Workshop on the Neurobiology of Consciousness is jointly funded with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and be held on the main NIH campus in June, 2023. Talks will be live-streamed as a Webinar for a broad audience of interested scientists and the public. The Workshop will facilitate in-depth discussion between scientific experts working in divergent fields whose integration is essential to understanding the neurobiology of consciousness. Key goals of the Workshop are to synthesize the current state of knowledge about consciousness, discuss and design experiments to critically test existing theories of consciousness, define the most exciting new approaches to advance the field, and develop a roadmap for future discoveries in the science of consciousness. A special issue of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience will be devoted to publication of conference presentations. In addition to established scientific investigators, the Workshop will also include postdoctoral trainees and early investigators to participate in this high-profile workshop. Trainee fellowships to cover travel expenses will be preferentially given to women and under-represented minorities in order to enhance diversity in the field of consciousness research. The Workshop will also include an educational program that will provide a pre-Workshop introduction to the field of consciousness research to undergraduates from minority serving institutions to further broaden inclusion and diversity  and encourage the next generation of consciousness researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Certain sources are non-sustainable, meaning that they cannot be replenished quickly once consumed, while others are sustainable and can be regenerated. Unfortunately, non-sustainable sources are running out rapidly; thus, the nation could benefit both environmentally and economically from an improved use of sustainable sources. Plants are promising sustainable sources, which offer fuels, materials, and nutrients. Yet, these valuable components cannot be easily taken out from plants, because they are trapped in plant skins. Typical plant skins are composed of complex species, such as i) an intense network of numerous, cross-linked large molecules, known as cellulose, ii) a bunch of small molecules known as lipids which line up and assemble into plant cell membranes, and iii) glycoproteins, molecules formed by sugar-like molecules connected with proteins. These species build up a hard protection layer to plants, which cannot be broken down easily. This project will develop special biomaterials to break down such a protection layer. A series of enzymes, special proteins which speed up the breaking-down of cellulose, lipids, and glycoproteins, will be placed in the scaffolds and gaps of a solid crystal, known as Ca-MOM. These enzymes will cooperate to degrade the protection layer of plants without generating adverse by-products. The Ca-MOM crystal will stabilize and help re-collect the enzymes, making them reusable. Meanwhile, the positions of the enzymes in the crystal scaffolds will also be probed to understand the performance of the enzymes in the developed biomaterials. These efforts will not only produce biomaterials to efficiently and sustainably break down plant skins to allow for the extraction of valuable energy resources and materials but also understand how enzymes function in these biomaterials. The demonstrated strategy will also improve the progress of science because it can be adapted to breaking down of other natural sources which contain valuable components and require multiple enzymes to cooperate. The research efforts will be bridged with an educational plan to bring research opportunities to local underrepresented groups by involving them in green chemistry research. This principle investigator will also develop an educational program called Green Chemistry- Green Planet in order to introduce the green chemistry concept to local elementary students through established programs such as the North Dakota (ND) 4-H and Operation Military Kids programs in ND.<br/><br/><br/>Technical summary/abstract<br/><br/>Plants are sustainable sources of energy and materials, yet the valuable components are protected by plant cell walls. The challenges to break down these cell walls are the difficulty in degrading the intense cellulose network, the major cause of cell wall stiffness, and complexities due to other components such as lipids and glycoproteins, which also enhance viscosity and stiffness. Using cellulases and accessory enzymes to degrade cellulose and other components is the green choice of plant biomass degradation due to their specificity and biocompatibility, yet the challenge is the need of multiple enzymes including proteases which damage the partner enzymes. This project will overcome this challenge by immobilizing three celluases, a lipase, and a protease on Metal-Organic Materials (MOM) via enzyme-MOM co-crystallization. In the resultant co-crystals, each enzyme is partially exposed to the reaction medium for substrate contact while partially buried under MOM surfaces for enzyme protection to reduce proteolytic damage. The developed biocatalysts will be demonstrated on the degradation of a model plant biomass, followed by probing the structure-property relationship of the resultant multi-enzyme/MOM biocatalysts differing in MOM ligands using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The hypotheses are 1) simultaneous immobilization of 5 enzymes enhances the cost efficiency of and accelerate plant biomass degradation with reduced proteolytic damage and 2) the biocatalytic performance of the developed biocatalysts depends on the structural basis of enzyme exposure on MOM surfaces and MOM ligands. These hypotheses will be tested through three objectives: 1) develop a 5-in-1/Ca-BDC biocatalyst for the rapid biodegradation of plant biomass, 2) determine the structural basis of the 5-in-1/Ca-BDC biocatalyst, and 3) establish the structure-property relationship of the 5-in-1/Ca-MOMs the biocatalytic performance of the developed biocatalysts. The educational plan of this project will provide opportunities for averagely 1 Native American student, 2 undergraduate students, and 1 local high school student per year to participate in green chemistry research. In addition, an educational program called Green Chemistry - Green Planet will be developed to enhance the science knowledge of numerous K-12 students via the North Dakota (ND) 4-H system and the Operation Military Kids program in ND.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Four commercial applications will be explored. First, coastal engineering firms are required to match local grain size during beach restorations, necessitating grain size analysis at the site and all nearby sand resources (onshore and offshore). Engineering works of this nature are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude as climate changes. Second, recent work suggests that carbon dioxide drawdown can occur during beach nourishment if crushed olivine (a naturally occurring mineral) is used instead of beach sand. The measurement and verification of carbon dioxide removal requires monitoring the time evolution of olivine grain size. This can be done quickly using this technology. Third, preliminary work has focused on coastal applications, but river restorations also must match a target grain size to make sure that the sediment does not immediately wash away in flood conditions, and that new sediment is suitable for habitat for flora and fauna. Fourth, this device is potentially useful for classifying sand and gravel for mining aggregates.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a handheld camera-based measurement system that uses on-device machine learning, does not require calibration, and provides accurate in-the-field measurements within 1 second. Much of the earth is covered with a veneer of mobile sediment. The size of this sediment determines under what conditions it will move; larger sediment requires larger forces to move. Grain size is a first order measurement for geologic, engineering, and other earthmoving activities. The standard techniques for measuring sediment grain size are time consuming and performed exclusively in laboratory settings, not in the field. Bringing samples back to the lab to be analyzed can take up to 6 months, even as surface grain size can change on the timescale of seconds to minutes. This innovation is focused on the continued development of an existing device that can analyze grain size instantaneously.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the Arctic warms, shrubs are replacing other plant species, altering the carbon cycle. The driving mechanisms and impacts of this shift on Arctic soil carbon remains unclear. This research explores the reasons behind this shift by testing three hypothesized mechanisms that may explain shrubs' competitive advantage in a warmer climate. These hypotheses include increased photosynthesis, greater response to nutrients made available by warming, and larger gains from longer growing seasons. The project employs mathematical models, field experiments, and surveys of shrubs across Alaskan tundra landscapes to test these mechanisms. This research will improve our understanding of vegetation changes and carbon cycling in the rapidly warming Arctic. Results will be shared via a public-facing interactive website and incorporated into K-12 and college courses. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms by which changing climate enables shrub dominance in heterogeneous Arctic ecosystems. The research approach combines trait-based models of competing tundra species informed with field experimental manipulations of temperature, nutrient availability, and snowmelt date. The full factorial experimental manipulation of these three environmental factors will allow researchers to untangle the relative contribution of the hypothesized mechanisms to shrubification. Since different mechanisms may be driving shrubification across vast and variable Arctic landscapes, researchers will conduct surveys of shrub populations and warming experiments across natural environmental gradients on the North Slope of Alaska. By clarifying mechanisms driving shrubification at local and landscape scales, this research will aid future efforts to represent Arctic shrubs accurately in Earth System Models and reduce uncertainties in climate change projections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, participants will explore what might comprise a corresponding infrastructure to support the widespread use of CBR. When using CBR, researchers look not only at an educational innovation as a whole, but also at its individual parts. Additionally, they systematically describe the contexts within which the innovation is happening. By doing so, researchers can determine more than whether a program ?works.? Over time, CBR may enable researchers to identify the parts of an innovation that work for particular groups of students in particular settings, resulting in customizable and more impactful innovations. A CBR paradigm may also help address some long-standing challenges in STEM education research. For example, while much research has informed many instances of educational improvement, the field has been less successful at accumulating knowledge over time. CBR, with its specific descriptions of innovation and circumstantial components may assist with this problem. Also, STEM education programs that work well in one situation don?t necessarily work well in a different one, leaving local educators the challenge of adapting the innovation without guidance. CBR approaches, along with supporting research infrastructure, can support data-informed adaptations that enable practitioners to customize education innovations for their specific circumstances. CBR approaches also have potential to make data more readily available to practitioners, instructional materials developers, and others who can use it to inform their work. This two-day conference will bring together 30 individuals to examine and articulate possible steps for bringing the CBR paradigm to the broad field of STEM education research. Attendees will include individuals who work in a range of capacities in STEM education and STEM education research, as well as scholars who have been using CBR-like approaches in other disciplines such as public health. Additionally, attendees will include a strong representation of people from groups who have historically been excluded from STEM fields. The two primary outcomes of the meeting are 1) community building and knowledge generation, and 2) a monograph summarizing the work of the conference and next steps. <br/><br/>This conference will focus on how the field might operationalize the CBR paradigm in STEM education research. It will be organized by five dimensions that need to be developed in order to have a foundation for further CBR work, with additional attention on the research infrastructure needed for such work. Specifically, there will be five working groups that examine: 1) approaches to developing collaborative language, including taxonomies, ontologies, and standards; 2) innovative analytic approaches that can address the complexity of CBR analyses; 3) ways CBR can leverage data mining, AI, and other elements of data science that can support CBR; 4) databases, design, and other infrastructure to ensure accessibility to CBR-based data and support its application in the field; and 5) the challenge of engaging the field, developing collaborations and consensus, and creating training and further education. Alternating with group work will be ?consultation seminars? that entail having working groups present their work to other working groups who will interrogate the work to raise challenges, gain new insights, and identify ideas to develop as well as those to jettison. After the conference, participants, will be invited to contribute to the creation of a monograph either through writing contributions or through review.

High performance servo motors and motor controllers do exist, but they are too heavy, large, and expensive to be incorporated into many robotic applications, particularly mobile robots. By combining a unique hardware design with a software solution to eliminate intrinsic hardware problems, this project will result in an ultra-compact, high performance, and low-cost electric servomotor.

During the recent hiatus decade (2003-2012) about two-thirds of the excess heat that entered Earth?s climate system was stored in the Indian Ocean. This project will address the ITF pathway patterns in the South Indian Ocean. The PIs propose a new pathway for heat flow in the Southeast Indian Ocean and will investigate its role in distributing the excess heat and freshwater that entered the South Indian Ocean from the ITF during the hiatus decade. An integral approach will be used that combines analyses of observational and reanalysis datasets with high-resolution ocean model experiments. These methods will be used to characterize the spatial and temporal structure of the flow pathway, investigate the forcing and processes that govern the pathways of ITF waters, and explore the roles of the different pathways in distributing heat and freshwater in the South Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>The PIs hypothesize the existence of a flow pathway for waters from the ITF between the Southeast Indian Ocean and the subtropical South Indian Ocean, along which ITF waters spread to the western subtropical South Indian Ocean with a portion leaking to the Southern Ocean.

To test this observational data will be analyzed in combination with numerical model experiments. Observational data will include data from moorings, drifters, satellites, reanalysis products. Model data will include existing 1/10 degree simulations from Ocean General Circulation Models For the Earth Simulator and new 1/12 degree runs using HYCOM. The overall goals of the research are to explore the potential new pathway of ITF waters in the South Indian Ocean, investigate the governing mechanisms of this new pathway, and quantify its role in transporting the excess heat and fresher ITF waters during the recent hiatus period into the Greater Agulhas Current System of the subtropical Southwest Indian Ocean. The project focuses on the hiatus period 2003-2012 when a dramatic heat increase in the Indian Ocean due to enhanced ITF was observed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their study connects with several areas within mathematics, as well as physics and other fields of science. This project is focused on groups of symmetries of dynamical systems, exploring how properties of the underlying system manifest in, and constrain, the structure of these symmetry groups. A key class of systems are the hyperbolic homeomorphisms, and the core of the project concerns a new stabilized framework for studying the collection of automorphisms of these systems. Symbolic systems, including shifts of finite type, also play a key role, and have important connections to other areas such as ergodic theory and information theory, and their symmetry groups exhibit a wide range of complexity. This project will advance the field by investigating new techniques and invariants for classifying symmetries of systems through the use of stabilization. The project also provides opportunities for graduate students to conduct research. <br/><br/>The project is aimed at a notion of reconstruction: the extent to which the structure of symmetry groups, and their stabilized counterparts, can be used to reconstruct various dynamical properties of the underlying system. The PI intends to further develop and apply various stabilized invariants, notable local entropy, to the study of such automorphism groups with the goal of recovering dynamical invariants, such as topological entropy and zeta functions. Such invariants have been used successfully in the symbolic setting, and one aim of the project is to extend this to certain smooth settings. One goal of the project is to study the question of whether the stabilized automorphism group of a shift of finite type is a complete invariant up to topological conjugacy. In addition, the project explores the extent to which stabilized results, and invariants derived from there, might be used to analyze the classical automorphism groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While connectivity forms the backbone in realizing SM, it has opened new cybersecurity risks and challenges, requiring a fundamental rethink and foundational efforts to tackle these challenges. Recent National Science Foundation-sponsored workshops have underscored a compelling need for a research infrastructure that can bridge the traditional divide between manufacturing and cybersecurity professionals and foster a community of CISE experts in manufacturing cybersecurity. Creating such an infrastructure is essential to understand the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and to develop solutions tailored to SM systems. This project envisions the creation of a vibrant CISE research community for data-driven cybersecurity for SM by launching a community research platform integrating three elements: (1) A web infrastructure that enables virtual ?playgrounds? to share data, codes, resources, and tools, mostly contributed by the research community? (2) a data infrastructure for curating diverse cybersecurity datasets? and (3) a SM machine infrastructure that will leverage established national resources, including the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform from the Department of Energy. Taken together, this infrastructure will help CISE researchers to collaborate with the SM community ?spanning academia, industry, and government? to create and share data for understanding the vulnerabilities of a network of SM machines and other components of a manufacturing enterprise, and facilitate the development of AI-driven cybersecurity innovations for SM. This infrastructure will enable CISE-relevant, data-driven research thrusts spanning five key SM system elements: (1) Cybersecurity by design; (2) compiler optimizations for SM process plans and toolpaths; (3) forensics and watermarking of SM machines; (4) protections against SM process-unique side-channels; and (5) fingerprinting and securing SM networks. The community will be able to contribute their SM equipment, relevant hardware and software components, data, and innovations to grow this networked cyber-physical platform infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Emerging manufacturing enterprises are increasingly adopting advanced sensor and AI technologies and transforming themselves into smart manufacturing systems. These smart systems can connect multiple manufacturers, designers, and businesses to efficiently meet customer demands. A SM network is noted by IBM as the largest target for cybersecurity attacks among all industry sectors. Securing such a network is a daunting task. This project aims to create an online resource consisting of web infrastructure, data, and machines to bring together professionals from the manufacturing and cybersecurity communities. This infrastructure will enhance collaborations among these communities to enable a deeper understanding of current and emerging cybersecurity threats to smart manufacturing environments and enable the development of innovations to assure cybersecurity within the smart manufacturing sector. It will particularly benefit diverse researchers, practitioners, and students from cybersecurity, AI, and manufacturing disciplines. For example, the project will leverage the Inclusive Engineering Consortium, a network of 20 Underrepresented Minority serving engineering colleges to enable broad-based impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such care is a major health determinant, as early life stress can influence lifetime and even intergenerational health outcomes. Numerous institutions arose historically to provide this care, including religious institutions like monasteries that offered social and health services. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the impact that such services had on juvenile health by comparing skeletal evidence of stress in juveniles from monastic and non-monastic sites. The research provides historical context for understanding how and why these institutions survived and how they operate today, including how access and effectiveness vary with factors such as age, status, or location. The project contributes to undergraduate and graduate training in transferable laboratory skills, as well as to open data projects and science outreach efforts.<br/><br/>This study has three primary objectives: (i) to propose an expanded bioarchaeological model of juvenile care which fully considers sociocultural context and is applicable to juveniles of a range of biological and social age categories, (ii) to subsequently demonstrate the model?s efficacy by applying it to a complex care network, and (iii) to determine how early social and health services functioned in the network of care to impact juvenile health. Bioarchaeology of care models use a step-by-step approach which includes the diagnosis and analysis of pathological and stress indicators, biological and social care needs of the individual/group and the nature of that care, and the agency of both the caregivers and receivers. Within this framework, the researchers compare skeletal stress indicators, mortality data, and cultural data between three skeletal collections (urban monastic, rural monastic, and non-monastic). Results from this project can demonstrate the applicability of an expanded bioarchaeology of childcare framework as well as contribute to the understanding of social and health services by more thoroughly characterizing their early history and impact on juveniles across time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology could eliminate traditional surgeries and invasive therapy complications. This technology can also be made at a competitive price point allowing it to be more accessible, especially to clinics in low-income communities. This technology also removes some of the major performance barriers in the market. A proposed miniaturized ultrasound solution can be deployed in numerous portable applications, such as ultrasonic deep brain stimulator, which eliminates complications and cost of current treatments, and can be used in other emerging applications such as mental health treatments, without opening the skull and implanting electrodes into a patient's brain.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an ultrasound transducer drive system. Multichannel phased arrays and single channel power modules are ultrasound transducer drivers, which are used in a wide range of medical and non-medical applications. These drivers are very high in price, and they have performance variances. This innovation reduces the cost of these drivers with some performance breakthroughs, such as generation of sine or harmonic-free outputs beneficial for both medical and nonmedical applications, as well as the removal of the matching networks per transducer and providing an increase in the power limitations of each channel. This technology can be deployed in focused ultrasound medical applications to cure a wide range of conditions non-invasively, with these harmless soundwaves. The technology can also be deployed in other non-medical applications, where economical and high-performance drivers are necessary. The technology is supposed to be miniaturized to replace current severely invasive deep brain stimulation with non-invasive ultrasound version used for different neurologic conditions, such as Epilepsy and Parkinson.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will address the ITF pathway patterns in the South Indian Ocean. The PIs propose a new pathway for heat flow in the Southeast Indian Ocean and will investigate its role in distributing the excess heat and freshwater that entered the South Indian Ocean from the ITF during the hiatus decade. An integral approach will be used that combines analyses of observational and reanalysis datasets with high-resolution ocean model experiments.

This project focuses on computational methods for control of optimal transport and mixing of some quantity of interest in fluid flows.  The question of what fluid flow maximizes mixing rate, slows it down, or even steers a quantity of interest toward a desired target distribution draws great attention from a broad range of scientists and engineers in the area of complex dynamical systems. The goal of this project is to place these problems within a flexible computational framework, and to develop a solution strategy based on optimal control tools, data compression strategies, and methods to reduce the complexity of the mathematical models. This project will also help the training and development of graduate students across different disciplines to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods for solving these problems.<br/><br/><br/>The project is concerned with the development and analysis of numerical methods for optimal control for mixing in fluid flows.  More precisely, the transport equation is used to describe the non-dissipative scalar field advected by the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes flows. The research aims at achieving optimal mixing via an active control of the flow velocity and constructing efficient numerical schemes for solving this problem. Various control designs will be investigated to steer the fluid flows. Sparsity of the optimal boundary control will be promoted via a non-smooth penalty term in the objective functional. This essentially leads to a highly challenging nonlinear non-smooth control problem for a coupled parabolic and hyperbolic system, or a semi-dissipative system. The project will establish a novel and rigorous mathematical framework and also new accurate and efficient computational techniques for these difficult optimal control problems. Compatible discretization methods for coupled flow and transport will be employed to discretize the controlled system and implement the optimal control designs numerically. Numerical schemes for the highly complicated optimality system will be constructed and analyzed in a systematic fashion. New incremental data compression techniques will be utilized to avoid storing extremely large solution data sets in the iterative solvers, and new model order reduction techniques specifically designed for the optimal mixing problem will be developed to increase efficiency. The synthesis of optimal control and numerical approximation will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in many other complex and real-world flow dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are 6.7 million cerebral aneurysm patients and 2.5 million abdominal aortic aneurysm patients in the United States. Patients that suffer from aneurysms are likened to having a ticking timebomb that can set off at any second, causing death or morbidity due to excessive internal bleeding. Biomechanical and shape analyses from medical images can provide greater insight into how aneurysms progress with time. However, analyses of medical images are a significant bottleneck to a clinical workflow, reducing the translation of such tools into a clinical setting. The proposed technology can reduce the overall time to extract critical information from medical images, alleviating the need for computational experts to provide an artificial intelligence-based approach to striate patient risks. The ability to personalize medicine from various indices allows clinicians to import information or data points from stress and shape analyses that are typically inaccessible to non-experts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an aneurysm prognosis classifier that will be trained on small aneurysms, creating a robust risk score for clinicians to decide on costly surgical interventions. The approach will track changes to determine the shape of the aneurysm and biomechanical indices from various scans for a single patient at different time points, which will aid in determining the evolution of the aneurysm with time. A clinician would be able to decide on surgical intervention risk based on various factors rather than relying on the maximum diameter criterion and would be able to personalize patient healthcare management by reducing the surveillance intervals (whereby reducing overall costs of monitoring).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Smith Lab has designed small molecules that bind to a key protein involved in cell survival known as valosin-containing protein (VCP).  This project seeks to modulate the function of VCP with small molecules to provide a fundamental understanding of the etiology of different diseases and provide clues to their future treatment.  This project will be incorporated into a summer bridge program aimed at introducing incoming freshmen to research at Bowie State University, a Historically Black College & University (HCBU).  During the summer students will participate in lab rotations in the Smith and other collaborating labs in the Department of Natural Sciences at Bowie State.  These research experiences will demonstrate the importance of structure-function in small molecule-protein interactions through chemical synthesis, bioinformatics, biochemistry, and molecular biology projects.  In addition to research, the summer bridge program will introduce students to college-level biology, chemistry, bioinformatics, and physics. Given the robust research proposed and the nurturing environment of HBCUs, students participating in this program will have the skills and confidence to succeed in STEM. <br/> <br/>Valosin-containing protein is a hexameric ATPase which is key to protein degradation due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  Many downstream effects of VCP modulation have been identified including cell migration.  However current small molecules that target the ATPase activity of VCP are unselective. Allosteric binders have shown promise as alternatives to ATPase binders, however acquired resistance has been observed.  The Smith Lab has identified small molecules which bind to VCP through molecular docking.  These molecules have the potential to be tools to understand how VCP binding effects downstream processes such as cell migration through regulation of p53 and NF-KB.

Enterprises that lack the programming capabilities to perform these tasks well will become increasingly disadvantaged as smart contracts continue to proliferate. Ranging from simple Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that convey ownership to complex, self-executing agreements that automate future payments, smart contracts are at the heart of the commercial utility and perceived value of a blockchain. Growing numbers of financial institutions are seeking to advance their Web3 capabilities, even at premium prices. As algorithmic trading has demonstrated, automating analysis and execution can provide enormous commercial upside, yet it also can result in large losses if designed improperly or left unchecked. Pioneering a solution that enables enterprises without advanced programmers to reap the benefits of analyzing and writing smart contracts while managing the associated risks requires deep technology? specifically a novel visual programming language designed to manage big-data sets involving millions of smart contracts on public blockchains using simple no-code commands.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to build a unique blockchain application interface that will enable users to scan and read smart contracts and immediately leverage the extracted data to design, build, and test trading algorithms that incorporate digital assets. This interface will ultimately enable users to analyze and write smart contracts at scale without the need to code. The project will set the foundation for the inexpensive development of Web3 capabilities by thousands of enterprises that do not have access to advanced programmers. The project will also produce a computerized tool that does the following two key tasks:  1. continuously scan publicly-accessible smart contracts in real time, and 2.  derive indicators from these scanned contracts that likely are meaningful, initially for the purposes of analyzing and trading financial assets.

While connectivity forms the backbone in realizing SM, it has opened new cybersecurity risks and challenges, requiring a fundamental rethink and foundational efforts to tackle these challenges. Recent National Science Foundation-sponsored workshops have underscored a compelling need for a research infrastructure that can bridge the traditional divide between manufacturing and cybersecurity professionals and foster a community of CISE experts in manufacturing cybersecurity. Creating such an infrastructure is essential to understand the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and to develop solutions tailored to SM systems. This project envisions the creation of a vibrant CISE research community for data-driven cybersecurity for SM by launching a community research platform integrating three elements: (1) A web infrastructure that enables virtual ?playgrounds? to share data, codes, resources, and tools, mostly contributed by the research community? (2) a data infrastructure for curating diverse cybersecurity datasets? and (3) a SM machine infrastructure that will leverage established national resources, including the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform from the Department of Energy. Taken together, this infrastructure will help CISE researchers to collaborate with the SM community ?spanning academia, industry, and government? to create and share data for understanding the vulnerabilities of a network of SM machines and other components of a manufacturing enterprise, and facilitate the development of AI-driven cybersecurity innovations for SM. This infrastructure will enable CISE-relevant, data-driven research thrusts spanning five key SM system elements: (1) Cybersecurity by design; (2) compiler optimizations for SM process plans and toolpaths; (3) forensics and watermarking of SM machines; (4) protections against SM process-unique side-channels; and (5) fingerprinting and securing SM networks. The community will be able to contribute their SM equipment, relevant hardware and software components, data, and innovations to grow this networked cyber-physical platform infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Emerging manufacturing enterprises are increasingly adopting advanced sensor and AI technologies and transforming themselves into smart manufacturing systems. These smart systems can connect multiple manufacturers, designers, and businesses to efficiently meet customer demands. A SM network is noted by IBM as the largest target for cybersecurity attacks among all industry sectors. Securing such a network is a daunting task. This project aims to create an online resource consisting of web infrastructure, data, and machines to bring together professionals from the manufacturing and cybersecurity communities. This infrastructure will enhance collaborations among these communities to enable a deeper understanding of current and emerging cybersecurity threats to smart manufacturing environments and enable the development of innovations to assure cybersecurity within the smart manufacturing sector. It will particularly benefit diverse researchers, practitioners, and students from cybersecurity, AI, and manufacturing disciplines. For example, the project will leverage the Inclusive Engineering Consortium, a network of 20 Underrepresented Minority serving engineering colleges to enable broad-based impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generally, neurons are not born in their proper place, but must travel (migrate) long distances to find their final destination before they can carry out their essential functions. To get to their destination they need to adhere to the proper road (substrate) while being guided by external signals. Along their way they will also interact with different partners, like glial cells, that aid in the process of migration. This proposal is aimed at understanding how neurons interact with their environment to choose the proper road and find their final location focusing on the development of a brain region called the cerebellum, which is essential for movement coordination and precise movement execution. The experimental plan involves performing genetic experiments using the mouse, an extensively used mammalian development model, to investigate how a family of proteins with important roles in cell adhesion (Cas family) participates in the establishment of cerebellar circuits. The proposed studies will combine mouse genetics with novel imaging techniques to address how these proteins help neurons and glia interpret external signals during neural migration. It is anticipated that the results from these experiments will provide unique insights into neuronal circuit development and the etiology of certain neurodevelopmental disorders. The educational and outreach program will improve STEM-career recruitment and retention by promoting early exposure of high school and undergraduate students to hands-on research in neural development.<br/><br/>The simple laminar architecture and largely postnatal development of the cerebellum make it a highly tractable model for understanding the cellular mechanisms that direct neuronal migration and lamination. Migration and lamination provide a foundation upon which functional neural circuits can be assembled. During these early developmental events, neurons and radial glia actively interact with each other and the extracellular matrix (ECM). These processes involve the precise and timely regulation of adhesion and detachment of neural cells from their substrates. Preliminary in vivo loss-of-function studies identify Crk-Associated Substrate (Cas) adaptor proteins as central players in cerebellar development: Cas gene ablation results in severe lamination phenotypes. Cas proteins are known to act downstream of adhesion-signaling, and differential phosphorylation of Cas proteins regulates Integrin Adhesion Complex (IAC) dynamics. Thus, the study of Cas protein function provides a unique opportunity to understand how modulation of the attachment of cells to their substrates participates in cerebellar circuit formation. The driving hypothesis is that Cas adaptor proteins play essential roles during cerebellar lamination and foliation by regulating IAC remodeling. Task 1 uses Cas triple conditional knockouts to test the roles of Cas adaptor proteins during cerebellar development. Task 2 leverages these mouse models to investigate whether Cas genes participate in cerebellar lamination and foliation by acting neuronal-autonomously or glial-autonomously. Task 3 tests the hypothesis that regulation of Cas function controls key steps in cerebellar ontogeny by participating in IAC dynamics. The education plan will integrate the proposed experiments in coursework and hands-on undergraduate research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there are new TMS coils and devices in development for the treatment of disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), autism, stroke rehabilitation, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Locating the exact area of the brain that needs to be stimulated or determining the strength of the stimulation in different regions of the brain may be achieved through anatomically accurate brain phantoms. However, currently, there are no accurate brain phantoms that can be used for training and research in neuromodulation.  The proposed technology may enable higher efficacy of neuromodulation treatments by improving the precise targeting of the TMS coil and provide a way to train researchers in magnetic neuromodulation.  In addition, the proposed phantoms also may be modified to be used in focused ultrasound stimulation and concussion research.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a realistic anatomical model, or phantom, of humans and rats for neuromodulation training and research. The proposed technology mimics the electrical conductivity of different brain regions. The proposed phantoms may enable clinicians and researchers in the field of neuromodulation to conduct safety tests and verify whether a critical part of the brain has received the required stimulation field strength in a brain stimulation treatment procedure. In addition, the proposed technology also may enable better visualization of magnetic and electric field distribution in the brain. The phantoms are produced using 3-D printed shells for each tissue layer of the brain. Brain tissues are divided mainly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), grey matter (GM), ventricles, and cerebellum. These layers are made into shells, and following 3-D printing, they are filled with a conductive material prepared using a soft polymer that is mixed with varying concentrations of electrically conductive multi-walled carbon nanotubes.  The nanotubes impart electrical conductivity to different regions of the brain phantom. The phantom is then examined under different transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) parameters and compared with finite element analysis (FEM) modeling of induced electric and magnetic fields in the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rising injury and fatality rates in the United States for vulnerable road users is an area of societal concern, and contribute to public hesitancy to walk or bicycle more. These trends challenge ongoing efforts nationwide that aim to both make roads safer for all and reduce transportation sector emissions through a modal shift to increased walking, bicycling, and transit use. To date, data-driven solutions to address issues related to vulnerable road user safety often rely on official crash data, but these data cannot alone comprehensively represent the safety experiences of vulnerable road users. The ability to more broadly record near-miss events, and how their frequency and locations compare to officially reported crash data, is essential to informing safety-oriented transportation planning strategies. To address this topic, this project will integrate approaches and technological innovations from geography, traffic engineering, and urban planning, in partnership with community collaborators in greater Reno and Sparks, Nevada.<br/><br/>Recent advancement in classification techniques applied to data collected from Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR, sensors provides an ability to detect near-miss events involving vulnerable road users. This project will deploy a portable network of such sensors at locations throughout greater Reno and Sparks. Sensor locations will be informed by responses to a web-based survey distributed to those who frequently walk or bicycle in the community that will prompt them to identify specific locations of vulnerable road user safety concern. Data will be collected at these locations for one week. Emerging near-miss detection methods will be applied to the field-collected data, and frequency and type of near misses will be compared against official crash data. A community focus group will review near miss events detected by these sensors and provide feedback to improve event identification methods. A Geodesign workshop will produce a collaborative plan that will prioritize locations for future assessment of vulnerable road user safety, and identify potential countermeasures. These efforts will help guide ongoing efforts to integrate a sensor network that if effectively scaled, could improve the ability to detect near-miss events in real-time, which in turn can better inform planning efforts to improve road user safety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important to work on methods such as vaccines that can eliminate or reduce the chance of getting infected.  Infections begin when a viral particle sticks to the outer coating of a live cell and most vaccines and therapies work by trying to block the adhesion between the viral particle and the cell surface. It is, therefore, important to understand how virus particles infect our body?s cells. In this project, the investigators propose to study the mechanisms of virus-cell adhesion.  The approach is two-pronged.  First, computer model simulations of virus-cell adhesion will be developed and used to study two common features of virus/cell adhesion processes: (a) the role of spike-like adhesive protrusions on the virus or cell surface, and (b) the mechanism by which viruses penetrate through the protective cell surface coating: the Glycocalyx.  Second, the computer models will be validated by experimental measurements of adhesion. The multidisciplinary and collaborative nature of this research program will provide excellent educational and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The investigators will work with the Deputy Vice President for Equity and Community to seek under-represented minority candidates for graduate study through Lehigh?s institutional membership in the National GEM Consortium with its mission to enable underrepresented minority graduate students? education in STEM disciplines.  Via a long-standing partnership with the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown PA, the work will be communicated to the general public through the design of new learning activities for informal education about viruses, how they infect human cells, as well as how vaccines or therapies work. <br/> <br/>The goal of the project is to develop meso-scale coarse-grained (CG) models to study two common features of virus-cell adhesion processes: (1) the omnipresent glycocalyx that decorates the exterior surface of a cell membrane, and (2) spike-like protrusions either on the viral surface (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) or on the cell membrane (e.g., Ebola) that form flexible receptors and so mediate adhesion.  The CG approach is used to effectively optimize between the generality of highly abstracted continuum models and the specificity of highly detailed all-atom molecular simulations. Studies are designed to answer two related puzzling questions: (1) What is the role of the glycocalyx in mediating virus-cell adhesion?  Specifically, how does the virus reach the cell-membrane-bound receptors when the glycocalyx thickness is significantly larger than the virus size? and (2) What is the role of the physical properties of spike-like protrusions, such as their length and flexibility, and how do these affect adhesion?   Models will be validated and accompanied by experimental investigation of adhesion using AFM force spectroscopy and adhesion contact mechanics within the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts framework. The primary outcome will be a set of experimentally validated coarse-grained models that can be used to study and predict the effect of spike-like protrusions and glycocalyx properties on virus-cell adhesion.  Because these two elements occur in so many of the viruses that cause infections in humans, the results of the studies will have broad societal impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The updraft is an area of rapidly rising air that is transported aloft to form clouds and eventually precipitation. The updraft contributes to every hazard that a storm produces, notably large hail and tornadoes. Past work has provided evidence that larger storm updrafts produce stronger tornadoes and larger hail compared to storms with smaller updrafts. In addition, studies have hinted that storm updrafts that are vertically upright, as opposed to tilted, are also more likely to produce tornadoes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly observe and measure characteristics of the storm updraft. However, upgrades performed to the U.S. radar network have introduced new options to track features that serve as a proxy for the updraft. In this project, the researchers use the size and tilt of this radar feature as an estimate for those same characteristics in the updraft in more than 100 actual storm cases to better determine how closely linked updraft size and tilt are to tornado and hail occurrence. The researchers also will determine if the weather conditions feeding into the storm are linked to the size and tilt of the updraft. The project objectives ultimately aim to provide forecasters with new tools that may help them alert the public to storms that are about to produce strong tornadoes and/or very large hail.<br/><br/>The storm type being studied is the supercell thunderstorm, which generally produces the strongest tornadoes and largest hail. To estimate the size and tilt of supercell updrafts, the researchers use a novel algorithm that automates detection and area of a dual-pol radar signature, the ZDR column, which forms when an updraft lofts rain and small hail above the freezing level. Those data will be used in tandem with traditional radar analyses to identify links between updraft proxy characteristics, the near-storm environment, and hazard production in large numbers of supercell cases. Specifically, this project seeks to (i) determine a firm link between midlevel updraft area, low-level updraft area, and tornado and large hail occurrence, (ii) quantify the degree to which updraft vertical alignment is necessary for tornado production, (iii) the near-storm environmental controls, if they exist, on both updraft size and alignment, and (iv) combine the results from (i) and (ii) with data of another dual-pol radar signature, the ZDR-KDP separation vector, to optimize known predictors of tornado formation and peak tornado intensity for possible operational use. In addition, depending on project results, the ability to accurately assess these characteristics and their potential use in nowcasting of hazardous weather will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, scientists are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of the smaller majority of marine life that operate largely behind the scenes. Collectively referred to as cryptofauna this group includes parasites. Gnathiid isopods (gnathiids) are a group of parasites that are unique to marine environments and are found in all oceans and depths. By attaching to fish, extracting blood meals and then dropping off, gnathiids are the marine equivalent of ticks and mosquitos on land. Some even transmit blood parasites to fish just as ticks and mosquitos do to birds and mammals. This project focuses on the diversity of gnathiid isopods in coral reef systems, the most diverse ecological systems on the planet. The project is an international collaboration involving nearly all the active gnathiid researchers in the world who are making significant investments in the project, including helping to train US students. While there are hundreds of research teams worldwide who study ticks and mosquitos, only a handful of scientists study their marine equivalent ? gnathiid isopods. As a consequence, while there are likely hundreds of species of gnathiids, we only have identifications and names for a few. Identifying and characterizing gnathiids to species is important for the same reason that we need to know one tick or mosquito species from another ? even though they have certain similarities, there are important differences among them, such as what, if any diseases they may transmit. Given the similarity of gnathiid isopod-fish interactions to ticks and mosquito interactions with humans and other land animals, this study will provide the basis for understanding similarities and differences of host-parasite interactions and disease transmission in coral reef fish as compared to terrestrial systems. The project will contribute to educating and training the next generation of taxonomists and systematists, and will improve public understanding of coral reef biodiversity both in the US and abroad.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to: 1) Characterize gnathiid isopod diversity, biogeography, and key functional traits in tropical coral reef and adjacent ecosystems; 2) Generate DNA barcodes for as many species as possible and construct a molecular-based phylogeny; and 3) Provide student training in gnathiid isopod taxonomy and systematics. With an international group of collaborators that include field ecologists, taxonomists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, and museum specialists, we will use an integrative and interdisciplinary approach. We will sample from representative coral reef habitats using a variety of collecting techniques our team has developed over decades, and will use state of the art taxonomic, molecular, and bioinformatic techniques to describe and identify gnathiid species. Through this approach we will fill major gaps in biodiversity knowledge by: 1) Thorough and systematic sampling of regions characterized as evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered and therefore likely harboring unknown gathiid diversity; and 2) Providing information on the systematics, biogeography and genetic diversity of fish-parasitic gnathiid isopods that will enable major advances in our understanding of their phylogenetic relationships. By identifying patterns of host exploitation, and linking parasite life history stages, we will answer fundamental questions regarding ecological function of parasitic isopods and build capacity to address more sophisticated ecological and evolutionary questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to enable new algorithmic and software advancements, particularly in the field of numerical linear algebra, to fully utilize these new heterogeneous architectures. The primary goal of this project is to provide computational building blocks for scalable implementation of numerical linear algebra, which is an essential and often indispensable component of simulation software. Methods developed as a part of this project will help computational physicists and chemists to efficiently identify and study promising novel materials and enable high fidelity numerical simulations to address the challenges at the frontiers of science and engineering. The research program is integrated with education and outreach activities that aim to build the future science and engineering workforce and stimulate public engagement with mathematics. The project provides undergraduate and graduate students with advanced training in critical science and technology skills as well as opportunities for interdisciplinary research on applications of global importance. The investigator also aims to increase local engagement and participation through STEM-promoting public events, provide K-12 students with hands-on computational mathematics education, as well as include members of underrepresented groups and enable their professional success.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to further the understanding of a broad class of extrapolation and nonlinear convergence acceleration techniques and explore their ability to enhance and extend existing solvers to fully utilize distributed and heterogeneous computing environments. Convergence acceleration methods have been successfully used in science and engineering for decades, but their rigorous mathematical underpinnings are still not fully understood. Moreover, iterative methods for computations in eigenvalue problems and general nonlinear systems are one of the most important research areas in computational mathematics. The project has the following research objectives: (1) provide a systematic mathematical study of nonlinear acceleration techniques; (2) develop accelerated, possibly asynchronous, iterative algorithms to solve linear systems with potential similar to the well-established Krylov subspace methods; (3) enable efficient and reliable eigenvalue computations by developing accelerated (block) iterative (non)linear eigenvalue/eigenvector solvers; (4) develop and validate new numerical linear algebra tools to support algorithmic developments in computational physics and chemistry. All the methods under development are intended for application to a wide range of complex science and engineering simulations in exascale and distributed computing environments.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Computational Mathematics and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finding a way to kill the pathogenic bacteria without harming the beneficial microbes could prove a useful tool.  Phage research has emerged as an exciting new frontier in microbiology due to its role in shaping microbiomes and as a potential therapy against drug-resistant bacterial infections. Phages identify and interact with their specific bacterial target through a structure known as the receptor-binding protein. While characterization of thousands of natural phages have occurred, limited studies have explored the molecular mechanisms that govern phage-host interactions through the receptor-binding protein. This research will apply genome engineering, high-throughput DNA sequencing, and viral metagenomics approaches to elucidate how protein sequences encode function.  The research will be the basis for numerous viral-focused educational outreach activities, including for middle school classrooms, to expose the public to relevant, real-word issues in viral and bacterial biology.   <br/><br/>Receptor binding proteins mediate the interaction of a phage with its bacterial receptor(s) and thus constitute key determinants of a phage?s host range and activity (virulence). Phages exhibit high functional plasticity through genetic alterations of these proteins to adapt to new host environments.  Despite extensive research to address the mechanisms associated with this interaction, it remains unclear how receptor binding protein mutations influence phage activity and host range. This work will examine the molecular rules of receptor binding proteins of coliphages, viruses that infect coliform bacteria, and will seek to exploit those rules to engineer synthetic coliphages with specificity for foodborne pathogens. In addition, the project will study receptor binding proteins from another group of phages that have a more complex receptor binding architecture that permits the phage to both enzymatically degrade the capsule that protects certain bacteria and also to bind to host receptors. To understand this process mechanistically, mutational and metagenomic scanning will be used to map and identify the function of every sequence in the receptor binding protein of a phage with the dual capability. These mutational studies will inform protein design strategies guided by machine learning to engineer new phage-host interactions. The project has the potential to create tools that could be broadly adopted by the research community to study sequence-function relationships in a variety of phage-host systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semiconductors, such as silicon, gallium nitride, gallium arsenide and indium phosphide, form the backbone of today?s communication systems. For next-generation communication systems, however, multi-functional semiconductors are essentially required. Recently, ferroelectric ultrawide bandgap semiconductors have shown significantly enhanced electrical, piezoelectric, and linear and nonlinear optical properties compared to conventional semiconductors, which have made them one of the most promising materials for future communication devices. This project will facilitate forming a team of experts and establish research connections and industrial partnerships to enable the co-design of next-generation and beyond communication technologies. The planning phase focuses on seeding synergy and adding new researchers and external partners to the team to work toward three integrated thrusts, including co-design of materials and devices for ultrahigh speed communication technologies, epitaxy and heterogeneous integration, and co-design and demonstration of multifunctional energy-efficient devices. Success of this program will result in a multifunctional platform for the co-design of high-speed communication and quantum devices for future ultra-fast wireless and optical communication systems. The broader impacts also include the highly interdisciplinary nature of this project and outreach to undergraduates and K- 12 students through the appealing potential social impacts of the research.<br/><br/>The researchers in this team will explore high-speed semiconductor devices by addressing the energy efficiency and connectivity challenges from ultrahigh-speed operation to a far-future goal of light-wave electronics and quantum information technology. Their co-design starts from wide and ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors, including the newly discovered ferroelectric nitrides and grafting-based heterogeneous integration, to spur advances in multifunctional electronic, acoustic, photonic, light-wave electronics, and quantum devices for future high-speed communication systems. The outcomes will ultimately include significantly improved RF power density, bandwidth, reduced power consumption of operation, enhanced<br/>security, and possibilities to tap into quantum information with semiconductor technology. Team members from seven universities and four industrial partners, bring together expertise ranging from materials discovery, predictive theory for design, and state-of-the-art epitaxy/characterization to a broad range of emerging technologies. The team will ultimately focus on creating communication devices that reach 10-times higher speeds in a decade and potentially connect with emerging quantum and light-wave electronic components to revolutionize sensitivity and speed, respectively.

It is important to identify similarities that occur across diverse learning contexts because such similarities provide evidence for the evolutionary basis of language - what makes humans (but not other animals) capable of learning human languages. And yet diversity among languages and cultures implies that human infants must considerably adapt their language behaviors to their home environments. This CAREER project investigates how consistencies in learning are flexibly adapted in context by examining early word learning in two unrelated languages. The findings contribute to the development of detailed theories of child language learning that apply to children from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds in educational and clinical settings. The project advances the training of the next generation of scholars to conduct comparative cross-linguistic research and creates educational resources for use by the community and the general public.<br/><br/>Across multiple languages, children?s first words are more likely to refer to objects than actions, a cross-linguistic similarity that is colloquially called the ?noun bias?. This project investigates the source and strength of this bias across a highly noun-centric language and culture and a more verb-centric language and culture. The results shed light on what experiences make children more or less likely to focus on nouns and noun-like words during early development. On the one hand, a language itself can be structured in a way that points children?s attention to nouns. On the other hand, the ways that adults communicate with children may also point their attention to nouns. By using a comparative cross-linguistic approach that includes spontaneous conversation, eye tracking, and tests of new word learning, this research pinpoints the nature of the noun bias and deepens understanding of how it is adapted for the specific language and culture of a child?s home environment. The findings yield insight into a key part of the evolutionary basis for language: how children are biased to understand and label the world around them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The MFO is a leading international mathematical research center in Germany with annually nearly 3,000 international scientific visitors who are leading experts in a field of research in mathematics and its applications. Participation of junior scientists from the United States in these activities will allow them to benefit at an early stage of their career from opportunities to meet and network with top senior scientists from all over the world. They can present their own results, either in talks or in poster sessions, can learn new methods and results from the other participants and can take part in the numerous and scientifically very profitable public and private discussions. As the MFO is solely devoted to research, workshop participation enables interactions during the whole week, fostering new approaches and fast progress on a broad range of research topics in mathematics and adjacent disciplines in science and technology.<br/><br/>The MFO runs its week-long scientific activities in 4 central programs: The Oberwolfach Workshops, the Mini-Workshops, the Arbeitsgemeinschaften, and the Oberwolfach Seminars. The main scientific program is the Oberwolfach Workshop program which consists of about 40 research workshops per year, each with about 50 participants and organized by internationally leading experts. The Mini-Workshop program offers 12 mini-workshops per year, each with about 15 participants, and allows more focused meetings than the workshops. The purpose of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft (?Study Group?, 3 times per year) for junior as well as for senior researchers is to learn about a new active topic outside their current area of research by giving a lecture on it. The 6 Oberwolfach Seminars are schools organised by leading experts in the field and address PhD students and postdocs from all over the world.

As marine heatwaves associated with ocean warming become increasingly frequent, it is urgent to understand if and how reef-building corals will be able to respond to these repeat stress events and thus survive in a rapidly warming ocean. To address this problem, this project is investigating how corals on the reef respond to recurring marine heatwaves in order to identify if repeat exposure to heat stress promotes coral tolerance of higher temperatures via acclimatization or instead leads to the accumulation of stress and thus reduced performance and survival following future stress. The results of this study are critical for understanding how the current generation of corals will respond to increasingly warmer oceans, and whether acclimatization will buy enough individuals sufficient time for adaptation to occur and promote coral persistence into the future. In addition, this project is training students from secondary schools through advanced postdoctoral researchers in global change biology and ecology. Specifically, the investigators are increasing access to research opportunities for undergraduate students by developing a new hands-on course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in Global Ocean Change Biology that will reach hundreds of students per year. Outreach efforts include creation of hands-on coral reefs and climate change activities for incoming first-generation, low-income undergraduate students and a professional development program to train middle and high-school teachers to deploy these climate change activities in their classrooms in the Philadelphia Public School District. <br/><br/>Acclimatization following exposure to sub-lethal heat stress may be an important protective mechanism for corals to survive a changing climate. However, the role of environmental memory of marine heatwaves in driving acclimatization or, conversely, stress accumulation and sensitization of reef-building corals is not well understood. This study is addressing this question using a combination of in situ and mesocosm experiments to assess the cellular, organismal, and ecological consequences of repeat heatwaves on corals with contrasting bleaching histories. Specifically, the researchers are monitoring adjacent conspecific pairs of bleaching-susceptible and bleaching-resistant individuals of two reef-building coral species in Hawaii, Montipora capitata and Porites compressa. These corals have been monitored for over 7 years through multiple bleaching events and are being used to test the hypothesis that environmental memory of marine heatwaves differentially alters coral thermal performance due to phenotypic variation in acclimatization ability within and between species. This work is identifying whether the bleaching thresholds of corals with different bleaching histories varies through time, and the consequences of these phenotypes on coral calcification, survival, and population size structure are being assessed using a combination of benthic surveys, photogrammetry, and in situ growth measurements. The influence of environmental memory of heatwaves on coral physiology is being assessed using thermal performance curves to determine how the thermal optima of respiration, photosynthesis, calcification, and host intracellular pH change (or not) over time (e.g. ambient vs. heatwave years) and if that response differs between corals with contrasting bleaching phenotypes. Finally, the contribution of algal endosymbionts to acclimatization is being evaluated by exposing corals to a range of increasing temperatures in experimental mesocosms, potentially uncovering differences in the degree of acclimatization or sensitization for host vs. symbiont traits in corals with high fidelity (P. compressa) vs. cosmopolitan (M. capitata) symbiont associations. By understanding of the phenotypic diversity in thermal performance across biological scales, this research improves predictions of coral persistence in the face of the ongoing climate crisis.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Biological Oceanography, Integrative Ecological Physiology, and Ocean Education Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern devices, including cell phones, laptops, and electric vehicles contain high-powered semiconductor components which generate unwanted heat that, in turn, reduces their efficiency. If left unchecked, this heat may destroy the devices and even injure users or cause damage to the environment. This project addresses excessing heating in electronic devices by introducing new high-performance thermal interface materials based upon embedding liquid metal droplets inside of stretchable polymers. These so-called liquid metal embedded elastomer (LMEE) materials can be applied to computer processors, graphics cards, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and even power modules in electric vehicles, to help keep electronic devices operating at peak performance at all times. The growing prevalence of the Internet of Things, 5G network infrastructure, and electric cars all necessitate better thermal solutions so that devices can function properly. This project could contribute to the semiconductor, automotive, and healthcare industries.<br/><br/>This project?s goal is to develop and commercialize a thermal interface material (TIM) for packaged microelectronics, building upon the LMEE composite architecture.  The technology will outperform existing TTIMs by combining the superior thermal resistance of metal-based solid TIMs (S-TIMs) with the mechanical reliability of polymer-based TIMs and the high-volume manufacturing compatibility of thermal greases.  Specifically, LMEEs possess a unique combination of metal-like thermal resistance, rubber-like elasticity, and liquid emulsion-like rheology prior to curing, thereby solving two main challenges present with existing S-TIMs: (i) poor mechanical reliability over long durations and (ii) incompatibility with syringe-based dispensing for high volume manufacturing.  The strategy proposed in this project is to synthesize an LMEE-based TIM that forms a robust bond between the surfaces of the semiconductor chip and surrounding enclosure, maintains a controlled thickness between the chip and enclosure, and ensures the necessary rheology for syringe-based dispensing.  Specific project tasks build around a comprehensive technical plan that includes materials synthesis, performance characterization, and in-package evaluation.  In parallel, the project will examine methods for storage, shipment, and dispensing to ensure a product that is ready for integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor assembly and testing industry by the end of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Selective labeling of proteins is important to the elucidation of their mechanisms, understanding of their functions, and improvement in the properties of therapeutic proteins such as prolonged circulation time, reduced immunogenicity, and/or better proteolytic stability. The research group of Professor Yan Zhao at Iowa State University develops antibody-mimicking polymeric nanoparticles to recognize specific parts of proteins and deliver fluorescent tags, affinity labels, or polymeric reagents  precisely to the targeted sites. These site-specifically labeled proteins are useful in many applications including biological studies of protein functions, tracing proteins in their cellular fates, and purification of proteins. These nanoparticles are inexpensive, robust synthetic materials that do not denature as fragile biomolecules and can be produced in large quantities without using live animals. They have the potential to replace antibodies under many research and biotechnology settings. The multidisciplinary research helps trains student researchers into professional scientists by exposing them to a wide range of skills in biomaterials science, biology, physical organic chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and polymer chemistry.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Proteins rarely work alone in their biological functions but are regulated through post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein?protein interactions (PPIs), and other mechanisms. Mapping out these PTMs and PPIs is key to fundamental biology and drug development, and frequently requires selective modification of proteins, as well as selective protein-binding materials. The latter is also useful for a range of other purposes including protein purification, detection, and replacement of antibodies in certain applications. This project, funded by the Biomaterials Program of the Materials Research Division, supports Professor Yan Zhao of Iowa State University to develop antibody-mimicking polymeric nanoparticles that to bind proteins with high affinity and specificity. Aim 1 focuses on the site-specific labeling of protein with a single or multiple tags. Aim 2 focuses on the development nanoparticle receptors to bind surface groups of proteins. These materials are prepared through molecular imprinting within cross-linked surfactant micelles. They are expected to impact multiple research fields including fundamental biochemistry and cell biology, biotechnology, and protein therapeutics. The education and outreach activities center on participation in on- and off-campus programs to engage undergraduate research and increase STEM exposure to K?12 students. In addition, the PI uses several methods to familiarize students with patents and the patenting process and to better prepare them for industrial careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when a user visits an online retailer, the products shown are selected by a recommender system designed to help one find things to buy and to increase the vendors sales. Recommender systems are also behind most online news sources, and they can shape which news people see. Given the importance of recommender systems to individual choice, it is critical for researchers to be able to carry out studies to evaluate different designs and their impact on the users of the system. But conducting such studies is beyond the resources of most researchers. To get meaningful results requires building and sustaining a community of willing users who have given their permission to be studied.  As a result, the amount of experimental research ? and specifically experimental research on long-term users of a system ? has plummeted. Almost all such studies are conducted by commercial recommendation platforms and their results are rarely made known to the public. This project is designed to develop a shared news recommender system specifically to enable researchers nationwide to be able to carry out experiments and learn just how different algorithms and interfaces affect users. This should create the knowledge that will allow the community to fully understand the impact of these systems and design new recommender systems that can enhance fairness and equity. When complete, this research infrastructure will support researchers in answering critical questions about how complex and often opaque recommender systems affect user behavior and to test new systems that can improve these systems and their outcomes.<br/><br/>This community-centered project will design and build an experimental news recommender community infrastructure to support research in personalization and recommender systems, AI and machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, social computing, and other fields that would benefit from the ability to carry out online field experiments with long-term users of a system.  The cloud-based software infrastructure includes a pluggable recommendation architecture in which researchers can deploy custom algorithms and interfaces, a feed of news articles starting with those obtained through a partnership with the Associated Press, experiment-support modules including consent, payment, and surveying of subjects, and support for two news interfaces?first a news digest and then a progressive web news browser.  The infrastructure will maintain a set of long-term consented users, provide extensive support to researchers including overarching IRB protocols, training, sample experiments, datasets and metrics, and live support through a researcher support team.  It will be governed by a community advisory board drawn from the researcher community with representatives of the content providers and end-users and charged with allocating experiment slots and steering the development and management of the infrastructure.  By developing and deploying this research infrastructure, the investigators seek to empower individuals and small groups to study important questions in recommender systems, including questions about how different algorithms and interfaces can alter the diversity of sources and viewpoints represented and provide users with greater understanding and control over the content they explore.  The investigators come from five institutions spread across the country and will in turn assemble and train a diverse team to take on this technically challenging and important work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, as they infect a cell, biological viruses pass through and are enveloped by a deformable cellular membrane. However, observing the formation of closed capsules in conventional materials such as cellular membranes is highly challenging. The reason is that such highly dynamical processes occur on very fast time scales and nanometer length scales that are not easily visualized with even the most powerful microscopes. Colloidal membranes provide a model experimental system that shares many common characteristics with cellular membranes, yet are about a thousand times larger and thus easier to study. Combining the unique features of colloidal membranes with state-of-the-art optical microscopy will allow for visualizing the process of vesicle formation in real time with molecular-level resolution. Furthermore, using the same technique will reveal how a closed colloidal vesicle falls apart through a cascading process of repeating nucleation of transient pores and their subsequent self-healing. Chemical crosslinking of colloidal vesicles provides a unique opportunity to create a porous membrane that can be used for size-selective filtration and targeted delivery of various nanosized cargoes. The experimental efforts will be integrated with rigorous training and mentoring in interdisciplinary biomaterial sciences to graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also encourage underrepresented groups to pursue work in STEM-related fields by providing them with research opportunities and will raise general awareness of the importance of scientific research to broader communities.<br/> <br/>Technical description <br/>Colloidal membranes are liquid-like monolayers that spontaneously assemble from one-micron-long filamentous viruses of uniform length. The continuum deformations of both colloidal monolayer and lipid bilayers are described by the same class of continuum elastic models proposed by Helfrich. Thus, colloidal membranes provide a unique opportunity to elucidate the universal behaviors of all membrane-based materials. Ultra-fast three-dimensional confocal microscopy and dielectric tensor tomography will reveal the dynamical processes by which colloidal membranes undergo gravity-assisted formation of elongated tethers and their subsequent fracture that leads to the formation of closed colloidal vesicles. Furthermore, the same techniques will visualize with molecular-level detail the kinetic pathways by which transient pores nucleate in over-pressurized vesicles.  Once nucleated the measurements will quantify the hydrodynamic flows through the pore that leads to their resealing. Below the lower critical size colloidal membranes become unstable and undergo a dramatic topological transition into flat disk-like structures. The porous structure of colloidal membranes and vesicles is determined by the osmotic pressure and the ionic strength. Thus, it provides a unique opportunity to create a powerful experimental platform for the stimuli-dependent and size-selective delivery of nanosized cargoes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, proteins do not operate in isolation and often form molecular machines in which several proteins bind together and with other biomolecules to act as a single entity called a molecular complex. This provides tremendous versatility and regulatory capacities, since by changing a single component of the complex, its function can be dramatically altered. Protein complexes often also form more stable structures than isolated proteins, and their formation creates new active sites as protein chains from different molecules assemble in close proximity. It is therefore of crucial importance to know the composition of complexes and study them as discrete functional entities in order to truly understand how cellular processes work.

These predictions of complexes will be validated against other experimental data and, where possible, also against literature evidence. We will also use large scale studies of protein expression in different cell types, tissues, and conditions to validate the predicted complexes and to differentiate between variants of complexes formed in different conditions. Complexes predicted to exist at high confidence will be made available through the Complex Portal website, properly identified as computationally inferred data, where they will both guide the work of Complex Portal curators and dramatically increase the amount of complexes available for researchers as reference entities.

In those hidden and anonymous environments, cyber criminals discuss how to 1) identify software vulnerabilities, 2) create or purchase exploits, 3) choose a target and recruit collaborators, 4) obtain access to the infrastructure needed, and 5) plan and execute the attack. Although this behavior helps hackers to produce a huge amount of malware, it also provides valuable intelligence for defenders, as the information shared online can be leveraged as precursors to various types of cyber threats. By relying on proactive cyber-threat intelligence analysis, this project addresses the following key research question: can emerging cyber-threats be accurately and aforesaid predicted? With continuous retrieval and analysis of hacker communication, this research will shed light on the assets, capabilities, behaviors, and interests of malicious hackers that can be leveraged for establishing cyber threat prediction.<br/><br/>To accomplish that, two finer-grained problems are being investigated. These investigations constitute the project?s novelties and are key factors for the design of better cyber-defense systems. First, the prediction of software vulnerability exploitation is conducted through classification techniques that correlate hackers' digital traces on hacker forums and marketplaces, and security advisories with real- world hacking attempts. The positive predictions (i.e., it will be exploited) are then ranked for patch prioritization, overcoming two current shortcomings not addressed by machine learning work in this domain: 1) the lack of differentiation of the predicted exploitation and 2) the lack of time interval for predictions. Second, the anticipation of malicious information cascades that might propagate to viral proportions is also performed. Here, classification techniques leveraging social network analysis are used to extract hacker topological information and to estimate social influence, predicting which techniques, strategies, or exploits included in hacking forums might be widely adopted in the near future. Both project efforts will lead to new techniques to predict cyber threats that are time sensitive, giving defenders a better chance in the fight against attackers. The project deliverables, data and models, will be disseminated through the security community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It can be challenging to disentangle the relationship between energetic costs and benefits of care provided by multiple individuals, and the study of this question can benefit from the examination of other species with similar forms of cooperative infant care. The simplest form, where infants receive care from only their mother and father, is called biparental care. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project measures energy expenditure related to infant care in primate species with biparental cooperative infant care. Behavioral data, movement data, and metabolic measurements of energy use during infant care are combined from wild and captive populations to investigate how these monkeys distribute the energetic costs of childcare responsibilities. The project supports long-term research and scientists at a field station and produces short bilingual videos to disseminate results.<br/><br/>To quantify the relative investment of male and female parents in the care of their infants, this research combines behavioral data from both coppery titi monkeys with activity and energetics data. Coppery titi monkey mothers and fathers each specialize in some caring tasks: mothers nurse and fathers carry the infant. However, the extent of sex-based specialization for other caring behaviors, such as grooming and tolerated food theft remains unknown as does the energetic burden of these behaviors and any compensatory changes in the parents? activity. Activity data will be collected throughout the entire period of infant care , andallows inferences about the energetic investment parents make during infant care to be made on both behavioral and physiological bases since the measures of energy use will be in the context of behavior and activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fundamental research program aims to create biomaterials that combine this dynamic reconstruction capacity with the extraordinarily precise organization of a crystal. Specifically, this project will use crystals composed of engineered protein, DNA, and RNA building blocks. The designed crystals will have pores large enough to permit the infiltration or controlled release of protein and nucleic acid components. Ideally, the resulting living materials will allow active addition or substitution of molecular building blocks. To unlock a variety of practical material science applications, scaffold crystals made out of biomolecules must be fortified after self-assembly. Therefore, one aspect of the project is the optimization of methods for adding bonds throughout the crystals and the quantification of the resulting stability increases. Precise control of the 3-D position of functional molecules within a scaffold crystal opens the door for materials with unprecedented performance for diverse additional applications including biosensing, catalysis, energy conversion, biomedicine, and biotechnology. For example, porous co-crystals that anchor, protect, and release functional RNAs will have applications in therapeutic RNA delivery. To partially explore these applications, the team will provide mentorship and funding for 3 years of undergraduate-led biomolecular design teams (2023, 2024, and 2025). Inspiring and training the next generation of students to innovate at the biomaterials design frontier will directly accelerate the pace of discovery, to the benefit of the scientific community and the nation.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This research program will develop a new class of crystalline biomaterials composed of both protein and DNA building blocks, with solvent channels large enough to permit intra-crystal transport of macromolecules. The limits of co-crystal expansion modularity will be tested through assembly trials with struts composed of dsRNA, hybrid RNA:DNA, and a mixture of varying dsDNA blocks. This project explores ""living"" materials with actively replaceable molecular components. Confocal microscopy will be used to track the incorporation of fluorescent building blocks, as well as the site-specific capture of functional RNA added after crystal growth. Engineered co-crystals will be stabilized via chemical ligation and disulfide-based protein polymerization. Crystal stability when challenged with high temperature will be quantified via microscopy, spectroscopy, and nanopore sequencing. To demonstrate biomolecular infiltration and substitution, ligase and endonuclease domains will be diffused into the crystal interior to verify that enzymatic ligation stabilizes the crystals, but subsequent nuclease attack reverses stabilization via controlled crystal demolition. This project will then determine if endonuclease and ligase can work together to gradually excise and substitute scaffold crystal components. This project establishes a foundation for subsequent applied research. For example, porous co-crystals that anchor, protect, and release functional RNAs will have applications in therapeutic RNA delivery. Education and outreach activities associated with this project include support for a semi-autonomous undergraduate research organization, REU students, underrepresented students, first-generation college students, and high school interns. This education plan is intertwined with the research plan since a large team of mentees is critical to pursue, in parallel, the large number of proposed biomolecular crystal variants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when a user visits an online retailer, the products shown are selected by a recommender system designed to help one find things to buy and to increase the vendors sales. Recommender systems are also behind most online news sources, and they can shape which news people see. Given the importance of recommender systems to individual choice, it is critical for researchers to be able to carry out studies to evaluate different designs and their impact on the users of the system. But conducting such studies is beyond the resources of most researchers. To get meaningful results requires building and sustaining a community of willing users who have given their permission to be studied.  As a result, the amount of experimental research ? and specifically experimental research on long-term users of a system ? has plummeted. Almost all such studies are conducted by commercial recommendation platforms and their results are rarely made known to the public. This project is designed to develop a shared news recommender system specifically to enable researchers nationwide to be able to carry out experiments and learn just how different algorithms and interfaces affect users. This should create the knowledge that will allow the community to fully understand the impact of these systems and design new recommender systems that can enhance fairness and equity. When complete, this research infrastructure will support researchers in answering critical questions about how complex and often opaque recommender systems affect user behavior and to test new systems that can improve these systems and their outcomes.<br/><br/>This community-centered project will design and build an experimental news recommender community infrastructure to support research in personalization and recommender systems, AI and machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, social computing, and other fields that would benefit from the ability to carry out online field experiments with long-term users of a system.  The cloud-based software infrastructure includes a pluggable recommendation architecture in which researchers can deploy custom algorithms and interfaces, a feed of news articles starting with those obtained through a partnership with the Associated Press, experiment-support modules including consent, payment, and surveying of subjects, and support for two news interfaces?first a news digest and then a progressive web news browser.  The infrastructure will maintain a set of long-term consented users, provide extensive support to researchers including overarching IRB protocols, training, sample experiments, datasets and metrics, and live support through a researcher support team.  It will be governed by a community advisory board drawn from the researcher community with representatives of the content providers and end-users and charged with allocating experiment slots and steering the development and management of the infrastructure.  By developing and deploying this research infrastructure, the investigators seek to empower individuals and small groups to study important questions in recommender systems, including questions about how different algorithms and interfaces can alter the diversity of sources and viewpoints represented and provide users with greater understanding and control over the content they explore.  The investigators come from five institutions spread across the country and will in turn assemble and train a diverse team to take on this technically challenging and important work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the majority of livestock are reared in concentrated animal feeding operations causing environmental, public health, and food security concerns. An emerging option is to replace conventionally produced meat with meat-like tissues grown in the lab (i.e., cultured meat). Cultured meat can help to reduce the environmental, public health, and food security issues posed by commercial farming. However, major scientific, technological, and educational barriers related to consumer acceptance must be overcome. Developing cultured meat products (i.e., ground meat and/or steaks) that have the texture, flavor, and familiarity of conventional meat products will be critical to consumer acceptance. Current cultured meat technologies are expensive and have focused on ground meat products that do not re-create the three-dimensional (3D) tissue structures of animal steaks, especially with regards to the distribution of fat in these tissues. Therefore, the goal of this CAREER project is to establish a fundamental understanding of the biological dynamics of fat accumulation in muscle and develop 3D bioprinting techniques and parameters to create cultured meat products that match the properties and structures of conventional meats.  3D bioprinting would add minimal production costs while significantly increasing the price point of the final cultured product, improving the financial viability of the industry. In parallel, this proposal seeks to engage in educational and public outreach activities to increase consumer awareness of the current animal protein supply chain?s critical weaknesses and the biomedical engineering solutions to relieve these, drive consumer acceptance, and grow the cellular agriculture research community.  <br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goals involve 3D printing of biological tissues, mechanistic studies of disease processes, and regenerative medicine.  Towards this goal, this CAREER project seeks to enhance consumer acceptance and palatability of cultured meats by accurately reproducing the texture, properties, and costs associated with conventional meat products.  The Research Plan is organized under two objectives: (1) Obtain a fundamental understanding of intramuscular fat accumulation and (2) Print viable, lipid-laden adipocytes alone and into the intramuscular space.  These objectives will provide an open-source foundation for the cultured meat industry and future work in human disease modelling, regenerative medicine, and reconstructive medicine. The proposed studies will (1) develop conditions for co-culturing mature adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells that have not been achieved or reported, (2) make significant contributions to creating new models of biological mechanisms for intramuscular fat accumulation, and (3) establish parameters for the 3D bioprinting of tissues that contain both lipid-laden adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells. These 3D printed tissues should be mechanically and compositionally similar to their biological counterparts and will significantly improve the fundamental research and application-driven capabilities of technical personnel in cellular agriculture and biomedical engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current chemical sunscreen ingredients raise health concerns for consumers.  Additionally, some ingredients are banned for causing potential damage to coral reef ecosystems. Consumers increasingly want products that are safe for them and for the planet, and that are aesthetically pleasing. This project will explore ways to meet the growing demand for better sunscreen ingredients that are produced sustainably.  This team will investigate methods to cost-effectively extract naturally-occurring materials from photosynthetic bacteria that can replace current chemical and mineral sunscreen active ingredients.  These will also replace a significant portion of the UV filter ingredients. Sunscreens and other related products that might use these naturally occurring, safe, and effective ingredients will help people reduce UV damage to their skin and help reduce skin cancer (including deadly melanoma) and ameliorate skin aging. The project supports the US economy by creating jobs in the algae biotechnology field and in the cosmetic industry including testing, manufacturing, distribution, and sales. <br/><br/><br/>The technical innovation at the core of this proposal is to improve the yield and reduce the cost of extracting mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from a complex mixture of compounds contained within cyanobacterial cells (or other MAA producing organisms). Small volumes of MAAs are currently obtained using expensive and hazardous solvents and expensive equipment. The innovation is focused on the use of synthetic nucleotides (aptamers) to selectively bind to the MAAs and purify them from a cell lysate. Mycosporine-like amino acids arose on early Earth to protect microbes from harmful UV radiation. Their prevalence and longevity substantiate their value in protecting cells from UV radiation and other forms of oxidative stress. Their presence in the Earth?s oceans for millennia speaks to their safety in marine ecosystems and suggests their safety for use on human skin; Safety will be verified using standard pre-clinical tests. Technical hurdles include the isolation and identification of the specific MAAs produced, identifying aptamers that are highly specific for the MAAs produced, determining MAA yield from several purification processes and assessing process scalability. These data will be compared to other isolation techniques (filtration and chromatography) to assess comparative yields and economic performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Workshop will be held in Arolla, Switzerland in June 2023 and involve 20-30 attendees. Meiotic drive is a phenomenon that occurs across most eukaryotic groups of organisms (mammals, plants, insects, fungi, nematodes). Instead of gametogenesis resulting in equal representation in the gametes, gametogenesis in a meiotic drive system results in mostly one of the two homologous chromosomes. Thus, meiotic drive loci cheat normal Mendelian segregation which aids their spread through populations. Meiotic drive has several potential evolutionary consequences, but it also leaves a profound signature on the genomes of species with drivers. The enormous amount of genomic data now available for meiotic drive system will facilitate a synthetic review of the genomic consequences of meiotic drive. <br/><br/>Our approach is to bring researchers together to present their work on genomic consequences of meiotic drive, then brainstorm and draft a review article that synthesizes the field. This model follows two prior reviews on different aspects of meiotic drive published in 2016 and 2020. Our work will provide a comprehensive overview of the field for both specialists in meiotic drive and those who need to consider meiotic drive as a tangent to their own research questions. This work will be impactful to the genetics/genomics community as a whole. The workshop is also designed to elevate the research of newcomers to this field.

In recent years, physical and mechanical systems that contain more than two entities have become common in applications. Some examples include fuel mixing in a deforming engine chamber, wind and ocean waves impacting on offshore wind power generation systems, and heart blood flow simulations. Although there are many numerical methods that can be used individually, most do not work well with each other for solving challenges in these more complex situations. To this end, this project aims at developing a computational framework and software suite for the high-fidelity simulation of multi-material flows. Upon completion, this project will provide a powerful tool for studying the coupling between multi-material fluids and any number of structures. The project also involves collaboration in two related subjects ? a computational method to capture under-resolved structural boundaries in fluid-structure interaction problems and a machine-learning based reduced order modeling of embedded flow computations to realize real-time flow predictions in complex environments. In carrying out the project, the PI will train two graduate students. In addition, the PI will improve two graduate courses for a new PhD program in Data Science at The University of Texas at El Paso to better prepare a majority Hispanic student body to solve data and computing related challenges. Furthermore, the project involves the organization of a new annual one-day workshop to promote a STEM-related career among young students from underrepresented groups and low-income families in the Borderplex region.<br/><br/>The major component of the project is an efficient and reliable embedded boundary method on moving computational grids, called the ALE-EBM method. Traditionally, the interface between fluids and structures are tracked by mesh points and it necessarily causes the grid to move, a strategy commonly known as the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian or ALE methods, whereas the interface between two fluids are usually captured implicitly by various embedded boundary methods (EBM), due to its large deformation or topological changes. The two strategies, however, cannot be combined per se to enable computation of multi-fluid/structure interaction problems or multi-material shock hydrodynamics, as existing EBMs rely heavily on the assumption of a fixed grid. The new ALE-EBM method attempts to fill this gap by providing a proved methodology to perform embedded boundary computations on a computational grid that is allowed to move freely. In particular, the project includes: (1) analyzing multi-material Riemann problems to enforce various transmission conditions between materials while maintaining the physical relevance of the numerical solutions, (2) utilizing multiple level sets to capture the motion of multiple fluid sub-domains while preserving the signed distance meaning of each level set and conserving the mass of each fluid, (3) using a Nitsche-type method to capture adjacent structural boundary with a much smaller physical scale, and (4) a machine learning approach to achieve efficient reduced-order modeling computations of these problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ZEV transition is the primary solution to the decarbonization of the transportation sector, which is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the US. The project focuses on transit agencies, with the ultimate goal of lowering both operating costs and capital costs of their ZEV fleets. Coupled with the current funding support by federal, state and local governments to transit agencies to purchase ZEVs, this project could accelerate the decarbonization of the US transit fleet. A 50% transition of the US transit fleet to ZEVs will reduce nearly 200 million metric tons of carbom dioxide (CO2) equivalent, providing cleaner air quality and reducing urban noise pollution, particularly in low-income communities that rely more heavily on transit services for their transportation needs. The addressable market of Transportation Management Systems will grow from $8.8 billion in 2020 to $27.48 billion in 2028. Demonstrating success in the transit segment will enable the replication of this approach to other fleet segments like school bus fleets, last-mile and mid-mile delivery fleets, and long-haul trucking fleets. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is the design and implementation of an artificial intelligence software platform to automatically learn predictive vehicle models of transit ZEVs and provide recommendation services to transit agencies. The Phase II project has three integrated goals.  The first goal is the development of energy prediction algorithms which are scalable and highly accurate. Transit ZEV fleets have stochastic load changes, high sensitivity to operator driving style and high variation of battery size, weight and driving range, even for similar vehicles. These challenges will be addressed by developing automated learning techniques built on algorithms developed in Phase I, which use contextualized data from ZEV stops and trips. The second goal is to validate the prediction accuracy via pilots with ZEV fleets providing scheduled bus services.  The final goal is development of real-time, scalable, fleet optimization algorithms which optimize daily assignment and charge management of ZEV fleets. Chance-constrained optimization will be merged with predictive control theory to address scalability and real-time performance of the resulting optimization algorithms. These recommendations will, if successful, demonstrate highly accurate predictions of charge usage, a substantial increase in ZEV fleet utilization, and a reduction of transit ZEV fleet operating costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its variability is particularly significant because it plays a vital role in global ocean circulation and climate. Even though ITF has been measured the last three decades, no detailed measurements of full depth variability have been done nor has its impacts on mixing and upwelling along the eastern tropical Indian Ocean been investigated. This absence of data represents a significant gap in our understanding of the role of this shallow choke point in regulating the Pacific-Indian Ocean exchange, air-sea interactions, and water-mass transformation in the chokepoint of the shallow Meridional Ocean Circulation.

Differential privacy is a promising framework for protecting individual privacy, but deploying it in practice remains a challenge. Bugs in differential privacy systems are difficult to find, and can result in unexpected privacy failures. In addition, such systems often require collecting sensitive data on central servers; a compromise of these servers could result in a catastrophic loss of privacy. This project aims to develop tools for addressing both challenges. The project's novelties are: (a) new techniques for verifying that programs correctly implement differential privacy, and (b) new applications of cryptography to protect the security of data during processing. The project's broader significance and importance lies in its potential to enable the broader deployment of correct, secure implementations of formal privacy guarantees for individuals in data processing systems.<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to enable the construction of correct, scalable systems that satisfy differential privacy without the need for a trusted data curator. To this end, the project aims to design both new secure protocols and new techniques for ensuring the correctness of systems built with those protocols. Specific research goals of the project include (1) the design of new secure protocols that leverage properties of differential privacy to increase performance and scale to millions of participants; (2) new tools for evaluating these protocols at scale; (3) new automated program analyses for verifying the correctness of secure protocols; and (4) new program analyses and automated testing approaches for checking the correctness of differentially private systems built on secure protocols.

These weather extremes are closely related to the location and intensity of midlatitude jet streams, which blow from west to east and often shift to the north and south. As Earth?s climate gets warmer, the jet streams are affected by the tug-of-war between the rapid surface warming over the Arctic and the enhanced upper-tropospheric warming in the tropics. The investigators will examine several interrelated dynamical mechanisms for midlatitude-Arctic interactions and the associated weather extremes. The first theme is the linkage between the planetary waves in the stratosphere and the risk of cold events. This task will test the hypothesis that extreme wave events in the stratospheric polar vortex serve as a source of intraseasonal predictability for cold events over North America. This linkage between the stratosphere and surface temperature will be analyzed in observations and climate models. Secondly, the investigators will examine a hypothesis that a weaker jet stream under rapid Arctic warming would lead to more frequent weather extremes in mid-latitudes. This task will perform idealized numerical simulations to examine the effect of jet speed or jet structure on the north and south shifts of a jet and thus attempt to reconcile different views on the changes in midlatitude circulation waviness in response to climate warming. The third task is on atmospheric rivers, the narrow intense moisture transport associated with midlatitude cyclones. Atmospheric rivers dominate the poleward moisture flux in the middle and high latitudes, which contribute to Arctic warming. Intense moisture transport can be influenced by either wind speed or temperature, and the two factors will be studied in an atmospheric transport model of water vapor and cloud tracers.<br/><br/>Midlatitude weather extremes have profound socioeconomic impacts. Predictive skills from extreme stratospheric events could improve the sub-seasonal forecast of winter cold spells over North America, with important implications for energy consumption and transportation. A better understanding of extreme cold events in a warming climate can foster better communications of global warming science between the scientific community and the public. Improved predictions of the intense moisture transport by midlatitude cyclones into the Arctic help better adapt to the changing Arctic. Besides supporting an early career scientist at Penn State University, the proposal will train two graduate student researchers at UCLA in the analysis of observations and climate models. Several UCLA undergraduates will be trained in statistical analysis of climate data, particularly for STEM majors and underrepresented minorities. The idealized models developed in this study will be made available on a GitHub website with sample python scripts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through open source community building, the project can scalably grow its species coverage and its interdisciplinary research impact, providing an advanced foundation for education and wildlife research.<br/><br/>This project will advance the Wild Me ecosystem through building an open source managing organization, which is responsible for the initial open source community growth effort (i.e. attracting software professionals and scientists). The managing organization will establish the foundational contribution model for code, AI models, and related data and define the community governance model for the Wild Me ecosystem. The project?s efforts also include developing training materials to encourage open source code contribution, reaching out to related professional and academic users (potential code contributors), and defining the flow of data and machine learning models back and forth between academia and field biologists for interdisciplinary collaboration. The project begins with identifying existing, unmet needs and open source appetite in our existing user community. It then will create a gap analysis translated into needed services and provide code examples and documentation to make it easy and secure for third party contributions. The project will establish quality and security standards for code and model contribution and review, as well as set a code of conduct for community discussion and contribution.

Present SSTs fall short of meeting these needs, having remained virtually unchanged since their inception. This necessitates the need to rethink the realization of SSTs, leading to the introduction of a family of new AC-DC bidirectional power converter topologies and control strategies to perform power conversion at higher switching frequencies with reduced component count and size for a wide range of applications. Simultaneously, the proposed approach takes full advantage of emerging Wide and Ultra-Wide Band Gap (WBG and UWBG) power semiconductors and innovations in magnetic materials for power conversion. A tightly-coupled educational plan supports the national priority to create renewable energy systems-based jobs through a power electronics workforce training program that includes students from diverse backgrounds and includes outreach to community colleges, public high schools, and Native reservations. The outcomes contribute to a sustainable future by reducing the cost and complexity of integration of renewable energy, reducing power conversion losses in such systems and transforming the charging infrastructure for electrified transportations, thus increasing their range and payload.<br/><br/>This project engages in fundamental research to realize a new family of WBG and UWBG device-based, SSTs. The anticipated outcomes include 1) discovery and validation by analysis, prototyping, and testing of a new family of reduced device count, soft switched, high frequency, light weight fault-tolerant non-modular and modular power and voltage scalable SSTs naturally conforming to IEEE 1547; 2) unique multi-carrier space vector modulation and control techniques for the new SSTs; 3) novel additive manufacturing techniques for high temperature nano-crystalline integrated magnetics for SSTs. The new SSTs will have 25% fewer devices compared to state of art, will be 30% cheaper, 40% more power dense, and 5% more efficient resulting in a more sustainable future. In applications to battery energy storage alone, which is expected to expend to 4000 Tera-Watt Hours by 2030 in the US, the new family of SSTs will reduce the losses during power conversion by about 400 GWatt-Hours.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are relatively recently recognized as important, and the exact role of most remains poorly understood.  Detailed study of each lncRNA would provide essential information about possible functions, but would be time, labor, and resource intensive.  Computational analyses can provide an efficient way to analyze many different molecules simultaneously, classify the molecules based on different shared features, and use these classifications and other information to predict function. This project will develop and use computational tools to integrate many different data types generated by previous studies and predict functions of lncRNAs in plant and animal cells. These predictions will allow for hypotheses about how the loss or increase of specific lncRNAs might impact a cell or whole organism.  These hypotheses will then be tested through experimentation as a way to assess the efficacy of the predictions.  Project resources will also support public education activities, K-12 teacher training on these emerging scientific topics, and student participation in modern computer and molecular genomics research.<br/><br/>A central hypothesis of this project is that a multimodal, causal network analysis approach, constrained by physiological and molecular data from data-rich experiments, can be utilized to functionally annotate lncRNAs and to build a predictive model for future experiments. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop network-based models that can predict lncRNA function based on genetic, molecular, and genomic interactions, which can then be applied to datasets from any species. Through this award, researchers will construct and test networks that depict and predict lncRNA functions.  Publicly available high-throughput sequencing from human cell lines, associated -omics data,  and literature-based functional information will be used to infer a fully directional gene-regulatory network (GRN). Machine learning models will be applied to predict essential lncRNAs based on network topologies and connectivity.  A similar approach will be applied to available datasets in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana.  Predictions from both networks will be tested by manipulating ncRNA expression and assaying the impact on the network using Nanostring technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scientific study of interpersonal relationships over the lifespan is important to our broader understanding of the human experience.  These relationships begin with our earliest interactions and continue into later life, and through them we learn how to communicate with, and support others, as well as handle conflicts and negativity. These relationships are also studied through a variety of disciplines, including psychology, family sciences, and interpersonal communication.  However, the science of these important, everyday interactions is typically overlooked by undergraduates as 1) being a science, and 2) being a viable option for future study and professional goals. While undergraduates in the fields of Communication, Human Development and Family Sciences, and Psychological Sciences are often interested in relationships, the majority of those undergraduate majors who go on to graduate study largely apply to more applied areas within these fields of study (i.e., mass communication, marriage and family therapy, clinical/counseling psychology). This REU Site aims to educate students on what it means to scientifically study interpersonal relationships across the lifespan. <br/><br/>This 9 week on-campus summer program (8 students per summer) is centered on the interdisciplinary, lifespan developmental, and diverse nature of the scientific study of close relationships.  This REU site will take advantage of the collaborative and interactive research environment fostered by the Family and Relationships Research Network of Missouri (FARR-net) at MU.  Each undergraduate will be mentored by a primary FARR-net-affiliated faculty member from the departments of Communication, Human Development & Family Sciences, or Psychological Sciences, to design a project related to one or more primary close relationships (i.e., parent-child, sibling, friends, romantic/marital partners) from a developmentally-informed perspective.

Particularly, decomposing the reservoir into an inner network with static weights and an output neurons layer with adaptive and trainable weights allows realization of physical RC where optical-based RC platforms are attractive due to the ?speed-of-light? propagation, inherent parallelism, relatively low operation power, and the possibility to harness additional degrees of freedom such as polarization and wavelength. Furthermore, on-chip Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) offer enhanced light-matter interaction and modes polarization for enlarged reservoir, and interconnection with CMOS compatible electronics for power efficient electrical reprogrammable feedback. The proposed physical RC PICs are expected to impact mobile applications such as unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV) and robotic platforms by reducing the need for communication with remote computers, thus avoiding latency and prolonging battery life.<br/><br/>(technical description)  <br/>To realize the reservoir computing (RC) processor utilizing the polarization degrees of freedom on a photonic integrated chip (PIC), we propose the following objectives: (1) numerical and theoretical study aiming to explore the effect of introducing polarization as a new degree of freedom on RC efficiency depending on the underlying architecture of PIC with the electronic feedback elements providing dynamics control; (2) design, fabricate and characterize silicon PIC interconnected with external electronic feedback, admitting the designed architectures; (3) experimentally test the PIC system with external electronic feedback to realize reprogrammable RC tasks, validate the theoretical study and evaluate its performance for relevant applications providing higher accuracy and lower energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art. Rapid prototyping and testing will be performed at UCSD with full scale runs performed at the AIM Photonics foundry. The proposed research is transformative in nature as it will: (i) greatly expand the limits of applicability of RC in CMOS compatible PIC platforms, (ii) develop a fundamental understanding on the effect of reprogrammability on the induced reservoir dynamics and the corresponding performance error, (iii) expand the current notions of both RC and the optical degrees of freedom employed for RC (e.g., polarization). The transformative broader impact of the project arises from the creation of a new much faster and more efficient RC PIC accelerator that will impact mobile applications such as UAV and robotic platforms. The project will provide scientific training for students at graduate and undergraduate levels as well as serve as a basis for outreach, education and collaborative efforts with middle and high schools. Engagement of students from broad backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) will be continued via the ongoing RET, REU, and COSMOS activities.

The multidisciplinary project team will collect videos of human movement available online and use experts in movement analysis and non-experts to pinpoint at characteristics of the human movement that can be used to drive algorithms that will attempt to classify the emotion expressed by the human mover. These characteristics will form labels on the data that include context, demographics, technical concepts from movement analysis, and emotion. This work will take an unprecedented, multidisciplinary approach in creating a data infrastructure for computational modeling of bodily expression of emotion. To ensure the infrastructure's compatibility with human-robot interaction research, the team will conduct a public-facing feasibility study. The team will also employ advisory boards and continue to engage with active researchers in multiple sub-disciplines of the computer and information science and engineering research community in the designing, creation, testing, and dissemination of the data infrastructure, and organizing annual user community workshops and benchmarking challenges. The data infrastructure is expected to promote technological innovations and breakthroughs in data-driven modeling of human bodily expression of emotion and affect, a highly complex problem with applications in healthcare, e.g., caregiving robots and diagnostic tools for mental health, manufacturing, e.g., socially-aware autonomous forklifts and safety monitoring systems, security, e.g., monitoring, and consumer electronics, e.g., improved interactions with a home robot.<br/><br/>Bodily movement expresses important information, including conveying emotion, which is crucial for future human-machine interactions. As in other areas of artificial intelligence (AI), such as image recognition, a large-scale data-driven approach holds promise for revealing new insights into the complex, subtle, and contextual nature of human bodily expression. However, research on computational recognition of bodily expression, an area of affective computing, AI, and human-robot interaction, is struggling to mature as researchers must replicate many of the same work-intensive steps, creating divergent efforts and expense. This NSF project aims to create a large-scale, high-quality, multifaceted, annotated, open, and extensible data infrastructure for computational understanding of human bodily expressions in a variety of settings. It will leverage the team's expertise in AI, computer vision, affective computing, expressive robotics, emotion recognition, psychology, movement analysis, statistics and data mining, data ethics, and the arts to create (1) a data-sharing infrastructure tailored to the needs of research into subjective experience, emotion, and bodily movement, (2) a crowdsourced annotated video dataset, and (3) a collection of tools and software for rigorous reliability validation, reproducibility and transparency assessment, and content-based search and retrieval. The data infrastructure is expected to serve applications in fields such as robotics, psychology, performing arts, animation, and entertainment. The project also develops human expertise in this emerging field by supporting graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, providing experience in conducting infrastructure development, integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines. These students will interact regularly with the team?s international partners. Public events that create broad public engagement in the work will focus on numerous applications to human-robot interaction.

In the United States (U.S.), the Clean Air Act of 1970 has resulted in air pollution concentrations dropping below national standards, meaning that most communities in the U.S. have cleaner air. However, clean air is not realized across all communities, especially in communities of color, where air quality can differ significantly. Further, regulatory air quality sensors that are sparsely deployed may not accurately detect the quality of air that residents breathe in their communities. With the availability of low-cost sensors and advancement of low-cost single-board computers and microcontrollers, this research aims to provide residents with an ability to accurately understand their air quality through the deployment of an Internet of Things (IoT) air quality sensor. We will meet with residents that have been affected by both redlining and nearby pollution sources to better understand how air quality affects their daily lives and what air quality information is most beneficial to them. In addition, the team will closely collaborate with partner school(s) to create K-12 curriculum for students to learn how to create their own air quality sensor, deploy it at their school, and make the air quality readings publicly available.<br/><br/>In this research, we will combine the availability of low-cost particulate matter sensors with the accessibility of IoT compatible single-board computers and microcontrollers to enable publicly available fine-grained air quality information.

To address common challenges of both power and connectivity, we will partner with PCs for People to deploy the sensors and provide connectivity through their existing infrastructure. An enclosure will be developed that ensures proper airflow, has low interference with wireless communication, and is modular to allow other sensing capabilities in the future. We will compare the findings from a test deployment of the sensors with regulatory sensors readings and share the results with the community and local officials.

As these systems operate in environments that cannot always be perfectly anticipated/modeled, it is crucial that robustness be a prime objective right from the design phase. The project's novelty is the development of scalable and rigorous formal algorithmic approaches for facilitating such robust CPS engineering. These approaches advance classical discrete algorithmic techniques for use in quantitative environments in which CPS operates. The research aspect of the project is complemented with the creation of graduate and undergraduate courses teaching core logical and algorithmic analyses skills to scientists and engineers about to enter the workforce.<br/><br/>The first step toward algorithmic analysis of CPS is a formal specification of the expected correct behaviors of the system. Signal Temporal Logic (STL), the signal variant of Metric Temporal Logic, is currently a popular formalism for classifying good/bad CPS behaviors. Unfortunately, STL cannot specify many properties of interest to engineers. The project is augmenting STL with other temporal operators, such as the freeze operator, in order to have more expressive specification formalisms, addressing the shortcomings of STL. This augmentation is guided by, and done in tandem with, the development of efficient algorithms, heuristic methods, and tools so that the new logics will be tractable to use in industrial CPS contexts, for instance, in test generation. The tradeoff between increased specification expressivity and resulting increased algorithm complexity is being explored to find tractable classes of new CPS logics. Of equal importance is the project thrust that builds a theory of quantitative robustness over these new formalisms, both in the space and in the time domain.

Traditional aerodynamic control surfaces seen on aircraft like flaps and fins are ineffective at certain speeds and high altitudes owing primarily to the low pressures and densities in the Earth?s upper atmosphere. This necessitates the use of alternative means of vehicle control for hypersonic systems, which generally takes the form of control jets. An improved understanding of the physics of these interactions will also help improve high-speed engine efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint.  When fired into a high-speed flow; however, these jets can create massive disturbances in the flowfield that are complex to model. The current lack of proper predictive tools has rendered jet-based control and fuel-injection unreliable, yet little validation-quality experimental data for this fundamental problem exists in the current literature base. This project will address this need by producing validation-quality experimental datasets of jets issuing into a hypersonic crossflow using the Mach 7 wind tunnel facility at The University of Texas at San Antonio. The acquired data will help unravel the complex physics of this critical flow phenomenon and impact future high-speed vehicle design.<br/><br/>This research program will be accomplished in three phases: 1) in-depth characterization of the unsteady dynamics of a jet-in-crossflow over a wide high-speed parameter space; 2) comparison of jet-in-crossflow fluid physics to an analogous standing cylinder geometry; 3) investigation of the transient dynamics of the initiation of a jet in a high-speed crossflow. This work will impact hypersonic aerodynamic research by: 1) quantifying unsteady dynamics and surface loads of jet-in-cross-flow interactions for varied incoming boundary layer states and Mach numbers; 2) characterizing the impact of these jet interactions on control moments for a flat plate; 3) generating validation data for model development. This research will also be tightly integrated with educational outreach.

With extensive interactions with the XR community, the Virtual Experience Research Accelerator (VERA) project will develop a transformative new CISE community research infrastructure in the form of a human-machine system (hardware, software, and people) that combines and extends aspects of distributed lab-based studies, online studies, research panels, and crowdsourcing, into a unified system for carrying out XR-based research. VERA was designed with and for the XR community to tackle this field?s research needs, supplying the demand for big data from diverse subjects at high scalability. The system will enable researchers to conduct XR user studies online, concurrently across a very large, carefully curated, diverse, dedicated standing pool of XR study participants. Access to the infrastructure will fundamentally change the way XR researchers develop and conduct research, enabling them to break free from the intractability of the lab-based study paradigm, and to dramatically accelerate the quality and quantity of new knowledge. Access will also increase equity by providing opportunities for XR researchers (including students) from all parts of the nation to do high-impact research even if they do not have access to XR labs and equipment at their local university. It will enable innovative research with large and diverse participant samples, longitudinal and replication studies, as well as large diverse data set generation for machine learning and other purposes. As part of this effort, the VERA team will implement and publish mechanisms to make studies more accessible and inclusive.<br/><br/>The project includes a significant community-engaged approach to development of the platform through strategic partnerships with industry and community-based organizations who will help in building the platform and disseminating the work throughout the XR community. The infrastructure will provide a transformational tool for XR researchers by leveraging the large and rapidly growing base of XR systems in the homes of the general public, and the abilities of the owners to use them. With consent from these users, VERA will enable CISE researchers to conduct very high-quality studies very quickly. VERA is also designed to tackle this field?s research agenda, supplying the demand for big data from diverse human subjects at high scalability.

During the recent hiatus decade (2003-2012) about two-thirds of the excess heat that entered Earth?s climate system was stored in the Indian Ocean. This project will address the ITF pathway patterns in the South Indian Ocean. The PIs propose a new pathway for heat flow in the Southeast Indian Ocean and will investigate its role in distributing the excess heat and freshwater that entered the South Indian Ocean from the ITF during the hiatus decade. An integral approach will be used that combines analyses of observational and reanalysis datasets with high-resolution ocean model experiments. These methods will be used to characterize the spatial and temporal structure of the flow pathway, investigate the forcing and processes that govern the pathways of ITF waters, and explore the roles of the different pathways in distributing heat and freshwater in the South Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>The PIs hypothesize the existence of a flow pathway for waters from the ITF between the Southeast Indian Ocean and the subtropical South Indian Ocean, along which ITF waters spread to the western subtropical South Indian Ocean with a portion leaking to the Southern Ocean. They posit that this pathway was the major conduit for the enhanced ITF heat and freshwater transport of the recent global surface warming hiatus period. To test this observational data will be analyzed in combination with numerical model experiments. Observational data will include data from moorings, drifters, satellites, reanalysis products. Model data will include existing 1/10 degree simulations from Ocean General Circulation Models For the Earth Simulator and new 1/12 degree runs using HYCOM. The overall goals of the research are to explore the potential new pathway of ITF waters in the South Indian Ocean, investigate the governing mechanisms of this new pathway, and quantify its role in transporting the excess heat and fresher ITF waters during the recent hiatus period into the Greater Agulhas Current System of the subtropical Southwest Indian Ocean. The project focuses on the hiatus period 2003-2012 when a dramatic heat increase in the Indian Ocean due to enhanced ITF was observed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The replacement of flammable liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes in next generation batteries will greatly improve the energy density and safety of lithium batteries. However, it is still a challenge to fabricate high performance solid-state batteries using commercially viable manufacturing processes. The outcome of this project will be the development a new scalable process for fabrication of novel materials for solid-state batteries. The proposed technology derives strengths from chip manufacturing techniques and will enable batteries with improved safety characteristics and energy density compared to the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. The impact of the technology will be accelerated commercialization of the next generation of batteries for electric vehicles, drones, power electronics, and other energy storage applications.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a novel deposition method that will enable high quality thin films of lithium conducting solid electrolyte, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), to be grown directly on substrates and electrodes. Among the solid-state electrolytes being considered for all-solid-state batteries, LLZO is one of the most attractive due to its high ionic conductivity and good thermal and electrochemical stability. However, the inability to reliably form LLZO thin films with existing physical/chemical vapor deposition methods or conventional ceramics processing is a major obstacle to the commercialization of LLZO-based solid-state batteries. The innovation is in using plasma-based methods for the production of high quality LLZO thin films with low interfacial resistance and a grain microstructure that is expected to mitigate lithium dendrite penetration. The research will identify optimal process parameters for the film deposition and surface treatments and establish relationships between the LLZO film quality and mechanical and electrochemical properties. Through a close collaboration combining expertise in LLZO materials synthesis, plasma processing, and commercialization of battery ceramic materials and manufacturing processes, knowledge gaps related to the correlations between LLZO thin film growth conditions, device performance, and commercial viability will be bridged.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The site especially targets recruitment from students whose home institutions have limited research opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) and therefore might not be given the necessary exposure to kindle a desire for a career in research, as well as women, whose widely-observed departure from the technical pipeline could be counteracted by a meaningful and challenging summer of research. The REU site focuses on technologies and methods for data analysis, and applications thereof. The focus on data science allows students to participate in inherently interdisciplinary research that crosses a variety of fields, creating broad appeal for students with a diverse range of interests. Data science also opens numerous opportunities for engagement with industry, nonprofits, and government agencies. The REU allows students to gain expertise that makes them valuable contributors to research projects and sought-after candidates for many different types of positions in STEM fields once they finish their undergraduate degrees.<br/><br/>The objectives of this REU site are that students will (1) develop research skills in data analysis; (2) contribute to a substantive research project involving development of new methods for, or applications of, data analysis; (3) develop an appreciation and passion for research, as well as an understanding of what it is like to pursue graduate study in computing. In addition to the core research immersion in individual projects, students also participate in various activities as a cohort, including a boot camp for technical and social orientation, an end-of-summer symposium with talks and posters, research skills seminars, meet-the-faculty events, and talks by industry speakers. Social events organized by the department and school, and facilitation of student social events further help to build cohort identity. The site specifically seeks to recruit students from colleges with limited opportunities for undergraduate research in engineering, and to address the underrepresentation of women through the computing pipeline. Students participating in the REU will: (1) be exposed to the many applications of data analytics across computer science, (2) gain expertise in specific technical skills and general research skills via their specific project, boot camp, and other ancillary activities, and (3) be equipped with a technical competitive advantage, knowledge, and motivation to pursue a research career in a STEM field. Students contribute to cutting-edge research in the analysis of large datasets, spanning research topics including human-computer teaming, molecular design, algorithmic fairness, and plant science. This REU site trains and engages the next generation of STEM researchers and professionals in data analytics, with a special focus on women and students from undergraduate institutions with limited research opportunities. There is a focus on attracting women to the computing pipeline and helping to retain them by enabling their work on projects with social importance and real-world applicability, and special emphasis on providing them with both the motivation and the tools needed for success. Students are recruited heavily from undergraduate institutions, including 90 partner colleges in a 3-2 program, a relationship with Harris-Stowe State University (a Historically Black University), and through networks promoting women in computing (the Grace Hopper Conference) and diversity in computing (the Tapia Conference).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The multidisciplinary project team will collect videos of human movement available online and use experts in movement analysis and non-experts to pinpoint at characteristics of the human movement that can be used to drive algorithms that will attempt to classify the emotion expressed by the human mover. These characteristics will form labels on the data that include context, demographics, technical concepts from movement analysis, and emotion. This work will take an unprecedented, multidisciplinary approach in creating a data infrastructure for computational modeling of bodily expression of emotion. To ensure the infrastructure's compatibility with human-robot interaction research, the team will conduct a public-facing feasibility study. The team will also employ advisory boards and continue to engage with active researchers in multiple sub-disciplines of the computer and information science and engineering research community in the designing, creation, testing, and dissemination of the data infrastructure, and organizing annual user community workshops and benchmarking challenges. The data infrastructure is expected to promote technological innovations and breakthroughs in data-driven modeling of human bodily expression of emotion and affect, a highly complex problem with applications in healthcare, e.g., caregiving robots and diagnostic tools for mental health, manufacturing, e.g., socially-aware autonomous forklifts and safety monitoring systems, security, e.g., monitoring, and consumer electronics, e.g., improved interactions with a home robot.<br/><br/>Bodily movement expresses important information, including conveying emotion, which is crucial for future human-machine interactions. As in other areas of artificial intelligence (AI), such as image recognition, a large-scale data-driven approach holds promise for revealing new insights into the complex, subtle, and contextual nature of human bodily expression. However, research on computational recognition of bodily expression, an area of affective computing, AI, and human-robot interaction, is struggling to mature as researchers must replicate many of the same work-intensive steps, creating divergent efforts and expense. This NSF project aims to create a large-scale, high-quality, multifaceted, annotated, open, and extensible data infrastructure for computational understanding of human bodily expressions in a variety of settings. It will leverage the team's expertise in AI, computer vision, affective computing, expressive robotics, emotion recognition, psychology, movement analysis, statistics and data mining, data ethics, and the arts to create (1) a data-sharing infrastructure tailored to the needs of research into subjective experience, emotion, and bodily movement, (2) a crowdsourced annotated video dataset, and (3) a collection of tools and software for rigorous reliability validation, reproducibility and transparency assessment, and content-based search and retrieval. The data infrastructure is expected to serve applications in fields such as robotics, psychology, performing arts, animation, and entertainment. The project also develops human expertise in this emerging field by supporting graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, providing experience in conducting infrastructure development, integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines. These students will interact regularly with the team?s international partners. Public events that create broad public engagement in the work will focus on numerous applications to human-robot interaction. The infrastructure will stimulate focused research projects and agendas in affective computing, AI, including artificial emotional intelligence and human-AI interaction, computer vision, social/assistive robotics, virtual agents, psychiatric telemedicine, human-centered design, machine/deep learning, ethics in computing, and related communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, we do not fully understand how the makeup and structure of mitochondria determine their life-sustaining abilities. We do know that biochemical reactions in mitochondria are separated into compartments known as cristae, which become disrupted under stress. To understand the reasons for this disruption, this project will employ advanced microscopy to visualize mitochondrial structural details and molecular methods to mimic disrupted mitochondrial metabolism. The project will provide educational experiences to high school students and teachers and research experiences to undergraduate and graduate students, who will learn how theoretical concepts can be linked through experiments to produce new knowledge of how mitochondria function as the energy factories of cells. <br/><br/>Cristae are invaginations of the inner membrane of mitochondria that contain the bulk of the biochemical enzymes required for the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP. Under stress, cristae remodel in a controllable manner, which correlates with the maximum rate of oxidative phosphorylation. This project seeks to identify causal mechanisms behind this correlation. In Aim 1, novel calcium related mitochondrial physiology will be elucidated using bioenergetic data collected from purified mitochondria, interpreted via computer modeling. In Aim 2, cryo-electron tomograms of mitochondria in specific conditions will be used to quantify cristae morphology parameters at near-nanometer resolution. In Aim 3, 3D spatial models constraining a biochemical reaction/diffusion model of oxidative phosphorylation will be used to reveal the biophysical mechanisms regulating energy metabolism and cristae morphology.

Even individuals in highly satisfied relationships can readily recall negative interactions with their partner. Both theory and intuition assume that feelings about significant others are complex. Yet, there is scant evidence that this complexity exists implicitly (i.e., knowledge that people often cannot deliberately bring to mind but that still impacts behaviors). Recent work shows that in the first milliseconds of perceiving a significant other, both positive and negative information is triggered. Clearly, the single individual most liked in a person?s life strongly activates immediate positive evaluations, but this same person also activates some negative evaluations immediately as well. The current studies investigate this early signature of implicit bivalence (i.e., immediately activated positivity and negativity). Specifically, is implicit bivalence triggered only by significant others with whom one has a long history of affectively-complex experiences? Alternatively, might a stranger with whom one has no past experience trigger implicit bivalence because interactions with any person have the potential to be rewarding but also costly? Importantly, what are the consequences of implicit bivalence for psychological functioning and behavior in relationships? Understanding the evaluations that immediately come to mind when one encounters or thinks about others informs how people quickly make sense of the rewards and costs of social dynamics, with implications for flexible and adaptive social functioning.<br/><br/>Mental representations of others are the cognitive building blocks of human behavior and color perceptions and interpretations of a person?s actions and social interactions with them. One way in which mental representations help people to interpret and react toward others is through enabling rapid and spontaneous evaluations of them. These implicit evaluations are triggered effortlessly and unintentionally whenever one encounters, or simply thinks of, another person. Implicit evaluations deliver immediate information about the positivity and negativity of another person, influencing how we think and behave toward that other person. But initial research has revealed that rather than other people triggering either positivity or negativity, they in fact trigger both positivity and negativity, even for significant others. The current work investigates how this affective complexity develops, for whom it emerges, and what consequences it has for behavior. In so doing, the research examines the plausibility of two theoretical accounts for why implicit bivalence emerges. One account suggests that bivalence emerges whenever the information about the attitude object is affectively complex, which would suggest that bivalence occurs toward a wide range of objects and people but not for newly encountered others. The other view suggests that bivalence prepares the perceiver to react to all people because of their potential to behave in a positive and negative manner, which would suggest that bivalence might emerge for others regardless of any past history. The work utilizes a range of research designs to assess implicit evaluations for people and for everyday objects (e.g., tempting foods, cigarettes), increasing the generalizability of the findings, as well as for people and objects for which implicit evaluations are experimentally created in the lab (e.g., by associating a person or object with rewarding or aversive experiences). The findings will inform models of social cognition, with implications for theory and research on ambivalence, attitudes, implicit cognition, and relationship science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the primary goals of the program is to strengthen the STEM workforce by providing transformative research experiences to students who would not have otherwise considered STEM research or careers.<br/><br/>The three-year renewal REU Site project, ""Climate and Sustainability Research in Nanotechnology and Electrochemical Devices for Community College Students"" at Rice University will introduce ten Houston-area community college students each year to climate and sustainability research, applications, education, and careers through 10-week internships and follow-up support. This REU will broaden the participation of URM students in STEM by providing research opportunities to community college students who might not otherwise have access to state-of-the-art research facilities, prominent scientists, and proactive mentorship. Houston's community colleges represent a large group of students, many of whom are first-generation college students. This REU will be a bridge between 2- and 4-year colleges and serve as a pipeline for those entering graduate school. Furthermore, through this REU, participants will build and maintain mentoring relationships with the Rice faculty, staff, postdocs, and grad students while fostering inter-institutional partnerships between Rice University and community colleges in the Houston area. Rice University has established itself as a leader in the field of nanotechnology through extensive research facilities, interdisciplinary collaboration, and significant breakthroughs. This REU will offer students lab experiences in cutting-edge research. Using nanotechnology and electrochemical devices, students will address climate change and environmental sustainability through three interdisciplinary themes: 1) Processes to reduce greenhouse gases, 2) Energy storage and management, and 3) Water purification. REU participant research and program findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at regional and national conferences. Moreover, project outcomes will be disseminated to Rice University, community college faculty, students, and the Houston region through an annual poster colloquium and the REU website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when a user visits an online retailer, the products shown are selected by a recommender system designed to help one find things to buy and to increase the vendors sales. Recommender systems are also behind most online news sources, and they can shape which news people see. Given the importance of recommender systems to individual choice, it is critical for researchers to be able to carry out studies to evaluate different designs and their impact on the users of the system. But conducting such studies is beyond the resources of most researchers. To get meaningful results requires building and sustaining a community of willing users who have given their permission to be studied.  As a result, the amount of experimental research ? and specifically experimental research on long-term users of a system ? has plummeted. Almost all such studies are conducted by commercial recommendation platforms and their results are rarely made known to the public. This project is designed to develop a shared news recommender system specifically to enable researchers nationwide to be able to carry out experiments and learn just how different algorithms and interfaces affect users. This should create the knowledge that will allow the community to fully understand the impact of these systems and design new recommender systems that can enhance fairness and equity. When complete, this research infrastructure will support researchers in answering critical questions about how complex and often opaque recommender systems affect user behavior and to test new systems that can improve these systems and their outcomes.<br/><br/>This community-centered project will design and build an experimental news recommender community infrastructure to support research in personalization and recommender systems, AI and machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, social computing, and other fields that would benefit from the ability to carry out online field experiments with long-term users of a system.  The cloud-based software infrastructure includes a pluggable recommendation architecture in which researchers can deploy custom algorithms and interfaces, a feed of news articles starting with those obtained through a partnership with the Associated Press, experiment-support modules including consent, payment, and surveying of subjects, and support for two news interfaces?first a news digest and then a progressive web news browser.  The infrastructure will maintain a set of long-term consented users, provide extensive support to researchers including overarching IRB protocols, training, sample experiments, datasets and metrics, and live support through a researcher support team.  It will be governed by a community advisory board drawn from the researcher community with representatives of the content providers and end-users and charged with allocating experiment slots and steering the development and management of the infrastructure.  By developing and deploying this research infrastructure, the investigators seek to empower individuals and small groups to study important questions in recommender systems, including questions about how different algorithms and interfaces can alter the diversity of sources and viewpoints represented and provide users with greater understanding and control over the content they explore.  The investigators come from five institutions spread across the country and will in turn assemble and train a diverse team to take on this technically challenging and important work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urea is currently manufactured using ammonia. Ammonia production for urea synthesis emits large quantities of carbon dioxide because ammonia is produced by first converting natural gas to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, then combining hydrogen and nitrogen at high temperatures. The proposed process will instead use low-temperature electrochemical methods powered by renewable electricity to couple carbon dioxide and nitrate to directly produce urea with much less carbon dioxide emissions. This research has the potential for a paradigm shift in the production of urea while mitigating two harmful air and water pollutants. The project will engage elementary schoolers about STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) through the Grizzly Scholar program and provide high school students with research experience each summer through a Summer High School Apprentice Researchers Program. These educational programs aim to foster development of the next generation of STEM students.<br/> <br/>Under this project the team of Nirala Singh, Bryan Goldsmith, and Suljo Linic of the University of Michigan is studying electrocatalytic C-N coupling using carbon dioxide and nitrate. Through a joint computational and experimental approach, they will study the reaction mechanism of carbon dioxide and nitrate coupling on metal alloys with a target of increasing selectivity to urea. They will measure the effects of partial pressure of carbon dioxide and concentration of nitrate to identify potential reaction mechanisms and compare with atomistic modeling studies to identify rate-determining and selectivity-determining steps. They will use Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopies to characterize the electrocatalysts under reaction conditions to better understand the reaction mechanism. They will also investigate the role that linear adsorbate scaling relations have on limiting the urea selectivity, and how the use of novel alloy compositions can avoid these limitations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will provide two separate business models including hardware fabrication and testing, and active orbital debris removal services. Six Department of Defense (DoD) and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO)SSO spacecraft have broken up in high-value low earth orbits since 2000, and the US Space Force tracks over 550 pieces of NOAA-16 and NOAA-17 debris objects (>10cm). This technology provides solutions to help remove such problematic debris from space. The technology will be designed for beneficial use by both US Government agencies and commercial space companies. The proposed vehicle fleet production is expected to enable efficient deorbit services for removal from space.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative method for Earth orbit transfer, called a Hyper Transfer Vehicle (HTV). HTV is a non-rocket technology that solves performance limitations of in-space rocket thrusters. HTV offers reusable and economically sustainable orbital space debris removal solutions across all earth operational orbits. This proposal addresses the space debris problem not caused by operational satellites, but from non-maneuverable objects and debris in the highly populated Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO). Historically, SSO space objects have contributed to technical, societal, and scientific advancements. The potential outcome of HTV research is a viable and reusable technology for cost-effective orbit object disposal in high value SSO with clean Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP). Instead of expelling propellant, HTV rotates a working fluid gas inside a toroidal cavity to generate a usable force. HTV torus structure draws in the gas while mounted inside an ambient pressure enclosure, which is separate from the vacuum of space. HTV generates a reactive force by employing the Conservation of Angular Momentum (CAM). CAM is preserved when HTV fluid angular momentum (H) and rotational energy (Trot) change. This project will demonstrate with experimental measurements an external force by using air as the working fluid gas, while satisfying CAM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Competing information can create uncertainty, leading people to turn to available social cues to form risk judgments and make decisions. This research revolves around two questions: (1) To what extent do social norms reflected in user comments shape risk attitudes and behaviors in competitive information environments? (2) To what extent do dynamic norms in risk messages pre-empt or counter the effects of misinformation, even more so than social norms in user comments? The findings offer risk regulators valuable insights on how to craft risk messages that can cut through the clutter of misinformation to promote pro-social outcomes.<br/><br/>The researchers investigate these questions using two survey experiments that integrate research on competitive framing and social norms. Competitive framing research has primarily focused on how individual perceptions (e.g., cognition and emotion) influence persuasive outcomes, but there is limited understanding of the role of social perceptions on outcomes. Given that social media are inherently social in nature, social perceptions are central to this work. The research also explores the impact of dynamic norms, which highlight the change in a minority behavior over time, thus departing from conventional social norms research that focuses on static norms (e.g., description of prevalent or socially approved behavior). The intellectual merit of this research lies in advancing knowledge about the underlying mechanism of social perception influencing risk judgments and decisions in competitive information environments. It also illuminates the relative impact of dynamic norms compared to static norms and the role of minority influence on risk attitudes and behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These satellites operate in low orbits, less than 1000 Km above Earth, and democratize access to Earth imagery for multiple applications: precision agriculture that improves farm yields and incomes, disaster management such as early detection of forest fires, modeling the spread of diseases, geo-political analytics, and climate monitoring. As such constellations scale to hundreds of satellites, traditional architectures for space-Earth connectivity fail to meet their needs. Specifically, these constellations generate hundreds of terabytes of data every day that must be transported to the Earth, while the satellites travel at fast speeds with respect to ground stations on the Earth. Therefore, the data download process experiences day-level delays and is prone to failures due to bad weather or hardware errors. The goal of this proposal is to design a new paradigm for space-Earth connectivity that removes these bottlenecks and enables fault-tolerant networks that generate near-realtime (minute-level) insights from data collected by these satellites. The proposed research will remove networking and compute bottlenecks for LEO satellites and enables novel commercial, academic, and national security applications. Some example applications include early response to aircraft intrusions, forest fires, and geopolitical events.  The educational efforts in this proposal will train students to engage in research and development efforts focused on space-Earth networking and edge computing.<br/><br/>The proposed research designs new algorithms and architectures for networking and edge computing on satellites and ground stations. Specifically, the proposed research includes: (a) a new distributed ground station architecture that is robust to transient failures, agile to traffic variations, and enables low latency data download from satellites, (b) an edge computing framework that extracts insights, schedules data transfer, and prioritizes important imagery for networked transfer while being scalable to multiple applications, and (c) design and analysis of interconnects between communication and Earth observation satellites for opportunistic routing.

This project develops a framework for integrating complex logical reasoning capabilities into the components of AI systems that make their ability to reason by analogy possible. To support the development of this framework, the project builds a large dataset capturing the logical relationships among sentences in three languages by using AI systems to determine which kinds of logical relationships are most useful for improving that system?s own logical reasoning capabilities. Through integration with graduate and undergraduate curricula, the project serves as a vehicle to enhance programming and statistical literacy as well as data collection and data management skills through training with hands-on applications. <br/><br/>The framework integrates logical representations into AI systems by imposing constraints on the sorts of numeric representations that those systems use to make inferences on the basis of some natural language input. These constraints are defined in terms of a mapping from the system?s numeric representations of natural language to logical representations. This mapping is learned from scratch and itself constrained (a) to correctly predict inferences that actual speakers of a language make ? as captured by the large-scale datasets collected under the project ? and (b) to be compositional: the meaning of some piece of language must be predictable from the meanings of its parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Treatments of neurological and psychiatric disorders impose over $1 trillion annually on the US population alone. A large body of literature on mathematical modeling in neuroscience had little impact on clinical treatments because most models either rely on simplifying assumptions or use machine learning methods that obscure the link to the underlying biology. This research will develop a new category of mathematical models for the brain that are at once biologically meaningful and interpretable, without relying on simplifying assumptions. These models will be rooted in engineering approaches that combine data-driven and nonlinear dynamical systems methods.  The research is tightly integrated with a diverse and solid body of educational activities targeted towards high school, undergraduate, and graduate students at UCR, the local Inland Empire community, and across the globe.<br/><br/>This project will develop data-driven models of the human brain that rigorously incorporate three critical but often ignored aspects of biological neural networks: (i) spanning across multiple scales, (ii) heterogeneity, and (iii) response to neuromodulation. The first thrust will be achieved through data-driven modeling of feedforward and feedback interactions between neural dynamics at different spatial scales (neurons, neural populations, and brain regions), that move beyond simple macroscopic readouts of microscopic dynamics and enhance our understanding of how macroscopic dynamics emerge from, and feed back into the smaller scales. The second thrust will develop structurally heterogeneous brain models that incorporate data of brain heterogeneities in nonlinearity, dimensionality, and neural code across cortical and subcortical regions. The third thrust will generate a data-driven, sample-efficient framework for modeling the effects of deep brain stimulation at the level of the whole-brain network, thus moving beyond local predictions based on first principle modeling of electromagnetic diffusion. The expected outcomes are potentially transformative models and modeling techniques that provide the neuroscience community with solid and clinically translatable tools for the design of neuromodulation, while also significantly increasing our understanding of the multiscale, heterogeneous, and input-driven dynamics of the human brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Normally skin temperature measurements from radiometers have been made from ships and have required in situ two-point calibration, a separate sky measurement to account for downwelling radiance, and entail uncertainty in the emissivity. The PI is already developing a radiometer that utilizes a single point calibration scheme. This project will leverage the ongoing radiometer development to eliminate the need for a sky measurement and reduce the effect of emissivity uncertainty. The result will be that practical and accurate skin temperature measurements can be made from unmanned surface vehicles and buoys as well as oceanographic research vessels. The availability of accurate skin temperature observations could lead to improved models for near-surface stratification and validation of satellite measurements.<br/><br/>This project leverages an ongoing NSF project by the PI to develop the InfraRed In situ Skin Sensing (IRISS) radiometer for the further development of a technique that eliminates the need for separate sky measurements in measuring ocean skin temperature and provides a significant reduction in the effect of emissivity. The technique uses an optimal spectral band in which the reflected sky radiance is from the atmosphere within a 1-2 km of the ship. The combined simplification of a single ambient temperature calibration and no sky measurement will significantly increase the practicality and accessibility of ocean surface skin temperature measurements. As a result it will be possible to make practical and accurate skin temperature measurements from a variety of observation platforms, including USVs, buoys, and ships.

HEA NPs are structures where multiple elements (typically five or more) are homogeneously mixed at nanoscale dimensions. This technique of fabricating NPs offers access to a large number of compositions of HEAs that have the ability to form unique microstructures, leading to new physical properties which can be applied in areas like catalysis in order to reduce the energy consumption of industrial processes. A key challenge to realizing the unique potential of HEA NPs is the lack of manufacturing processes that can access a large compositional and dimensional space of NPs and advance the fundamental understanding of process-structure-property correlations. This research project will aim to develop a laser-driven method that reliably allows the generation of HEA NPs with control over broad composition and size ranges. This project aims to generate extensive material libraries of HEA NPs, which can accelerate research to understand the across-the-scale (atomic-to-nano) structure of NPs and their correlation with the electro- and plasmonic catalytic properties. The integrated educational program of this project will disseminate the research activities to a broad community of students and teachers at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels. These initiatives aim toward increasing the skilled workforce of engineers with improved participation of underrepresented American populations.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a high-throughput methodology to create HEA NPs with large compositional and dimensional space by employing a nanosecond pulsed laser-driven particle formation method. The pulsed laser processing on combinatorial multilayer/alloy ultrathin films (1-30 nm) facilitates the fabrication of well-defined isolated droplet-shaped HEA NPs of various compositions on substrates. These NPs are formed through the laser-induced melt-phase dewetting phenomenon, coupled with thermally-driven mass transport and ultrafast solidification in the nanosecond timescale. The success of this hypothesis-driven methodology will facilitate an accelerated fundamental understanding of the formation mechanism, governing factors, elemental distribution, and microstructures. The utilization of conventional and advanced data science driven characterization methods, such as 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, will resolve the compositional and microstructural complexities to fill the knowledge gaps in understanding laser-material interactions for creating NPs. These results will have broader implications for advancing the fundamental science of microstructure correlations with the electro- and plasmonic catalytic properties of HEA NPs.

This is a mutually beneficial project that will provide invaluable experiences for students from NC State University and University of Louisville, who will be exposed to interdisciplinary thinking, problem-solving, and leading-edge, field-based research in WaSH. These students are future leaders in science, engineering, and policy. Their understanding of the global challenge of water and sanitation and the local contexts of communities is crucial to their envisioning effective and innovative solutions not just in Malawi and the U.S., but all over the world. WaSH issues directly affect public health and the environment; transformative research has the potential to increase the quality of life of billions of people affected by lack of access to water and sanitation. In Malawi, this research would increase safe water and sanitation services in underserved communities, and help the country meet UN Sustainable Development Goal 6. This project also strengthens research capacity in Malawi by expanding our university partners? range of field-based research topics. <br/><br/>This program  maximizes our long-standing partnership and collaborative research with WaSH researchers at Mzuzu University (MZUNI) and the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST). The program will support the research experience in Malawi of a total of 23 undergraduate and graduate students over three years (6-7 NC State University and 1 University of Louisville student every year). The intensive research in Malawi is for 8 weeks, but each student will be engaged in the IRES program before and after the international experience, for a total of 16 months. Vibrant interdisciplinary collaborations among the students (coming from engineering, environmental science, natural resources, and economics) and among the Malawi mentors and their students will be ensured through joint research, cultural, and service activities. The overall research goal of this IRES project is to collaboratively address WaSH research gaps in Malawi, through field-based student research experiences, beyond traditional (mainstream) research topics in water and sanitation. Addressing these gaps will increase WaSH research in Malawi, add dimensions to current research foci, and help bridge the acknowledged countrywide gap in sanitation and water-related human capacity. This research will also advance the global thinking and agenda on effective WaSH approaches beyond Malawi. The overall training goal is to provide transformational research experiences to NC State University and University of Louisville students, leading to graduates who: (1) will engage in interdisciplinary thinking, problem-solving, and research in WaSH; (2) are globally aware and culturally competent; (3) can leverage their field experience working with diverse communities to develop context-adapted solutions; and (4) will view these solutions through a holistic lens, considering equity, sustainability, and long-term benefits and impacts of their research. We will achieve these goals through: (1) co-designed research activities (with an emphasis on both field- and lab-based research in Malawi) that maximize the strengths and expertise at the partner universities and research sites; (2) individual- and cohort-based training with emphasis on learning outcomes; (3) cultural activities and a service learning project for the IRES students in partnership with their peers in Malawi; and (4) a continuous monitoring and evaluation program that will provide summative and formative assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, communication is much more that language. English is the universal language of science, but even within that context, there are considerable cultural aspects to effective interaction and collaboration. To be effective contributors in this global scientific enterprise, students must add these additional dimensions to their education. This program addresses the need to expose US undergraduate science and technology students to the international nature of modern research at a critical early stage in their careers. This is accomplished through a focused summer research program in an international setting, with the goal of developing Globally Aware Scientists. Over the course of this program, fifteen students will be supported for an immersive research experience focused on functional nanomaterials at the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Japan. This program is built on the base of a very successful program that has been conducted in various forms since 2008. Prior programs have been demonstrated to be extremely effective in developing the Globally Aware Scientists that are needed for successful international research collaboration.<br/><br/>This program supports summer research experiences in nanotechnology for five U.S. undergraduates each summer for an advanced international research experience.

It has been suggested that up to five hominin species ? Paranthropus boisei, Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, Homo ergaster, and Homo erectus ¬? overlapped in space, time and in the dietary resources consumed. This project identifies the extent and type of competition between eastern African P. boisei and early Homo during the Pleistocene (after c. 2.5 mya). Understanding how early Homo responded to competition with other species at this critical early stage in the history of our genus allows us to better appreciate our own anatomy, behavior and plasticity. This study also has broader implications for ecological and biological research. Character displacement, which is one of the factors that enables the coexistence of closely related species, influences the structure of ecological communities, and helps drive speciation and the distribution of biodiversity. The project also creates lesson plans with education experts in the United States and internationally and supports the training of a woman scholar.<br/><br/>The researchers use 3D geometric morphometric (GM) shape-change analysis to test whether interspecific competition influenced the evolution of our genus Homo through time, and whether there were any significant morphological effects of this competition. Conventional wisdom suggested that early Homo led to the extinction of P. boisei over time through competitive exclusion. However, this project applies an updated 3D GM shape-change analysis methodology to test for ecological niche incumbency, a type of competition hypothesis that has not typically been considered in paleoanthropology. The investigators use molar morphological evidence from over a million years in P. boisei and early Homo to investigate the nature and potential causes of any interspecific competition. The results of this study may provide evidence of competition between these genera through time and transform previous narratives of Homo exceptionalism by showing how a non-ancestral hominin may have influenced the trajectory of our own ancestral lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, more than 80% of the world is at risk from at least one vector-borne disease, and Malaria is a leading cause of death in the developing world. However, most research in this field addresses this public health crisis in the form of pesticides, chemical interventions and genetically modified mosquitos with little consideration for the role of the built environment, particularly in limited resource settings. Recent efforts to make housing more protective, however, often lead to dwellings that have reduced air transmission and provide substandard air quality and interior comfort conditions. Additionally, modern, sustainable buildings can be technologically complex and prohibitively expensive. The brick, however, is the most commonly used building material in the world and one third of the world?s population lives in buildings which are totally or partially made from earth. By studying the material aspects of this humble material in tandem with the synergistic relationships of heat, energy, emissions, water, information and resources that make up a city?s public services, a novel brick has the potential to become a greater part of the urban resiliency and public health strategy. Working collaboratively in the classroom and abroad, U.S. engineering and architecture students will design innovative ways to reconceive modular earthen materials to challenge existing norms of construction and material science. <br/><br/>This multidisciplinary proposal joins faculty mentors from four diverse specialties ? architecture, engineering, entomology, and social anthropology ? to address the significant impact of the domestic environment on public health and resiliency in rural Tanzania. U.S. student researchers from architecture and engineering will work collaboratively to explore the capability of masonry construction materials made from accessible, low-impact resources to control the transfer of heat, moisture and mosquitos in rural housing in Tanzania, exploring the intersection between design, disease and a rapidly changing climate. The primary objectives of this IRES effort are to (1) develop strategies for accessible and immediately deployable modular building materials in rapidly developing, hot-humid regions afflicted by mosquitoes, (2) expand the role of climate-adapted building materials with the potential for mosquito protection to support the resiliency and public health efforts of rural communities, and (3) provide community-based research and design experience for U.S. students in a hands-on context that promotes skill development, application of technical knowledge and professional development in an interdisciplinary environment with complex relationships of culture and science in a rapidly changing climate. This interdisciplinary group of students will work with local materials and regional experts to develop prototypes for low-cost buildings and construction technologies that improve occupant comfort while reducing the potential for intrusion of disease-carrying mosquitos. Though this project focuses on one mosquito-stricken country, it is our hope that the pathogen host interaction and thermal mitigation strategies would be applicable to other tropical regions, benefiting those who are likely to be most impacted by rapid development in a changing climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the lack of knowledge in both fatigue failure and the performance uncertainty of LPBF parts poses a significant challenge and undermines the potential of deploying LPBF for high-consequence applications. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to understand the effects of LPBF processing on defects and subsequent fatigue behavior, advance the knowledge of fatigue scattering of LPBF parts that are complex in geometry and subject to multiaxial loading. The effort will establish a physics-centric, machine learning framework for fatigue life predictions, serving as a technological foundation for future metal AM production of dynamic load-bearing applications, and thus, enhance the competitiveness of U.S. industry. This CAREER project will also integrate education and outreach programs designed to broaden the participation from underrepresented groups through actively engaging K-12 students for STEM education and recruiting women and minorities into research, priming future generations of diverse engineers with the knowledge and skills indispensable in the age of manufacturing innovation and big data.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this early career effort is to understand fatigue failures of complex LPBF parts under multiaxial loading for data-driven fatigue life predictions. The research will investigate the nature of fatigue failures from plastic deformation and crack initiation at the highest stress concentrations and translate fatigue life predictions into evaluating the crack growth at the vulnerable zones using a multiscale approach. On the micro-scale, critical defects with crack-initiating features (by x-ray computed tomography or optical profilometry) will be identified based on the correlation with fatigue failures; both the effects of critical defects and their spatial interactions on crack growth will be examined using fracture mechanics and data-intense statistics. On the part scale, the weak regions of the highest stress concentrations will be examined by finite element modeling of stress and strain behaviors through decoupling multiaxial loading. The effects of critical defects and the principal stresses at vulnerable localities will then be incorporated into a hierarchical graph convolutional network of deep learning to model their synergistic impacts on crack growth and calculate the fatigue life of LPBF parts with advanced data analytics. The findings are expected to generate new knowledge of defect formation relevant to fatigue performance of LPBF parts, uncover the synergistic impacts of multiscale factors on fatigue fractures, and further LPBF adoption for high-consequence applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, it is necessary to train students in AAM design and operations in order to prepare the future scientific workforce for effectively handling next-generation transportation systems. AAM services are not only gaining popularity in the US but also worldwide.

The result will enable future generations of robots to provide meaningful assistance throughout the daily lives of human users. To achieve this, robots must be able to quickly learn about their surroundings through physical interactions, particularly in chaotic settings beyond carefully controlled laboratory conditions. This will require robots to gain new capabilities beyond the current state of the art. This project will provide robots with the ability to determine critical characteristics of surrounding objects -- despite variations in shape, size, color, and material -- such as whether they move when touched, whether they are soft or stiff, and whether they bend or twist. A robot should be able to enter a room for the first time, briefly investigate the objects in that room, and then safely accomplish an assigned task. For example, an in-home robot might maneuver about a kitchen, encountering new food items or culinary tools, and then interact with those items to help prepare a meal. This project will advance a range of life-improving robotic applications, including in-home assistive care, dangerous search and rescue operations, or small-scale manufacturing. To train and inspire the next generation of engineers, investigators, working with educators in the Philadelphia Public School District, will develop an educational unit leveraging a robotic simulator to demonstrate concepts from high-school algebra.<br/><br/>This project brings together concepts from non-smooth dynamics, learning, and control, to enable robots that perform dexterous manipulation of previously unseen objects, using data gathered in real time from a cluttered environment. For example, a robot may interact with a set of novel objects for at most a few seconds or minutes, then precisely perform, with human-like dexterity, complex tasks such as tool use or in-hand manipulation. The need for this project is driven first by the dependence of functional robotics on interaction between the robot and its environment, which is notoriously difficult to model, and second, by the reliance on predictive models of both model-based and sim-to-real methods for control. This project addresses the modeling of discontinuous contact-driven dynamics by gathering all sources of non-smooth behavior into a set of contact forces.  An implicit loss function, which itself uses convex optimization to estimate non-smooth contact forces, can be minimized using gradient-based methods to find a set of the smooth parameters that describe the physics of robot-object interactions. To provide data-efficient learning of robot-world interaction, this project explores the following three primary research thrusts: (1) development of foundational implicit-learning frameworks with physics-inspired structure for predicting robot-world interactions, (2) dynamic manipulation of novel rigid and soft objects by unifying tactile and visual sensing with motion prediction, and (3) combining these two learning systems with control and reinforcement learning for closed-loop performance. Together, these thrusts will provide new robotic capabilities when dealing with novel objects, across a range of manipulation tasks including in-hand manipulation and object reorientation, whole-body manipulation (using limbs, torso, and other body parts) to maneuver, push, and drag heavy objects, and multi-arm manipulation of large or unwieldy objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The creation of tools that drive this process have applications in not only understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern molecular processes, but also in the development of a sustainable bioeconomy. This proposal seeks to elucidate how epigenetics improves product yields to enhance natural product discovery in microbes.  The mechanisms of epigenetic control will be examined in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to engineer a programmable system. This research will form the basis of a new synthetic biology course at the University of Illinois at Chicago and will provide research opportunities for students at various levels, including high school. A key goal of the educational activities is to make synthetic biology accessible to students.<br/><br/>Epigenetic DNA methylation is involved in bacterial host defense as mediated by Restriction-Modification systems, and in the control of DNA replication and gene expression. Synthetic biologists have recently started to explore epigenetics and Restriction-Modification systems to engineer memory in biological systems. Unfortunately, understanding of this mechanism is hindered by numerous challenges, including the low production yield of heterologous gene expression. An industrial Burkholderia strain, which produces 580-times the normal levels of the peptide capistruin, will be employed as a heterologous test host. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that this overproduction is most likely mediated by epigenetic factors that impact plasmid copy number and gene transcription. This research seeks to identify the underlying basis for this regulation, by perturbation of enzymes within the Restriction-Modification  system. Methylome and transcriptome datasets will be generated separately and then integrated to determine methylation patterns. In addition, the role of epigenetic factors in controlling product yields will be further explored in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria model organisms. The project is expected to provide critical understanding of the basis for stochastic variation in product yields and thereby to contribute to construction of improved synthetic biology tools in diverse model organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, one component in neurons, called the voltage sensing phosphatase or VSP, uses an electrical charge to directly change the chemistry inside the neuron. However, how VSP then changes neuron communication is still unknown and a greater understanding of this process may clarify how brains process information such as vision, hearing and touch, by communication between neurons. The results from this research may also be applicable to other tissues apart from the brain that are known to use electrical signals to regulate cellular function. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will be trained on how to think critically, solve problems and conduct experiments. Aspects of the project will be shared with the public through hands-on experiences for children and adults. To reach a broader audience within the rural communities of Montana, video conferencing will also be used to share the project and the underlying science behind it.<br/><br/>	Membrane potential and phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) are critical signals in neurons, regulating synaptic transmission, ion channels, growth and migration. VSP is the only known protein to directly link both signals, using a voltage sensing domain to activate a phosphatase domain that then dephosphorylates PIPs in a voltage dependent manner. VSP could significantly influence neuronal signaling because it is activated on a faster time scale than other phosphatases. However, the impact of VSP on neuronal function is still unknown. This research aims to determine whether VSP dimerization serves as a regulatory mechanism for VSP activity and specificity. First, the dimer will be disrupted to determine the impact of VSP dimers versus monomers on function. Second, the consequences of VSP heterodimerization on catalysis will be determined.

Visually distinct root shapes of wild tomato can be distinguished by evaluating the root architecture as a network in which lateral root tips, which absorb water and nutrients, need to be connected to the root base, which supports shoot growth. This network design considers two competing objectives: minimizing the building blocks of a network (cost) and minimizing the transport time from root tips to root base (speed). To improve the relevance of the model to the physiology of plants, the model will be expanded to include the effects of gravitational forces and account for anatomical differences between the main and lateral roots. To identify the genes underlying root network design, we will use genetic approaches and generate mutant plants that will be evaluated for network efficiency, as well as plant productivity and resilience. Understanding mathematical and genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture will lead to designing better crops with improved productivity and stress resilience, thereby contributing to increased sustainability of food production. Additionally, an improved understanding of biological networks and how they grow can be applied to transportation networks, allowing transit systems to naturally scale with population growth.<br/><br/>This project will develop methods for explaining and optimizing the structure of natural transportation networks, such as the root system architecture of wild tomato plants. Initial work will involve developing a numerical optimization algorithm for constructing minimal Euclidean Steiner trees that are subjected to non-linear constraints. We will apply the Euclidean Steiner tree algorithms towards quantifying how tomato root architectures optimize trade-offs between conserving material costs and ensuring efficient nutrient and water transport, especially when growth trajectories are constrained by gravitational forces and differential cost/transport qualities imposed by the differences in root anatomy. We will also study measurements of root architecture growth to reverse-engineer an algorithm for constructing optimal Steiner trees using purely distributed computation. Our goal is to use forward genetics to identify genetic components underlying the development of optimal architectures under non-stress and salt stress conditions. The identified algorithms, ideotypes and genetic mechanisms will serve as targets for plant breeding and genetically engineering stress-resilient crops. We anticipate that the methods we develop can be generalized towards explaining, designing, and optimizing transportation networks found in other natural and engineered systems. In the future, our work can provide insight into designing public transport networks that scale efficiently.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, Mathematical Biology Program and the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systematic barriers increase the difficulty for researchers of color to attend and successfully maneuver these conferences. Often, those researchers who do attend are one of a handful and their experiences can be riddled with isolation, making it hard to truly engage in meeting sessions and activities. To increase diversity and engagement of scientists of color at ocean science conferences and reduce negative experiences stemming from seclusion, the non-profit Black in Marine Science (BIMS) introduces The BIMS Tidal Wave. The goals of this project are to 1) provide a cohort of scientists the networking and technical skills needed to successfully present at a conference, 2) incorporate contributions of researchers of color in ocean science conferences including a conference hosted by the BIMS Institute and 3) increase cohesion among allies and Black professionals who focus on ocean conservation and research. Each year, a cohort of Black marine scientists at varied educational levels (undergrad to graduate) and professions (academic, government, private sector) will be selected to attend one ocean science conference. Prior to each conference participants will partake in a series of workshops focused on presenting research, networking, and successful mentor-mentee interactions. After each conference, cohorts will receive post-conference training that will assist participants in publishing their research and forming collaborative bonds for future research.<br/><br/>As a means of improving the diversity and experience of Black marine scientists at scientific conferences, the nonprofit organization Black in Marine Science introduces The BIMS Tidal Wave. This program aims to expand the diversity of marine science conference participation and society membership in a stepwise fashion, supporting 40 students, and both early & late career professionals in presenting research at two marine science meetings each year. Moving past the experience of being isolated and excluded at conferences, the goal is that participants in The Tidal Wave Program feel a boost in confidence and in a sense of belonging by having new skills, resources, and cohort support. These fundamental changes will alter the experience of both Black scientists and other attendees at the conference. Prior to the meetings, the program will provide hands-on networking and professional development workshops including the resources, support, and skills needed to navigate a conference successfully. These workshops will strengthen relationships and mutual support among participants, thereby increasing the sense of comfort and ease of attending. Pertinent scientific meetings have been selected to represent an array of sub-disciplines within ocean policy and research, ensuring that Black peoples? research contributions are heard and have a seat at the table. At the conferences, we will facilitate opportunities for participants to network with one another, as well as with members and leadership of the host society. In the final year of the grant, the BIMS institute will host a culminating conference, exclusive to Black marine science professionals and allies.

The present proposal focuses on a key behavioral skill acquired by nearly all children in their first few postnatal years ? the ability to understand and speak their native language. The neural basis of language acquisition will be studied with a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that will allow researchers to understand changes in the brain during language learning. Such data in children has been very difficult to collect with other brain imaging techniques, because those techniques create loud noises that interfere with spoken language stimuli and require severe constraints on body and head movement - features that are especially challenging for children. In conjunction with others, the investigators in this project have developed a ?child-friendly? neuroimaging approach that will make it possible to study brain signals in widespread neural networks in the brain during language acquisition in infants and young children. This will provide a new window into neural dynamics, and brain plasticity and reorganization during the early years of natural language development as children learn to speak, read and write. This research will have profound implications for social, cognitive and educational outcomes of early development. <br/><br/>The researchers will use a relatively new approach to brain imaging called fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and validate the technique with a more established brain imaging technique - fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). This combination of fMRI and fNIRS is crucial to achieve the best possible interpretation of brain signals across a wide age range (from 6  months to 7 years) as language-related networks develop. After enhanced characterization and validation of fNIRS signals, the researchers will then obtain repeated longitudinal measures of individual infants during a period of rapid language development using fNIRS alone. Children will be presented with engaging, naturalistic movies with linguistic content that is systematically varied to study how the language areas and networks of the brain are activated across development.  Measurements of language development using parental report and in-home audio recordings will be conducted in parallel with the brain imaging measures. The overall goal is to provide a detailed characterization of the language-related brain networks that support language comprehension as infants/toddlers/children acquire their native language. In addition, this project will generate a useful public dataset and a critical test of the utility/reliability of fNIRS as a more child-friendly neuroimaging technique, thereby making possible the use of fNIRS in the future as a readily accessible and cost-effective tool for future pediatric studies of brain development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These societal transformations originated with rapid advancements in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, that is, the processing of images and texts. Yet, a wide range of data is not best represented by a grid of pixels or a sequence of words. For example, (biomolecular) shapes or (social) networks are data types exhibiting local and global geometric properties that might not be efficiently leveraged by existing deep learning architectures. Hence, there is a need to rigorously understand and expand the data types to which deep learning methods can be applied. This research project considers the more abstract ""cell complex"" data type. The work introduces and aims to quantify the potential of ""cell complex networks"" in deep learning. Applications range from computational biology and medicine, social science, and art, to a better understanding of deep learning itself. The project will disseminate these ideas through publications and the release of open-source software, demonstration material, and datasets. The results are expected to enhance existing ties between deep learning and other fields that rely on geometric, topological, and combinatorial objects. The needs of diverse machine learning communities will be addressed by carefully choosing publication venues. Research training will be provided to undergraduate and graduate students, where the recruiting process will encourage applications from underrepresented groups. Pair-programming sessions, together with occasional hackathons, will help train the next generation of practitioners in topological and geometric deep learning, complementing their theoretical training with pivotal software engineering practices. This project will also facilitate outreach through public lectures featuring speakers from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop a unifying mathematical framework where deep learning models and protocols can be universally defined and executed over cell complex domains. Such domains generalize discrete domains of practical importance such as graphs, point clouds, meshes, and simplicial complexes. The project first unifies existing deep learning computational blocks into the framework of cell complex neural networks (CXNs). The investigators plan to rigorously construct the necessary tools of neural network computational primitives over domains that have geometric, topological, and combinatorial characteristics. They will investigate important theoretical questions associated to these models, such as generalizability and expressiveness in the light of metrics specifically defined for CXNs. Second, the project will harness the power of deep learning in answering questions that arise when studying data with such topological and combinatorial structures. The project will provide benchmarks for graph, point cloud, and mesh data types, leveraging both simulated and real datasets. The investigators will develop an open-source Python package that gathers the topological and combinatorial deep learning primitives with an interface allowing study of their theoretical properties. Third, the project will apply these tools to the understanding of deep learning itself. The work will leverage CXNs to extract geometric and topological summaries of the sequence of weight iterates generated during the training of a given network. The investigators will connect these summaries to the generalizability of the deep learning algorithm and architecture at hand.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The database for the meta-analysis includes information on dental health, skeletal infection, degenerative joint disease, trauma, and nutritional deficiency from populations representing different adaptive strategies and socio-economic status worldwide throughout history. The project aims to address two major questions. (1) How did the process of harvesting and refining sugar impact the physiological health of enslaved Africans? (2) How does the severity and prevalence of skeletal indicators of stress observable on enslaved Africans compare to those indicators on other marginalized populations throughout history? The PIs make several predictions about expected levels of stress, including with reference to subsistence strategies and gender roles.

The researchers will study the infusion of principles from cognitive science as possible ways to enhance teacher learning from video (these include contrasting cases and self-explanation principles).  PD opportunities that support teachers in making sense of the information about students? thinking and reasoning as students work are rare. Motivation to address this need has led to the interdisciplinary collaboration in this project that will study the use of video clips in teacher PD and explore teacher learning with and from video clips of science instruction in-depth. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>This design based research project will pursue descriptive accounts of teacher learning by explaining how and why teachers learn with and from video clips of instruction.

Evidence pertaining to teacher learning will be gathered through teachers? participation in video-rich PD, semi-structured interviews with teachers around video clips and prompts for interacting with the clips, and classroom observations. Through intentionally designed video clips and supporting structures, the project will help to uncover how to support noticing of 1) students? thinking and reasoning and 2) critical and often nuanced differences between more and less productive teaching practices that facilitate students' intellectual engagement in performance assessment tasks.

Initially thought of as cellular ?dust? or ?garbage bags?, EVs have now been found to play a role in a myriad of biological activities, ranging from maintaining homeostasis to cancer progression. EVs can carry a range of cargo, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA), that contribute to their diverse functions. While much research has focused on understanding the synthesis and release of EVs from the cell, little research has been conducted on how cargo gets sorted and packaged into EVs. This project focuses on the RNA component of EVs and seeks to understand the selection, packaging, and transport of linear and circular RNAs in EVs. Circular RNAs have a multitude of regulatory functions, and dysregulation of circular RNA expression has been linked to disease outcomes. Overall, this project will provide a new understanding of RNA transport via EVs. The project will also have educational impact through training of next-generation scientists through recruitment students at multiple stages, including K-12 students, first-generation college students, and undergraduates from low-income families. Students will gain multidisciplinary skills by incorporating studies of cell biology, biochemistry, imaging, bioinformatics, and computational tools.<br/><br/>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been found to carry a wide variety of biomolecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids; however, their content varies based on the physiological state of the cell producing them. Moreover, EVs have been implicated in a wide spectrum of physiological and pathological conditions, and they can serve as important players in cell-cell communication. Leveraging the PI's previous expertise with  single-molecule imaging systems for studying intracellular transport of RNAs from the nucleus to distant sites in cells, this project will address  the long-standing question of how RNA cargo is sorted and packaged into EVs. There have been several theories proposed, but none of these are substantiated with direct visual evidence. Reporter constructs and genome-wide RNA sequencing of EV RNA cargo will be used to determine how and what factors govern the selective packaging of RNA cargo. The role of EV surface marker heterogeneity in RNA cargo content will also be evaluated, as well as its effect on uptake of EVs by recipient cells. The analysis of RNA sorting, tracking of RNA movement into EVs, and eventual transfer of RNAs into recipient cells will help to uncover the biological function of RNA cargo. Use of imaging at single-molecule resolution will provide the first visual validation of sorting and delivery processes and will serve as the basis of future advancements in our understanding of cell-cell communication, thereby enabling better engineering of EVs for therapy and diagnostic purposes. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historical racial stereotypes and ideologies suggest that Black individuals are not capable citizens or political leaders. As a result, Black individuals who accept these ideas may participate in politics less and/or judge Black-led governments more harshly than they otherwise would. Understanding these effects is important because negative stereotypes can be powerful enough to create self-fulfilling prophecies; in other words, stereotypes can actually degrade the objective quality of government services over time. This research highlights how racial inequality may reproduce and sustain itself, even in cases with minimal contemporary legal barriers to political equality. Scholars and activists in certain contexts have identified this mentality as a ubiquitous, persistent, and damaging legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Nonetheless, social scientists have largely ignored this social ill in these contexts, limiting knowledge about its prevalence, its consequences, and means of mitigating it. This research better equips policymakers and practitioners by providing measurement tools and by identifying potential social harms arising from an internalized cultural inferiority.<br/><br/>This research project surveys six hundred Black respondents to accomplish two goals. First, the researchers develop a new scale to measure this mentality. This scale is substantially shorter than existing scales ? only four to six items ? making it easier for social scientists to conduct policy-relevant research. Second, this survey generates evidence to examine how this mentality affects Black individuals? political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. In particular, it tests hypotheses that this mentality (1) reduces self-assessed political competency, as well as propensity to vote and take other political action, and (2) generates more unfavorable evaluations of government performance under Black leadership. The same survey collects data for both scale development and hypothesis testing simultaneously as a cost saving measure; however, the researchers finalize the scale before examining political data to prevent generating bias toward their own hypotheses. By increasing understanding of the causes and consequences of a this mentality, the research provides useful information for policy makers in their efforts to reduce internalized cultural inferiority.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, quantum computers are limited to purely local computation, analogous to computers without an internet.  Additionally, optical fiber communication infrastructure that works for classical information is not suitable for quantum information.  This project focuses on solving materials and integration challenges that will enable the team to fabricate scalable nodes of a quantum optical network, thus making a key step toward establishing a quantum internet.  For quantum optical network nodes to succeed, they must unify high-quality optical devices that control and manipulate light with local elements that store the fragile quantum information.  The research team will integrate the materials needed for these two distinct tasks by taking advantage of recent advances in semiconductor growth.  With the integrated materials, the optical devices can be fabricated in a cleanroom.  These devices will communicate with local quantum states, and the research team will benchmark the performance of the system.  As part of this effort, the team will include undergraduate and graduate students in quantum manufacturing research, thus developing a workforce prepared for the challenges of emerging quantum technologies.  The team will also aid in the recruitment of female engineering students and students from groups that are currently under-represented in engineering.<br/><br/>The research team will create a silicon carbide on aluminum nitride quantum optical platform, taking advantage of the crystalline epitaxy between aluminum nitride crystals grown on silicon carbide substrates.

Over the next three years, the team will bring US students to Finca Las Piedras, a biological station located in the Madre de Dios region of the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest. The Amazon is the largest and most biodiverse rainforest on Earth, with several times more species of trees, butterflies, and other species than North America. Observing organisms in their natural habitat has led to the discovery of new principles in material science, engineering, and robotics. However, significant barriers exist for US scientists to study in these biodiverse locations: field sites are traditionally under-equipped, budget-conscious, and with minimal infrastructure. Substantial training and mentorship are necessary for students to successfully travel and perform research in such locations.  The goal of this grant is to lower these barriers and enable successful scientific research experiences for US undergraduates and graduate students.  Students will gain access to a unique location to do field research, increase their intercultural awareness, and strengthen research ties between Peru and the US.<br/> <br/>This IRES program will implement a jungle biomechanics laboratory (JBL) to (1) provide international research and professional experience to US undergraduate and graduate students, (2) provide opportunities for the students to explore non-traditional organisms for biomechanics and robotics research, and (3) establish a paradigm for training and research laboratories to be built in other international budget-conscious settings. Biomechanics and robophysics work will be enabled by high-speed cameras, materials and fluid measurement devices, 3D printers, and ad-hoc equipment built using the paradigm of frugal science. The requested funding provides financial support, training, materials, supplies, and travel for the students and evaluation of the program goals by an independent third party. This program will support a diverse group of U.S. students, giving them practical field research experience in a growing interdisciplinary field of bioinspired design.

The way genes are used (gene expression) has been implicated in such differences, but the genetic basis for altered gene expression is poorly understood. Until recently, because of limits in DNA sequencing techniques, a major source of genetic variation (tandem repeats) has been difficult to study. While sequencing technology has advanced so that we can produce these data, we still lack a way to analyze it. This project will create a new analysis tool and will demonstrate its use by studying great ape evolution, addressing longstanding biological problems such brain evolution.

AVs and CAVs have strong potential to increase performance, safety, and efficiency, and as a result, to contribute to societal well-being and enhance economic growth. On the other hand, autonomous systems still fail to provide generalizable responses to vehicle, sensor, road, and environment related uncertainties, and need human intervention. Reinforcement learning (RL), an emerging branch of machine learning (ML) and control, has a lot to promise for autonomy with its capacity to address unpredictable changes in the system and environment. However, the field still has many research gaps and also suffers from the lack of practical research evaluation. Most AI based AV research is performed in simulations, on simple platforms and for simplified cases that are far from reflecting real-life uncertainties and convincing responses to changing road conditions, especially at high speeds. This 3-year project will support selected undergraduate and graduate students from US universities to tackle the open challenges of fully autonomous vehicles within a cohort experience at Istanbul Technical University (ITU) under the mentorship of subject-matter experts from ITU, from KTH, and a US based autonomous bus company (ADASTEC Corp). Eight US students (4 graduate, 4 undergraduate) will be funded each year for a 10-week on-site, hands-on research experience at ITU, with each student being in charge of his/her own level-appropriate project using ML/RL for one or more of the vehicle autonomy layers; namely, for perception, localization, motion planning, and trajectory tracking and associated practical tests on actual vehicles (with safety drivers). The algorithm tests will be performed around the ITU Campus within real-world scenarios. Each year, a different student cohort will be selected for this unique research and professional development opportunity, thereby contributing to the US leadership in the future of vehicle technologies with a well-prepared workforce. Special recruitment efforts are planned for broadening participation and recruitment of students from underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>The adaptive optimality offered by RL provides increased performance and efficiency when compared with classical control approaches that cannot handle unstructured dynamics, often resulting in safe but highly conservative, low-performance solutions.  Similarly, because of its adaptability to changes in the environment and problem dynamics, RL offers increased safety when compared with rule-based, heuristic approaches often practiced in industries to address the needs of autonomous vehicles and platforms. The student research projects for each layer of vehicle autonomy will use RL based designs to address uncertainties and disturbances faced in real-life, which have often been ignored in lab based AV research. In our perception/localization projects, novel algorithms will be developed to estimate sensing uncertainties to improve the performance of RL based motion planning and dynamic object tracking. The trajectory tracking algorithms will be based on Zero-Sum Games (ZSG) and online, model-free RL based control algorithms to address disturbances and slip/slide effects, which is also a significant research contribution. At the end of each research cycle, the modularly developed algorithms will be integrated on an actual vehicle and tested individually and in integration, first on the ITU vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) system, then on indoor RaceCars and finally, at the ITU Living Lab environment for shuttle service scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Composition optimization of engineered materials is essential to many applications that are crucial to our national health, prosperity, and welfare. This type of design optimization, however, has two major challenges that dramatically reduce the efficiency of designers: (1) co-existence of multiple uncertainty sources (e.g., lack of data, inaccurate simulations, unknown parameters), and (2) existence of a vast disjoint design space that has both categorical and quantitative features. To address these issues and accelerate the design process, this project will convert the design problem into a statistical learning one. This conversion uniquely leverages machine learning and enables designers to make informed decisions for resource allocation, uncertainty quantification, and anomaly/novelty detection. The impact of the framework will be demonstrated on optimal design of complex concentrated alloys, which have shown great potential in critical applications involving energy storage, cryogenic operating conditions, and more. The research outcomes of this project will be tightly integrated with multiple educational and outreach activities to benefit educators and students (at both high school and university levels), as well as businesses. These activities will produce educational content (including codes and video tutorials) and a user-friendly app that small businesses and high schoolers can leverage for design optimization under uncertainty. These activities will collectively demonstrate to students and practitioners that engineering design and machine learning can dramatically increase our capabilities in solving complex engineering problems.<br/><br/>The hypothesis behind this research is that with appropriate conversion operators and learning mechanisms, the combinatorial design space and associated uncertainties can be encoded via a set of low-dimensional and interpretable manifolds, each of which is a compact representation of high-dimensional objects (e.g., an uncertainty source). This hypothesis will be tested in four research thrusts to make the following contributions: (1) Developing an uncertainty representation method that improves uncertainty quantification capabilities and also provides visually interpretable diagnostic measures for detecting model form errors and existence of non-Gaussian uncertainties; (2) Establishing a design representation methodology for encoding a vast combinatorial design space in a compact manifold that designers can leverage to identify promising combinations; (3) Introducing new optimality metrics for probabilistic metamodeling and resource allocation; (4) Developing a multi-fidelity multiscale modeling framework that enables homogenization-based multiscale simulations to dynamically and automatically adjust the fidelity (and hence, cost) and calibration parameters of the nested simulations. These methodological contributions are generic and can benefit a broad range of applications, such as multi-disciplinary systems analysis. The education and outreach components of this project include developing a design optimization and calibration app that can be used by high school students, educators, and local small businesses; transferring the technology on materials optimization to the manufacturing industry; and developing educational materials and summer workshop series.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there is uncertainty about whether these exceptional traits have evolved across the entire spectrum of primate diversity. To better understand the evolution of complex intelligence in primates requires comparative data. Towards that end, this doctoral dissertation research project examines the ecology, sociality, and cognitive behavior of an understudied ancient primate lineage. Results can provide key insights into how cognitive complexity has evolved in primates. The project supports mentorship of student researchers and international research collaborations. It also involves an interdisciplinary collaboration that integrates ideas from biological anthropology and electromechanical engineering to develop novel remote biologging technologies. This collaboration can facilitate the future collection of spatial and movement data on many smaller-bodied nocturnal species for which this type of data has been traditionally unattainable.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify ecologically and socially relevant cognitive adaptations in a wild population of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates, thick-tailed galagos, to determine how socioecological pressures shape patterns of cognitive evolution in nocturnal strepsirrhine primates compared to diurnal gregarious primates. The researchers utilize manual behavioral observation, newly developed biologging technology, vocalization playback experiments, field-adapted cognitive tests, and comparative statistical analysis to collect and analyze relevant cognitive and behavioral data on thick-tailed galagos. If similar cognitive abilities are observed in the galago lineage as in gregarious, diurnal primate lineages, then there may be a preserved evolutionary blueprint of specific socioecological conditions selecting for specialized sets of cognitive adaptations in primates that predates the divergence of the galagos. Comparing cognitive adaptations between thick-tailed galagos and other primates presenting similar socioecological traits can help determine how specific socioecological pressures affect primate cognitive evolution across taxa and help contextualize the ultimate evolutionary origins of human cognitive abilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particulate matter in the open ocean consists primarily of organic material from plankton and other biological detritus, which can readily aggregate to form large flocs. A combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes transforms these flocs as they settle, redistributing material throughout the water column and potentially sequestering elements such as carbon in the deep ocean. The impact of these transformations is affected by the sinking speed of these flocs, with larger and denser particles settling faster than smaller, less-dense ones. One of the key questions facing oceanographers today is what controls particle settling speed (for example, particle size, shape, and density). There is considerable evidence that particles readily break apart as they settle, decreasing their average size and settling speed, but it is not yet understood what conditions cause these disaggregation events. This work will measure the breakup characteristics of organic settling particles both in the laboratory and at sea to quantify the importance of these breakup processes relative to particle transport. The work will be done at the Pennsylvania State University in collaboration with the University of Georgia to target the development of future marine particle disaggregation models for use by the oceanographic community.<br/><br/>This research will play an important role in determining the importance of disaggregation on the vertical transport of particulate matter in the ocean. The project will quantify the breakup of organic marine aggregates due to fluid forces caused by turbulence or swimming organisms. Phytoplankton will be cultured and formed into aggregates in the lab prior to disaggregation using calibrated turbulence. The size, shape, and structure of these aggregates before and after breakup will be quantified using high-speed visualization and holographic imaging. In addition to the laboratory measurements, a deployable instrument that can disrupt particles in-situ and measure their size and shape will be built and deployed in the North Atlantic during the spring bloom of phytoplankton. Detailed measurements of particle concentrations, breakup characteristics, organic content, and ambient turbulence as a function of depth in the water column will be collected. This work will represent the first study of marine aggregate breakup in-situ. Specifically, the project will clarify: (1) under what conditions disaggregation is important, (2) how strong different types of natural marine aggregates are and how their strength varies with size, composition, and morphology, and (3) how aggregate size, composition, and structure influences the distribution of its breakup mass.

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF?s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The chemically-complex metallic-alloy nanoparticles (CCA-NPs) that motivate this work are of great interest in a wide range of applications including catalysis, energy conversion and storage, and bio/plasmonic imaging.  This research project develops a multi-disciplinary modeling methodology supported by experimental measurements to keep pace with the growing widespread application of atomically resolved microscopic measurements.  The main objective of this project is to utilize a novel modeling framework based on machine learning to extract information about atomic column heights and chemical elements from experimental high-resolution electron microscopy images of CCA-NPs of different compositions and sizes.  Although the present work is motivated primarily by nanoparticles, the framework is general and easily extendable to other nanoscience research amenable to scanning transmission electron microscopy, such as catalysis, crystallography, and phase evolution.<br/><br/>The team will introduce in their undergraduate and graduate courses a number of topics related to the present project, stressing familiarity with current research problems and direct experience with different computational methods as well as open source and commercial software.

This research uses a deep-learning model built on a fully convolutional neural network to resolve the elemental distribution of CCA-NPs represented in atomic-resolution transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy images.  The objective of the proposed neural network is to learn, through semantic segmentation, the non-linear correlations between the pixel intensities of microscopy images and the number of atoms of different constituent elements in the atomic columns of CCA-NP structures.  In spite of the critical need in determining structures and elemental distributions, current experimental efforts rely on trial-and-error analysis and often involve many assumptions.  This is due to the nonlinearity and complexity of TEM images, preventing the straightforward estimation of atomic column heights and elemental distributions.  Thus, the main objective of this project is to provide such information from experimental high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) images of CCA-NPs of different sizes and compositions, including high-entropy alloys (HEAs).  An integrated, multi-disciplinary modeling framework based on machine learning (ML), an evolutionary approach (EA), and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations supported by HRTEM and STEM measurements is proposed.  A supporting objective is to provide a range of experimental conditions for which reliable HRTEM images may be acquired.  This project provides a paradigm shift in the analysis and interpretation of HRTEM/STEM experimentally acquired images of CCA-NPs employing a multi-disciplinary modeling approach through (i) advancing the current state of the art of deep-learning techniques for evaluation of experimentally obtained images, (ii) generation of physically meaningful and reliable training data for CCA-NPs using the Wulff Construction, (iii) evaluation of elemental motifs in HEAs using an evolutionary approach, and (iv) more profound understanding of the influence of the microscope parameters (e.g., dose, focal spread, defocus, etc.) on the quality of neural-network predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiple imaging systems, which include systems for imaging living systems and those for gamma-ray astronomy, have the unique ability to acquire data on a per-photon basis and store this data in list format. However, the full potential of these systems, referred to as list-mode systems, remains untapped since current methods to process data from these systems are sub-optimal and result in information loss. This information loss is even more concerning for list-mode systems, since typically these systems are photon-starved, and it is vital that maximal information be extracted from each detected photon. Towards addressing this important need, in this CAREER project, a new paradigm to process data from list-mode systems will be developed. The development of this paradigm will open new frontiers on imaging small-sized regions and low-count imaging. Direct impact will be demonstrated in quantifying physiological properties of small structures deep in the brain towards the goal of understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease. The paradigm is also poised to impact many other sciences where such systems are used including astrophysics, biomedical research, geoscientific process monitoring, and nuclear security and safety.

Conventional computational imaging methods are typically designed to operate with discrete data. Thus, when processing data from list-mode systems, these methods first bin that data, which, as has been shown in multiple studies, results in loss of task-specific information. To avoid this information loss, there is a crucial need for new methods that can process the list-mode data in this continuous format. The intellectual significance of this proposal stems from this need and lies in the development of a continuous-to-continuous operator-based paradigm and associated methods to process list-mode data. The research approach is to (a) develop new information-theory-based techniques to quantify limits on task performance with list-mode systems, (b) design and validate algorithms to extract task-specific information from list-mode systems, including new reconstruction algorithms that will estimate continuous representation of the underlying object and (c) develop algorithms to estimate mean regional uptake in small regions of the brain from single-photon emission computed tomography images. The proposed list-mode paradigm will strongly impact both the fundamental and applied aspects of imaging science by providing new rigorous mathematical formalisms to process list-mode data, thereby yielding the ability to retrieve previously unextracted information from these systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a major source and sink for carbon, urban areas are a frontier in understanding changing environments and the carbon cycle.  The investigator will study the extent to which city trees function as urban air filters, capturing carbon particles from the atmosphere and then depositing them into soils for long-term storage.  Because of carbon?s powerful influence on atmospheric radiative mechanisms, understanding its removal and input into the soil is key to developing and implementing short-term environmental mitigation strategies.  In addition, understanding the factors that contribute to carbon removal in urban areas could help improve air quality for urban residents.  The research will be conducted at the edge of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and will quantify the filtration of carbon particulates.  The project will open new pathways into science, technology engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for geography and education majors, and it provides research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.  Project results will have socioeconomic implications by providing opportunities to impact urban architecture and configuration while understanding the complex urban forms that drive biogeochemical patterns and processes.<br/><br/>The investigator will quantify rates, pathways, and determinants of carbon deposition at fine spatial scales in a rapidly growing city that is representative of many urban areas in semi-arid regions of the world.  The investigator will explore answers to three core questions:  (1) What is the spatial variability in the deposition rates of black carbon on urban tree canopies?  (2) What is the role of throughfall and litterfall in the flux of carbon to the soil?  (3) What are the urban form components that control spatial patterns of black carbon deposition?  High-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, geospatial data, and field-measured vegetation characteristics will be integrated to determine the most important factors contributing to spatial variability in the filtering of carbon particulates.  A statistical model will be developed to provide estimates of carbon removal by trees at the city scale.  The LiDAR-based scaling approach is potentially transformative, because it has broad applicability to a range of scientific questions across diverse ecosystems."

Traditional ways of programming conflate algorithms and their organization such that a straightforward implementation is unacceptably slow. At the same time, neither one can be written or optimized independently, which limits the productivity of programmers and the portability of programs to future hardware. Optimized organizations are often an order of magnitude faster and more complex since they necessarily take a global, rather than per-operation, view of the algorithm to exploit parallelism and locality. This project's novelty is in creating a new kind of programming language in which the algorithm and its organization are decoupled from one another. Programming systems are the tool through which computation is applied to human problems. The project's impact will be transforming the way major classes of software are written, enabling a wider range of people to more productively write new algorithms which are both high-performance and portable to future computing hardware.<br/> <br/>This project explores a programming model that decouples algorithms from their organization, represented explicitly in the language as a ""schedule."" It extends this paradigm from multidimensional arrays to more general computations and data structures, including sparse matrices and graphs, and builds a machine-learning system to automatically find schedules competitive with human experts. To realize this vision, it pursues four major research directions: (a) combining tree search with neural networks in a reinforcement learning system to automatically find expert-quality schedules; (b) broadening the class of expressible computations and schedules to include general loops and program gradients; (c) broadening the class of data structures and schedules with a relational model to process sparse and linked data; and (d) creating a comprehensive performance benchmark suite to serve as our evaluation testbed, and also be shared broadly to foster new research in systems, compilers, and architecture. The resulting language and compiler enables productive high-performance programming and provides a powerful foundation for easily building new domain-specific programming systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given its singular design and material flexibility, metal additive manufacturing (metal AM) has the potential to revolutionize U.S. manufacturing by improving part performance and reducing waste and processing costs. However, safety-conscious industries, such as aerospace and biomedical, are hesitant to adopt AM processes due to the frequent occurrence of parts with hidden flaws. Traditional approaches for detecting and correcting flaws involve determining and adjusting the process parameters that lead to defects using a trial-and-error approach, which is expensive and time-consuming. This innovative project utilizes a computational simulation software to identify and correct design and processing problems before a part is printed. Importantly, this approach will provide scientific insights into why certain process parameters and part design features result in defect formation. This efficient and cost-effective method for detecting and correcting flaws in AM parts will enable their wide-spread commercialization and adoption. Ultimately, using AM processes rather than traditional manufacturing may save businesses time and resources while increasing part efficiency and reducing negative environmental impacts. <br/><br/>This project will verify, validate, and commercialize a computational heat transfer modeling approach to simulate the temperature distribution in parts made using metal AM. This technology, which is based on the novel concept of heat diffusion on graphs (graph theory), aims to predict and correct design and processing problems before a part is printed. This capability would ultimately lead to improved AM part quality and increased use of AM processes in precision-critical industries. Existing simulation packages are expensive and incorporate proprietary assumptions. Non-proprietary approaches, in turn, take hours, if not days, to simulate the  thermal history for a simple part. Prior work by the research team has demonstrated that the graph theory approach is approximately twenty times faster than non-proprietary methods and so computationally lightweight that it could be deployed on a laptop or smartphone. In moving toward commercializing the technology, the project team will employ practical use case samples produced by their industrial partners. The work will address two fundamental research questions: (1) What process conditions and part design features are linked to specific temperature patterns and why? (2) What is the influence of thermal history on flaw formation? The technical results from this project may include a rigorous, experimentally validated, computationally efficient, user-friendly, and industrially corroborated thermal simulation approach that can be used for rapid physics-based optimization of part design and process settings in metal AM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ordered mesoporous carbons are a result of advancements in nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. However, their conventional manufacturing involves several bottlenecks toward scale-up, such as, solvent consumption, limited attainable pore sizes and high cost. This research employs low-cost and widely available thermoplastic elastomers as the starting materials and develops an efficient crosslinking method, allowing their direct conversion through pyrolysis to ordered mesoporous carbons. With large consumption and broad use of thermoplastic elastomers in various applications, their end-of-life represents a growing environmental concern. This project addresses the thermoplastic elastomer wastes problem by upcycling them to functional ordered mesoporous carbons. Moreover, the ability of thermoplastic elastomer-derived ordered mesoporous carbons for water remediation is developed, particularly associated with the removal of aggregated micropollutants, a pressing need for the sustainable development of the environment and society. This research is supported and complemented by a cohesive educational program, including curriculum development, hands-on activities for high school and community college students, science after school programs, community outreach to underserved areas, and annual regional soft matter symposia.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this research is to pioneer and establish the use of thermoplastic elastomer-based block copolymers for fabricating ordered mesoporous carbons through a simple and scalable sulfonation-enabled crosslinking method, followed by direct pyrolysis. The fundamental relations of precursor chemistry, manufacturing process, and final material microstructure and properties are elucidated, informing rational system design to attain tailored pore structures, textures, doped carbon framework, and material functionalities. A technology transformation pathway towards the production of ordered mesoporous carbons is developed and informed by techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. This research also aims to enable the application of thermoplastic elastomer-derived ordered mesoporous carbons for removing micropollutant aggregates from polluted water, particularly concerning per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This is accomplished by systematically understanding the sorption mechanisms of ordered mesoporous carbons against model contaminants, paired with elucidating sorbate nanostructures via advanced neutron scattering measurements. This research determines how pore structure, texture and framework chemistry of ordered mesoporous carbons dictate their water remediation performance. Collectively, this project establishes an industrially feasible route toward scalable manufacturing of functional ordered mesoporous carbons through direct pyrolysis of crosslinked sulphonated thermoplastic elastomers, in conjunction with demonstrating and understanding their robust use for water remediation.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) Program, the CMMI Division, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior research has found that low- and moderate-income (LMI) households suffer disproportionately and recover less quickly than more privileged residents. Financial resilience?the ability to recover from an economic shock?underpins other aspects of recovery and is a necessary condition for broader disaster resilience. Despite this, it is an under-researched aspect of climate adaptation and investigation of actionable solutions is scarce. The proposed project will fill this gap.<br/><br/>The project?s overarching goal is to increase the financial resilience of LMI households in New York City to escalating flood risk through the use of inclusive insurance. Inclusive insurance refers to any program that makes coverage available to those previously locked out of the insurance market. Our project will establish NYC as one of the first communities in the U.S. to harness these approaches. This project is a joint effort between the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania, the New York City Mayor?s Office of Resiliency, and the Center for New York City Neighborhoods (CNYCN). It also involves a research partnership with the Urban Institute, research and development work with Global Parametrics, technical assistance from Guy Carpenter, and support from the NYC Office of Management and Budget. <br/>The project has four interrelated objectives:  <br/>1. Developing and deploying innovative, inclusive insurance pilots. The key pilot will be the purchase, by CNYCN, of a parametric flood insurance policy designed to rapidly provide emergency cash grants to LMI households post-flood.

Downward fair-weather current would be quantified through electric field observations in Alaska, Colorado, and Texas, with a focus on refining the definition and uncertainties of fair-weather conditions using cloud and aerosol data.  Six specific science questions are posed:<br/><br/>?	Q#1: In the spectrum of electrified clouds, is it possible to separate the more important clouds having large contributions to the GEC from those that can be neglected, based on properties seen from radar, microwave radiometers, or other satellite-based measurements?

The risk-compensation bias argues that individuals adjust their at-risk behaviors to achieve a balance between potential risks and benefits and thereby maintain a target level of risk. Derived from external (e.g., task or environmental-related) and internal (e.g., individual characteristics) sources, risk compensation ultimately influences an individual?s (deliberative, affective, and experiential) risk perception as a central predictor of health and safety-related behaviors and certain risky decisions. Decision making under risk is mainly studied at the individual level in the construction-safety setting. However, drawing on social influence and behavioral intention theories, coworkers? risk-taking serves as an ?extra motive? of risk-taking behavior among workers in the workplace. Thus, studying the risk-compensation effect in the construction environment can become more complicated given that construction workers work in groups, and coworker behavior can influence safety-related behavior. Furthermore, the effects of heat exposure and subsequent heat stress might translate into an increased risk of injury caused by physical discomfort, fatigue, and reduced vigilance that can influence worker emotional state and risk perception, and lead to cognitive failure, misperceiving hazards, and neglecting precautionary behavior. Accordingly, this multidisciplinary project addresses these gaps by integrating psychological science, artificial intelligence (AI), and advances in construction safety to deliver a novel theoretical platform and empirical process to understand the latent changes in worker decision dynamics following an intervention for greater protection from injury.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of this study are to (1) examine the extent to which individuals? characteristics and psychological states, along with task and environmental factors (e.g., time pressure, extreme heat) influence workers? at-risk decisions; (2) determine the role of risk compensation bias on team risk perception, decision making, and work behavior; and (3) develop a multidimensional AI model to identify at-risk workers and interpret their risky decision-making, using limited attributes including individual, task, and environmental-related factors. To achieve these objectives, a multi-sensor immersive 360 mixed-reality environment that consists of passive haptics and environmental modalities is used to raise the workers? sense of presence, capture their realistic responses to safety features during various current and future construction tasks. A combination of qualitative and quantitative measures serve to investigate the underlying mechanisms of workers? risk-compensatory behaviors and decisions. The measures derive from location-tracking sensors, vision-based sensors, wireless neuropsychological and cognitive brain monitoring (fNIRS), eye-tracker, photoplethysmography (PPG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) psychophysiological sensors, semi-structured interviews, demographic, and psychographic surveys. The collected data constitutes information about workers? behavioral changes simulated using agent-based modeling, and used to develop a multidimensional predictive model to minimize the likelihood of risk compensation and to prevent incidents and injuries. The project outcomes have the potential to impact the performance of a nationwide industry and create a novel platform for enhancing the national research and education infrastructure.

This project will use new geochemical tools to tell when the Bering Strait was flooded or exposed during the last glacial cycle (the past 120,000 years). In combination with computer model simulations, this information will be used to bound previously unknown global ice volume histories over this time.

Measuring nitrogen isotope ratios of organic matter protected within the shell walls of Arctic planktic foraminifera will elucidate the past connectivity of the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans, thus constraining the local sea-level history at the Bering Strait. State-of-the-art glacial isostatic adjustment sea-level simulations will be performed using the range of uncertainty on global ice volumes to model local sea level at the Bering Strait. Finally, this continuous Bering Strait flooding reconstruction will be used to test the plausibility of different global ice volume histories, and thus bound global mean sea-level highstands and lowstands before the Last Glacial Maximum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such lifelong learning is also crucial for computational systems to achieve high levels of performance, flexibility, and adaptation when they interact with real world environments and process streaming sensory data. This project will develop biologically inspired lifelong learning architectures and methods that integrate functions and characteristics of a mammalian brain, which is arguably the best learning system the world has seen. The success of this research will advance fundamental knowledge in computational lifelong learning and will have the potential to transform how the field creates human-like artificial intelligence with lifelong learning capabilities. In addition, the outcome of this research will be integrated into a new curriculum, and opportunities will be provided to students from under-represented groups to participate in computational intelligence research.<br/><br/>The project will explore a new machine learning paradigm to address many critical challenges facing current deep neural networks when learning is performed from sequential tasks and different sources. The proposed research will introduce a lifelong learning framework consisting of a feature learning network, a convertible short-term and long-term memory network, and a memory replay network. To achieve effective lifelong learning, this project will address the following three research challenges: (1) learning to memorize -- achieving the optimal balance between plasticity and stability of neural connections to improve the efficiency of both learning and memory networks; (2) learning to recall -- optimizing cue effectiveness in both learning and memory replay networks to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting; and (3) learning to associate -- enabling multimodality association at the memory level. Since the proposed models mimic the hierarchical architecture, short- and long-term memory mechanisms, and feedback function of the mammalian brain, they have the potential to contribute to an artificial general intelligence that better accumulates knowledge without interference, learns multimodality association, and even predicts the future.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Robust Intelligence and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to this need, robot learning from demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a paradigm that allows users to quickly and naturally program robots by simply showing them how to perform a task, rather than by writing code. This methodology aims to allow non-expert users to program robots, as well as communicate embodied knowledge that is difficult to translate into formal code. However, current state-of-the-art LfD algorithms are not yet ready for widespread deployment, as they are often unreliable, need too much data, and are designed to learn in a single session in a laboratory setting.  This work addresses these issues to help enable future robots to perform important tasks ranging from in-home elderly care to reconfigurable manufacturing.<br/><br/>Specifically, this work identifies three significant technical improvements to current LfD algorithms that are needed before they can be deployed in the real world: the need for safety guarantees, the ability to learn from very limited amounts of data, and the ability to continually improve in an ongoing, life-long fashion.  A formal theory of safe LfD is developed, along with practical algorithms that provide strong probabilistic lower bounds on agent performance.  Algorithmic efficiency is addressed via a re-examining of common statistical assumptions (such as independent and identically distributed data) and through the use of multimodal side-information, such as natural language and gaze.  Finally, active learning strategies and modeling of human beliefs are used to enable interactive, continual learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This calls on scientific community to design networks that can push spectrum efficiency to its limits. On the other hand, making cellular networks energy efficient is a goal that is becoming more pressing than ever not only for operational cost reduction but also for minimizing the carbon foot print of the bulging information and communications technology industry.  Recent studies show that unless new degrees of freedom and artificial intelligence based dynamic adaptability is added in the cellular architecture, any significant gain in spectral efficiency must come at cost of energy efficiency. The overarching goal of this project is to design, characterize, optimize and validate through a state-of-the-art testbed a new architecture that enables the additional degrees of freedom and intelligence to dynamically exploit these new degrees of freedom in the design and operation of the mobile network to yield substantial gains in both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, simultaneously.  This proposed architecture is named as SpiderNET: Spectrally Efficient and Energy Efficient Data Aided Demand Driven Elastic Architecture for Future Networks. The key idea behind SpiderNET is to introduce additional degrees of freedom to relax the rigid spectrum efficiency-energy efficiency tradeoff and thus enable simultaneous enhancement of both. In wake of the internet of everything, as a key enabler of network resource efficiency, enhanced battery life and service level improvement, SpiderNET is bound to have a broad impact on nearly every aspect of evolving digital society that counts on wireless connectivity. In addition, as diminishing revenue per bit is already pushing cellular operators to reduce energy bills, huge energy savings enabled by SpiderNET can substantially reduce OPEX. Reducing the carbon foot print of cellular industry is also a key benefit of the proposed research. This project offers workforce training in a highly sought-after multi-disciplinary skill set while ensuring the participation of women and other underrepresented groups, and K-12 outreach. Compared to only theoretical or simulation-based research, a key distinction of the proposed research is the experimental research on a cutting-edge cellular testbed that is expected to cast a much broader impact. This project is collaborative undertaking with key national and international stakeholders in cellular eco-systems to ensure timely adaptation of the project outcomes by respective industry and government bodies.<br/><br/>The simultaneous enhancement of both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency is achieved by shifting the pivot of operation from the rigid always-on base-station-centric cells to user-centric on-demand cells.  To enable this, SpiderNET consists of a layer of low-density large footprint control base station underlaid by high-density switchable data base stations. The switching on/off the data base station, the size of user-centric cells (S-Zones) and other parameters are orchestrated proactively by a machine learning based self-organizing network (SON) engine that leverages a database of selected measurements at data and control base stations.  Preliminary studies show that intelligent orchestration of the both, the size of the S-Zone and active data base station density, along with optimal design of the contents and spatiotemporal resolution of the database can substantially enhance both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency without compromising quality of experience. The research will transform SpiderNET form an idea into a functional architecture by pursuing the following three research thrusts: 1) Developing analytical and simulation models to fully characterize the spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency of SpiderNET to determine the key design parameters that can be optimized to maximize its spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency gains. These models will then be leveraged to design algorithms for maximizing spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency in dynamic traffic conditions. 2) Designing the database of measurements and leveraging this data at control and data base stations to develop algorithms for proactive cell discovery and selection and radio resource allocation for jointly maximizing both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency without compromising quality of experience. 3) Proof of concept of SpiderNET on TurboRAN (an NSF-funded end-to-end programmable testbed). This research leverages tools from domains of fluid modelling, stochastic geometry, game theory, machine learning and stochastic and multi-objective optimization to achieve its goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When do central authorities encourage experimentation, and when do they insist on strict enforcement of policies? This project examines how a single-party autocratic government issues a mixture of ambiguous and clear directives to guide policy experimentation, as well as the conditions under which different types of commands are issued.

Second, for comparative political scientists, the project will bring attention to and illuminate the neglected theme of adaptation in the study of authoritarianism.

The detection of these chemicals in various environmental matrices and living organisms (including humans) along with their high stability and toxicogenic potential have raised significant public health concerns. Conventional water and wastewater treatment processes are ineffective at removing and degrading these chemicals due to their highly stable carbon-fluorine bonds along with varying hydrophobicity and polarity. The goal of this proposed project is to design a new class of reactive nanocomposite membrane filters that will simultaneously separate these compounds from water and degrade them to less- or non-toxic byproducts. To achieve this goal, the principal investigators will combine expertise from nanomaterials, membrane separations, and ecotoxicity using novel planar two-dimensional  nanomaterials to fabricate catalytic nanofiltration membranes with high water flow rate, stability, and antifouling properties. This will enable removal and degradation of these chemicals which are priority pollutants as well as other emerging chemicals in this family of compounds. At the same time, the 2D nanomaterials and resulting byproducts will be tested for their toxicity to model organisms to determine the sustainability and effectiveness of this new  treatment process. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the development of fundamental knowledge about the new 2D nanomaterials and their interactions with these fluorinated compounds for the development of an integrated membrane reactor system that could serve both as a centralized water treatment system and a point-of-use filter for the treatment of water contaminated with these compounds.

Novel 2D nanomaterials with differing electronic and physicochemical properties, non-metallic phosphorene and metalloid hexagonal boron nitride that have shown evidence for degradation of these compounds, will be employed. This research project aims to address the knowledge gap on how these properties affect transformation, stability, and toxicity of the 2D hexagonal boron nitride and phosphorene nanosheets in free-standing form in aqueous media and after incorporating them onto nanocomposite membranes. The research team will examine the degradation potential of the 2D nanomaterials and their mechanisms of interactions with these compounds, identify breakdown products, and evaluate toxicity of their  degradation products using a model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, to verify that the breakdown products are less toxic than the initial chemicals. To achieve this, state-of-the-art nanoscale characterization techniques, molecular and thermodynamic modeling, analytical chemistry, and molecular biology techniques will be employed. Findings will provide knowledge about the potential transformation of non-carbon 2D nanomaterials and the overall stability of 2D nanomaterials which will be useful to understanding other non-carbon 2D materials with varied electronic and physicochemical properties. Furthermore, while the chemistry of blending non-carbon 2D nanomaterials onto polymeric membranes for the removal and destruction of emerging water pollutants is the focus here, the same chemistry can be used to fabricate air filtration membranes that would be able to potentially capture and destroy airborne toxins, such as viruses. This project will also strengthen the ongoing educational and outreach activities of the principal investigators by integrating research and education, mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, reaching out to community organizations, and engaging underrepresented students in STEM fields.

Amorphous selenium is the only disordered semiconductor that produces avalanche multiplication gain while exhibiting a very low excess noise factor due to non-ballistic and single-carrier impact ionization. The primary objective of this project is to fabricate and characterize high sensitivity solid-state photomultipliers by fully exploiting the deterministic avalanche multiplication properties of amorphous selenium via a solution-processed oxide blocking layer with a high dielectric constant. From the theoretical perspective, the noise-free nature of the hole impact ionization process will be modeled in amorphous selenium to enhance scientific insight into hot carrier transport in disordered structures. The resulting technology can be utilized in a wide range of advanced fields and applications such as medical diagnostic imaging, high energy physics, Cherenkov imaging detectors and trackers, optical communications, and time-domain spectroscopy. The broader impact of this project involves training of students (graduate, undergraduate, and under-represented) in this exciting field of research, and dissemination of tools and materials online.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Amorphous selenium is poised to revolutionize solid-state photodetection and imaging through its noise-free single-carrier avalanche multiplication gain. Currently, to achieve high dynamic range and linear mode operation, the detectors used for low-light detection are almost exclusively made of vacuum photomultiplier tubes, where only electrons exist and are multiplied deterministically by the dynodes. However, photomultiplier tubes are bulky, have poor quantum efficiency in the visible spectrum, and cannot be made into an imaging array. Although solid-state crystalline semiconductors are also used as avalanche photodiodes, the amount of enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio is often severely limited by excess noise due to the stochastic nature of the avalanche impact ionization process. Thus, the optimal signal-to-noise ratio typically occurs at very low gains. This work proposes a true solid-state alternative to the vacuum photomultiplier tube using amorphous selenium as the bulk avalanche i-layer, which is a unique disordered photosensing material. In this amorphous selenium layer, hole carrier transport can be shifted entirely from localized to extended states, where holes experience deterministic and non-Markovian impact ionization avalanche. To utilize this material property in devices and imagers, and to achieve reliable and repeatable avalanche gain without irreversible breakdown, a non-insulating n-type hole-blocking/electron-transporting layer is required. This work proposes use of room-temperature, solution-processed quantum-dots, as the high-k dielectric hole-blocking n-layer. Solution synthesis of colloidal quantum dots allows for high-quality stoichiometric and vacancy-free crystals with potential for room-temperature deposition in the desired reverse-biased p-i-n structure, without inducing any crystallization of amorphous selenium, as opposed to other incompatible high-temperature fabrication techniques. This methodology enables, for the first time, reaching an avalanche gain of 10E6 or beyond using a solid-state material. Computational models that explore the physics of the hole blocking layers shall be created to understand and optimize device performance. To this effect, an in-house kinetic Monte Carlo code used to model transport through defects will be developed.  Next, an in-house full-band Monte Carlo simulator, that utilizes the full band structure of selenium, will be established to examine the hole impact ionization process in bulk selenium. As a final step, the kinetic and the full-band Monte Carlo results will be coupled for computer-aided design simulations, to provide design guidelines for the fabrication of more efficient selenium photomultipliers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fully-implantable Bidirectional Brain Computer Interfaces (BBCI) are the focus of this project. These are electronic systems capable of recording, processing and stimulating neural activity, and they play a foundational role in enabling better understanding of the brain. Implantable BBCIs will enable neuro-scientists to explore brain function in unprecedented detail, and help realize neuro-prosthetic devices capable of restoring mobility, vision and brain function among the disabled. However, critical technological barriers facing BBCIs are hindering progress in neuroscience. Existing BBCI architectures do not scale well, in terms of power or area, to support ever-increasing numbers of recording and stimulation channels needed for finer examination and control of brain function. Furthermore, neural stimulation produces artifacts - electrical disturbances in the brain - that hamper the ability to perform neural recording. Finally, the desired level of computational performance required to perform neural signal processing and data-communication to external devices consumes power in excess of thermal limits of implantable devices. The technologies resulting from this project will be translated into a fully implantable, bio-compatible and versatile closed-loop neuroscience platform that overcomes these existing challenges. Collaborations with neuroscientists, the medical-device industry, and fabrication partners, to be pursued during this project, are critical to the realization of this goal.

Such types of data bring statistical challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by existing tools. This project seeks to provide foundational perspectives on the emerging inferential and computational challenges in modeling a population and populations of networks. The theory and methods developed here will allow us to characterize the network connectivity at the population-level, and to monitor how the subject-level connectivity changes as a function of subject characteristics. Quantifying such subject-level differences has become central in studying the human brain, genetics, and medicine in general.

Integration of research and education will be achieved through training undergraduate and graduate students, and developing special topics graduate courses.<br/><br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new network response model framework, in which the networks are treated as responses and the network-level covariates as predictors. The framework developed in this project, under appropriate structural constraints, will preserve the intrinsic characteristics of networks, ensure model identifiability, facilitate scalable computation, and allow valid statistical inference. A variety of fundamental and critical computational and inferential challenges will be addressed under this framework, including model identifiability, efficient computation, quantifying computational and statistical errors, and debiased inference.

The facility will promote advances in our understanding of Earth structure and dynamics, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and interactions between the solid Earth, hydrosphere, and atmosphere through management and operation of: 1) Global and regional continuously operating seismic networks, including the Global Seismographic Network; 2) Portable geophysical instrumentation for use in principal investigator driven and community experiments; 3) data management systems for the collection, quality assurance, curation, management, and distribution of open access data and data products; and 4) education, workforce development, and public outreach programs designed to be inclusive and enhance participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in the geosciences. The seismological facilities provided through the SAGE contribute to issues of national/global strategic importance, including geohazard assessment and disaster resilience; environmental management and economic development; national security; and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and workforce development. Data and data products from SAGE will be used by state and federal agencies including the United States Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense, for mission agency activities, including earthquake monitoring and characterization, tsunami warning, weather forecasting, water and environmental management, and nuclear test monitoring.

Researchers use SAGE to gain valuable insights into fundamental Earth processes, and SAGE also provides key data for national security needs, including monitoring efforts of clandestine nuclear tests. The scientific priorities of the new facility would enable advances in the following areas: (1) Global Earth Structure and Dynamics: The facility would enhance our ability to resolve the three-dimensional structure of the Earth's interior and enable investigators to study processes that drive plate tectonics and natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. (2) Fault Zones and the Earthquake Cycle: Over the last decade, scientists have discovered a broad array of fault zone slip behaviors that span a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales. The SAGE facility will enable a variety of seismic and electromagnetic measurements to elucidate how these different types of behaviors start and stop, vary along fault zones, and interact with one another. (3) Magmas and Volatiles in the Crust and Mantle: Geophysical instrumentation is critical for understanding volcanic systems and minimizing risks associated with volcanic hazards. The capabilities provided by SAGE will enable researchers to study melt production, monitor its transport through the crust, and map out the plumbing systems of volcanoes. (4) Hydrosphere, Cryosphere, and Atmosphere: An area of increasing community interest is utilizing geophysical measurements to study processes at the Earth's surface. The SAGE facility will provide opportunities to study processes in the near-surface, such as hydrology, cryospheric processes, and glacier dynamics.

When pores are connected, fluids can flow through them. Understanding and predicting fluid flow in porous media is important as it occurs in a wide range of applications, from contamination of groundwater and soil to printing on paper and fabrics. By understanding flow pathways, we can make accurate predictions of the fluid flow, which in turn, will help us design and control related processes. However, predicting fluid flow in porous media is still a long-standing problem. While observing fluid flow in simple two-dimensional porous media can be straightforward, the same is not true in more realistic three-dimensional cases. This proposal aims to carry out an integrated computational and experimental study to provide a more accurate description of flow pathways and realistic fluid flow and the resultant deformations in such materials.  <br/><br/>Although non-destructive 3D imaging has provided much information about fluid distribution in porous materials, fast and cost-effective 4D pore-scale visualization (i.e., over a period of time) is still very difficult, costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, although visualization of multiphase flow in porous media has been extensively studied in 2D models, there have been very few of such studies in 4D (or even 3D). One goal of this proposal is to develop a 4D method for visualization of two-phase flow in transparent porous media and the deformation that it induces in the media beyond the realm of creeping flow, i.e. when the flow is very slow. This goal will be achieved by collecting 2D images from various angles, which will then be used with a computational algorithm to build a highly detailed 4D image of the multiphase flow. Detailed computations will be carried out in which the two-phase fluid flow and the resulting deformation will be simulated in the same porous media beyond creeping flow. The investigators will also study and identify the critical Reynolds number (Re) at which the transition from the Darcy regime to Forchheimer and eventually turbulent flows occurs. The effect of wettability on the deformation of porous media during two-phase flow will also be investigated. Distinct deformation modes of a porous medium will also be examined under a wide range of Reynolds number and wettability conditions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Fluid Dynamics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Targeted drug delivery is one of the most promising approaches which relies on nanoparticles (NPs) that carry and release drugs.  The therapeutic efficacy of NP-based drug carriers is determined by the proper concentration of drug molecules at the lesion site.  NPs need to be delivered directly to the diseased tissues while minimizing their uptake by other tissues, thereby reducing the potential harm to healthy tissue.  Therefore, the design of these NPs and hence the efficacy of the targeted drug delivery could be significantly improved by understanding how the drugs carried by NPs are transported and dispersed in human body.  This project proposes a set of computational tools to model and investigate the transport and dispersion of NPs in human vasculature.  This, in turn, can provide better imaging sensitivity, therapeutic efficacy and lower toxicity of NP-based drug carriers.  The multidisciplinary nature of the project also brings together concepts from biology, engineering and computer science to educate the next generation of computational biologists, scientists and engineers. This research, thus, aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare. <br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to create a hybrid finite element and molecular dynamics computational approach for modeling NP transport and adhesion in human vasculature.  The realistic geometry of vascular network and fluid dynamics of blood flow are accurately captured through the finite element model.  The microscopic interactions between NPs and red blood cells within blood flow and adhesion of NPs to vessel wall are resolved through the molecular dynamics simulation.  A robust and efficient coupling interface is built to couple the finite element and molecular dynamics solvers.  Specifically, this project aims to 1) create a multiscale and multiphysics computational model for predicting the vascular dynamics of NPs under the influence of realistic geometrical and physiochemical features of human vasculature; 2) craft an interface coupling technique that enhances computational accuracy and predictability by coupling the finite element and molecular dynamics solvers; 3) build testsuits for multiscale and multiphysics simulations for coupled solution error and convergence analysis; and 4) advance the current cyberinfrastructure to accelerate the material design process and enrich the cyber-enabled materials design community.  Such a computational method can be used to explore how the vascular dynamics of NPs will be affected by their size, shape, surface and stiffness properties, as well as complex geometry of human vasculature.  The simulation results can further guide experimentalists to design NP-mediated drug delivery platforms that optimally accumulate within diseased tissue to provide better imaging sensitivity, therapeutic efficacy and lower toxicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, however, the number of appeals within common law judiciaries have significantly increased while the number of cases heard by High Courts has remained relatively stable. In light of burgeoning caseloads, the intermediate appellate courts effectively serve as the court of last resort for the vast majority of judicial appeals. This project develops, assesses, and advances a new and innovative theoretical framework on the dynamic transmission of information between two tiers of courts across the judiciaries of Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of hierarchical influences on judicial decision making within a comparative context. Specifically, this project explores hierarchical interactions between lower intermediate appellate court judges and their High Court counterparts in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The comparative focus of this project presents scholars, policymakers, and practitioners with exciting, innovative, and new opportunities to explore how ideological and institutional differences within judicial systems and different tiers of the judiciary can influence decision making. This project also contributes to a broader understanding of courts in a comparative context by illustrating that scholars cannot easily assume that frameworks developed for American courts are automatically transportable to other countries. Beyond contributions to the academic sphere, the proposed project has broad policy and social impacts. Understanding how judges behave in this dynamic decision making process is necessary for understanding how law and policy is developed and how institutional designs seemingly condition judicial decision-making behavior. <br/><br/>The extensive data collection, both quantitative and qualitative, for the project will facilitate the sharing of a vast database of information on appellate courts and hierarchical responses to Supreme Court precedents for a variety of future analyses. The database of intermediate court decisions assembled for this project provides a valuable supplement to the National High Courts Database. The combination of new and reliable data on two tiers of the courts has the potential to foster extensive new analyses for academic faculty, students, and legal professionals. By providing comparable data on the intermediate courts over a substantial period of time, this study will create a rich resource that will enable future research on judicial policy making in a variety of settings. Such data will benefit both established scholars as well as their students including doctoral students throughout related disciplines seeking data for comparative judicial dissertation projects. This project also incorporates the insights gained from in-depth interviews with judges to provide a more nuanced understanding of the way judges understand their approach to decision making. These resources hold significant promise for many analyses beyond this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Turbulence in the OSBL distributes biogeochemical and ecologically relevant tracers that are floatable (buoyant), such as plankton, bubbles, nutrients, oil, and microplastics. Wind and waves drive OSBL turbulence in several critical ways: Wind-generated ocean currents; wave-current interactions result in wind-aligned vortices, called Langmuir turbulence (LT); and breaking waves inject turbulent kinetic energy to the subsurface . The present conceptual and theoretical framework of wave-driven OSBL dynamics is largely based on conditions for which surface heat fluxes are assumed to be either neutral or conducive to overturn the surface water column. However, diurnal heating or rain events prevent overturning and are omnipresent over the world oceans. This project would use numerical simulations and analysis of existing data sets to explore the effects of surface waves on the stratified OSBL in surface heating conditions. The objectives of this study are to: (1) identify limitations of traditional surface boundary assumptions due to wave effects; (2) reveal the dynamics of wave effects on the heated OSBL, based on a systematic analysis of momentum, buoyancy, and turbulent kinetic energy; (3) integrate data and simulations to establish a turbulence regime diagram that reveals the conditions in which Langmuir turbulence (LT) and breaking wave effects affect OSBL dynamics; (4) perform an analysis of turbulence statistics to assess and proposes improved ocean mixing parameterizations. These new parameterizations will be applied to demonstrate the importance of wave effects on the transport of buoyant tracers during diurnal OSBL heating. The work will be relevant across many oceanographic and atmospheric sub-disciplines; support an early career researcher; train graduate students; and engage in outreach. <br/> <br/>The proposed research will test specific hypotheses: (1) wave effects on heated OSBL dynamics are significant and quantifiable through observations and simulations; (2) LT is essential for OSBL mixing but sufficiently strong heating generates favorable conditions for shear-driven turbulence due to jets; (3) breaking waves prevent flow laminarization in strong heating conditions; and (4) wave-driven mixing in heated OSBLs can be accurately represented in improved turbulent mixing parameterizations to capture accelerated jet transport and the deep submergence of buoyant tracers. The team has access to several extensive observational data-sets, from which they will be able to determine the presence of LT during surface heating and assess the impact of LT on OSBL dynamics. Numerical experiments will be conducted using Large Eddy Simulations (LES) which produce LT through vortex forcing and include effects from breaking waves. Based on results from a combined data, LES modeling analysis, physics-motivated and practical mixing parameterizations for the heated OSBL will be developed, assessed, and applied to transport of buoyant tracers, such as microplastics, plankton or oil.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cardiac Operating Room (OR) is a complex environment where healthcare professionals from multiple disciplines -- including surgeons, anesthesiologists, perfusionists, and nurses -- collaborate to administer this life-critical care. To successfully administer care, all members of the surgical team are expected to perform their tasks in lockstep and with full awareness of dynamic situations encountered during surgery. However, achieving such ideal teamwork is difficult in the complex environment of cardiac OR, where human performance is adversely affected by factors such as high workload, fatigue, and interruptions or disruptions during surgery. This project addresses an urgent need for mitigating these preventable human errors and improving patient safety through the design of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled coaching system (AI Coach) for monitoring, assessing, and enhancing surgical teamwork in the cardiac OR.  Central to the functioning of the AI Coach will be a set of novel machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence algorithms to computationally generate interpretable feedback and interventions for enhancing surgical teamwork based on multimodal sensor data. The project will train students in the multi-disciplinary research area of Smart Health. The project will increase public engagement with AI, by incorporating the research results into a planned museum exhibit on human-AI collaboration.<br/>	<br/>The project?s overarching goal is to design the AI Coach system comprised of multimodal sensing hardware, data-driven algorithms, and a user interface to enhance surgical teamwork in the cardiac OR. AI Coach will achieve its objectives by pursuing two parallel strategies: (i) addressing the problem of modeling surgical teamwork; (ii) computationally generating feedback to improve this teamwork. The project team will first develop a novel Team Markov Model (TMkM) that reflects the surgical team?s mental model. Then, the computational core of the system will be realized through the development of (a) machine learning algorithms based on novel multi-agent imitation learning methods to arrive at predictive models of teamwork that explicitly depend on latent performance-shaping factors, such as mental models, and (ii) explainable AI techniques to computationally generate interpretable feedback and interventions for enhancing teamwork. Due to the challenge of collecting large data sets of surgical teamwork, the algorithm development will emphasize sample- and label-efficient techniques. The project team will prototype and test usability of the integrated system by employing iterative, user-centered design approaches. The solutions will be developed and evaluated using multi-modal expert-annotated data of surgical teamwork and prototyped in a state-of-the-art OR simulation facility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These applications require a large data storage system that is fast, elastic, cost-effective, and easy-to-use. Unfortunately, current cloud storage offerings are unable to satisfy all of these requirements: big data analytics applications can run up to 500X slower when they run as a cloud-native application using a cloud object store; provisioning more cloud storage resources does not solve the performance problem and storage over-provisioning leads to millions of dollars of extra cost. This project rethinks the design and implementation of next-generation, cloud-native storage infrastructures via a new approach. This approach is enabled by a novel take on the serverless computing paradigm -- serverless functions are elastic and truly pay-per-use, making them a fast and inexpensive storage medium. This project aims to build InfiniStore, a new cloud storage system, which elastically scales in response to constantly changing data access patterns by orchestrating the collective memory of serverless functions. Following an end-to-end, stacked approach, this project will develop an elastic and inexpensive memory store using serverless functions, techniques that provide strong consistency guarantees for data replicated in serverless functions, fault tolerance mechanisms to maximize the data availability in highly unreliable serverless environments, and a scalable serverless file metadata service to support file semantics.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to redefine cloud storage pricing models -- InfiniStore enables memory-store-level pay-per-access that lets cloud users pay for the data they access. This project will enable, in a broad range of disciplines, the development of new, stateful, serverless applications that have not been previously possible. All artifacts will be open source to support the use and development both in academia and industry. This project has an integrated educational plan, which also harnesses serverless computing but uses it to develop a new serverless notebook cloud service, called InfiniCloud, for interdisciplinary education. InfiniCloud will allow educators and students to write and run serial or parallel Python programs at any scale, without needing to manage servers or clusters. Moreover, this project will use InfiniStore and InfiniCloud as a basis for various educational activities including curriculum development, diversity building, undergraduate engagement, and workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among these technologies, quantum communication is foreseen to create broad near-term impacts as seen in recent quantum testbeds, teleportation, and entanglement distribution experiments. It is also envisaged to underpin future's fully connected quantum computers, quantum sensors, and a global secure communication network. Mainstream quantum communication platforms, however, rely on expensive, unscalable bulk optics components that impede their widespread deployment. While recent work on integrated quantum communication devices opens a new route to the development of compact quantum-communication systems, an integrated quantum photonics platform encompassing multiple, functional modules on a single chip to generate and process large-scale entanglement remains elusive. <br/>This collaborative project will develop a room-temperature integrated quantum photonics platform that incorporates quantum communication modules for scalable generation, processing, multicasting, and detection of large-scale multipartite entanglement in a quantum communication network. This project will leverage the nanofabrication and testing expertise at UCLA and the Interdisciplinary Quantum Information Research and Engineering (INQUIRE) testbed at the University of Arizona (UA) to demonstrate the capability of utilizing a highly compact and mass producible integrated platform to generate, multicast, and detect large-scale entanglement in a real-world setting. The outcome of the project will lay the foundation for future's quantum internet comprised of compact devices linked by large-scale multipartite entanglement. This project will educate and train the next-generation workforce for quantum information science and technology. Specifically, undergraduate and graduate students will grasp essential knowledge and expertise of nanophotonics and quantum information science and technology.

The physical architecture will consist of programmable quantum sources, processing units, and receivers using the silicon nitride material system that offer dramatic functionalities. Through &#55349;&#57164;(3 four-wave mixing in microring resonators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers, the silicon nitride chipset section will produce and process quantum signals with high fidelity and low loss. The silicon nitride section will also provide a classical frequency comb to serve as the pump for the microring resonators and phase references for the Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Programming of the quantum sources, processing units, and receivers will be by modulating the classical comb spectral lines in an integrated hybrid silicon section. In our frequency comb cluster system, the quantum signals will be immune to the programming-induced loss and disturbance. The integrated quantum photonics platform will be programmed to support two system-level quantum communication implementations: 1) a high-rate secure communication system based on quantum illumination; and 2) an entanglement multicasting and purification demonstration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Online platforms make it easier for workers to find short-term work and for employers to hire freelancers for their short-term needs. Such short-term work arrangements offer workers the independence and flexibility they desire, while at the same time allowing companies to momentarily tap into external knowledge and experiences their workforce lacks. However, short-term workers today exist on the fringes of their temporary workplaces and find it challenging to build social connections within the organizations that hire them, affecting both their well-being and productivity negatively. Workers from minority or marginalized groups are particularly impacted negatively. This project will develop a research program that accelerates assimilation into future work settings through a unique partnership with two industry collaborators, who operate at very different scales and rely on freelancers to varying degrees: one partner is a small business with fewer than a hundred permanent employees, the other partner is a large, multinational information-technology and research company that operates in many countries. In coordination with these partners, the researchers will organize a series of workshops to create a focused research agenda that is beneficial for workers and organizations broadly. Based on this agenda, the project team will include diverse stakeholders, such as industry representatives, workers, and researchers, who can then make progress on this research agenda. This planned research will also train graduate students across multiple disciplines, including computer science, social sciences, and organizational science. Given the central emphasis on inclusion and access, the project will place particular emphasis on recruiting women, students of color, and first-generation students to contribute to this research. <br/><br/>This project brings together several disciplines, including learning science, computer science, and social psychology.

The research is highly integrative and converges expertise from social/behavioral sciences and computer/learning science. The team is structured to achieve multiple convergent goals: To address the need for rapid assimilation of on-demand workers into organizations, this research will uncover the social and technical needs for digital and physical environments that accelerate newcomer situated learning and assimilation. Second, it will build a diverse and cross-disciplinary team to build such environments in planned future research. Finally, this project will positively impact a highly skilled, and economically significant workforce of information workers at large, and the project's research agenda is likely to particularly help female and underrepresented workers be more included in the workforce.

Lightnings most commonly occur during thunderstorms as electrostatic charges accumulate in clouds.  Lightnings have also been found to occur on Mars, believed to be created by dust storms.  Though not as common as on Earth because of low atmosphere pressure, such lightnings can be a hazard to instruments on Mars with metal objects acting like a lightning rod.  The multiplication of robotic explorers at the surface of the planet has increased the chances of such electric discharges, increasing risks for instruments and an ever-more likely human-exploration.<br/><br/>This CAREER research outlines a five-year effort to study the physics and observability of electrical discharges in atmospheric conditions representative of Earth and Mars. The investigators suggest a comprehensive study combining theory and experiments centered on discharges produced in air at pressures ranging from 6 to 1013 mbar, to examine the differences between discharges started from a hot, cylindrical or spherical electrode, and the electrification observed in the tribocharging of regoliths and sand grains.  The principal objective is to further our understanding of the physics of electrical discharge in diverse environments. In particular, this research seeks to resolve the following outstanding issues in planetary electricity: (1) Can geometric factors adequately explain the difference between theoretical and observed lightning initiation thresholds? (2) Can modeling help assess the nature (glow, streamer, leader) of atmospheric breakdown occurring in the form of Transient Luminous Events or putative Martian lightning? (3) Can tribocharging lead to the initiation of such non-conventional discharges?<br/><br/>The research plan aims to: <br/>?	produce the formulation of a new, generalized model of electron avalanche initiated from a hot cylindrical or spherical electrode,<br/>?	create a 3-D fractal models of extraterrestrial discharges and estimates of their electric charges and dipole moments,<br/>?	make quantitative measurements of the electrification in a scaled Martian dust event,<br/>?	disseminate of academic research outside academia through Astronomy on Tap talks, and<br/>?	create a summer camp using LEGO Mindstorms to introduce middle-schoolers to programing and space science through an innovative and engaging approach.<br/><br/>The success of this project will directly impact the design of future instruments for the detection of extraterrestrial atmospheric electricity by identifying the most measurable changes due to non-conventional lightning. It will also help to assess the risk of initiating discharges from surface objects in particular in the framework of Martian exploration.

Studies of organizational sustainability of such practices are rare, particularly in Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions. Also, few such initiatives have been sustained significantly over time. The Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI), a 16-year-old consortium of 40 HSI computer science departments and other partners dedicated to improving racial equity, is one rare long-lasting initiative in this arena. Studying this consortium provides the opportunity to inform organizational change and adaptive strategies to mitigate often long-standing institutional practices that have led to inequitable participation in the computing field. INSPIRE?s goals are to (1) strengthen understanding of equity-centered student success strategies to mitigate systemic inequities in the computing enterprise, (2) support organizational sustainability of equity-centered student success strategies in HSIs, and (3) extend a transferable model of equity-centered student success in computing to other institutions.<br/><br/>The project aims to achieve three primary outcomes. First, to advance research on equity-centered student success practices that mitigate institutional racism and advance racial equity in computing. Second, to create a platform to elevate and give voice to student-, staff-, faculty-, and administrator-developed practical approaches to integrate and sustain these strategies. Finally, to develop a transferable and culturally sustaining model of organizational transformation. The project?s scope includes mixed methods quantitative and qualitative research with CAHSI computing departments. The INSPIRE team will also strive to build capacity in these computing departments to sustain organizational change toward racial equity. The approach will include quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, and in-depth qualitative case studies of four CAHSI departments. The case studies will involve interviews and observations to study how key stakeholders encounter challenges and opportunities to implementing and sustaining equity-centered practices. These stakeholders include faculty, administrators, staff, and students. The project team will share data and generate feedback to build departments? capacity to sustain equity-oriented organizational change during these activities. One expected result is an enhanced understanding of equity-centered student success strategies and the organizational conditions that hinder or enhance the adoption and sustainability of these strategies. Another is a model of computing student success to mitigate institutional racism in computing and STEM at all institutions. The INSPIRE team will disseminate research and professional development through webinars, publications, presentations, and interactive workshops. Dissemination will focus on inclusive and equitable departmental practices, such as community-building and intersectional approaches to learning and research, that can be directly applied to raise minoritized students? computing success. Dissemination efforts will address audiences in multiple roles, including students, staff, faculty, and administrators. <br/><br/>This project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EHR Racial Equity). The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. This program aligns with NSF?s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation's diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations. Funds for EHR Racial Equity are pooled from programs across EHR in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.

With mortality as high as 80% in cases of ruptures, abdominal aortic aneurysm accounts for more than 10,000 deaths in the United States every year. One of the most common treatments is endovascular aneurysm repair, which redirects blood flow away from the aortic wall and bypasses the weak spots by implanting a covered stent graft in the aneurysm sac via a minimally invasive procedure. Among the stent recipients, 30% of them can experience persistent blood flow into the aneurysm sac, called ?endoleak,? leading to aneurysm expansion and rupture. Thus, blood pressure and flow near the stent should be periodically monitored. However, the commonly used imaging technique is highly dependent on patient compliance, and its repeatedly administrated iodinated contrast poses a risk of chronic kidney disease. As such, the overall objective of this research is to create a Smart Stent based on a flexible and battery-less membrane-based sensor and wireless bioelectronics with a deep-learning algorithm to realize automated diagnosis of endoleak. This collaborative research will integrate the scientific findings and discoveries with educational venues for students across disciplines (Electrical and Mechanical Engineering), generations (K-12 to lifelong learners), and two institutes (Temple University and Kansas State University).<br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to develop a Smart Stent for post-endovascular aneurysm repair surveillance that combines a flexible, and battery-less bioelectronic system with a deep-learning algorithm to realize automated diagnosis of endoleak. The central hypothesis is that Smart Stent, created by conformally weaving piezoelectric porous membrane sensors inside and outside of the conventional stent graft, will bring a novel electromechanical wireless biotelemetry scheme whose sensor data can be directly analyzed by a deep-learning model for classification of complex hemodynamics. The intellectual merits of the proposed research include 1) design of an auxetic porous piezoelectric membrane for the Smart Stent that is optimized for the multi-modal sensing of blood pressure and flow, 2) microfabrication  of complex 3D structure and surface-integrated micro coils for near-field magnetic induction communication, 3) a novel electromechanical interrogation scheme that converts energy from physiological information (e.g., blood pressure and flow) into wireless magnetic induction signals, 4) a comprehensive evaluation using a precise aneurysm phantom model to build baseline data for cardiovascular research, and 5) a deep learning-enabled sensing classification algorithm that offers real-time, quantitative, and automated assessment of five different types of endoleak. The research will establish a machine learning-enabled wireless sensing system that will spur new theory and understanding for the next generation implantable biomedical system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this regime, multiple agents (e.g., processors or sensors) communicate their information locally with their neighbors to cooperatively optimize a global performance metric. This decentralized paradigm plays a key role in the network domains where communication with a centralized coordinator is either undesirable or impossible. This also allows for preserving the privacy of the agents. It is for these reasons that the design and performance analysis of decentralized optimization methods have attracted a growing attention in several application domains such as data science, wireless networks, and communication networks. This project is aimed at development of new models, mathematical tools, and computational algorithms to address emerging complex multi-agent systems. This complexity arises in emerging applications such as remote sensing, economic dispatch models with renewable energy, and efficiency estimation in transportation networks. This project has the potential to substantially reduce the gap between the theory and real-world practice of complex multi-agent networks. Moreover, collaborations with the industrial partner will facilitate effective knowledge transfer. This project is also aimed at increasing awareness and interest among high school students, educators, and college students through several fully integrated educational and outreach activities. These include enhancing professional development of teachers of Stillwater High School, engaging secondary students in after school activities, and promoting diversity through involvement of underrepresented undergraduate students in research. <br/><br/>The long-term research goal is to advance the computational models and algorithms for distributed constrained optimization in emerging complex multi-agent networks. In pursuit of this goal, the research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to apply the theory of variational inequalities and regularization in the field of distributed optimization to design new algorithms with provable performance guarantees that can address multi-agent networks with complex constraints. This complexity arises in several application domains such as wireless sensor networks, transportation networks, and machine learning, where the optimization model is complicated due to the presence of:  (1) uncertainty and nonlinearity in constraints; (2) an inner-level large-scale optimization problem; or (3) equilibrium constraints. The state-of-the-art approaches including weighted-averaging consensus, push-sum, and alternate direction multiplier methods work often under the premise that functional constraints are easy-to-project. These schemes rely significantly on Lagrangian duality theory and do not lend themselves to asynchronous protocols and communication delays. Accordingly, this research is expected to advance the area of distributed optimization over complex networks by: (i) Development of an enhanced mathematical modeling framework by utilizing the theory of variational inequalities; (ii) Design and analysis of new classes of iteratively regularized consensus-based algorithms with explicit performance bounds to address the modeling framework; and (iii) Explore novel ways to address nonsmoothness in the modeling framework. The long-term educational goal is to broaden the participation of K-12 and college students (in particular women and underrepresented minorities in STEM) in the fields of Operations Research and Applied Mathematics. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective of this CAREER project is to inspire and engage young minds, formal and informal educators, and undergraduate and graduate students in understanding the role of optimization in tomorrow?s practice. This includes the following activities: (i) provide four-week professional development workshops for secondary teachers; (ii) develop an after school STEM program for Stillwater High School students; (iii) involve underrepresented undergraduate students in the PI?s research in collaboration with The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation; and (iv) develop an undergraduate and an advanced doctoral course.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Energy, Power, Control, and Networks Program (EPCN), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Operations Engineering Program (OE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data generated from end-user devices has tremendous value to the research community. For example, mobile and Internet-of-Things devices can participate in large-scale Internet-based measurement or monitoring of patient's health conditions. While ground-breaking discovered may occur, malicious attacks or unintentional data leaks threaten the research data. Such a threat is hard to predict and difficult to recover from once it happens. Preventative and defensive measures should be taken where data is generated in order to protect private, valuable data from the attackers. Currently, there are efforts that try to regulate data management, for example, a research application might have a privacy policy that describes how the user data is being collected and protected. However, there is a disconnect between these documented policies and the implementations of a research project. In this project, the investigators propose to interpret the documented policies and enforce them in research projects, in order to protect the privacy of research data. This work can significantly reduce researchers' overhead in implementing policy-compliant code and reduce the complexity of protecting research datasets.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators provide a solution that protects research data using policies mandated by different regulatory entities, such as an application store and an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract security and privacy requirements from unstructured regulatory documents and translates these requirements to code that can patch a program that does not comply with the policies. The solution covers the lifetime of research data protection, from data collection to data storage, and data processing. This research has two thrusts. First, the investigators will build novel NLP techniques to extract security and privacy policies from unstructured, sparsely-labeled documents such as IRB protocols, and privacy disclosure of research applications. Second, the investigators will enforce these extracted policies in code, through context-aware program analysis to discover inconsistencies between a researcher's implementation and the extracted policies, and instrument researcher?s code to enforce compliant program behavior. The results of this work will have a transformative impact on the development of the next generation research data protection techniques, and more defensive security and privacy practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These applications depend on very large amounts of data. This data must be used in a fast and efficient manner. The use of large supercomputers to analyze such data is on the rise. The techniques they use are referred to as deep learning (DL) high-performance computing (HPC). Researchers are using DL HPC to make sense of this flood of data and obtain useful information. To do this they must redesign HPC systems. A key challenge is how to use resources such as data storage and computer memory at a huge scale. This project will build Metis, a high-performance data storage system that uses new, end-to-end, hardware-supported memory and storage design to meet the needs of DL HPC applications. The goal is to satisfy the challenge posed by increasing data management performance for next-generation supercomputers. The project will connect several different computing communities and increase interactions among them. The project includes educational and engagement activities which will greatly increase the community's understanding of HPC systems. These activities include broadening participation activities to attract and retain new students. Special emphasis will be given to students from underrepresented groups. The project will encourage student interest in design and research in large-scale computing systems design.<br/><br/>This project brings together researchers in micro-architecture, distributed computing systems, namely cloud and HPC systems, storage systems, and power/energy modeling to boost DL HPC data processing performance. The research will yield a fundamentally new software-hardware co-designed memory compression technique that transparently compresses DL application memories with negligible runtime performance overhead. Metis will leverage the novel compression substrate to enable a distributed, intelligent, operating-system-level data cache that effectively exploits the physical memory freed via program-memory compression. The developed techniques will open doors for innovative HPC and scientific applications in a broad range of disciplines, which have not been previously possible. Metis' focus on addressing the challenges of increasing performance in the Exascale era, along with engaging researchers from multiple areas, aligns it very well with the goals and objectives of the SPX program. Additionally, the research will also create new knowledge on design principles of memory compression, and yield insights to provide seamless integration of DL applications into the next-generation DL-aware supercomputer infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biodegradable TPEs are promising recyclable and sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact. They have the potential to be used as protective coatings for cell phones, artificial muscles for soft robotics, and polymer electrolytes for batteries. However, few of these applications have been effectively realized due to the limited understanding of TPEs' synthesis-structure-property relation. This research project aims to understand and quantify the link between synthesis, microstructure, and mechanical property of TPEs, with the help of multi-scale computational modeling, data science (machine learning), and experimental validation. With tailored mechanical properties, these biodegradable and environmentally friendly polymers can be widely used to enable an array of novel structural and device applications, alleviating the plastic pollution crisis. The project includes an education and outreach plan to train diverse groups of next-generation engineers through a variety of avenues: production of educational movies for the general public and K-12 students, engineering education for K-12 students through Pre-Engineering and Explore Engineering Programs, and providing research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, especially the underrepresented groups, through internships at industries and national labs.<br/> <br/>The research objective of this project is to formulate a machine-learned coarse-grained model for TPEs with thermodynamic consistency, temperature transferability, and representability. TPEs are segmented copolymers composed of hard segments and soft segments, forming a two-phase microstructure. Thus, the machine-learned coarse-grained model can be used to understand microphase separation and its contribution to mechanical behaviors of TPEs, leading to the well-defined synthesis-structure-property relation. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) establish the machine-learned coarse-grained model for TPEs through deep neural networks and an active learning scheme; 2) integrate coarse-grained molecular simulations and constitutive modeling to achieve a meaningful structure-property relation of TPEs; 3) explore a novel class of sequence-defined TPEs with tailored microstructures and mechanical properties. The fundamental understanding of the synthesis-structure-property relationship will highlight a clear design path for experimentalists to utilize biodegradable TPEs for a broad range of applications, e.g., sound and vibration damping materials, shape-memory materials, and adaptive solar control materials. This computational framework can be readily adapted and generalized to many other polymeric materials for understanding their structure-property relations, such as fatigue-resistant hydrogels and protein-mimetic polymers, with phase-separated microstructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The majority of type 1 patients are not successful in achieving target blood glucose levels and control has actually been worsening in recent years despite expanded use of technologies. Inadequately controlled diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack and peripheral vascular disease possibly leading to amputation and in some cases death. Joint use of a continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump is considered the current gold standard for management of type-1 diabetes. Existing technologies, however, suffer from two well-established limitations: high user burden due to the need for manual ?meal announcements? to estimate insulin doses and low adherence to glucose monitoring devices due to the inconvenience of constantly breaking the skin for sensor insertion and irritation from the sensor adhesive. Thus, there is an urgent need in public health for fully automated, closed-loop glycemic control for type-1 diabetes patients, which will be the focus of the proposed research.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The proposed work aims to develop and pilot a joint multimodal sensing system that can provide continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring data in addition to automated meal detection with an estimate of meal intake. Both types of information are necessary to inform artificial pancreas algorithms for prediction of bolus (i.e. short-acting) insulin dose needs. More specifically, the proposed system is in the form of an ear-worn device, tackling key systems and algorithmic challenges to realize a fully closed-loop artificial pancreas system. The intellectual merits of the proposed work are following. First, it will develop novel system designs to realize fine-grained, robust dietary sensing by fusing three streams of signals (i.e., bio-electrical signals, motion, and acoustic signals); Second, it will advance existing optical-based noninvasive glucose monitoring by addressing challenges of skin scattering and mitigating the impact of confounding factors and user diversity; Third, it will present new energy-efficient machine learning models dedicated to enabling local execution at micro-controllers, dealing with the limited number of labeled training data, and ensuring data privacy and communication efficiency; Finally, it will characterize and validate biological and behavioral biomarkers most relevant to diabetes management for implementing an artificial pancreas systems and develop new approaches for adaptive sampling and noise handling to ensure accurate monitoring of target events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This collaborative project involves investigators at Drexel University (Award DUE-2111128) and Wright State University (Award DUE-2111275). Education research has shown that using an ""active learning"" approach is central to improving students' learning in STEM classes. In physics, many different teaching methods fall under the umbrella of ""active learning,"" but the specifics of how the methods differ from one another are not clear. One way in which all active learning classes are the same is that the students interact more with each other than they do in standard lectures. In this project, the investigators will attempt to identify the important features of active learning in physics by collecting data on what students and instructors are doing during class and how students are interacting with each other. Then they will attempt to relate these data to improved student learning. This research will help instructors make decisions about which teaching methods are best for their population of students.<br/><br/>This project will build on exploratory research that the investigators conducted during a previous project that was funded by NSF Awards DUE-1711017 and DUE-1712341, ""Collaborative Research: Characterizing Active Learning Environments in Physics."" That research analyzed differences among active learning environments using network analysis and the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS). The focus was on a small number of sites that represented high-fidelity, high-quality implementations of six active learning pedagogies. The investigators discovered recurring mid-scale network structures across pedagogies, with fine-grained models beginning to identify smaller-scale features. In addition, by using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) on COPUS observations, the investigators found that the COPUS presents distinct profiles for the different pedagogies that were examined. In the new project, the investigators will extend the baseline data from the pilot project, exploring whether the patterns are broadly repeated at other implementation sites of the same pedagogies and how they relate to student outcomes. In particular, the investigators will extend their previous work by collecting and analyzing data from 32 different sites and by coordinating the existing network and COPUS measures with student outcome data. Key aims of the research will be (1) to characterize implementations of active learning curricula in physics in terms of student-student interactions and instructor and student activity within each learning environment, (2) to survey common features of student-student network development across active learning environments, and (3) to integrate data on student networks and COPUS profiles in relation to student outcomes. The additional data and analyses should enable researchers to identify the specific features of active learning environments that contribute to specific student outcomes.

Recent advances in computing and data science, and the data revolution in each of these domains have now provided a means to address these questions. The investigators jointly establish the PRISM Cooperative Institute for pioneering the integration of large-scale, multi-resolution, dynamic data across different domains to improve the prediction of risks (potentials for extreme outcomes and system failures).

In healthy conditions, a highly efficient innate host defense system continually monitors and heals the wounds in an orderly and timely manner. However, the prevalence of diabetes, obesity, poor circulation, neuropathy, difficulty in moving, or aging can cause wounds unresolvable for several months. Further complications such as a particular microbial consortium can cause destructive inflammation, often resulting in significant morbidity. To effectively manage the wound, this research develops the next-generation wound treatment that enables simultaneous wound healing and antimicrobial effects by exploring a microneedle-mediated, wound state adaptive (via pH level), localized phototherapy. We henceforth call it a Microneedle-mediated Adaptive Phototherapy or MAP wound dressing. Combined, the MAP wound dressing that integrates self-diagnosis and autonomous treatment may lead to a translational solution for wound healing. This collaborative research will integrate the scientific findings and discoveries with educational venues for mentoring graduate students in research, generations (K-12 to lifelong learners), and two institutes (Kansas State University and Temple University).<br/><br/>Central to this research project is a new approach of a one-of-a-kind in-situ phototherapy, Microneedle-mediated Adaptive Phototherapy (MAP) wound dressing that uniquely enables longitudinal 3D spatial wound sensing and multifunctional pH-sensitive treatment, aiming at physical tissue healing and pathogenetic bacterial infections. The central hypothesis is that the MAP can autonomously treat chronic wounds, controlled by the state of the wound (i.e., pH level), without the need for any electronics or interaction with medical professionals. Depending on the regional state of the wound, the MAP wound dressing positions the microneedles either in the highly bacterial active region or the acute wounds. Simultaneously, the MAP changes its body color depending on the wound state and converts the natural light into blue for sanitizing or red light for accelerating tissue regeneration. The light delivery occurs through microneedles tips, allowing localized phototherapy. Notably, the MAP wound dressing includes conduits for 1) the advanced diffraction microlithography technique that realizes complex 3D structured microneedles, which will act as an optical waveguide with an innate lens effect; 2) the wound state-driven self-actuation using pH-sensitive micropatterned hydrogel and adaptive optical filter by infusing pH dye in the hydrogel; and 3) ex vivo studies to build preclinical data for chronic wound sensing and treatments. Therefore, a novel wound dressing aimed at deep light penetrating, the adaptive wavelength converting PBM therapy could be a superior substitute for conventional wound dressing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Houston region represents a unique region of study, where isolated clouds and thunderstorms are common, there is a sea breeze due to the nearby Gulf of Mexico, and there are specific sources of aerosol due to urban and industrial emissions.  The research team will deploy research aircraft, ground based radars, and a variety of other sensors to characterize the environment in and around growing clouds.  The data will be analyzed and incorporated into numerical models to answer questions about the role of temperature, moisture, winds, and aerosols in the formation and development of clouds and precipitation.  This research will help to improve high-resolution simulations of extreme or high-impact events in highly populated coastal regions.  The research will also have wide relevance to climate models, where aerosol/cloud interactions are difficult to simulate.  Early career researchers and students will gain experience in conducting observational research.  Outreach activities will also provide opportunities for enhanced public awareness of thunderstorm and flooding hazards.  <br/><br/>The Experiment of Sea Breeze Convection, Aerosols, Precipitation and Environment (ESCAPE) is planned for June and July 2021 in the Houston metropolitan area.  ESCAPE will provide measurements that will be used symbiotically with high-resolution models to improve simulations of the lifecycle of isolated convective cells, including the effects of interactive aerosol, microphysical, and kinematic processes on observable cloud, precipitation, and electrification signatures.  The research team plans to methodically advance observation-based understanding of fundamental convective cloud processes and aerosol impacts on these processes by deploying a host of instruments in a targeted geographic region.  The main airborne platform would be the NSF/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) C-130 research aircraft with a wide range of cloud microphysical measurements.  On the ground, the PIs would coordinate multiple radars, radiosondes, swarmsondes, and the Houston Lightning Mapping Array.  The campaign will coordinate with the Department of Energy deployment of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement mobile facility and make use of existing measurements of air quality in the Houston area.  The observational data would be combined with modeling using WRF and RAMS to address the following science objectives:  1) Investigate the control of meteorology, dynamics, and mixing on aerosol indirect effects on the early growth stage of convective clouds, 2) Characterize the environment and physical processes leading to coastal convective initiation, 3) Determine how mature convective updraft microphysical and kinematic properties relate to those earlier in the cloud lifecycle, its initiation mechanism, and heterogeneities of its parent environment, 4) Quantify environmental thermodynamic and kinematic controls on convective lifecycle properties under different aerosol conditions, 5) Quantify how: a) cold pool properties and lifetimes vary as a function of precipitation amounts and precipitation size distributions, and how are these relationships modulated by the relative humidity, b) what is the impact of aerosol number concentration on cold pool depth and intensity, and c) how do different land-surface types determine the dissipation of cold pools, 6) Characterize how the lightning flash size and energy depends on the modification of the supercooled liquid water content, scale and volume of the mixed-phase updraft, and hydrometeor populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Subduction zones, known for parallel chains of towering volcanoes and deep oceanic trenches, host Earth's most geologically complex and heavily populated regions. Subduction zones represent the continuous convergence of two tectonic plates, one of which subducts (?dives?) into the mantle while the other rides over the top of the subducting plate. Stress in this converging system continuously builds until it exceeds the frictional strength of the boundary separating the two plates. At this point, the pent-up stress is released in the form of an earthquake and warps the seafloor. This warping seafloor shifts the overlying ocean surface, a process known as tsunami genesis. Only subduction zones can generate mega-earthquakes, which can warp the seafloor over tremendously vast areas and trigger devastating tsunamis. Predicting tsunamis is a challenging problem because it requires an understanding of the inaccessible details of the stress release along the plate boundary and how it deforms the structure of the entire subduction zone. This research presents a new approach that brings the combined power of mathematics and statistics to bear on this problem. Mathematics describes the physical processes of earthquakes and tsunamis and the statistics account for what is known, or more importantly, what is unknown about the subduction zone system. Results of this research could provide the tools to evaluate risks for coastal locations that are prone to tsunamis. Numerical modeling is the key to this approach and demand for numerical modeling skills is increasing in parallel with expanding data collection initiatives and advances in computational capabilities. This project includes an educational component that will engage students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in formalized training in numerical modeling. <br/><br/>This research will develop numerical tools with a probabilistic perspective to investigate the coupling of seafloor deformation from megathrust earthquakes and tsunamis. These tools will address the challenging problem of embedding sophisticated finite element models of earthquake deformation into automated Monte Carlo sampling strategies. The deformation models will have geodetically-informed slip distributions over curved fault surfaces embedded in domains having the geometric irregularities of topography and bathymetry. Domains will simultaneously account for seismic tomography and reflection models, submarine-based seafloor observations, and tsunami observations. These models will propagate uncertainties from geodetic data into probability density functions for tsunami run-up behavior along coastal locations. This research will, for the first time, quantify how the larger uncertainties for near-trench slip propagate into tsunami predictions. Finite element models are necessary to simulate the complex mechanical behavior of subduction zones and Monte Carlo sampling will reveal how uncertainties in the data and model configurations propagate into deformation and tsunami predictions. These objectives will be achieved using the well-documented 2004 Sumatra megathrust earthquake and tsunami as a case study. A short course on finite element models of earthquake deformation will be developed and delivered. The curriculum will comprise Protocol-based Modeling, Forward Modeling, Inverse Modeling, and discussions of Target Applications. Graduate students from U.S. institutions will be recruited by the Graduate Women In Science chapter and the Women in Science and Engineering program at the South Dakota School of Mines to promote participation of underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
