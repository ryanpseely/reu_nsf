It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained to conduct and present independent research. With a strong commitment to supporting underrepresented groups, including veterans, and first-generation college students, the CSUSM NSF REU program contributes to building a diverse and talented population of next generation scientists. The summer experience will increase participation, retention, persistence, and success in the classroom and instill confidence, and encourage innovation and leadership in research. Upon program completion, students are well poised to apply to doctoral/Masters programs and/or positions in the Life Science Industry. A common web-based assessment tool will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training, and students will be tracked after the program to determine career paths.  <br/><br/>The unifying theme of this hands-on research program is ?The Plasticity of Cells, Organisms, and Communities?. Students select a research mentor from a diverse team of scientists who are using cutting edge tools and techniques to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how cells, organisms, and communities adapt to stochastic environmental conditions by coordinating growth with morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits to maximize fitness. Research projects range from probing the genetics of phenotype, to investigating simple sequence repeats and genomic fluidity, microbiota and microbiome-mediated plasticity, to physiological adaptations to climate change. The residential program fosters a community of scholars who transition from being students to research scientists and move from learning to discovery. Weekly enrichment activities include seminars, field trips, and workshops highlighting the remarkable plasticity of cells, organisms, and communities. Students work together to write a scientific manuscript, attend graduate school application, and career workshops, and participate in a Poster Showcase to celebrate research accomplishments.

Global spread of these viruses continues to pose a threat in the United States; therefore, it is important to understand how they are transmitted in different cultural settings. In addition to the potential public health benefits of this study, it facilitates scientific training of a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students. Public dissemination of findings will also inform community members on the roles of the household and extended family members in transmitting disease, and measures to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses among family and friends.<br/><br/>This study is designed to assess how social behavior and environmental conditions interact to affect the transmission of common respiratory viruses and longer-term health impacts of illness in a tropical setting. To do so, the research team is collecting year-round, community-wide data on social networks and symptoms of respiratory illnesses, seasonal biological markers of respiratory infection, and seasonal anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, and upper arm circumference. In-depth interviews are being conducted to gain an understanding of how people think about illness risk. This study tests the theory that humans use behavior to adapt to environmental circumstances, and that they do so in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks associated with the behavior. This may help to inform future public health policy on how best to minimize transmission of respiratory viruses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, while being such core infrastructures of a nation, there is a lack of systematic and rigorous security analysis frameworks and secure-by-design principles to ensure secure and reliable operations of these networks. Even though cellular technologies have evolved over generations, trust assumptions have largely remained the same whereas adversary capabilities have significantly grown. The adversary capabilities will thus continue to grow and violate the security guarantees of next-generation cellular networks that we rely on today. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to secure the next-generation cellular networks through the development of algorithms and systems that verify the security and privacy guarantees of cellular network protocols' design and implementations with respect to next-generation adversaries that can break the current trust assumptions. The proposal's educational content will offer and organize courses, cellular capture-the-flag (CCTF) competitions, and K-12 workshops focusing on the security and privacy of emerging networks and systems. Undergraduates, women, and underrepresented students will be recruited to encourage their engagement in research and educational activities.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve the security of cellular networks from the ground up by incorporating security analysis starting from the design to implementations and real deployments. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to achieve this vision in practice due to the following three important grand challenges: (i) Lack of models and properties for security analysis; (ii) Lack of automated and holistic security analysis framework; and (iii) Lack of techniques to create correct and secure cellular protocol implementations. This project seeks to address these broad challenges in a unified framework through (a) Developing a formal static security analysis framework to scalably analyze the protocol model of the design, i.e., the cellular standard of next-generation cellular networks; (b) Designing and implementing dynamic security analysis framework for analyzing and verifying the security of cellular protocol implementations; and (c) Developing cellular network-specific protocol modeling language and code generation mechanism to produce high-assurance reference implementations of cellular protocols. Results from this work have the potential to fundamentally improve the security of current (5G) and next-generation (6G) cellular networks and thus will make a significant impact on national and global security. Tools, models, properties, and findings will be shared in the public domain to promote and advance the science and community of cellular networks, directly benefiting cellular stakeholders, developers, and standard bodies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cell-cell adhesions integrate cells into tissues. They relay signals between the extracellular environment and cells. They also experience strains of different magnitudes and rates. Currently, there is a lack of understanding about the strain rate-dependent behavior of the cell-cell adhesion. This is particularly true of the response mechanisms at play across the spectrum of strain rates. This knowledge is critical in understanding various pathological conditions and developmental defects where cell-cell adhesions play a significant role. This research project will quantify the stress-strain relationship of a single cell pair. Different tensile strain rates will be used to examine the process that governs the responses of the cell-cell adhesions. The results will elucidate the coordinated response from the cytoskeleton network and cell-cell adhesions. The complementary outreach program will translate laboratory innovations into learning opportunities for young kids. This will be accomplished through interactive educational platforms for K-12 students. This CAREER award will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students via a laboratory mentoring program. <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to uncover the mechanisms governing the mechanical response of single cell-cell adhesion junctions when they are subjected to mechanical strains of different strain rates. It is generally accepted that stress accumulation in the cytoskeleton network is strain rate-dependent. Thus, it is critical to understand how stress relaxation by the cytoskeleton under different strain rates coordinates with the enhancement of cell-cell adhesion to prevent fracture of multicellular structures. The central hypothesis being tested is that under tensile loading cytoskeleton reorganization and cell-cell adhesion enhancement/rupture are loading rate-dependent and driven by mechanosensing molecules at the cell-cell adhesion. Two research objectives, focusing on the cytoskeleton and the cell-cell adhesion, respectively, include: 1) examine the rate-dependent stress relaxation and tensioning of the cell adhesion-cytoskeleton network, and 2) examine the rate-dependent enhancement of cell-cell junctions that reduces rupture potential under tensile loads. Through the two objectives, one of the fundamental questions in mechanobiology will be answered: what fundamental mechanical variables do cell-cell adhesions sense and respond to, force/stress or deformation/strain, or the rate change of these variables? The success in completion of the objectives will build a solid foundation for pioneering the study of the strain rate-dependent mechanical behavior of cell-cell adhesions, leveraging the unique capability of a single cell-cell adhesion interrogation platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While society has learned how these platforms can negatively impact individuals, little is known comparatively about how our interactions on the platforms benefit us and how to encourage positive behaviors of people on these platforms. Being able to measure the potential benefits of social media can help understand its cumulative effects on people and help identify both ways individuals can change their own behavior and inform the design of social media platforms themselves. This project aims to develop computational tools to identify and measure a variety of ways in which positive behaviors such as compassion or empathy occur online. This research will study the effects of experiencing positive and negative behaviors in social media on people?s psychological well-being to create a holistic picture of social media?s impact. Furthermore, the project will identify strategies for how to phrase positive reinforcement and develop tools to support individuals in behaving positively, both of which should encourage future positive behavior in social media. The project team will also release educational material, courses, and videos for the public and students at multiple levels, as well as provide practical and informative public-facing tools that educate people about the impact of social media on well-being at a personal level.<br/><br/>This project studies prosocial behavior in social media and quantifies the impact of interactions, content, and interventions there on specific dimensions of psychological well-being. To accomplish this goal, the project will develop datasets, models, and technologies to identify and encourage positive behaviors. The computational techniques will combine insights from natural language processing and computational social science to recognize subtle social signals in language, which will enable moving from just understanding the meaning of a text to understanding the text?s effects on the audience. The project will address three core technical challenges: (1) recognizing prosocial behavior in online spaces in ways that are sensitive to the norms of the community; (2) quantifying the impact of social media interactions and content on dimensions of psychological well-being and developing computational methods for analyzing this impact at scale; and (3) creating proactive technologies that promote prosocial behavior via behavioral nudges and tools to help people write more prosocially.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly natural spaces to study in topology are the so called smooth manifolds. An example of a smooth manifold is the universe we live in, which we think of as 3-dimensional, but if we include time is actually 4-dimensional. A fundamental question is: what manifold is our universe? A goal of a geometric topologist is to list possibilities and most importantly to develop tools to understand the structure and distinguish the overall topology of manifolds. Low dimensional topology mainly refers to the study of 3-and 4-dimensional manifolds, where the theory of such spaces, in particular in 4-dimension, is significantly more complicated and exhibits many unique phenomena that are not seen in any other dimension. A particularly successful and rich way to understand the topology of manifolds is to introduce certain complex analytic structures on them, such as Stein structures and/or geometric structures, such as symplectic and contact geometries. The PI will study questions and conjectures that sit at the intersection of symplectic/contact topology and smooth manifold topology in low dimensions, and complex geometry. Alongside the research component, this project also includes activities that integrate the PI?s research program with education and training initiatives for student research, at both graduate and undergraduate levels. To that end, the PI will maintain an active topology group at the University of Alabama by organizing seminars, workshops, REUs and conferences. More broadly, the PI will use funds from this award to organize a week-long research and professional development summer workshop for talented undergraduate students from underrepresented colleges in the state of Alabama. He will also initiate a collaborative, multi-dimensional, long-term educational and research program for geometry-topology graduate students and faculty in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools, initially including the University of Alabama, Louisiana State University, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Arkansas.   <br/> <br/>This project involves studying interactions between complex geometry, symplectic geometry and contact geometry, and low dimensional topology with a focus on various notions of convexity. The first long-term research objective will be to consider constraints on the topology of closed 3-manifolds embedded in 4-space from the perspectives of symplectic topology (e.g. contact type hypersurfaces) and complex geometry (e.g. the boundaries of holomorphically/rationally/polynomially convex Stein domains).  Specifically, the PI will work towards a complete resolution of Gompf?s conjecture that predicts no Brieskorn sphere bounds a holomorphically convex domain in complex 2-space, determining the topology of contact type hypersurfaces in 4-space and in complex projective space, and exploring their implications for the exotic nature of smooth 4-manifold topology. The second long-term research objective concerns two outstanding problems dealing with the existence and classification of tight and fillable contact structures on closed, oriented 3-manifolds. The PI?s various joint works provide a framework and new constructions to study the existence question of tight and fillable contact structures from the point of view of Heegaard Floer homology. The PI and his collaborators will investigate to what extent invariants coming from Heegaard Floer homology detect tightness completely. The PI will also work to complete the classification problem for tight structures on small Seifert fibered spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing solutions and increasing our understanding and knowledge of renewable energy and microgrids is vital to the well-being of communities in the Arctic, and lessons learned can be transferred to other remote and rural areas of the world. This program will focus on research pertaining to energy developments in the Arctic and include topics on the integration of renewable energy sources into existing microgrids; energy data collection, analysis, and visualizations; societal changes and impact in attitudes toward renewable energy and energy equity; and macro- and micro-economic policies and regulations in rural and remote areas of the Arctic. Four main elements comprise the program: (1) research projects addressing Arctic energy issues, (2) a five-day Microgrid Boot Camp, (3) Arctic Science, Engineering and Community lectures and activities, and (4) a series of Professional Development lectures and exercises. The program will benefit the energy science community by attracting young and diverse people to the STEM fields and preparing the next generation of Arctic engineers and scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, human-robot interaction is tested with human subject experiments. While these experiments are necessary to evaluating human-robot interactions, they are often limited in the number of environments and human behaviors that can be observed. Furthermore, it is not well understood how to build robots that account for infrequent and undesirable behaviors found when testing such systems. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to improve human-robot interactions by automatically creating simulated human-robot interaction scenarios that reveal undesirable behaviors, as well as integrating the generated scenarios into the robot?s learning process. Results from this work will provide the field of robotics with a theoretical and experimental tools for allowing the robot to adjust to new and challenging scenarios. Tightly integrated with the research activities, the education plan will introduce scenario generation in robotics education and artificial intelligence competitions to improve students' understanding of robots' capabilities and limitations and inspire them to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>This project will advance the science of robust, complex human-robot interaction by automatically generating and learning from diverse, challenging and realistic scenarios in simulation. It will investigate computational foundations for the design of quality diversity algorithms that efficiently search the scenario space. It will then develop frameworks that integrate the developed algorithms with generative models to optimize a low-dimensional space of complex and realistic scenarios.  The project will close the loop between scenario generation and learning by exploring and characterizing methods for efficiently selecting challenging scenarios to form a curriculum for learning. Dissemination of all developed algorithms through open-source software and workshops will help bring ideas from quality diversity optimization and scenario generation to a wider robotics audience.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The lack of accessible material can exacerbate social issues, for example, the complexity of language used in college admission and financial aid applications has contributed to the lagging access to higher education among emergent bilingual students; the WHO has recognized the urgency of accessible technical information, given the rise of medical misinformation especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there has been much work on sentence simplification, very few datasets are large enough to train supervised models; simplifying a document also involves different operations from those at the sentence level, including content addition, and how sentences connect with each other. This project aims to develop new resources and data-driven approaches for document simplification, with the potential to address information transparency and fair access across a range of high-stake domains. This project will also support the education and training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students across disciplines.<br/><br/>To substantially advance document simplification, this CAREER project will tackle several key issues in existing simplification work, including corpora diversity, explanation generation, and document-level approaches. This is achieved by the following research activities: (1) introducing new corpora that tackle the pressing challenge of data diversity in simplification research and enable new application scenarios, especially in the accessibility of technical and jargon-laden texts; (2) tackling content addition and elaboration during simplification---a previously little-explored challenge, and propose a novel, linguistically-informed framework that characterizes and generates elaborations; (3) develop models for document simplification that are informed by structures of discourse, using both coherence structure and entity salience.

This project will use the tools of mathematical logic (and computability theory in particular) to study the way that information can be coded into mathematical structures of the types that arise in all areas of mathematics. The general paradigm is that information is encoded into a mathematical structure if it can always be recovered in an intrinsic way from the structure, without artifacts from the way that the structure is presented. For the simplest kinds of information, like a string of 0's and 1's, the situation is well-understood. But for more complex kinds of information, the situation is much less well-understood and there are many interesting phenomena to explore. Understanding the coding of information will help us understand both the nature of information and the ability of structures of various kinds to code information. This, in turn, informs and guides the mathematical practice of other mathematicians. This project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to high schools.<br/><br/>More formally, we say that a piece of information A is coded in a structure B if from every copy of the structure, we can recover in a computable way a copy of the information A. For example if B is a countably infinite group then a copy of B is a Cayley table for the group, noting that for an infinite group there are many different Cayley tables obtained by listing the elements of the group in different orders. By a piece of information we mean, in order of increasing complexity, a binary string (or subset of the natural numbers), an infinite family of binary strings, an infinite tree, or some other structure. For the first case of a binary string, there is a good structural characterisation of when a structure codes a binary string; one can interpret this as saying that there is always a good reason for a binary string to be coded by a structure. This is not the case for any more of the more complicated types of information; it seems that there are structures which happen to code information, but there is no good structural reason as to why. This project aims to explore these phenomena and push them to their limit with one aim being to give new tools to attack difficult open problems on degree spectra which have been resistant to current techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A pervading stereotype associating intellectual talent with men rather than women is a powerful cultural message that is in part responsible for this gender gap, termed the gender brilliance stereotype. This pernicious stereotype emerges early and immediately shapes children?s interests. To tackle this gender disparity from its developmental roots, this project will address three interrelated questions: (1) How do children internalize the gender brilliance stereotype? (2) How does the gender brilliance stereotype influence children?s, especially girls?, motivation? (3) What strategies can be developed to promote girls? involvement in STEM? Findings from this research will transform understanding of the barriers posed on girls and lay a solid foundation for devising interventions to engage them in STEM. The project will also support graduate and undergraduate students in STEM education research and a course related to this research will be developed as part of the educational integration plan. Ultimately, this work will contribute to reducing gender inequalities.  This research project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>Integrating experimental and longitudinal approaches, the project will focus on 5- to 7-year-old children and provide a comprehensive investigation of the gender brilliance stereotype. Specifically, this research will investigate the contextual factors contributing to children?s endorsement of the stereotype, with a focus on parenting practices and will explore three psychological mechanisms through which the stereotype shapes girls? motivation. The research design includes a series of experiments, and analyses include correlational approaches and identifying causal links between environmental sources and gender stereotypes. Young students and their parents will engage in brief tasks and respond to questionnaires that probe their underlying assumptions about the role of gender in STEM. In addition, the researcher will develop a role-model intervention to alleviate the negative consequences of the stereotype, namely, the early gender imbalance in participation in STEM activities. This project will advance the state of knowledge about the early-emerging psychological processes that underpin women?s underrepresentation in STEM and beyond. It will also bridge research and education by yielding information for parents, teachers, and museum educators on how to reduce the gender brilliance stereotype and its negative impacts.<br/><br/><br/>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One particular demographic expected to benefit from the development of automated systems is adults aged 65 years and older. Older adults have become the fastest-growing age group globally. General age-related declines in cognitive and physical abilities may limit older adults? ability to perform daily tasks, such as driving. In this case, automated systems (e.g., automated vehicles), may bring particular benefits for older adults to maintain daily task performance and independence. Given that current automated systems are often constrained by design limits and require human interventions, a reliable human-machine interface (HMI) is necessary to assist humans during the manual recovery process. Additionally, individual differences in cognitive and physical capabilities may lead to different task performances. It is necessary to examine how non-chronological age factors, such as cognitive and physical abilities, may impact adults? performance and wellbeing in complex environments. This project aims to develop methods and tools to support older adults with different abilities in automated systems and to better understand how the aging process affects interaction with an interface. The outcomes of the project will contribute to the knowledge base in aging, automation, and human-machine interactions, as well as provide guidelines and recommendations for the design of next-generation automated systems for a wide range of user groups. By contributing to the scientific basis of human-automation interactions, the project will benefit the society by increasing human safety and wellbeing in automated systems. The PI will also initiate outreach programs in local senior centers, such as workshops and activities to educate the importance of successful aging, i.e., living an active and healthy lifestyle at the later stages of life. <br/><br/>This project aims to conduct a series of human-subject experiments using automated driving simulations to investigate three areas. The first area is to explore the effects of multimodal displays, both visual (e.g., augmented reality) and tactile interfaces, on how quickly older adults intervene and takeover from an automated system. Second, the project will investigate the impacts of non-chronological factors on older adults? task performance in data-rich complex environments. The final area explores whether visual and tactile interfaces, as multimodal displays, can mitigate individual differences in task performance. The project will collect empirical data and develop computational models on human behavior and performance with various capabilities and limitations. These could help researchers working in aging, human factors, and inclusive design and frameworks that address how non-chronological factors affect performance on complex tasks. For addressing individual differences in task performance, the project will investigate the effectiveness of adaptive multimodal displays on older adults? takeover performance change.

Popular smart devices include watches, doorbells, cameras, locks, televisions, and speakers. Smart devices offer better ways of living, working, playing, creating, and caring for others. But they also introduce privacy concerns, security vulnerabilities, and potentials for unfair and opaque uses. For example, people may use smart security cameras to surveil and monitor the activities of neighbors, domestic workers, passersby, and other household members. Smart devices with spatial sensing capabilities--such as microphones, cameras, and location tracking--may identify and track people nearby. Non-primary users, such as guests, roommates, and delivery drivers, may interact with smart devices, but with limited awareness, consent, and control. This project will study how primary and non-primary users interact with smart devices, and each other, to better understand their concerns and preferences. Findings will be used to develop prototypes for new products and interfaces to improve privacy for non-primary users. Insights from these prototypes will be generalized into design recommendations for practitioners and educators. The project will also address design tradeoffs and stakeholder conflicts that demand policy and strategy responses beyond purely technological solutions. The education plan incorporates digital privacy, cybersecurity, and data ethics into design and human-computer interaction education and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This research will apply interdisciplinary design processes to develop design prototypes, patterns, and principles for improving human-centered data privacy, security, and interrelated ethical concerns, including trust, transparency, and fairness.

These activities will expand awareness of biotechnology career pathways and build direct industry connections with community college biotechnology programs. These connections will be used to recruit and retain the next generation of skilled technicians. Methodologies will be tested and evaluated across three colleges from different regions of the United States: Austin Community College (TX), City College of San Francisco (CA) and Johnston Community College (NC). Over the 3 years of this project, the activities will include building connections between over 90 students and 45 industry professionals through alumni success stories and speed networking, to increase students? sense of belonging, science identity, and career awareness. The project will document the career paths of the alumni to create career pathways for current students. These direct connections with industry will foster recruitment, retention, and placement of community college students in the biotechnology field. The methodologies and tools developed will be disseminated nationally to community college biotechnology programs and will likely be applicable to other disciplines.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to produce results-oriented methodologies and tools for recruitment and retention that focus on alumni engagement. This will be done through piloting speed networking events, creating ?Scientist Spotlights'' and publishing ?Alumni Success Stories? across the three colleges with different demographic, socio-economic and industry landscapes. To accomplish this, the project will 1) establish an alumni network to document alumni career pathways for the purpose of educating current and future students, and 2) develop employee and alumni outreach tools to increase alumni and industry engagement creating direct industry interactions between existing and potential community college students. Feedback from faculty and staff from all three colleges will be used to develop and embed these methodologies and tools into curricula. Community college biotechnology, biology, and chemistry students, as well as high school students, will be recruited to participate in the speed networking events to directly interact with alumni industry professionals. These events will provide current and future students relevant and relatable information that will encourage them to join and/or complete biotechnology programs. This will simultaneously provide alumni opportunities to re-engage with their program and give back to their community, creating a sustainable feedback loop for industry engagement with community college biotechnology programs.

Recent advances in small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS, or ?drones?) and artificial intelligence are enabling a new era of forest research in which individual trees can be mapped, measured, and identified to genus or species across broad areas without extensive ground surveys. Although the technology for low-cost drone-based forest mapping now exists, infrastructure to enable scientists to produce and access extensive forest maps is limiting. This project establishes and facilitates future expansion of a network of over 100 forest inventory plots of approximately 25 ha each. Fine-scale, broad-extent forest inventory data allows for new insight into the complex processes shaping forest communities and ecosystems. Understanding these dynamics is increasingly urgent as stressors such as droughts and high-severity wildfires drive dramatic shifts in forests?including conversion to non-forest vegetation?in the western U.S. and globally. Ecologists and forest managers require data on forest response to these novel conditions to develop management strategies, but the rate and magnitude of recent changes challenge traditional field-based data collection approaches. This project introduces drone-based forest mapping tools to the next generation of scientists via a Forest Ecology Drone Pilot Apprenticeship and via outreach events emphasizing underrepresented communities. It leverages existing investments in public cyberinfrastructure by NSF and trains scientists in its use for cloud-native research. It is demonstrating the relevance of the forest mapping infrastructure to forest management planning by mapping forests to support a multi-stakeholder forest restoration partnership. In recruiting staff and student participants, the project engages groups supporting underrepresented students and scholars, and the selection processes use holistic review and distance-traveled criteria.<br/><br/>This project involves development of three complementary cyberinfrastructure innovations to support and extend the capacity of forest ecology and disturbance ecology research: (1) a scalable, reproducible, AI-enabled software workflow for processing imagery from low-cost drones into forest inventory data (e.g., maps of individual trees by size and genus or species); (2) a searchable, publicly accessible, extensible database of tree maps, initiated with > 100, 25-ha maps aligned with forest inventory plot networks (including the NSF National Ecological Observatory Network, NEON) along important abiotic and disturbance history gradients; and (3) documentation and training, including virtual and in-person workshops, to enable researchers to produce and contribute their own data and analytical tools. The software workflow, which incorporates photogrammetry for 3D stand structure modeling and multi-view computer vision (via artificial neural networks) for taxonomic classification and rejection of false-positive tree detections, expands the forest survey extents achievable by scientists and resource managers by > 100-fold. The project leverages CyVerse, one of NSF?s largest investments in research cyberinfrastructure, for data processing and data hosting. The resulting public forest inventory database supports cloud native research to improve models of forest pattern and process currently constrained by limited data.

Free radicals are important reactive intermediates in many chemical environments (such as combustion and atmospheric chemistry). This research aims to understand the photochemistry of polyatomic radicals and the roles of interacting electronic states with quantum accuracy. The knowledge (free radical electronic structures, energetics, reaction mechanisms, etc.) from this project is valuable to the combustion, atmospheric chemistry, theoretical chemistry, and physics communities. The project trains graduate students and prepares them for careers in academia or industry and promotes research experience of women and underrepresented minority undergraduate students. The project reaches out to the diverse student population in the Riverside and San Bernardino community colleges. This program also mentors economically disadvantaged high school students for summer research internships.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the hydroxymethyl, hydroperoxy, and methylene radicals. Experimentally, the free radicals are produced by photolysis of suitable precursors and subsequent reactions and are cooled in a molecular beam with a well-defined initial energy. The free radicals are photodissociated under a single collision condition by tunable laser radiation, producing hydrogen atom photoproducts. The high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight technique is utilized to measure state-resolved product kinetic energy and angular distributions. These distributions are closely related to theoretical calculations and are central to understanding photodissociation dynamics and mechanisms. The research generates high-quality data and benchmarks to test quantum mechanical theories of the excited open-shell species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project capitalizes on the unprecedented opportunities provided by the emerging field of data science to reshape the field of mining geotechnics and shift the paradigms for the assessment of high-risk infrastructure, focusing on tailings storage facilities. During the last decade, tailings storage facility failures have caused unprecedented environmental consequences and loss of human lives worldwide. A failure in the United States, similar to other recent ones, may cause dramatic damage to the environment, state economies, and local communities. Therefore, the resilient design and condition assessment of tailings storage facilities are vitally important for regions where mining is active, such as Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, amongst others, and have become more relevant than ever, considering the new global tailings standards. In this context, this project will provide fundamental insights to improve the resilience of tailings storage facilities and set new standards to enhance the resilience of mining infrastructure in general. The integrated educational plan will contribute to creating the next generation of geotechnical tailings engineers with literacy in data science by engaging undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students in (i) Georgia Tech STEM centers and US institutions that promote the resilience of mining infrastructure; (ii) Georgia Tech vertically integrated projects; and (iii) education enhancement opportunities. The outreach plan will establish a peer pilot mentoring program for Hispanic/Latinx students that complements the PI?s current outreach activities.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are to (i) investigate the multiscale mechanical response of mine tailings and discover high-dimensional interactions through data science; (ii) investigate the fundamental problem of assessing in situ states; and (iii) explore the formulation of novel data-driven and performance-based procedures in mining geotechnics. Towards these objectives, this project uses an integrated approach that considers data science, laboratory tests, microstructural measurements, field tests, and numerical simulations to bring novel insights to the multiscale response of intermediate materials such as mine tailings considering (i) microstructure signatures; (ii) the role of inherent and induced anisotropy and cyclic loadings; (iii) field-scale system effects; and (iv) data-driven approaches for state inversion. Insights gained from this research will be used to probe the value of data science and formalize its use in unraveling high dimensional interactions of mechanical properties of mine tailings and formulating novel data-driven and performance-based procedures using machine and active learning. This project will allow the PI to establish the foundation for an interdisciplinary field at the convergence of data science, mining geotechnics, and performance-based engineering that can demonstrate to the geotechnical and hazard communities the opportunities of embracing data-driven approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS, or ?drones?) and artificial intelligence are enabling a new era of forest research in which individual trees can be mapped, measured, and identified to genus or species across broad areas without extensive ground surveys. Although the technology for low-cost drone-based forest mapping now exists, infrastructure to enable scientists to produce and access extensive forest maps is limiting. This project establishes and facilitates future expansion of a network of over 100 forest inventory plots of approximately 25 ha each. Fine-scale, broad-extent forest inventory data allows for new insight into the complex processes shaping forest communities and ecosystems. Understanding these dynamics is increasingly urgent as stressors such as droughts and high-severity wildfires drive dramatic shifts in forests?including conversion to non-forest vegetation?in the western U.S. and globally. Ecologists and forest managers require data on forest response to these novel conditions to develop management strategies, but the rate and magnitude of recent changes challenge traditional field-based data collection approaches. This project introduces drone-based forest mapping tools to the next generation of scientists via a Forest Ecology Drone Pilot Apprenticeship and via outreach events emphasizing underrepresented communities. It leverages existing investments in public cyberinfrastructure by NSF and trains scientists in its use for cloud-native research. It is demonstrating the relevance of the forest mapping infrastructure to forest management planning by mapping forests to support a multi-stakeholder forest restoration partnership.

This requires low-latency and ultra-low power multi-Tb/s inter/intra-rack optical I/O as well as chip-to-chip interconnects. Although state-of-the-art inter-chip interconnects are realized with copper-based wirelines, they cannot meet the stringent speed, energy-efficiency, and bandwidth density requirements of emerging AI supercomputers. Silicon photonic transceivers have shown a great promise to address this challenge by ultimately co-packaging optical transceivers with high performance CPU/GPUs. Co-packaged optics for the next-generation AI computing should provide tens of Tb/s aggregate data-rates at sub-pJ/b energy-efficiency and low-latency. Despite recent efforts in developing such transceivers, proposed solutions do not yet satisfy the energy and latency requirements of future inter-chip links. In this work, we aim at solving these challenges for ultra-high data-rates by proposing a new equalization paradigm and a novel system-level architecture to make co-packaged optics ?smarter? than being just an electro-optical bridge as has never been imagined before. Outcomes of this project can speed up AI/ML computing hardware by enabling a truly disaggregated computing architecture down to the package level. We also plan to integrate our research methodology and modern topics into the educational curriculum by developing a new course. This course will bridge the gap between the fields of integrated circuits and photonics and will have publicly available materials for dissemination at other institutes. Our other educational plans include outreach activities for college and K-12 students and engaging underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students in this project.<br/><br/>The most critical challenge in building energy-efficient optical I/O at high data-rates is the power-hungry equalization circuitry conventionally implemented in the electrical domain. These equalizers can consume over 50% of the total link energy and area. We will overcome this issue by radically transforming the equalization techniques, embedding the necessary equalization functionalities in reconfigurable photonic devices rather than the electronic side for the first time. This approach will be deployed for both the transmitter and receiver sides and can achieve sub-pJ/b overall link efficiency. Moreover, while co-packaged optical I/O is becoming imminent for interconnect and switching networks, we will show that these chips can be ?smarter? than being just an electro-optical bridge by adding more system-level capabilities to them in this project. These new capabilities can be implemented on a co-processor unit in co-packaged optical I/O chips. In doing so, not only we can overcome the latency overhead of using optical interconnects for chip-to-chip communications, but also, we will exploit novel system-level architectures that can be unlocked by co-packaged optics. The new disaggregated AI architecture can significantly speed up the compute time for training/interference of large-scale AI/ML applications by reducing communication bottlenecks and providing direct memory access for multi-GPU systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant increases in automation are expected across the healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation sectors. Major challenges to the safe integration of automation in situations involving human participants are the lack of accurate mathematical models of human behavior, intent, and cognitive state, as well as of reliable ways of gathering relevant real-time data from humans. This project overcomes these challenges by building a new modeling framework that accounts for human cognitive constructs established within the social sciences, such as trust, workload, perceived risk, and self-confidence, while being amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. It demonstrates how this framework can facilitate the design of sensing and control algorithms that can allow an autonomous system to determine, for example, how confident the human is in taking over a task, say during driving of an autonomous vehicle. Through close integration of research and education, the project will train engineering students to tackle questions surrounding socio-political and ethical challenges associated with the rapid expansion of automation in society. This will be achieved through new interdisciplinary coursework and recurrent immersive learning experiences that bring students together with state and federal policymakers. <br/><br/>This research aims to develop the foundations of a control-theoretic framework for human-automation interaction that can use real-time data to continually improve prediction accuracy. It achieves this aim by defining a human cognitive state space and characterizing its dynamics in a model formulation that is compatible with standard tools of control design. A unique feature of this formulation is its interpretability, maintained by grounding the model in established conceptual frameworks governing human decision-making. A principled methodology for real-time parameter and cognitive state estimation will be created that blends information from multiple sensors with different capabilities and costs of querying, and enables adaptation to different individuals. A generalizable technique for exciting human cognitive dynamics, as well as guidelines for choosing the cognitive state estimation algorithm best suited for a particular human-automation interaction context, will be established. Laboratory and field experiments, including tests using trucks equipped with Level 1 driver assistance features, are planned for validation of the modeling framework and estimation algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate engineering coursework is heavily focused on technical preparation. However, in addition to technical skills, engineers should learn how to understand and address the needs and perspectives of the people who will be impacted by their technical solutions. This project will address this need by focusing on service-learning, that is, courses where engineering students work with communities outside of the university to help resolve a local challenge. The great benefit of service-learning is that students can learn to be socially responsible engineering professionals while positively impacting local communities. However, in practice, service-learning is very difficult which can lead to harmful impacts on the student and community participants. When not performed carefully, these courses can teach students to dismiss community perspectives and treat communities as laboratories rather than as collections of people with unique social, cultural, and historical backgrounds. Within this problem, this project will help ensure that the way engineering service-learning courses are taught maximizes benefits for all participants through transformational service-learning. More specifically, this project will investigate how instructors develop the skills, attitudes, and knowledge they need to design and implement transformational service-learning. <br/><br/>To pursue transformational service-learning, it is necessary that educators acknowledge the substantial role that race, power, and privilege play within this pedagogy. To support educators? understanding of the role of these factors in service-learning, a promising approach involves first developing educators? critical reflexivity: the process by which an educator creates an internal dialog and evaluates their own positionality to articulate its impact on educational processes and outcomes. This project will engage the framework of critical reflexivity, addressing research questions that explore (1) service-learning engineering educators? descriptions of their assumptions about service-learning and their own positionalities within this context, (2) the way these assumptions and positionalities impact their approaches to teaching service-learning, and (3) the impact that critical reflexivity has in supporting transformational service-learning outcomes. This investigation will begin with interviews, and findings will be used to engage educators from a community of practice that focuses on reflection and action to produce further knowledge. The results will inform the development, assessment, and validation of a short course and guidebook to propagate this new knowledge while also refining this project?s findings. Along with dissemination through publications and conferences, this propagation approach enables widespread impact of these outcomes by closely engaging potential adopters, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will pursue transformational service-learning. Through partnering with large networks of engineering and service-learning educators both nationally and internationally, these products will be used to promote a paradigm shift in engineering service-leaning towards impactful community-oriented approaches. This CAREER project will create new knowledge about (a) how SL engineering educator positionality and assumptions hinder and enable service-learning practice; (b) how critical reflexivity influences engineering educators? adoption of approaches to elicit transformational service-learning; and (c) how engineering educators can develop service-learning coursework to achieve transformational impacts for social justice and equity across marginalized communities. Collectively, these outcomes will lead to the development of engineering civic-minded engineering citizens who equitably engage with local communities and are prepared for resolving complex societal challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, to study permutations from a combinatorial and geometric point of view. Permutations are ways to describe symmetries and arrangements of objects. They have applications in many fields such as computer science (e.g., sorting algorithms), physics (e.g., describing states of quantum particles), and biology (e.g., describing RNA sequences). This project seeks to describe the composition of permutations that share a given collection of properties and their spatial distribution when plotting these permutations in a Cartesian space. The second focus is the study of arithmetical structures of graphs. Graphs are ways to geometrically describe a given relationships between a collection of objects. Arithmetical structures of graphs provide (among other things) a combinatorial description of the number of times certain curves intersect. The PI seeks to describe the total number of arithmetical structures in certain collection of graphs. Finally, the project will create the Villanova-Puerto Rico Research Retreat (VPR^3), a collaboration research summer program between students at Villanova University and the University of Puerto Rico.  <br/><br/>The project builds on previous work to better understand peak and descents of permutations. This project aims to describe the structure coefficients of the peak algebra and provide a combinatorial reciprocity theory for the coefficients of peak and descent polynomials. These polynomials are crucial in the enumeration of permutations with a given peak or descent set. A second goal is to describe a collection of polytopes created by permutations that share peak sets and those that share descent sets. Finally, the PI will study the collection of arithmetical structures on a family of ?Y-graphs? to enumerate them and to describe the effect of a smoothing operation on these arithmetical structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Late diagnosis is a primary reason for this since esophageal cancer does not present early symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop fast and effective targeted therapies for esophageal cancer, improving drug tolerance and clinical outcomes. Evidence from limited clinical studies has shown that cell signaling pathways present significantly altered genetic expressions in esophageal cancer cells and have been found to correlate with poor prognosis and disease progression. Moreover, compared with other solid tumor malignancies, esophageal cancer presents many more stochastic heterogeneities and diverse origins, which have been found to be major factors of drug resistance. Thus, due to the cost and time limitations of clinical trials, it is of paramount importance to develop computational frameworks that can accurately represent the stochastic behavior of signaling pathways and provide a rapid and cost-effective evaluation of combination therapies to control esophageal cancer. This project aims to elucidate the aforementioned questions by new mathematical modeling of the dynamical behavior of a class of signaling pathways in esophageal cancer and associated treatment strategies. The framework can also be adapted for the rapid evaluation of treatments in other cancer types and chronic diseases. The project will be conducted at the University of Texas at Arlington, a Hispanic-Serving institution. The project will bolster students from underrepresented groups in research and provide training opportunities through project-based learning modules and a new graduate course in computational mathematical biology. Finally, this project will lay the foundation for the investigator's long-term goal to develop a Center for Integrative Math-Bio and Experimental Research (CIMBEX). The center will promote integrative mathematical biology and experimental research environment for students from underrepresented groups and bolster student retention in STEM.<br/> <br/>This project aims to define and validate a novel stochastic mathematical framework for analyzing and controlling the dynamical behavior of a key stochastic signaling pathway in esophageal cancer, known as epidermal growth factor receptor, for a better understanding of associated monitoring and treatment strategies. The specific research objectives are to (1) develop and analyze a controlled hybrid switching diffusion process, in a Fokker-Planck setting, that accounts for heterogeneity-induced stochasticity in the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway dynamics, and (2) build a new gradient-free optimal control algorithm, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, that provides qualitatively accurate and computationally efficient numerical simulations of treatment outcomes using combination therapies, validated by esophageal cancer signaling data from laboratory experiments. The outcomes of this project will be the development of a new modeling and control framework for dynamical processes, the promotion of interdisciplinary research with biologists, and research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. While the focus is on cancer mechanisms, the project aims to define a mathematical framework that applies equally well to other chronic diseases, where stochasticity plays an important role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will also contribute to a better understanding of biological enzymes that use manganese. Manganese is an earth-abundant metal, and its increased use in catalytic reactions has the potential to mitigate some of the environmental impacts and costs of chemical processes. This project lies at the interface of inorganic and physical chemistry, providing a unique training experience for graduate and undergraduate students.

This dearth of samples has led to vigorous debate amongst the geological community regarding three very important aspects of Earth evolution: 1) when, 2) how, and 3) to what extent did continents emerge on the early Earth. Recent advances in technical capabilities now allow these questions to be revisited. Earth is a tectonically active planet, which means that old rocks are constantly being altered, leaving few pristine samples from the earliest phases of Earth history. By looking for very small, but important isotopic signatures in preserved rock samples, one may infer how much continental crust was around very early in Earth history. This project will fund advanced isotopic analyses of ~2.6-billion-year-old rocks in a search of evidence for great than 4.0-billion-year-old continental material, material that may have been reworked during later tectonic events. Collection of this data will allow the research team to test the hypothesis that very large volumes of ancient continental crust existed on the early Earth and to answer a fundamental question about planetary formation and evolution ? when did continental crust form on Earth? This project will also support an undergraduate field research experience, which will serve to train the next generation of geoscientists in skills that employers are keenly interested in ? field geology and spatial reasoning skills.<br/><br/>This proposal will combine petrology and isotope geochemistry to test broad hypotheses regarding the growth and reworking of continental crust. Neoarchean granitoid rocks represent some of the oldest well-preserved suites of rocks on Earth. Detailed analysis of samples will address the fundamental question of when continental crust formed on Earth.  This proposal will analyze suites of granitoids from three distinct North American cratons for their igneous chemical signatures.  Zircon age and isotopic information (U-Pb-Hf-O) will be measured from several compositional groups to test the fidelity of commonly used tracers for crustal melting and overprinting. Analyses of xenocrystic zircons and bulk rock Nd-isotope ratios will be used to search for reworking of truly ancient (>4.0 Ga) crust in the Neoarchean?a time that has been suggested to have experienced broad overprinting of the continental record.  The research team focus on 142Nd analyses as these data are particularly adept at identifying Hadean crustal relics. This proposal will fund an REU field experience aimed at developing a new workforce with training in field geology and spatial reasoning.  The maps created and samples collected by undergraduate researchers will be used for advanced isotopic analyses conducted during the scientific study, and undergraduate participants will not only gain important?and in-demand?skills in spatially-focused critical thinking but will also be exposed to advanced geochemical techniques and datasets.

Thermosetting polymers are used by aerospace, defense, transportation, electronics, and many other industries. Moreover, fiber reinforced thermoset composites dominate high-performance structural applications. Despite their common use, thermosets are brittle. Quantum dot nanoparticles, on the other hand, simultaneously enhance the toughness and strength of the thermosets. Yet, we don?t know how the ultrasmall two-dimensional particles enhance mechanical properties of the thermosets. The researched project will reveal the molecular origins of these enhancements using systematic simulations and experiments. This new knowledge is potentially transformative because quantum dots can enhance all the other larger-scale-filler composites, such as continuous fiber, graphene, and carbon nanotube composites. The education objective is to create open-source virtual reality engineering education tools and cultivate creative engineers. Unique collaborative design projects are planned to enhance student creativity that can impact innovation potential of the next-generation engineers. Outreach activities will also be performed in the elementary/high schools that serve underrepresented groups in the Silicon Valley.<br/><br/>This study will improve our understanding of molecular level damage/deformation mechanisms as well as macroscopic fracture behavior of quantum dot nanocomposites. A specific focus is given to unique sub-20 nm structures containing up to three different quantum dot sizes that can react with thermosets and with each other.

(b) What are their main toughening mechanisms?  The research objectives are to (i) reveal the load transfer and debonding mechanisms, (ii) identify the plastic deformation, damage initiation, and damage accumulation mechanisms, and (iii) observe, quantify, and model the toughening mechanisms in thermosets containing multi-modal size quantum dots below 20 nm. To achieve these objectives, molecular dynamics synthesis and mechanical tests will be performed. Positron annihilation time spectroscopy, in-situ Raman spectroscopy, in-situ synchrotron X-ray characterization, and ex-situ mechanical tests will be performed.

Despite a significant volume of clinical and experimental studies for the detailed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a lack of understanding about the host immune response to the virus, which is largely responsible for the variability in disease severity. To accelerate and supplement our understanding of key target pathways in the immune response, this project will develop and analyze a fundamental, comprehensive model for the host immune dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Given we continue as a nation under pandemic conditions with new variants emerging and vaccination rollouts, the theoretical explorations through mathematical modeling will serve as a complement to lab-based and data-based approaches. Other features of this work include student involvement in this research, development of a network of collaborators across three institutions, curricula development, recruitment of students from underrepresented groups, and efforts to bring a broad community of researchers studying the host immune dynamics of COVID-19 together to advance our understanding of the interactions between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2. <br/> <br/>This project aims to accomplish two specific research goals: (i) development of a mathematical model of the host immune dynamics of COVID-19; and (ii) exploration of the model to address important COVID-19 treatment-related questions. For the first goal, the PI will develop and analyze a mathematical model that explicitly represents the virus, immune cells, cytokines, and their interactions, formulated in a system of coupled ordinary and delay differential equations. The main objective is to obtain a better understanding of key aspects of immune response to SARS-CoV-2, specifically its sensitive pathways. For the second goal, the PI will investigate the importance of timing of specific immune responses in disease severity and divergent outcomes, and the emergence of the so-called cytokine storm, excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines in the immune system. The aim is to identify the key mechanisms responsible for disease severity, which could help to identify other pathways to target therapeutically. The primary tools to be used for this project are model parameterization using a series of clinical and experimental data, sensitivity analysis, and numerical simulations. The primary mathematical contribution is the development of computational techniques to analyze high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. In addition, the results from this study on the mechanisms involved in COVID-19 pathology and identification of several therapeutic targets would provide hypotheses to be clinically tested, thus, serving as a foundation for the development of evidence-based treatment protocols to address the global challenge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS, or ?drones?) and artificial intelligence are enabling a new era of forest research in which individual trees can be mapped, measured, and identified to genus or species across broad areas without extensive ground surveys. Although the technology for low-cost drone-based forest mapping now exists, infrastructure to enable scientists to produce and access extensive forest maps is limiting. This project establishes and facilitates future expansion of a network of over 100 forest inventory plots of approximately 25 ha each. Fine-scale, broad-extent forest inventory data allows for new insight into the complex processes shaping forest communities and ecosystems. Understanding these dynamics is increasingly urgent as stressors such as droughts and high-severity wildfires drive dramatic shifts in forests?including conversion to non-forest vegetation?in the western U.S. and globally. Ecologists and forest managers require data on forest response to these novel conditions to develop management strategies, but the rate and magnitude of recent changes challenge traditional field-based data collection approaches. This project introduces drone-based forest mapping tools to the next generation of scientists via a Forest Ecology Drone Pilot Apprenticeship and via outreach events emphasizing underrepresented communities. It leverages existing investments in public cyberinfrastructure by NSF and trains scientists in its use for cloud-native research. It is demonstrating the relevance of the forest mapping infrastructure to forest management planning by mapping forests to support a multi-stakeholder forest restoration partnership. In recruiting staff and student participants, the project engages groups supporting underrepresented students and scholars, and the selection processes use holistic review and distance-traveled criteria.<br/><br/>This project involves development of three complementary cyberinfrastructure innovations to support and extend the capacity of forest ecology and disturbance ecology research: (1) a scalable, reproducible, AI-enabled software workflow for processing imagery from low-cost drones into forest inventory data (e.g., maps of individual trees by size and genus or species); (2) a searchable, publicly accessible, extensible database of tree maps, initiated with > 100, 25-ha maps aligned with forest inventory plot networks (including the NSF National Ecological Observatory Network, NEON) along important abiotic and disturbance history gradients; and (3) documentation and training, including virtual and in-person workshops, to enable researchers to produce and contribute their own data and analytical tools. The software workflow, which incorporates photogrammetry for 3D stand structure modeling and multi-view computer vision (via artificial neural networks) for taxonomic classification and rejection of false-positive tree detections, expands the forest survey extents achievable by scientists and resource managers by > 100-fold. The project leverages CyVerse, one of NSF?s largest investments in research cyberinfrastructure, for data processing and data hosting. The resulting public forest inventory database supports cloud native research to improve models of forest pattern and process currently constrained by limited data. Open-source software development and project results are available at openforestobservatory.org.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-performance thermoplastic composites are emerging in industries to replace metals as these composites offer light weighting, outstanding mechanical properties, chemical stability, and manufacturability within few minutes via thermoforming. However, in fast-rate processes with high cooling rates, there is not sufficient time for the polymer to form long chain orders (crystals) that in turn reduces the crystallinity level. High crystallinity is required for improved stiffness and strength; however, lower crystallinity is desirable to improve toughness. These competing properties can be optimized by control of the detailed structure of the polymer. This grant supports fundamental research that fills the knowledge gap needed to engineer the thermoplastic composite crystallinity during processing to achieve concurrently high stiffness, strength and toughness. Nanomaterials (NMs) are used to control the crystallinity without the use of hazardous solvents, promoting the scalability. The research accelerates the manufacturing of next generation of composites with reduced weight and increased strength and toughness that benefits the US economy and national security by equipping U.S. automotive, aerospace and marine industries with a scalable and fast-rate manufacturing technique. The interdisciplinary nature of this research provides unique opportunities to train the next generation of highly skilled engineers and scientists in STEM fields especially from women and underrepresented minority groups that further enhances the diversification of the US manufacturing workforce.<br/><br/>Optimized composite mechanical properties achieved during fast-rate manufacturing of semicrystalline polymer composites require engineering the crystalline morphology. This research will enable alternative capabilities in tailoring the microstructure of semicrystalline composites at multiple length scales during composite processing. Nanomaterials consisting of cellulose nanocrystals-graphene nanoplatelets are used to synergistically reinforce and create a hierarchical crystalline architecture. This project will generate new information by bridging the knowledge gap in the evolution of crystalline-amorphous domains from molecular bonds and forces, their translation to interfacial and interlaminar properties, and their deformation under service load. The research uses in-operando X-ray scattering and in-situ microscopy complemented by density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations to establish the molecular interactions-semicrystalline microstructure-property relationship. The research also addresses the damage transformation from molecular bonds dissociation to delamination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social networks, blogs, online businesses, and sensors all generate immense data streams. Such data streams are received in patterns that change over time. While this data can be assigned to specific categories, objects and events, their distribution is not constant. These categories are subject to distribution shifts. These distribution shifts are often due to the changes in the underlying environmental, geographical, economic, and cultural contexts. For example, the risks levels in loan applications have been subject to distribution shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because loan risks are based on factors associated to the applicants, such as employment status and income. Such factors are usually relatively stable, but have changed rapidly due to the economic impact of the pandemic. As a result, existing loan recommendation systems need to be adapted to limited examples. This project will develop open software to help users evaluate online fairness-in algorithms, mitigate potential biases, and examine utility-fairness trade-offs. It will implement two real-world applications: online crime event recognition from video data and online purchase behavior prediction from click-stream data. To amplify the impact of this project in research and education, this project will leverage STEM programs for students with diverse backgrounds, gender and race/ethnicity. This project includes activities including seminars, workshops, short courses, and research projects for students. <br/> <br/>This project aims to develop a new and innovative paradigm for designing, implementing, and evaluating online fairness-aware Deep Learning (DL) models. Such models would be used for classification tasks in noisy and non-stationary data streams. This project will focus on five areas. First, the project will explore how to ensure a variety of fairness principles are incorporated in a DL model in online and non-stationary settings. The project will also look at how to identify a neural network architecture that will reflect the causal structure and be adaptive to distribution shifts.  The project also looks at how the DL model will learn global initialization of primal parameters (associated with model accuracy) and dual parameters (associated with model fairness). Finally, the project  looks at how to make online learning algorithms robust to uncertainties in model estimation of fairness and how to, ultimately, interpret the fairness of an online DL model. By bridging the areas of neural architecture search, online meta-learning, and fairness-aware deep learning techniques, this project advances state-of-the-art research in Fairness in AI. This project will offer the following innovations: (1) disentangle underlying sensitive and non-sensitive causal variables from raw features via causal representation learning; (2) identify adaptive architectures for data streams via differential architecture search; (3) learn effective initializations for both primal and dual model parameters in an online-within-online manner;  (4) develop robust versions of the algorithms to deal with uncertainties in model fairness and tasks, and (5) identify the training examples and latent causal variables responsible for model adaption using local and global interpretations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the discovery of plate tectonics more than 50 years ago, the dominant mechanism responsible for this weakening remains unresolved. Debate centers on two competing mechanisms: partial melting and hydration of the mantle. In theory, geophysical imaging of seismic velocity and electrical resistivity could distinguish between these competing mechanisms, but inherent trade-offs and uncertainties associated with inferring physical properties from the field observations result in significant ambiguity. This project will image the seismic and electric structure of the mantle beneath a portion of the Cocos Plate in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, where the presence of asthenospheric melt is confidently known. The new observations will provide an independent calibration for the effect of asthenospheric melt on seismic and electric properties and constrain the regional extent and geometry of the melt. This will in turn enable improved understanding of the source of abundant and anomalous volcanism in the region. The project will support the research activities of four graduate students and several undergraduate students, as well as data sharing and collaboration with partners in the neighboring countries of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Costa Rica. More than 20 cruise participants will be trained in geophysical data acquisition during two research expeditions, including students, international partners, and community participants.<br/><br/><br/>This project will utilize passive-source seismic and magnetotelluric imaging to quantify the seismic velocity and electrical resistivity structure of the Cocos Plate lithosphere and asthenosphere. A co-located array of ocean-bottom seismic and electromagnetic receivers will be deployed over a 500 km by 500 km section of the Cocos Plate on both sides of the Nicaragua Fracture Zone (NFZ). The seafloor in the survey area shows abundant evidence of past intraplate magmatism, including elevated seafloor bathymetry, numerous seamounts significantly younger than the plate age, and prominent volcanic sills within the sediment column. The presence of a partial melt channel at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is clearly imaged by a previous small-scale magnetotelluric profile. Observations from this study will provide new insights on the dominant controls on asthenosphere rheology and the mechanisms that produce intraplate magmatism by addressing the following key questions: (1) What is the spatial and depth extent of the high-melt region? Does the bathymetry contrast across the NFZ reflect a change in melt content and/or volcanic productivity? (2) What is the seismic signature of the previously inferred melt-rich channel? Are seismic observations consistent with magnetotelluric results and how can they be calibrated to each other? Given this calibration between melt content and velocity, what does it imply for the weakening mechanisms in the asthenosphere globally?

Since the discovery of plate tectonics more than 50 years ago, the dominant mechanism responsible for this weakening remains unresolved. Debate centers on two competing mechanisms: partial melting and hydration of the mantle. In theory, geophysical imaging of seismic velocity and electrical resistivity could distinguish between these competing mechanisms, but inherent trade-offs and uncertainties associated with inferring physical properties from the field observations result in significant ambiguity. This project will image the seismic and electric structure of the mantle beneath a portion of the Cocos Plate in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, where the presence of asthenospheric melt is confidently known. The new observations will provide an independent calibration for the effect of asthenospheric melt on seismic and electric properties and constrain the regional extent and geometry of the melt. This will in turn enable improved understanding of the source of abundant and anomalous volcanism in the region. The project will support the research activities of four graduate students and several undergraduate students, as well as data sharing and collaboration with partners in the neighboring countries of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Costa Rica. More than 20 cruise participants will be trained in geophysical data acquisition during two research expeditions, including students, international partners, and community participants.<br/><br/><br/>This project will utilize passive-source seismic and magnetotelluric imaging to quantify the seismic velocity and electrical resistivity structure of the Cocos Plate lithosphere and asthenosphere. A co-located array of ocean-bottom seismic and electromagnetic receivers will be deployed over a 500 km by 500 km section of the Cocos Plate on both sides of the Nicaragua Fracture Zone (NFZ). The seafloor in the survey area shows abundant evidence of past intraplate magmatism, including elevated seafloor bathymetry, numerous seamounts significantly younger than the plate age, and prominent volcanic sills within the sediment column. The presence of a partial melt channel at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is clearly imaged by a previous small-scale magnetotelluric profile. Observations from this study will provide new insights on the dominant controls on asthenosphere rheology and the mechanisms that produce intraplate magmatism by addressing the following key questions: (1) What is the spatial and depth extent of the high-melt region? Does the bathymetry contrast across the NFZ reflect a change in melt content and/or volcanic productivity? (2) What is the seismic signature of the previously inferred melt-rich channel? Are seismic observations consistent with magnetotelluric results and how can they be calibrated to each other? Given this calibration between melt content and velocity, what does it imply for the weakening mechanisms in the asthenosphere globally? (3) Does the mantle fabric change across the NFZ, both within and below the lithosphere? Does the implied flow field suggest a Galpagos plume influence on past seafloor spreading, and/or recent melt productivity beneath the plate?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key root cause that can deeply impede these experiences is the exposure to implicit social bias. The risk is high, since biases are pernicious and pervasive, and it has been well established that language is a primary means through which stereotypes and prejudice are communicated and perpetuated. This project develops language technologies to detect and intervene in the language of social discrimination?sexist, racist, homophobic microaggressions, condescension, objectification, dehumanizing metaphors, and the like?which can be unconscious and unintentional, but cause prolonged personal and professional harms. The program opens up new research opportunities with implications to natural language processing, machine learning, data science, and computational social science. It develops new Web-scale algorithms to automatically detect implicit and disguised toxicity, as well as hate speech and abusive language online. Technologically, it develops new methods to surface and demote spurious patterns in deep-learning models, and new techniques to interpret deep-learning models, thereby opening new avenues to reliable and interpretable machine learning. Successful completion of the program will pave the ground for a paradigm shift in existing ways for monitoring civility in cyberspace, shielding vulnerable populations from discrimination and aggression, and reducing the mental load of platform moderators. Therefore, this project can benefit and empower a dramatic number of individuals?representatives of disadvantaged groups discriminated by gender, race, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity?who use social media or AI technologies built upon user generated content. Finally, the educational curriculum developed by this program will equip future technologists with theoretical and practical tools for building ethical AI, and will substantially promote diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM education, helping to foster a new, more diverse generation of researchers entering AI. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to develop lightly supervised, interpretable machine learning approaches?grounded in social psychology and causal reasoning?to detect implicit social bias in written discourse and narrative text. More specifically, the first phase of the project develops algorithms and models for identifying and explaining gendered microaggressions in short comments on social media, first unsupervisedly, then with active learning, given limited supervision by trained annotators. It provides transformative solutions to making existing overparameterized black-box neural networks more robust and more interpretable. Since microaggressions are often implicit, it also develops approaches to generate explanations to the microaggression detector?s decisions. In the second phase, the project addresses the challenging task of detecting biased framing about members of the LGBTQ community in narrative domains of digital media and develops data analytic tools by operationalizing, across languages, well-established social psychology theories. The expected outcomes of this five-year program include new datasets,  algorithms, and models that provide people-centered text analytics, and pinpoint and explain potentially biased framings, across languages, data domains, and social contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Osteoarthritis is the type of arthritis that occurs with age or injury. Mechanical force is a key contributing factor to the development of osteoarthritis.  However, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms by which mechanical forces lead to biological behaviors can lead to osteoarthritis.  This work will focus specifically on cells in cartilage, which are called chondrocytes.  This project will elucidate molecular mechanisms by which articular chondrocytes determine cartilage tissue health.  Specifically, this work will examine the relation of mechanical inputs to biological outputs mediated through the transmission of forces across specific mechanoreceptors that connect the fibrous environment outside the cell with the structural components inside the cell. This research will have eventual application to future biomechanical or pharmaceutical interventions to prevent or reverse osteoarthritis. The research from this project will also be integrated into an educational and outreach program based on graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, promotion of graduate and undergraduate research opportunities, and K-12 and regional underrepresented minority outreach through the development of educational story books and hands-on summer camp activities.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to determine the integrin-mediated mechanotransduction mechanisms by which articular chondrocytes regulate cartilage homeostasis, and thus to advance understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. The research objectives include: (1) establishing a baseline catabolic threshold for tensile force applied to chondrocyte integrins, (2) determining the degree to which actin dynamics drives chondrocyte preference for dynamic force, and (3) establishing surface glycoproteins as modulators of chondrocyte integrin tension dynamics via application of prestress. The overarching focus will be on leveraging mechanical concepts developed initially for civil and mechanical engineering to investigate mechanisms of outside-in mechanotransduction, inside-out mechanotransduction, and molecular tensegrity to obtain a better understanding of integrin-mediated mechanotransduction in articular chondrocytes. Education and outreach components will integrate research results into graduate and undergraduate coursework and research opportunities, storybooks introducing Native American elementary students to principles of cellular mechanobiology, and hands-on summer camp activities for middle and high school students.

Elastin is a key structural protein that gives biological tissues their elasticity.  For example, skin, lungs, and arteries can stretch and relax thanks to elastin.  During aging or disease, problems with elastin can cause tissue degeneration, which inhibits normal function. This is a challenging problem to study because the physiochemical stressors that can lead to degeneration are linked together. Many of these stressors occur at the nanoscale. This gap in knowledge prevents new therapies from being developed.  The objective of this research program is to pioneer novel nanoscale insight into mechanical degeneration of elastic tissues.  Specifically, this work will use a computer modeling framework, which will be calibrated from measured experimental results. Understanding the various sources of damage to elastin may facilitate new therapies aimed at maintaining biomechanical function of elastic tissues to prevent or delay complications in aging and disease. The research program will also engage and support undergraduate and graduate students, especially from underrepresented groups, through diverse research experiences and the Women in STEM Frontiers in Research Expo.  This will lead to a new interdisciplinary curriculum and promote a new local network of computational biophysicists.<br/><br/>This research program will establish a new high-fidelity modeling framework for healthy and degenerated elastin as a tool to resolve the impacts of pathological physicochemical stressors on mechanics at the nanoscale and identify specific drivers to the loss of mechanical function of elastic tissues.

This research will establish a multiscale digital twin of healthy and degenerated elastin to elucidate how key physicochemical stressors, ? specifically glycation and non-enzymatic crosslinking, ectopic calcification, enzymatic proteolysis, oxidative damage, racemization, lipid peroxidation, and carbamylation ? contribute to structural change, impact mechanical function independently and cooperatively, and disrupt tightly coupled hydration water dynamics with unstructured elastin. This work will provide: 1) validated computational tools to characterize the multiscale structure and mechanical response of elastin, with applications to other heterogeneous, hierarchical disordered molecular systems; 2) fundamental insight into the role of hydration water in such systems; 3) mechanistic understanding of likely specific paths to loss of function in elastin during aging and disease; and 4) an educational program to engage and retain diverse students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But it also incurs on a range of security concerns. As IoT devices may gather geographical information, monitor users? privacy activities, and record clients? biometric features, one of the critical concerns is how to preserve the confidentiality of such sensitive-data traffic when IoT devices communicate with others. Specifically, due to the broadcast nature of wireless signals, conversations between IoT devices are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This project aims to enforce security in devices that cannot afford cryptography operations. In particular, the project will develop a lightweight channel-aware security design that can deliver information securely and is suitable for implementation in resource-limited IoT devices. The scheme will be fined-grained and not protocol-oriented. It is potentially compatible with all existing wireless standards (e.g., WiFi 6, Zigbee, Bluetooth, 5G) and can accommodate diverse requirements of different wireless networks (e.g. cellular network, Wi-Fi network, satellite communication). In addition, the scheme developed will be useful beyond IoT applications. It can be deployed over any network featured with wireless connectivity, especially for those lacking key management infrastructures. In addition, the scheme can work together with cryptography algorithms on the application layer to provide cross-layer security guarantee. Beyond that, educational activities are an integral part of this project, the PI plans to share the outcomes of this project into his courses to motivate more students to get involved in cybersecurity research. The PI will also actively participate in outreach activities to increase the participation, activities, and engagement of students from diverse groups in the community.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to propose an effective and light-weight security design that takes advantage of dynamic signal variation in wireless context to protect sensitive network traffic emanating from IoT devices. The scheme can achieve information-theoretical security and is suitable for implementation in low-cost IoT devices where limited energy and circuitry can be dedicated for security. Specifically, the proposed scheme aims to exploit the inherited randomness feature of communication channels to achieve confidentiality of sensitive data without key distribution and management. In addition, the project plans to employ security design into relatively simple baseband processing procedures, which incur less overhead and only consume a very limited amount of resources. The project will focus on investigating important research problems associated with the proposed channel-aware security design using analytical modeling, comprehensive simulations, and experimental evaluations. In particular, the project aims to 1) identify practical issues towards the implementation of the proposed scheme and developing techniques that address the issues; 2) validate and refine the design via a thorough theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations; and 3) build a practical wireless environment and systematically evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the proposed design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electron transfer (ET) is the basis of operation of every electronic device. ET research can elucidate methods for efficient conversion of light to electrons and, subsequently, usable and storable chemical energy.  This NSF-funded project investigates a new generation of mixed-valent complexes to study the behavior of electronic delocalization in molecular systems. The ramifications of these findings can extend to the development of integrated circuits, quantum computing, and artificial photosynthesis.

Accordingly, developers have adopted many explainable recommendation models and interfaces in applications such as social media. However, these explanations are not personalized to users with varied digital literacy or computational knowledge and may not always ensure users understand the underlying rationale contributing to data or algorithms. This project fills this research gap by exploring the dynamic process of a user's understanding of an AI-based, explainable recommender system and how this understanding evolves. In addition, it extends the existing research horizon on explainable recommender systems by investigating a novel conversational interaction between people and target systems. Finally, this work will enable a new ecosystem through a unified research program consisting of modeling explanation strategies for different users and exploring and developing practical system prototypes. The project's success will deepen the scientific understanding of designing and implementing fair and transparent everyday use AIsystems for users of varied backgrounds and expertise. For instance, users may seek personalized explanations from a health recommendation system and make an informed decision based on transparency and comprehension.<br/><br/>This project aims to design and develop a conversational agent to provide personalized explanations around AI-based results and recommendations.

CS suffers from several disparities along racial and gender lines that limit the participation of students in a field that is becoming more critical for their future career paths and for society as a whole. The project team has identified two reasons leading to this problem that will addressed in this project. First, there is a critical shortage of educational resources for our undergraduate students in the first CS course. Many students struggle with the introductory curriculum and existing resources don't appear to be sufficient, particularly for underrepresented groups. Second, students, especially underrepresented students, are not affirmed in their CS identities and sense of belonging. This project will implement a peer mentor program to develop an effective, evidence-based, and sustainable program for the preparation, tutoring, and ongoing support of undergraduate students in the CS department at SFSU and evaluate its effectiveness. By recruiting diverse peer mentors, training them in equitable and inclusive pedagogical techniques, and establishing an affirming mentoring procedure, this project will develop mentors themselves to become future leaders while creating a safe and inclusive learning community for entry level CS students. This program will directly benefit approximately 800 CS students at SFSU, including 750 students who are enrolled in the introductory CS class and 50 peer mentors each calendar year.<br/><br/>By building an inclusive, sustainable community of learners that affirms the experiences and identities of underrepresented students, the project will help diversify the CS pipeline, leading to a wider range of ideas and approaches that can be brought to bear on society?s most pressing problems. Research will support programmatic activities as well as contributing new knowledge important to addressing the needs of CS students from marginalized groups. The team will explore three research questions: (1) to what extent does participation in peer mentoring affect mentees? sense of belonging, CS identity, and retention in the field? (2) to what extent does participation in an inclusive pedagogy class support peer mentors in developing a growth mindset and asset-based thinking, identifying the need for inclusive teaching practices, and implementing such practices? (3) what are the benefits to peer mentors in participation in the program, including their sense of belonging and CS identity? Assessment will use a mixed-methods approach, triangulating the results of Likert-scale surveys, open-ended surveys, semi-structured interviews, course artifacts and grade distributions. It is anticipated that mentees? and mentors' sense of belonging, CS identity, and program retention will increase. Results will be disseminated through CS and STEM education conferences and publications and the CSU Chancellor's office.

Applications are broad and include the safe and sustainable engineering of subsurface operations to extract energy (geothermal), store energy (hydrogen), and dispose of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide). Still others include the optimal design of components for fuel cells, batteries, and civil infrastructure, all of national interest to the US. Existing models used to predict deformation and failure of microstructurally complex porous materials are slow and contain knowledge gaps that stem from a lack of mechanistic understanding of the physics. This project aims to accelerate computer simulations through novel mathematical algorithms and to anchor the simulations to controlled lab experiments for improved physical understanding. The integrated educational activities include the training of next-generation engineers, curriculum development for graduate students, outreach to K-12 teachers of rural Pennsylvania through a summer research program in partnership with the Center for Science and the Schools at Penn State, and tools and data for domain experts.<br/><br/>There is a gap in the fundamental understanding of how porous materials deform and fail at microscopic scales. Classical poromechanical models used to simulate the physics approximate porous materials as continua and, therefore, cannot provide insights into the microscopic origins of failure. Direct numerical simulation presents an attractive alternative but is computationally expensive. This project will support the development of an integrated suite of lab experiments and computational methods with the overarching goal of: (1) enabling a mechanistic understanding of deformation and failure of brittle porous media; and (2) accelerating microscale simulations through physics-informed mathematical approximations. The combined effort will contribute towards establishing structure-property relations that are useful for designing and screening new and resilient microstructures.

They are an essential component of plate tectonics and the setting of the most hazardous earthquakes and volcanoes. Mantle flow above and below the subducting plate is driven by the motion of the subducting slab. The primary tool for investigating mantle flow at subduction zones is measuring the directional dependence of seismic wave speeds. Variations in wave speeds - called seismic anisotropy - arise from the alignment of minerals caused by mantle flow.  However, this technique requires linking seismic observations to data on the alignment of mineral grains in deformed rocks, in the context of mantle flow.  Here, the team combines state-of-the art rock-deformation experiments with models of mantle flow and models of seismic anisotropy in mantle rocks. They generate synthetic seismic waves that are compared with observations in Alaska, Cascadia, and South America.  The overarching goal is to improve the understanding of mantle flow in subduction zones and better constrain plate tectonics. The project provides support for graduate and undergraduate students trained in a rich interdisciplinary environment.  It also fosters outreach to K-12 students and teachers. The project outcomes will be shared with the community, notably through a multi-disciplinary conference on this topic. <br/><br/>The project activities yield a holistic view of mantle flow, olivine texture development, and seismic anisotropy observations in subduction zones. The project is organized around three tasks. First, the researchers conduct a new set of high pressure and temperature olivine deformation experiments using the Large Volume Torsion (LVT) apparatus at Washington University in St. Louis.  The aim is to determine how strain produces and subsequently modifies crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). They use these results to produce a suite of experimentally validated parameters for use in the D-Rex texture modeling program, which simulates the formation and evolution of olivine CPO.  Second, the updated D-Rex model is incorporated into new 3D models of subduction zones; these models use a nonlinear rheology and a set of alternative assumptions on the distribution of water in subduction zones. Third, the team uses the results of the numerically modeled subduction zones to simulate shear wave splitting in the mantle wedge and sub-slab mantle, using full-wavefield simulation techniques. Through these steps, the researchers define an ensemble of potential interpretations of mantle flow near subduction zones that are supported by existing and new data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Functional Data Analysis (FDA) investigates data containing information that varies over a continuum such as the temporal and spatial domains, with tremendous implications for many real-world applications, including finance, natural language processing, electric grid stabilization, and especially the medical field. For example, data types such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) provide multiple observations for different locations of the brain and scalp, and are prime contenders of FDA. However, both fMRI and EEG data are often highly skewed and may contain outliers; currently, traditional FDA methods are not able to analyze them fully and accurately. Despite the many recent advancements in the FDA literature, this area is still in its infancy with much potential yet to be uncovered. The project addresses this gap by developing a novel approach for analyzing functional data that is better able to account for heavy skewness and outlying observations. This approach will be used to examine both fMRI and EEG data with the goal of investigating two important neurological disorders: (1) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and (2) alcoholism.  Neurological disorders exhibit brain activity characterized by drastically different biochemical and electrical behavior where the output is either atypically high or atypically low, and hence more effectively analyzed using this new method. The results will be incorporated into open-source software for reproducibility and further research, and for encouraging possible future collaborations in the medical community. A new summer research program will support students from underrepresented backgrounds who will analyze the fMRI and EEG data sets and will provide recommendations and suggestions to the medical community through public dissemination. This experience will improve students? attitudes towards STEM careers, help them develop skills necessary for the 21st-century workforce, and encourage them to seek advanced degree opportunities. The project will provide research training opportunities at the graduate level as well.   <br/> <br/>The infinite dimensional nature of functional data motivates the use of dimension reduction techniques, whereas the skewness and outlying observations often encountered in medical data require the use of quantile regression (QR). Despite recent advancements in FDA, there is no current work on the intersection of both dimension reduction and QR for FDA. Therefore, the project addresses this gap by (1) developing a dimension reduction technique for QR with infinite dimensional functional predictors, (2) extending the method to incorporate additional categorical predictors that are common in medical studies, and (3) integrating the methods into students? training through investigation of the medical disorders of ADHD and alcoholism. This work will develop computationally efficient algorithms that will be disseminated through the PI?s existing software. Finally, this research will lead to new critically needed statistical methods for medical researchers working with rare diseases and will help clinicians to garner more actionable insight.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This motion is a result of internal neuromechanical processes that translate neural signals into the activation of muscular tissue. As tissue-engineered pumps and biohybrid robotics improve with every technological advancement, developing the theory behind the actuation of their excitable materials is paramount. While much of the theory in organismal biomechanics and biomimetic materials has examined their performance in the context of mechanical resonance, very little work has been done examining the internal actuation of excitable materials. The interplay between neural time scales, that signal for muscular activation, and mechanical time scales, that are inherent to the elastic profile of the structure, have been found to play an important role in the resulting motion of an actuated material. Furthermore, understanding the role pacemakers play in driving the neural signaling can elucidate how robustness can be ingrained into excitable systems. This research program will develop and employ a suite of mathematical models that describe neuromechanical activation and pacemaker processes, as well as incorporate ?living? materials into computational fluid-structure interaction models. The mathematical principles developed here are relevant in the design of actuators for other biological pumps and systems with excitable materials. The project will involve work with both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The focus of this research program will be to both examine the mathematical theory that girds the interplay between the neuromechanical actuation wave speed and the material wave speed, as well as examine the role pacemaker processes play in driving these neuromechanical systems. To examine this interplay, a moon jellyfish is chosen as a model organism due to the relative simplicity of their nervous system and muscle morphology. To develop this framework the investigators will employ three different classes of mathematical models: (1) 1-D/2-D elastic wave equation model with internal actuation; (2) a coupled neuronal network model to describe the neurophysiological activity that leads to actuation; (3) a 3-D computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model to describe the forces and motion of a jellyfish bell. The research program's focus is on the roles of actuation wave speeds, pacemaker processes, and the fluid environment plays in the performance of organismal pumps and excitable materials. The resulting framework will be used to develop the first 3-D model of a swimming organism that fully couples the surrounding fluid with an animal whose emergent kinematics are a consequence of neuromuscular activation, elastic properties, and pacemaker processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Underrepresented minority students at HSIs have the academic abilities to succeed in STEM, but they are underrepresented in STEM majors and occupations. At Menlo College, Hispanic students in particular, tend to choose business majors due to expectations of well-paid careers. As an HSI in Silicon Valley with a focus on undergraduate business education, Menlo College is uniquely situated to test how a change to the undergraduate biology curriculum can encourage Hispanic students majoring in business to increase their knowledge of biology and pursue careers in or related to biotechnology. The project will develop a new introductory multidisciplinary biology course that integrates two existing classes: Human Biology and Evolution, and Race and Racism. The class will include guest speakers from local biotechnology companies and students will visit local biotech businesses. The new curriculum is expected to generate enhanced student success, interest in completing additional biology classes, and interest in pursuing careers in biotechnology and related STEM fields.<br/><br/>The work will contribute to our understanding of how best to enhance Hispanic student academic success and postgraduate involvement in biology and related STEM fields through changes to undergraduate biology curricula, with the broader effect of increased numbers of Hispanic students choosing STEM postgraduate work and careers. Across four semesters, we will compare student learning and attitudes between students assigned to one of three versions of the introductory biology course (Human Biology): treatment, control, and baseline. Treatment sections will add a new race and racism module, with some lectures and labs delivered by an instructor with appropriate expertise and experience. Control sections will deliver the standard curriculum but the same instructor will deliver lectures and lab sessions in parallel with the treatment sections. Baseline sections will follow the standard curriculum. We hypothesize that enrollment in the treatment course will increase student learning and interest in STEM courses and careers. We expect that these effects will be stronger among students who identify as a race/ethnicity other than white, non-Hispanic. Outcomes will be measured using standard assessment procedures (e.g., final exams), student surveys, and institutional data (e.g., enrollment in additional biology courses, and post-graduation destinations). Findings will be submitted to an academic journal for dissemination with the broader public. Pilot data will also be used to generate an HSI Track 2: Implementation and Evaluation Project proposal to extend the insights from the pilot to improve student success in other STEM courses at Menlo College (and provide guidance for other institutions seeking to make similar curricular shifts).

However, most literature considers only single-phase models, which are not applicable for geophysical applications involving two-phase flows. With the support of lab experiment data, the investigators will study a new coupled multi-physics multi-scale model for describing the two-phase coupling, the corresponding decoupling numerical methods for efficiently and accurately solving this model, and two data assimilation methods for improving the model prediction. Applications of this work include groundwater systems in karst aquafer, carbon sequestration, petroleum extraction, geothermal systems in fractured reservoirs, interaction between surface and subsurface flows, and industrial filtrations. This project provides students training opportunities in data-enabled modeling, development of numerical methods and code packages, data assimilation methods, mathematical analysis, and engineering applications. Students involved in this project can gain a solid foundation in computational math and data science, valuable research experience, and extensive collaboration experience with engineers. This project is also part of the expansion of the computational and applied mathematics program and Missouri Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematical Sciences at Missouri S&T which has the potential to benefit the entire engineering-based university and help the state of Missouri enhance its research in computational mathematics. The investigator at Clemson will continue high school outreach activities.<br/><br/>Coupling two constituent models leads to a complex system involving different scales in the two-phase porous media flow and two-phase fluid flow, which demands accurate and efficient numerical methods. The use of existing data to improve the model prediction further increases the complexity and computational cost due to the large amount of data and the iterative nature of the data assimilation methods. The interaction of nonlinearity, time-dependence, realistic interface/boundary conditions, and data information in a dynamic system increases the model complexity and computational scale, leading to significant challenges for this intricate multi-physics multi-scale model in coupling the two-phase porous media flow and two-phase fluid flow. This project will carry out novel research on lab data enabled phase field modeling, stable decoupling method, data assimilation, and mathematical analysis for coupling two-phase flow in porous media with two-phase free flow, by using a newly proposed Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes-Darcy model with varying densities and viscosities.

Often, the eventual behavior of these functions is of interest: Do they stabilize or tend to infinity? How fast do they grow? Valued differential fields are mathematical structures that abstractly formalize these questions and possible answers. This project will investigate valued differential fields from the perspective of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic which involves studying properties of mathematical structures that can be expressed in formal languages, in turn revealing new insights into these structures and their complexity. In recent years the ideas and tools of model theory have had fruitful applications in other areas of mathematics, a trend this project will continue in the setting of valued differential fields. The project includes the training and mentoring of undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Valued differential fields are algebraic structures that formalize the asymptotic comparison of solutions to differential equations. This project aims to deepen our understanding of such structures and their model theory in two primary ways. First, it will investigate unordered valued differential fields, most ambitiously complex transseries, which have been much less studied than ordered valued differential fields. These latter structures describe only non-oscillating behavior, while oscillating functions play an important role in mathematics and in describing the real world, from water waves to wave functions in quantum physics. This project will search for universal domains for the kinds of asymptotic differential algebra in which oscillation is permitted and study their complexity. Second, the project will investigate certain ordered valued differential fields that can arise from transexponential extensions of transseries. The work will then address natural next steps, most significantly the study of certain quotient structures, called imaginaries, associated to such ordered valued differential fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inference of temporal and spatially-rewired gene expression networks carries enormous implications for dynamic disease processes, offering key mechanistic insights into the dynamic variations of interacting biological processes in space and time. The behavior of such interconnected systems can be captured via spatio-temporal graphical models. The existing methods for inferring these models suffer from several statistical and computational drawbacks which render them impractical in realistic settings. With the goal of bridging this knowledge gap, this project aims at developing efficient computational tools for the inference of spatio-temporal graphical models that are not only provably optimal, but also adaptive, parallelizable, and implementable in meaningful scales. The methods developed in this proposal will be studied in the context of inferring gene networks underlying oncogenesis. The datasets generated through these efforts will be accompanied with well-developed analytics tools to derive mechanistic insights into the nature of gene-networks underlying biological processes. More broadly, the proposed machinery will give rise to models that are interpretable by domain experts, and will lead to a rich set of publicly-available datasets that can be used as test-bed for different inference methods, resulting in broader artificial intelligence (AI)-human collaborations.<br/><br/>Much of the progress in the inference of graphical models is based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with relaxed regularization, which neither result in ideal statistical properties nor scale to dimensions encountered in spatio-temporal settings. This project will address these challenges by departing from the regularized MLE paradigm, and resorting to a new class of constrained optimization problems with combinatorial nature that can systematically capture the hidden-but-useful structure of the spatio-temporal graphical models. Due to the prohibitively complex nature of the MLE-based methods, their practical implementations cannot simultaneously guarantee computational efficiency and favorable statistical performance. Therefore, the proposed approach will be the first systematic inference framework that can achieve the best of both worlds in a unified fashion. The new class of estimation methods will have a profound impact in statistical learning: it will lead to a renewed interest in the use of tractable discrete approaches and their statistical properties, and will pave the way towards the discovery of new inference methods suitable for the large-dimensional and spatio-temporal settings. In addition, the proposed project will be the first systematic study of a class of discrete optimization problems that are currently poorly understood, thus contributing to the combinatorial and mixed-integer communities as well. Given its interdisciplinary nature, the project will also largely contribute to training of future generations of researchers in data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, it is the only viable option for many engineering applications (for example, space launch vehicles). Therefore, the continued study of combustion physics and development of new, more efficient, and cleaner combustion devices is a high priority in today?s engineering world. Over the past five decades, combustion simulations have been invaluable to this effort, and yet they still pose a multitude of challenges. This project aims to tackle one such challenge, specifically how to quickly evaluate chemical properties. The approach proposed here is to combine machine learning methods, which can give a rough estimate of the property of interest, with previously developed tabulation methods that work by bridging the gaps between a relatively small number of evaluations. This combined approach will allow for combustion simulations that are faster, use more complex chemical models, and are more accurate. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students and provide them with mentoring and experience that will be valuable for their future careers in academia and industry. <br/><br/>This research aims to improve the computational efficiency of chemical property evaluations, which comprise most of the computational cost in reactive flow simulations with detailed chemistry. The proposed approach is to use a combination of neural networks (NN) and in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT), combining the strengths of both. Whereas NN can provide a function approximation at low memory cost, their accuracy cannot be improved without eventually overfitting the data. In contrast, ISAT can achieve any desired level of accuracy, but the size of the resulting table, and hence the computational cost, increases as the maximum allowable error is decreased. The ISAT table size scales with the Hessian of the function being approximated, and so reduction of this Hessian will also lead to a smaller table and lower computational cost. Such reduction will be achieved by using ISAT to tabulate not the full function of interest, but rather the difference between it and an NN function which approximates its Hessian. Two approaches for Hessian approximation will be developed and evaluated. In the first, a simple NN implementation will be trained to approximate the chemical function itself, and will thus approximate the Hessian only implicitly. For the second, an explicit Hessian approximation will be implemented via custom NN loss definitions based on finite differences between adjacent points. The effectiveness of the NN+ISAT combination will be tested on both partially-stirred reactor (PaSR) test cases and complex geometry reacting flow simulations. Success of the proposed methods can lead to significant speedup in reactive flow simulations, enabling the use of larger and more accurate chemical mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing based on automated metal arc welding is capable of large-scale and high-rate depositions and has the potential to provide flexibility and accelerated production needed to support the energy infrastructure. However, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how processing conditions affect the material's microstructures and the high-temperature mechanical properties and if post-processing is needed, hinders the adoption of such arc-welding based additive manufacturing in the industry. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports an integrated experimental and modeling approach to develop a mechanistic link between processing conditions, during additive manufacturing and required post-processing, and crucial microstructural features that dictate high-temperature creep and fatigue performance relevant to power generation operations. The project will also involve a minority-serving 2-year welding technology program and develop a module that teaches welding apprentices with various forms of automation, plus a joint capstone project with engineering students from the Colorado School of Mines, which provides a unique opportunity of team working with mutual appreciation of complementary skills and expertise. The automation module will then be shared with other paired 2-year and 4-year educational institutes around the country to develop a cohesive workforce for additive manufacturing. This educational endeavor will contribute to a more diverse, agile, and effective workforce, thus promoting the energy security and Nation?s prosperity.<br/><br/>The overall research objective is to address the challenging knowledge gaps, in both process and materials engineering, needed to realize emerging clean power generation technologies. To overcome the complexity, the project team will develop a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the processing, microstructures, and high temperature property relationships in wire arc additive manufacturing of a nickel-based superalloy, i.e., Haynes 282. Experimental methods including fabrications, in-situ thermal imaging, hot isostatic pressing, material characterizations and various mechanical testing will be combined with analytical and computational models to fundamentally investigate: (1) influence of deposition conditions to as-build microstructures and morphology, (2) potential of hot isostatic pressing to simultaneously reduce defects while controlling the grain size and morphology, and (3) effects of microstructure characteristics (controlled by deposition and hot isostatic pressing) on high-temperature tensile, fatigue, and creep performance between 800 and 900 Celsius, targeting demanding severe power plant environments.

However, most literature considers only single-phase models, which are not applicable for geophysical applications involving two-phase flows. With the support of lab experiment data, the investigators will study a new coupled multi-physics multi-scale model for describing the two-phase coupling, the corresponding decoupling numerical methods for efficiently and accurately solving this model, and two data assimilation methods for improving the model prediction. Applications of this work include groundwater systems in karst aquafer, carbon sequestration, petroleum extraction, geothermal systems in fractured reservoirs, interaction between surface and subsurface flows, and industrial filtrations. This project provides students training opportunities in data-enabled modeling, development of numerical methods and code packages, data assimilation methods, mathematical analysis, and engineering applications. Students involved in this project can gain a solid foundation in computational math and data science, valuable research experience, and extensive collaboration experience with engineers. This project is also part of the expansion of the computational and applied mathematics program and Missouri Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematical Sciences at Missouri S&T which has the potential to benefit the entire engineering-based university and help the state of Missouri enhance its research in computational mathematics. The investigator at Clemson will continue high school outreach activities.<br/><br/>Coupling two constituent models leads to a complex system involving different scales in the two-phase porous media flow and two-phase fluid flow, which demands accurate and efficient numerical methods. The use of existing data to improve the model prediction further increases the complexity and computational cost due to the large amount of data and the iterative nature of the data assimilation methods. The interaction of nonlinearity, time-dependence, realistic interface/boundary conditions, and data information in a dynamic system increases the model complexity and computational scale, leading to significant challenges for this intricate multi-physics multi-scale model in coupling the two-phase porous media flow and two-phase fluid flow. This project will carry out novel research on lab data enabled phase field modeling, stable decoupling method, data assimilation, and mathematical analysis for coupling two-phase flow in porous media with two-phase free flow, by using a newly proposed Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes-Darcy model with varying densities and viscosities. This research dynamically combines all of these components into a hybrid system of research and development that will take advantage of the inherent relationship between the novel mathematical modeling/methods/analysis and the practical engineering advances in validation/data assimilation/applications, laying the groundwork for reliable modeling of many relevant applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex systems are networks comprising many collaborating elements that continuously interact with each other in a nonlinear and counterintuitive manner; examples include cybersecurity, manufacturing processes, automated transportation infrastructure, medical devices, and many others relevant to our well-being. Faults in these systems are malfunctions, such as cyber-attack or sensor failure, that break security, degrade system functionality, and cause safety concerns and economic losses. Control of these systems is challenging because the dynamic behavior of the ensemble is intrinsically difficult to predict. This award supports fundamental research to build a ?fault-aware? control framework to study how interactions among individual elements produce the collective?s dynamics and how to alleviate the effect of faults on complex systems. To develop and test the control framework, a failing heart managed by a ventricular assist device will be used as the foundation to (i) detect device faults such as thrombosis and suction that jeopardize the survival of heart failure patients and (ii) automatically adjust the operation of the device under faults to improve the patient quality of life. The educational and outreach plan will focus on promoting active and life-long learning and engaging and training students at various levels, including veterans transitioning to civilian life, in emerging industries and transdisciplinary skills.<br/><br/>Using machine learning as the backbone, the objective of this research is to create a data-driven control strategy that regulates and maintains the system?s homeostasis following the onset of faults, while ensuring the system continues to operate in a seamless, continuous manner. This research will fill the knowledge gap for the supervision and control of complex systems when the governing phenomena are unknown and when first principle models are not readily attainable. The data-driven strategy will also overcome design limitations. Designing complex systems, such as ventricular assist devices, based on first principle models is costly, time consuming, and requires extensive expert knowledge to build application-specific models based on ubiquitous assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in practice. This research project will integrate data analytics, control theory, and machine learning into a unified framework with three innovative aspects: developing machine learning methods to discover symptomatic fingerprints of faults directly from data for real-time fault diagnosis; building an online adaptive modeling paradigm to predict performance-related variables that are not directly measurable due to economic considerations or technical constraints; designing a fault-tolerant controller to improve the system?s performance, while ensuring all operational constraints are met. In addition to its application to ventricular assist devices, this framework can be applied to protect computer systems from digital attacks, improve manufacturing efficiency, and address safety issues in automated transportation infrastructure and medical devices, leading to compelling societal and economic benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout the short yet rich history of evolution of connected and autonomous vehicles, a salient paradigm is to accomplish the efficient data exchange among vehicles, which has made vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications a household name. Despite the rapid evolution of V2X communications, successful exchange of safety messages still remains an ambitious task mainly due to the high mobility and dynamicity of vehicular systems. The bigger problem is that as more vehicles are connected and autonomously driven, the number of exchanged messages will explode, which will likely deteriorate the chance of successful message delivery. As an effort to address this problem, we propose to carefully define the priority of the transmitted information and prioritize channel access among vehicles accordingly. Predicated on the significance, this project will form a significant step towards the overarching vision of persistent and reliable operations of connected and autonomous vehicles in real-world conditions. The proposed research activities will go hand-in-hand with educational and outreach activities to train the next generation of engineers in multidisciplinary thinking. Specifically, the outcomes of this project (i.e., a testbed and further academic findings) will act as the research team's main resource in modernization of the courses, promotion of underrepresented minorities recruitment, community outreach, undergraduate research, and further collaboration with local/national stakeholders on resolving practical issues in deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles.<br/><br/>The key intellectual contributions of this project lie in the following innovative aspects: 1) Quantification of a ""metric"" capturing the holistic impacts of multiple risk-determining features in concert; 2) Formulation of the metric computation mechanism as a ""combinatorial optimization"" problem with a time constraint; 3) Proposition of a practical methodology of ""solving"" the proposed combinatorial optimization problem; 4) Development of a ""testbed"" implementing the proposed risk-based prioritization among safety message types defined in current V2X use cases.

However, iron is toxic when present in excess or improperly distributed within the cell or the organism. To cope with such paradox, organisms have evolved delicate strategies to tightly control iron. Uncovering the processes of iron regulation will generate knowledge fundamental to biology. Meanwhile, iron deficiency is a serious public health issue that affects nearly half of the global population. Staple crops, which are not rich sources of iron, are the main dietary source of iron worldwide. Therefore, to sustainably solve iron malnutrition, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of iron regulation in plants and apply the knowledge for biofortification, the process of enhancing nutritional value of crops via selective breeding or genetic engineering. This project focuses on investigating iron regulation in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are specialized intracellular compartments central to plant metabolism and require high levels of iron for their function. The expected outcomes of this project will provide knowledge significant for its scientific merit and critical insights that can be applied to improve agriculture and human health. Furthermore, the proposed educational activities to enhance authentic research experience for undergraduate students and the community-based learning non-major biology course for K-12 outreach will foster the growth of next generation scientists and science communicators.<br/><br/>Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the site of vital metabolic processes that require iron. These organelles are also involved in sensing iron and integrating signals to coordinate metabolic and physiological responses to changes in iron levels.

This project investigates iron regulation in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts, and its impact at the cellular and physiological levels, by examining Arabidopsis mutants defective in exporting iron from the mitochondria and chloroplasts. Specifically, abnormal membrane invaginations detected in iron-deficient mutants defective in mitochondrial and chloroplast iron export will be analyzed to test the hypothesis that these structures contribute to intercellular iron transport using cell biology and advanced imaging techniques. Membrane trafficking has not been previously studied in the context of mitochondrial and chloroplast iron and will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant iron homeostasis. The potential functional interactions between the chloroplast/mitochondrial iron exporter and proteins that sequester iron in chloroplasts and mitochondria will also be investigated using molecular genetics, biochemistry, and proteomic approaches. Such analyses will provide critical knowledge on inter-organellar iron homeostasis in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

They are an essential component of plate tectonics and the setting of the most hazardous earthquakes and volcanoes. Mantle flow above and below the subducting plate is driven by the motion of the subducting slab. The primary tool for investigating mantle flow at subduction zones is measuring the directional dependence of seismic wave speeds. Variations in wave speeds - called seismic anisotropy - arise from the alignment of minerals caused by mantle flow.  However, this technique requires linking seismic observations to data on the alignment of mineral grains in deformed rocks, in the context of mantle flow.  Here, the team combines state-of-the art rock-deformation experiments with models of mantle flow and models of seismic anisotropy in mantle rocks. They generate synthetic seismic waves that are compared with observations in Alaska, Cascadia, and South America.  The overarching goal is to improve the understanding of mantle flow in subduction zones and better constrain plate tectonics. The project provides support for graduate and undergraduate students trained in a rich interdisciplinary environment.  It also fosters outreach to K-12 students and teachers. The project outcomes will be shared with the community, notably through a multi-disciplinary conference on this topic. <br/><br/>The project activities yield a holistic view of mantle flow, olivine texture development, and seismic anisotropy observations in subduction zones. The project is organized around three tasks. First, the researchers conduct a new set of high pressure and temperature olivine deformation experiments using the Large Volume Torsion (LVT) apparatus at Washington University in St. Louis.  The aim is to determine how strain produces and subsequently modifies crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). They use these results to produce a suite of experimentally validated parameters for use in the D-Rex texture modeling program, which simulates the formation and evolution of olivine CPO.  Second, the updated D-Rex model is incorporated into new 3D models of subduction zones; these models use a nonlinear rheology and a set of alternative assumptions on the distribution of water in subduction zones. Third, the team uses the results of the numerically modeled subduction zones to simulate shear wave splitting in the mantle wedge and sub-slab mantle, using full-wavefield simulation techniques. Through these steps, the researchers define an ensemble of potential interpretations of mantle flow near subduction zones that are supported by existing and new data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Until recently, chemists thought of these processes as being controlled almost entirely by the potential energy surface, akin to looking for the lowest pass through mountains. More recently, it was learned that it is not uncommon for the participant atoms to explore previously unrecognized reaction paths or switch between low-energy paths. Sometimes there is not even a clearly unique path, with the atoms spending significant amounts of time ?roaming? before the reaction completes. This project combines experimental and computational methods to answer such fundamental questions as how energy flows in the fragmenting ion, what molecular-level parameters govern outcomes of reactions, and how/when reaction mechanisms defy conventional logic. The research involves undergraduate and graduate students from California?s Central Valley who are often the first in the family to get a university degree. This project provides them with advanced experimental and theoretical skills to position them well on the high-tech job market.<br/><br/>Non-minimum-energy-pathway (non-MEP) mechanisms, such as nonstatistical dynamic effects, reaction path bifurcations, and roaming, can lead to unusual branching ratios and unusual distributions of internal and kinetic energy in reaction products. This project uses Photoelectron Photoion Coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy to investigate unimolecular dissociations involving non-MEP phenomena in energy-selected gas-phase ions. The instruments, built by Professor Sztray and collaborators, enable measurement of both stable and unstable, thermal and molecular-beam-cooled species, and allow collection of branching, unimolecular rate, and kinetic energy release data with meV resolution. The experimental studies are complemented by Professor Dutoi?s molecular dynamics trajectory calculations to elucidate their mechanisms, further extended by high-level quantum-chemical calculations at select points. Integrating experimentation with computational modeling and theory from the onset allows extraction of physical insights not previously attainable by either experiment or theory alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a subduction zone, one tectonic plate dives beneath another and is heated during its descent into Earth?s deep interior. With heat, the hydrous minerals in the down-going plate breakdown to produce water-rich fluids. These fluids are buoyant and rise back to the surface, driving chemical reactions along their path. Important geological phenomena driven by these fluids include the violent volcanoes that dot the Pacific Ring of Fire, the economic concentration of critical elements along the edges of continents, the production of continental crust, and the addition and replenishment of gasses in Earth?s interior. Research efforts of this project center on experimental investigations of how the halogen elements trace the path of fluids through subduction zones and modify the chemical properties of water-rich fluids at depth. Educational efforts of this project include developing curricula to better engage students interested in STEM and training students in cutting edge research techniques at the graduate and undergraduate level.  <br/><br/>This project will support three specific research tasks. The first task is to experimentally measure the elemental partitioning of halogens between slab minerals and water-rich fluids under applicable pressure and temperature conditions. These data will be applied towards predicting the halogen chemistry of fluids and residual minerals for different slab conditions. Predictions will then be compared to observations from arc volcanoes and mantle sources to constrain how halogens are mobilized through subduction zones. The second task is to measure how efficiently chlorine increases the solute concentrations of water-rich fluids under conditions applicable to slab-fluid interactions. The collected data will inform how the chemistry of subduction zone fluids are determined. The third task is to quantify how the fluid-saturated melting point of rocks is increased by the addition of chlorine. Results will be applied towards understanding the thermal structure of subduction zones and the associated propensity for slab melting. The combined efforts of the research tasks will yield a systematic investigation for how halogens trace and modify mass transfer in subduction settings. This project will also support major educational efforts. The first is to develop an introductory class focused on planetary science. The class will be offered through the Tulane Science Scholars Program, a program that targets southern Louisiana high school students and enables a diverse cohort of ~150 students to take a STEM class over the summer for college credit. No geosciences class is currently offered through this program, and the newly developed planetary science class will fill this crucial hole in the current curriculum. The second is to revamp the laboratory activities of the Earth Materials class at Tulane to introduce students to a wide range of analytical techniques commonly applied within geochemistry. The impact of this revamping will be enhanced by partnering with other institutions that teach Earth Materials courses to help refine the laboratory activities. The refined activities will be posted to community repositories for curricula. The third educational effort will provide training for three PhD students in materials synthesis and materials characterization techniques. Within this effort, undergraduate students will be recruited from the New Orleans metro area to join the research efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most AI systems use some kinds of thresholds to make decisions. This project aims to improve fairness-aware AI technologies by formulating threshold-agnostic metrics for decision making. In particular, the research team will improve the training procedures of fairness-constrained AI models to make the model adaptive to different contexts, applicable to different applications, and subject to emerging fairness constraints. The success of this project will yield a transferable approach to improve fairness in various aspects of society by eliminating the disparate impacts and enhancing the fairness of AI systems in the hands of the decision makers. Together with AI practitioners, the researchers will integrate the techniques in this project into real-world systems such as education analytics. This project will also contribute to training future professionals in AI and machine learning and broaden this activity by including training high school students and under-represented undergraduates.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on advancing optimization for threshold-agnostic fair AI systems. The research activities include: (i) developing scalable stochastic optimization algorithms for optimizing a broad family of rank-based threshold-agnostic objectives; (ii) developing novel threshold-agnostic fairness measures including Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) fairness, Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) fairness, etc. and studying the relationship between them and the existing fairness measures; (iii) developing efficient stochastic methods for in-processing fairness-aware learning methods to directly optimize threshold-agnostic objectives subject to new threshold-agnostic fairness-ensuring constraints; and, (iv) investigating effective end-to-end deep learning framework that not only automatically learns the feature representations, but also satisfies the fairness constraints.

In the field of artificial intelligence, this process has been leveraged at a high level to develop evolutionary algorithms: computer programs that apply this framework to adapt solutions to computationally hard problems. Despite their popularity on a wide range of practical applications, relatively little is understood about their working principles, or how the structure of problems might influence their applicability. Moreover, there is a rich potential of untapped interdisciplinary knowledge situated at the confluence of biological evolution and algorithms. This project addresses this by establishing an Algorithmic Evolution Lab to serve as an incubator of scientific ideas that explore the boundaries between algorithmic evolution and mathematical models of evolving populations. The principal aim of the Algorithmic Evolution Lab is to study evolution and adaptation from the lens of computational complexity. The impacts of this project include developing new insights into how different forces affect the speed of adaptation in both natural and artificial settings. It will also yield rigorous performance guarantees for optimization heuristics coming from the field of artificial intelligence. As society becomes more reliant on techniques from artificial intelligence, it is increasingly more critical that these algorithms are rigorously analyzed. This is especially the case when human life and safety is at stake, or when algorithmic processes can have dramatic and unintended effects within broader systems. This project will help to publicize and push forward the rigorous analysis of these kinds of algorithms.  The research is also tightly coupled to the educational and outreach goals of the project. The Algorithmic Evolution Lab builds an environment for students to conduct interdisciplinary research. Activities such as undergraduate research workshops and guest lectures from prominent women in computer science will serve the goal of improving the gender balance in computer science, and creating pathways to STEM research opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The project will apply tools from the theory of parameterized complexity to explain how different evolutionary search operators influence the speed of adaptation on combinatorial landscapes, and how landscape structure in turn influences this speed. Evolutionary algorithms and other optimization heuristics from AI are robust and general-purpose, yet often come with many modules and design choices. Finding reasonable configurations requires a costly, ad-hoc trial-and-error approach. The project will identify parameters, both in problem structure and algorithm design, that isolate the source of exponential complexity for the algorithm to provide a rigorous understanding of the influence of different operators on running time. This will result in a principled approach to designing and tuning these techniques in practice. The project will also offer a fresh view on traditional theoretical work in evolutionary biology by tackling an old problem from a new algorithmic perspective. Wright's Shifting Balance Theory contends that stochastic processes such as genetic drift are critical forces in the dynamics of adaptation. This conflicts with the Fisherian view that adaptation is a simple hill-climbing process. By applying tools from the running time analysis of evolutionary algorithms, this project will attack these questions from a novel framework based on computational complexity in which efficiency of adaptation can be made rigorous.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, in genomics, the interactions among genes can be modeled via spatio-temporal gene regulatory networks across different cells. The inference of temporal and spatially-rewired gene expression networks carries enormous implications for dynamic disease processes, offering key mechanistic insights into the dynamic variations of interacting biological processes in space and time. The behavior of such interconnected systems can be captured via spatio-temporal graphical models. The existing methods for inferring these models suffer from several statistical and computational drawbacks which render them impractical in realistic settings. With the goal of bridging this knowledge gap, this project aims at developing efficient computational tools for the inference of spatio-temporal graphical models that are not only provably optimal, but also adaptive, parallelizable, and implementable in meaningful scales. The methods developed in this proposal will be studied in the context of inferring gene networks underlying oncogenesis. The datasets generated through these efforts will be accompanied with well-developed analytics tools to derive mechanistic insights into the nature of gene-networks underlying biological processes. More broadly, the proposed machinery will give rise to models that are interpretable by domain experts, and will lead to a rich set of publicly-available datasets that can be used as test-bed for different inference methods, resulting in broader artificial intelligence (AI)-human collaborations.<br/><br/>Much of the progress in the inference of graphical models is based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with relaxed regularization, which neither result in ideal statistical properties nor scale to dimensions encountered in spatio-temporal settings. This project will address these challenges by departing from the regularized MLE paradigm, and resorting to a new class of constrained optimization problems with combinatorial nature that can systematically capture the hidden-but-useful structure of the spatio-temporal graphical models. Due to the prohibitively complex nature of the MLE-based methods, their practical implementations cannot simultaneously guarantee computational efficiency and favorable statistical performance. Therefore, the proposed approach will be the first systematic inference framework that can achieve the best of both worlds in a unified fashion. The new class of estimation methods will have a profound impact in statistical learning: it will lead to a renewed interest in the use of tractable discrete approaches and their statistical properties, and will pave the way towards the discovery of new inference methods suitable for the large-dimensional and spatio-temporal settings. In addition, the proposed project will be the first systematic study of a class of discrete optimization problems that are currently poorly understood, thus contributing to the combinatorial and mixed-integer communities as well. Given its interdisciplinary nature, the project will also largely contribute to training of future generations of researchers in data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are an essential component of plate tectonics and the setting of the most hazardous earthquakes and volcanoes. Mantle flow above and below the subducting plate is driven by the motion of the subducting slab. The primary tool for investigating mantle flow at subduction zones is measuring the directional dependence of seismic wave speeds. Variations in wave speeds - called seismic anisotropy - arise from the alignment of minerals caused by mantle flow.  However, this technique requires linking seismic observations to data on the alignment of mineral grains in deformed rocks, in the context of mantle flow.  Here, the team combines state-of-the art rock-deformation experiments with models of mantle flow and models of seismic anisotropy in mantle rocks. They generate synthetic seismic waves that are compared with observations in Alaska, Cascadia, and South America.  The overarching goal is to improve the understanding of mantle flow in subduction zones and better constrain plate tectonics. The project provides support for graduate and undergraduate students trained in a rich interdisciplinary environment.  It also fosters outreach to K-12 students and teachers. The project outcomes will be shared with the community, notably through a multi-disciplinary conference on this topic. <br/><br/>The project activities yield a holistic view of mantle flow, olivine texture development, and seismic anisotropy observations in subduction zones. The project is organized around three tasks. First, the researchers conduct a new set of high pressure and temperature olivine deformation experiments using the Large Volume Torsion (LVT) apparatus at Washington University in St. Louis.  The aim is to determine how strain produces and subsequently modifies crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). They use these results to produce a suite of experimentally validated parameters for use in the D-Rex texture modeling program, which simulates the formation and evolution of olivine CPO.  Second, the updated D-Rex model is incorporated into new 3D models of subduction zones; these models use a nonlinear rheology and a set of alternative assumptions on the distribution of water in subduction zones. Third, the team uses the results of the numerically modeled subduction zones to simulate shear wave splitting in the mantle wedge and sub-slab mantle, using full-wavefield simulation techniques. Through these steps, the researchers define an ensemble of potential interpretations of mantle flow near subduction zones that are supported by existing and new data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fatigue is a physical process that is associated with the failure of crystalline materials under continuous and repeated application of loads. The knowledge of fatigue is of immense value in preventing the failure of metallic structural components in machinery, equipment and structures. The accurate prediction of fatigue life requires the need to know the governing mechanistic drivers for crack initiation at the microscale (the scale at which cracks initiate).

Understanding fatigue damage in crystalline materials is challenging because the microstructural features such as persistent slip bands and their interactions, in the vicinity of the crack initiation sites evolve continuously with cyclic loading. The continuous evolution of the microstructure generates complex micromechanical fields and interactions which makes it difficult to pinpoint the governing mechanistic drivers for crack initiation. Specific goals of this work include: (1) identify how strain localization affects the surface deformation during cyclic loading; (2) establish a unifying understanding of mechanistic drivers for subsurface deformation; (3) investigate the microstructural and micromechanical rationale for strain localization as a precursor to crack initiation and, (4) identify the influence of high strain gradients on microcracking at persistent slip band-matrix interfaces. This will be achieved through an integrated computational and experimental approach.<br/><br/>Insights and tools obtained from the research will improve the accuracy of fatigue life predictions for a variety of large-grained metallic structural components and thin film devices that undergo cyclic stresses.

Veige of University of Florida is developing new catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic polymers. Catalysts can be designed to perform many functions. In the case of polymer synthesis, the metal ion gathers the monomeric building blocks and stitches them together to create large oligomeric molecules (polymers).  Synthetic polymers are used in almost every aspect of our lives and are present in the materials we use daily. The polymers are almost exclusively long molecular chains containing chain ends. The properties of polymers are dictated by both the monomeric repeating unit (i.e. the chain links) and by the chain ends. Cyclic polymers do not have chain ends. Many advantageous properties can result from the lack of chain ends. For example, these cyclic polymers generally have improved optical properties, higher melting temperature, lower friction, reduced viscosity, and smaller size. The challenge is to build polymers without chain ends. This project involves the synthesis and design of several new tungsten- and molybdenum-based catalysts that can stitch together monomers to create cyclic polymers on a large scale. Another aspect of the research focuses broadening access to these highly specialized catalysts so other researchers can expand the scope of cyclic polymer and catalyst research rapidly.  The research activities associated with this award are expected to increase broadening participation and enable training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in catalysis chemistry. The longstanding public outreach event ?Halloween Molecular Mania?, hosted by the Dr. Veige and the Center for Catalysis at the University of Florida, involves presenting science in an interactive forum to the local community. The current project aims to create new methods of communicating scientific concepts though this outreach mechanism to participating local teachers, high school students, and their parents.<br/><br/>Under this award from the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Adam S. Veige of University of Florida is developing new catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic polymers. In the first goal,  a unique alkylidyne will be synthesized that has the capacity to polymerize alkynes to give new cyclic polymer materials. New ligand designs and new metalation strategies will be explored that have the potential to broaden catalyst design principles in organometallic chemistry. A second goal focuses on new strategies to build catalysts more efficiently. Existing W- and Mo-based cyclic polymer catalysts require numerous steps in their syntheses. This project aims to reduce the number of synthetic steps to three or four, thereby making such catalysts more synthetically accessible, and in this way, more readily available to other researchers working in the fields of catalysis polymer chemistry. Another catalyst project centers on building tethered alkylidene catalysts from commercial sources using a novel ligand design invented at the University of Florida.  The catalyst takes advantage of a new concept in metathesis chemistry that employs a double tethered metallacyclobutane functionality. More efficient, more accessible, more selective catalysts and higher catalyst activities may well be forthcoming from this work. Students participating in this research project will gain skills and knowledge important in catalyst design, polymer synthesis, and molecular characterization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spatially variable geologic structure near the ground surface exerts a significant influence on the intensity of ground shaking (known as site effects) and can exacerbate damage to the built environment. Drinking water and wastewater utilities are critical lifelines because of the significant negative effects of earthquake damage on the ability to fight fires, on public health, and the economy. This CAREER grant will foster a paradigm shift in system-level seismic hazard assessments for water distribution systems to overcome current practices that oversimplify the effects of near-surface geologic conditions. Accounting for site effects and uncertainty can reduce damage and service losses and improve post-event rapid damage assessments. The educational impacts include reshaping students? training in data analytics and uncertainty quantification, while the main outreach impact is the launch of the first Earthquake Engineering and Seismology Community Alliance in Latin America (E2SCALA).<br/><br/>The goals of this CAREER grant are to (1) advance scientific knowledge underlying multiscale assessments of site response and incorporate it into system-level probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for water distribution systems, and (2) improve retention strategies for and broaden participation of women and Latin American students in STEM fields. Numerical modeling, geospatial analytics and uncertainty quantification will be used. A new conditional site response model capable of adapting to and integrating all available subsurface data and the associated uncertainties will be formulated. The influence of spatially variable site effects on spatial correlations among ground motion intensity measures will be quantified, as well as azimuth-dependencies in site response. An improved system-level probabilistic approach that incorporates local site effects only at critical locations of the system will be created, and ergodicity will be assumed elsewhere for computational efficiency. The improved probabilistic approach will be implemented in three case studies of water distribution systems. ""Escala"" means ""to climb"" and also ""to scale"" in Spanish and those are key drivers of this CAREER project.

Despite the impressive progress in SfM, there are many open computational and mathematical problems. The goal of this project is to address these problems. Not only are these problems important to computer vision research, but they are also fundamental for computational mathematics and optimization research. In particular, mathematically guaranteed global procedures, which avoid unnecessary heuristics and parameters, are expected to be relevant to other applied problems. <br/><br/>The overall project aims to create theoretically-guaranteed optimization components for the SfM pipeline. The current pipeline still uses incremental and heuristic procedures, lacks sufficient guarantees for handling highly corrupted datasets and is slow. The specific subprojects are guided by rigorous mathematical approaches. In particular, mathematical arguments suggest optimal choices and definitions. They are also helpful with many practical considerations of SfM, such as reducing the number of parameters and improving robustness to corruption. These arguments are expected to develop into interesting mathematical theorems. The investigator will continue guiding graduate and undergraduate students in research. The investigator will also continue facilitating educational activities that prepare students for successful careers in industry.

Methods that can solve the many-body Schrodinger equation in a truly ab initio manner, such as Quantum Monte Carlo, are crucial for accurately modeling their properties. One of the most promising 2D magnets that has recently been synthesized is vanadium diselenide due to its high Curie and charge density wave transition temperatures.

The time it takes for water to move through an environment is often used as an important estimator of water quality and ecosystem health. In river deltas, this is complicated by the presence of deep, fast-moving water in channels that is connected to slow, shallow moving water in vegetated wetlands. It is important to understand how water transport times in river deltas evolve over time because of the considerable interest in using natural deltaic land-building processes for coastal restoration. This project investigates these issues using field work in coastal Louisiana and computer simulations of water movement in growing river deltas. An educational plan builds on these themes by training university students using innovative field measurements for coastal hydrology, integrating coastal hydrology research into undergraduate and graduate coursework, and engaging K-8 students with demonstrations, guided research projects, and field trips.  <br/><br/>River deltas are highly dynamic ecosystems with complicated hydrology that are of significant societal and environmental importance. This research addresses an urgent need in hydrology to understand how hydrological processes evolve in non-stationary ecosystems using numerical modeling, field observations, and graph theory. The project will develop the concept of Dynamic Water Transport Timescales and establish a framework for quantifying how changes to delta morphology and hydrodynamics impact water transport time. Fundamental questions will be addressed concerning the impacts of multi-decadal morphodynamic change on short-term hydrological transport in river deltas, the surface water responses to internal and external perturbations across time and space, and the links between deltaic channel network structure and water transport times. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences program and the Education & Human Resources program in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its ubiquity and importance to daily life, how humans physically interact with one another remains poorly understood. This project can make important contributions towards the development of biologically inspired control systems, aligning with the PIs' long-term goal of developing more effective biologically inspired robot-guided neurorehabilitation systems that can seamlessly interact with humans.<br/><br/>The investigators use the theoretical frameworks of decision sciences and optimal feedback control to explore how multiple interacting humans use vision and touch to make rapid decisions and coordinate their actions. Human pairs will be immersed in a state-of-the-art virtual reality and robotics suite that allows individuals to sense their partner?s actions visually and haptically while they perform either a collaborative or competitive motor task. In addition to healthy participants, the investigators also consider a stroke population in order to gain causal insight into how the nervous system weighs visual and haptic feedback when sensory information becomes sparse due to brain injury. The blend of experimental work and computational modeling involving both healthy and clinical populations will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms that underpin emergent interactive behavior.

Moreover, privacy and security configurations are often hidden and opaque. Thus it is hard for individuals to manage configurations and behaviors in ways that are consistent with their preferences. Bad actors or adversarial agents can take advantage of ambiguity or information leaks that result from poor settings and user uncertainty to find attack routes for disinformation and phishing. Conversely, socially beneficial behaviors that require data sharing are also hindered. A better understanding of the relationships among preferences, behaviors, and interfaces can help address these concerns. Business interests in preventing phishing can be preserved by understanding individual preferences and their relationship to employee behaviors. Personalized interventions can be applied when preferences conflict with socially beneficial data behaviors. This project synthesizes insights from behavioral economics and computing to promote information security.<br/><br/>The project team seeks to tackle this challenge by modeling individual preferences through the use of decision- and game- theoretic economic games to identify individual risk, ambiguity, and information preferences. The experimental games simulate competing and cooperating incentives and strategies, such as in the Prisoner?s Dilemma game. The appeal of these types of games is that a comparatively small subset of them may be useful to model a set of preferences that are predictive of a broad range of real-world behaviors. The team is modifying these games to better align with real-world communication tasks in a social media system. Behavioral experiments can provide novel evidence of the predictive value of the games and validate their use in novel contexts. The results may transform work in human-computer interaction, security, and privacy research and design by isolating simpler incentive-compatible instruments that model user preferences and correlate well with behaviors. This connection enables novel interventions from personalized interfaces to personally or socially beneficial interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There exist tools to protect individuals during online browsing, however, they are not tailored towards vulnerable subpopulations like individuals with developmental disabilities (e.g., Autism). Such individuals become targets without dedicated support to assist with threat identification in potential scam posts. This project aims to understand the distinctive comprehension and attention patterns displayed by individuals with Autism and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), to improve scam detection tools to assist these subpopulations. The project?s novelties include a multidisciplinary approach combining social computing, cognitive psychology, special education, and computational linguistics research to address existing biases in Artificial Intelligence methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP) used in scam detection tools, based on behavioral studies of browsing patterns displayed by vulnerable subpopulations. The project?s broader significance is in integrating insights of human behavior into cybersecurity tools, leading to better protection of vulnerable subpopulations and greater inclusiveness in cybersecurity. <br/> <br/>This project pursues two goals. First, it develops an eye-tracking study to discover variations in attention patterns observable across populations with and without developmental disabilities when exposed to scams and legitimate social media posts. Second, it uses observed variations in attention patterns to highlight representation biases in the labeled datasets of NLP-based scam detection models. It further creates a novel set of linguistic attributes that can be used to train scam detection models tailored to aid vulnerable subpopulations. Project outcomes include a better understanding of social media scams for vulnerable subpopulations, the development of an inclusive NLP model for scam detection, and an open-source browser plugin prototype to aid individuals with developmental disabilities via tailored scam alerts.

One of them is on the theory of optimal transport, which dates back to Gaspard Monge in 1781. The theory studies, for instance, the optimal way to move a pile of sand to an excavation, where optimality is measured against a cost function which may be proportional to the distance traveled. Many works led to connections with partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, geometry, probability theory and functional analysis. Currently, optimal transport enjoys applications in signal and image representation, inverse problems, cancer detection, shape and image registration, and machine learning, to name a few. The project relies on the theory of optimal transport to make advances in games which consist of a large number of players, and keeps a focus on equations such as the so-called master equation pioneered by Lasry and Lions. It also features variational problems and dynamics of systems of finitely many and infinitely many particles and also deals with non-commutative optimal transport theory. The project offers training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as learning seminars. The students are involved in a research program that aims to encourage interactions between mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers. <br/><br/>The project studies Hamilton-Jacobi equations with non-local terms, known to be challenging, especially when the non-locality appears in the gradient of the unknown function. In this context, the so-called Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition allowed to obtain the first well-posedness result on the master equation. In a previous research project, an alternative condition was proposed, which made it possible for the first time to handle non-separable Hamiltonians. This prior work relied heavily on the presence of the so-called individual noise. This project explores new ideas for handling non-separable Hamiltonians with only common noise in the master equations. It also initiates studies on inverse optimal transport and inverse Mean Field Games problems, with the goal of achieving desired outcomes by designing appropriate Lagrangians. Working on bounded domains makes it more difficult to predict the Lagrangians needed to produce desirable Nash equilibria in Mean Field Games. The project identifies minimal information on the boundary needed to deal with non-smooth augmented Lagrangians which appear in the resolution of these inverse problems. The project also considers inverse optimal transport problems in unbounded sets. Another part of this project is on partial differential equations on graphs and relies on a metric manifold of discrete densities. The project develops a well-posedness theory as well as a stability property for differential equations on graphs. While the role of optimal transport is well established in classical mechanics, establishing these ideas in the quantum setting, opens doors to several new avenues of research. For instance, one faces the challenge of identifying the non-commutative common noise operator, and studying its properties. To achieve these goals, there is a need to continue unearthing new properties of the Biane-Voiculescu's transport distance, and study non-commutative dynamical systems. Non-commutative optimal transport theory offers the appropriate setting for studying dynamics of random matrices, whose sizes will later tend to infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Depression is one of the top mental health concerns among undergraduates. Recent research has established that aspects of scientific research experiences can exacerbate depressive symptoms. However, it is unknown what aspects of research that exacerbate depression are most commonly experienced by students or which aspects of research are most detrimental to student mental health. This CAREER project will address these gaps in the literature using interview and survey studies. Additionally, the project will develop brief, self-guided online interventions designed to help undergraduate and graduate researchers productively cope with challenges in research that can worsen mental health. This project will integrate research and teaching by developing biology education course-based undergraduate research experiences that will be offered to students enrolled in Arizona State University?s online life sciences Bachelor of Science degree programs. Online students will engage in authentic research activities focused on the relationship between science education and depression.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to use an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to examine the relationship between scientific research and depressive symptoms among undergraduate and graduate students in the life sciences. Additionally, the project aims to develop and evaluate single-session interventions to help undergraduate and graduate students cope with aspects of scientific research that can exacerbate depressive symptoms. Specifically, exploratory interview studies will further probe why biology undergraduate and graduate students perceive that aspects of research exacerbate, and sometimes alleviate, depressive symptoms, as well as identify moderators of the relationship between research and student depression. These studies will also explore potential targets for creating more inclusive research environments. The findings from the interviews will inform national survey studies to assess the relationship between research and depression among biology undergraduate and graduate students at scale and what approaches undergraduate and graduate researchers perceive would be most effective in transforming research spaces to be more inclusive. The results of these studies will be used to develop single-session interventions to help students cope with common challenges in research; the interventions will be easy to administer, independent of instructors or mentors, freely available, and deliverable to students at scale. To integrate research and teaching with the intent to build a foundational body of research on the relationship between science education and depression, and to normalize mental health concerns among students, biology education course-based undergraduate research experiences will be developed and taught to students in Arizona State University?s online life sciences Bachelor of Science degree programs. This approach will deliver authentic research experiences to a population of students who have very few research opportunities and who often report higher rates of depression than their peers completing degrees in person.

The key technology enabling this switch to water, which Nature uses for chemical reactions, is based on the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) in the aqueous solutions. The NPs are designed to concentrate reagents and catalysts, thus enabling reactions to occur that would normally fail in water alone. Moreover, given the high concentrations of reactants and catalyst within each NP, high temperatures needed will no longer be required, reducing energetic cost of processes amenable to this system. These new advances are expected to contribute to the shift that organic chemistry, in general, must make to avoid its dependence on petroleum, from which derive many of the organic solvents typically used. To further assist with this transition to a more aqueous-based discipline, a Manual will be created containing experiments, all to be done in water at room temperature, for use in sophomore organic laboratories worldwide. The intention will be to introduce students at a very early stage to chemistry in water. <br/><br/>Under this award from the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Bruce Lipshutz  of the University of California at Santa Barbara and his team will pursue three main research directions: (1) innovations in chemoenzymatic catalysis, where the compatibility problem that has prevented the advancement of this field involving both chemocatalytic and enzymatic processes to be used in water in a single reaction vessel has been streamlined and facilitated by adding small amounts of a surfactant in the buffered aqueous medium; (2) the in situ-formation of selected thio-esters that are then subject to reaction with in situ-generated organozinc reagents, thereby leading to a new route to unsymmetrical ketones, in one pot and in water; and (3) development of a new concept in organic chemistry based on the atypical situation that exists within nano-micellar arrays; that is, high concentrations and limited reactant and catalyst mobility as a means of enhancing enantioselectivities (ee?s), rather than the traditional use of organic solvents at low temperature. Should this discovery prove to be general; that ee?s can be maximized by utilization of aqueous micellar media, potentially reducing dependence upon costly cryogenic reaction conditions to achieve and maintain low temperatures, this will be both an important addition to catalysis and a major step forward in advancing chemistry in water. The PI and his group are engaged with the fine chemical industry, in particular the pharmaceutical industry, so as to bring these advances to practical application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have remained largely unchanged morphologically over their 300 million year history, and are thus considered ?living fossils?.  Velvet worms are therefore an ideal model to investigate how animals successfully colonize different environments and locations over long periods of geological time in the absence of any significant morphological change. Because velvet worms are rare and mainly inhabit remote forests, they are relatively poorly studied. This research will focus on the least-understood group of velvet worms, the Neotropical Peripatidae. The researchers will document and describe all newly discovered species, assess their conservation status, and analyze the evolutionary processes affecting species diversity and distribution through geological time.  The research team and several trainees will combine cutting-edge molecular approaches with modern anatomical methods to advance our knowledge of the diversity and evolutionary history of this under-studied group. A 100-square-foot exhibit will be developed for the Harvard Museum of Natural History to explore the biodiversity, biogeography, ecology and evolution of velvet worms. The exhibit will also provide the opportunity for associated public programs, including lectures and K-12 activities. <br/><br/>A rigorous estimate of Onychophora species diversity in the Neotropical region will be provided by using high throughput sequence data and by the application of cutting-edge morphological techniques. This research will produce high-quality genomes for onychophorans and a UCE (ultra-conserved elements) probe set targeting about 1,000 genomic loci that will be applied to fresh and museum-preserved specimens. The resulting evolutionary groupings will be used to test hypotheses related to Caribbean biogeography, including specific radiations in Jamaica and Puerto Rico and the colonization of the Lesser Antilles. All specimens and genetic products of the study taxa will be deposited in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. All specimen data, including images, videos, and genomic data, will be linked to publicly available specimen records through a centralized database.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When SEPs are directed towards Earth, they cause impacts for human technology. They can cause satellite damage, high dosages of harmful radiation for astronauts, and many other effects. This project develops a new SEP prediction model, led by an early-career female PI. Two graduate students will be supported. This project includes an outreach plan to impact students at all educational levels in Utah from middle school to college level through lecture series talks in Utah State University Library, college-level presentations, and solar crafts activities during summer camp. The PI also will organize a public Kaggle competition to promote scientific research on SEP events prediction. The PI will prepare a monthly  ?Space Weather? five-lectures series that will take place at the USU library. Additionally, the research results will be taught as part of the data mining-related classes curriculum across many Utah State University regional campuses, which includes campuses located in rural areas of Utah. <br/><br/>Inspired by the success of machine learning (ML) in several areas of physical and life sciences, the project will implement new advanced methods to augment current datasets, improve SEP forecasts, and answer essential scientific questions. To achieve this vision, the new model will identify SEP predictive features based on the wealth of existing spatiotemporal and physical metadata of SEP parent events. These features will be extracted from image parameters and trajectory metadata of active regions and solar prominences preceding CMEs and solar flares parents? events. The newly engineered features will improve our understanding of the underlying processes leading to particles acceleration following fast CMEs and solar flares events (Thrust 1). The second challenge that the project will address is the small amount of SEP events that total merely 349 occurrences across all the energy ranges to this day. The project will augment the current SEP events catalog and time series dataset by generating new realistic synthetic solar events (Thrust 2). Finally, the project will build an accurate and robust ensemble model that combines state-of-the-art physics-based models, machine learning-based models, and new spatiotemporal methods for full-energy-range SEP events prediction (Thrust 3). One of the by-products of this research will be a one-of-its-own kind augmented SEP catalog supplemented with the new spatiotemporal metadata that will be freely available through Application Programming Interface (API) for its potential usage e.g., to train machine-learning-based and physics- based models. The final operational ensemble model will be deployed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC), supported by NSF and NASA, and deposited in publicly available repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalyst research and development has historically relied primarily on experimental methods ? often involving time- and resource-intensive materials screening.  In recent years, however, increasing effort has been directed toward predictive design of advanced catalyst technologies, enabled by advances in theory, computational methods, and artificial intelligence.  The project develops and applies advanced simulation tools, based on machine learning, which will be used to establish strategies for controlling metal/support interactions to enhance catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity. Models built with these tools will accelerate research efforts to design new types of catalysts consisting of either isolated metal atoms or small clusters dispersed on high-surface area metal oxide supports.  In addition to improving catalyst reactivity, product selectivity, and stability, the project will enable discovery and design of catalysts that reduce the amount of expensive and strategic metals (such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium) used widely in chemical manufacturing and pollution control. Beyond improving catalytic technologies, the project will extend educational efforts by establishing an outreach program for underserved communities through the Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity in Education at Rice University.<br/>	<br/>Synergistic interactions between metal nanoparticles and oxide supports are known to influence catalyst performance. The goal of the project is to develop a theoretical framework that uses statistical-based machine learning, together with density functional theory, to understand metal/support interactions (MSIs) in heterogeneous catalysis. The first objective is to apply computationally efficient statistical learning methodologies to identify the physical descriptors of metal binding on oxide supports, which in turn can be used to predict metal sintering rates and cluster morphology. The second objective is to predict catalytic activity and selectivity by constructing models that relate MSIs to adsorbate binding energies and the associated kinetic barriers that control mechanisms for prototypical model reactions, such as carbon monoxide oxidation. The third objective is to apply thermodynamic analyses to understand the stability of support modifications that are strategically introduced to enhance MSIs. Thus, the overall methodology not only will identify desirable surface modifications for controlling catalytic behavior by tuning MSIs, but also will predict the environments in which such modifications can be achieved most readily.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This paradox has puzzled scientists for centuries. While several organisms have been suggested to support life on reefs, when, where, or why they emerge as critical players for coral reefs is largely unknown. This project examines how the characteristics of a coral reef shape its reliance on different organisms to sustain all the large fishes typically associated with reefs. By quantifying fine-scale features of small reef patches, such as their temperature, wave energy, architecture, and small, hidden species assemblages, and combining these findings with a detailed analysis of what large fishes residing on the reef have eaten over time, this research reveals the circumstances under which different coral reef organisms ? from minute algae to corals, plankton, sponges, microscopic invertebrates, or tiny fishes ? take on important roles in feeding larger fishes. Using aerial drone surveys to scale up these fine-scale patterns to the area of an entire reef, the project then provides a whole-reef estimate for the contributions of different organisms to life on a reef. In doing so, the research offers a new opportunity for coral reef stewardship: if the most important organisms for coral reef productivity can be identified reliably from a few features, a much more targeted, context-specific management framework is possible. Finally, the project yields training opportunities for young, emerging reef scientists from coral reef nations, and a plethora of attractive digital coral reef media to engage the general public and increase awareness of the fragility of coral reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>The movement and storage of energy underpins the functioning of all ecosystems on Earth. The extreme diversity and productivity of coral reefs, despite their location in oligotrophic waters, has long generated substantial interest in the role of different organisms for coral reef energy fluxes. Yet, to date, these findings appear to be highly context-specific, and no general understanding exists concerning the environmental, structural, or biological drivers that cause reliance on one or more sources or pathways of productivity on coral reefs. As the first project to combine underwater data loggers, structure-from-motion photogrammetry, biological collections, underwater stereo-video, and compound-specific isotope analyses of amino acids, this research investigates how various interdependent attributes of small reef patches?such as wave exposure, rugosity, and cryptobenthic community structure?affect the relative contributions of different organisms to coral reef energy fluxes. By integrating the resulting relationships with aerial drone surveys and an exploration procedure based on quantitative color pattern analyses, the research then scales up the uncovered patch-dynamics to the area of an entire reef, ultimately revealing the contributions of different sources and pathways to reef fish biomass at the scale of the ecosystem. This reveals the potential pathways that can sustain coral reefs and their environmental and structural drivers. In doing so, the project offers a more general solution to a centuries-old question, while providing a new lens through which coral reefs can be managed in the Anthropocene.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Writing effective software tests is an open-ended problem that students find very challenging. The use of checklists has been shown to be an effective practice for helping students learn other software engineering skills. This project will investigate the use of checklists to provide a procedure that students can use to write software tests. Students will learn how to write software tests and use them to evaluate the quality of software they develop.

The UAS industry is well established in the San Diego region thanks to major employers in the industry as well as numerous other small to medium sized businesses. The outlook in the region is growing as the use of UAS across a variety of disciplines is increasing. Yet despite the high demand in the market, the skills gap is rising leaving drone service providers and related organizations scrambling to fill drone-related positions. This project will address the needs of an ever-expanding industry by providing both secondary and post-secondary educators and students with a variety of educational opportunities, such as: 1) Up-to-date and relevant work-based curriculum; 2) Articulation agreements between partnering secondary and post-secondary institutions; 3) Professional development workshops in UAS applications and operations; and 4) Summer high school academies specifically designed to inform and excite students (many of whom are from traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities) about UAS applications, educational opportunities, and career pathways. A unique element of the summer academies is the inclusion of students from the Pacific Islands, providing an opportunity for students from San Diego County and the Pacific Islands to become culturally connected, learn from one another, work together with different global perspectives to solve problems, and potentially make life-long connections with someone from a different part of the world. The project team includes college faculty, secondary school partners, educational consultants, and industry professionals. This project will provide relevant curriculum and educational opportunities for both secondary and post-secondary students, better preparing them to become skilled and thoughtful members of the UAS workforce.<br/><br/>The mission of this project is to strengthen the educational opportunities and career pathways in drone technology and applications for secondary and post-secondary students so that they can succeed as employees or entrepreneurs in the ever-expanding UAS field.  To meet the mission, three goals will be implemented, each with a set of objectives, activities, and deliverables: 1) Curriculum: In consultation with industry and education partners, the project team will: a) Create industry-aligned work-based learning projects; b) Develop and offer an advanced course in drone photography and videography; c) Create a set of engineering learning modules (in manufacturing, maintenance, and customization) to be offered in existing introductory engineering courses which will then be added to the list of program electives. 2) Professional Development: UAS are being used across a variety of disciplines, therefore it is important that secondary and post-secondary educators in those disciplines have hands-on, professional development opportunities in UAS applications so that they can share this information with their students. As part of the 2-day workshops, participants will create curriculum that will be vetted and placed on the National Center for Autonomous Technologies (NCAT) resource repository. 3) Secondary Education: In order to link high school learning experiences to college and careers, the project will do the following activities: a) Partner high school UAS curriculum will be cross-walked and modified where needed in order to articulate it to the college curriculum. The articulated course will create an academic pipeline for students, as the course will go toward the completion of the Southwestern College Drone Technology and Applications Certificate. b) The project will host hybrid summer drone academies for students in San Diego County and the Pacific Islands. At the academies, students will receive real-time instruction on flight training, data collection/processing, autonomous flight coding, and collaborative problem solving. The project evaluation will include formative feedback throughout the 3-year project along with annual evaluation reports that will assess progress towards achieving the goals and objectives. A summative evaluation at the end of the project will examine the effectiveness of strategies and provide an overall assessment of how well the project has met its goals. To maximize impact, the best practices and resulting content of the project will be documented and disseminated in publications, at various conferences, and on NCAT.

This study will improve knowledge of processes and consequences of evictions before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Inland Southern California. The first goal is to analyze the demographic and socioeconomic profile of renters who recently experienced an eviction, as well as the relocation process and outcome. The second goal is to analyze how community resilience and neighborhood change, such as neighborhoods that are gentrifying or becoming more impoverished, are tied to outcomes for renters. The third goal is to evaluate whether and how these outcomes are changed by the pandemic. This study will advance our understanding of involuntary residential choices under an external shock like a pandemic. It contributes to resilience scholarship and helps us understand why the root cause of socioeconomic disadvantage is the primary source of vulnerability under disastrous events, and how housing security interacts with community resilience. As eviction is linked to social, economic, and health disparities, and urban poverty, effective eviction-prevention initiatives could go a long way toward addressing these enduring problems. This study provides evidence for policy interventions designed to address eviction and stem its consequences. It will also provide significant implications for practice and policy in housing markets and social welfare to alleviate social and spatial divides by race, ethnicity, and class that have been exacerbated by the pandemic disruption. <br/><br/>This study investigates formal and informal eviction and neighborhood change before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Inland Southern California using a multiscalar, comparative, and mixed-methods framework.

As residential mobility shapes the future life course of evicted households and neighborhood dynamics, the team will model the residential choice of evicted renters and neighborhood dynamics. Further, the project conducts in-depth interviews with tenants, landlords, real estate agents and housing developers, non-profit organizations, and government officials to examine the pathways through which individual characteristics, neighborhood environment, and institutional forces contribute to eviction. The multiscalar, mixed-methods and comparative framework will advance knowledge on the process of eviction at the household level, as well as neighborhood dynamics, policy interventions, power relations, and the coping process of local communities during a pandemic-like disruption.

These environments are increasing due to human activities and climate change. Large amounts of organic carbon are buried in sediments below anoxic zones. However, we do not fully understand why organic carbon is preserved in these zones. This project seeks to understand a newly discovered process that may contribute to carbon preservation in anoxic zones. The process is called organic matter sulfurization. Through this process, organic matter is transformed and effectively ?pickled? by reacting with sulfide. Rapid sulfurization reactions were identified for the first time in sinking marine particles and may have larger effect on carbon burial in sediments than previously thought. This project will be the first to provide measurements of the scale and significance of rapid organic matter sulfurization in modern anoxic zones. This project includes field and laboratory studies. The research will involve a team of students, including a graduate student and six undergraduates, who will be supported through a peer mentorship program. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited from the inaugural class of a newly developed Practical Research Skills course (Earth 101A) at the University of California Santa Barbara. It seeks to help undergraduates develop critical thinking and observational skills that have broad applicability. This project will launch a self-sustaining and vigorous research program in marine biogeochemistry, heavily invested in undergraduate research education, with impacts that will outlast its five-year duration.<br/><br/>The overarching research goal of this project is to assess the contribution of sulfurization reactions to organic carbon preservation in anoxic environments. After constructing and testing a set of customized particle traps, an expedition will be conducted to the marine anoxic zone off the coast of Mexico. Sinking particles, suspended materials, and surface sediments will be collected at three sites on the Mexican shelf and slope, that have generally high local productivity and gradients in bottom-water oxygen concentration. In the field, the rates and isotopic fractionation of microbial sulfate reduction and organic sulfur formation will be measured with stable and radioactive isotope tracers. Subsequently, organic sulfur sources from both natural samples and laboratory experiments will be characterized using mass spectrometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and other geochemical techniques. Together, the results of this work will identify the timing and location of organic matter sulfurization in this environment, which have substantial implications for both modeling marine carbon fluxes and interpreting the geologic record. This study will provide the first quantitative estimates of the scale of organic matter sulfurization in anoxic marine zones, its contribution to sedimentary carbon burial, and its sensitivities to environmental change.

GST helps to solve problems by looking at data in a way that is readily displayed, can be spatially analyzed, and easily shared. It is a science that includes Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and image analysis, mapping and cartography, spatial analysis, and data collection tools such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Whether it is the map on a smart phone or the navigation system in a car, the base-map in a video game, or the maps that one sees on TV, ?geospatial? is all around. The science of GST is being used in resource management, environmental studies, urban planning, criminology, homeland security, military analysis, archaeology, precision agriculture, health sciences, political science, public safety and emergency response, physical sciences, earth sciences, marketing, logistics, economics, business, history, and virtually any other field that has a spatial and/or temporal component. Due to the ubiquitous nature of GST and the need for spatial analysis across many disciplines, instructors from middle school through college are embedding GST into their curriculum (including web-based mapping tools) to promote spatial thinking, or are offering GST specific courses or programs at their respective institutions to prepare students to successfully enter the workforce. The GeoTech National ATE Center is proposing to transition from a national center to a national Resource Center. The GeoTech Resource Center will focus on researching evolving workforce geospatial competencies and career pathways, curriculum modification based on changes/revisions to workforce geospatial competencies, curriculum especially designed for historically  underserved populations, and professional development opportunities for secondary and post-secondary educators.<br/><br/>The goals for the GeoTech Geospatial Resource Center are: 1) Research, create, and aggregate competencies that will support careers and programs. 2) Create and disseminate curriculum resources in an easily searchable resource repository, and 3) Provide professional development opportunities in face- to-face and virtual synchronous and asynchronous modalities to prepare educators to teach standards- based curriculum. These goals will provide the geospatial community of users (educators and industry professionals alike) curricular offerings in cutting edge GST, which is crucial in creating a well-prepared geospatial technician and technologist workforce. An evaluative process will be implemented to continually review workforce competencies, improve the educational materials produced, and enrich innovative professional development offerings. Learning modules will developed and will be contextual and relevant to historically underserved populations to excite them about GST careers and applications. Lessons will address a wide spectrum of social justice issues for people of color, women, tribal institutions, the LGBTQ community, and historical lessons such as redline maps. Environmental  current events such as climate change and wildfires will also be addressed. The curriculum will be modularized and portable to different learning environments and therefore designed to reach a large cohort of users.

It is estimated that 30-50% of the nation's water operators will retire within five years and only 5% of operators are under age 25. This project will address the critical infrastructure need for licensed water technicians by expanding the quality and capacity of training available for this field. In alignment with the mission of the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, this project will advance the delivery of technician education by creating high-quality, cost-effective, technology-based online resources for water operator technology. These new virtual resources will supplement the existing high-quality training offered by the South Carolina Environmental Training Center at Central Carolina Technical College (CCTC) with virtual reality (VR) modules developed collaboratively with Clemson University as a tool to enrich curriculum components identified as the greatest barriers to water operator licensure. This project also benefits operators in rural environments who have less access to professional development and training. Availability of virtual labs will further enable women, veterans, persons from  groups underrepresented in the field, and persons with disabilities to obtain certifications. Unlike immersive VR, these systems require no additional equipment as they are designed to run simulations on a standard laptop using a keyboard and mouse. Project outcomes include increasing: 1) the number of water operators prepared for the transition from learning to workforce, 2) recruitment and mentoring material to attract people from underrepresented groups to water treatment technology; and 3) the assessment of the use of these technologies with diverse groups of students in different educational settings. This work will contribute to the NSF's Big Ideas, including ""The Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier"" and ?Growing Convergent Research? by conducting fundamental research investigating the benefits and risks of integrating virtual labs in educational settings for water treatment education.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) Design, integrate, and develop VR enabled curriculum resources for water treatment training to address workforce preparedness and close the skills gap based on current and future workplace needs. 2) Implement the developed resources for online and hybrid approach, conduct rigorous evidence-based assessment of these modules, and provide the content to the ATE community. 3) Recruit and retain students including women, veterans, and persons from groups historically underrepresented in advanced-technology fields. 4) Create professional development resources and conduct workshops for water technology educators. The project will provide alternatives for place-bound and capacity-constrained water treatment programs via technology resources. Virtual labs will allow students access to realistic lab experiences in highly engaging VR environments that will address the most prevalent educational barriers to licensure. Key stakeholders from Association of Boards of Certification, community partners, NSF ATE centers, two-year partner institutions, and industry will guide the content development to ensure its relevancy. Evaluation and assessment will be led by an external evaluator who will provide both formative and summative evaluation of the implementation of the virtual resources in CCTC's existing curriculum utilizing Kirkpatrick's four-level model. Both the pre- and post-surveys will utilize the following validated constructs: perceived learning outcomes, engagement, usability, and satisfaction and perception.  The community of educators in water treatment technology, along with the broader technician education community, will receive implementation information on the modules created. Conferences for dissemination include an annual symposium hosted by CCTC, water treatment conferences, Technology Education Conferences, the NSF ATE Principal Investigators conference, and other professional association conferences. The findings will also be disseminated as journal papers, webinars, and presentations at professional development workshops. All materials developed will be distributed through ATE Central, CCTC's learning management system, and the EducateWorkforce portal hosted by Clemson University. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the dynamics of these systems leads to a wide variety of mathematical challenges. This project applies the theory of partial differential equations (PDE) to study two classes of diffusive models. The first, kinetic models of gases and plasmas, feature diffusion generated by collisions between particles. These models are of both theoretical and practical importance, as plasmas are used in many modern technological devices. The second class, elliptic free boundary problems, arise in the study of phase transitions, insulation, and many other physical and industrial processes. These models are based on the coupling between an undetermined geometric region and a diffusive equation defined in that region. The mathematical goals of this project are combined with an educational component that includes support for graduate student researchers, as well as a one-day workshop organized around research questions in PDE introduced at the advanced-undergraduate level. The goal of these measures is to increase opportunities for the next generation of researchers in this subject area, including those from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>This project seeks to advance the well-posedness and regularity theory of two classical kinetic equations, the Boltzmann and Landau equations, which feature the interaction of nonlinear, nonlocal diffusion in the velocity variable, with transport in the time and space variables. Specific goals include constructing short-time solutions for general initial data by leveraging the smoothing properties of the diffusion term, as well as weakening the conditions required for solutions to regularize and be continued past a given time. In free boundary theory, this project includes the qualitative study of minimizers for functionals of Alt-Caffarelli type with possibly irregular diffusion coefficients and unbounded coupling terms. The goal is to extend well-known free boundary regularity results to minimizers of these more general functionals. This project will also use free boundary techniques to study shape optimization problems related to Dirichlet eigenvalues of general elliptic operators, including problems for which existence of optimal domains is currently unknown.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, eyes are energetically expensive to produce, use, and maintain. As a result, animals that live in dim light environments tend to have eyes that maximize the ability to capture light at the expense of generating clear images. Thus, different light environments produce selective pressures that are predicted to affect eye number, form, and performance. The project will test hypotheses of how the transition into dim or totally dark marine environments may be related to eye regression and loss. To address these fundamental questions in sensory biology, the project will collect and analyze genetic, morphological, and ecological data under an evolutionary framework. Broader societal impacts include addressing goals of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) by incorporating molecular concepts in the teaching of evolution while using the eye as an approachable example. Novel curriculum on evolution at the high school level will be created through a collaboration with two educators immersed in the research project. Lesson plans will be publicly available via websites (e.g., National Science Teaching Association) and pedagogical data will be published in peer-reviewed journals. To expand training opportunities, the team will develop a workshop on teaching evolution for 12 additional high school teachers in Year 3. Workshop impact will be assessed with pre- to post- surveys. The work also will directly support the cross disciplinary training of postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students. Participation of underrepresented groups in STEM is a priority.<br/><br/>Understanding visual system diversity requires determining ecological and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for functional and morphological changes. Scallops and relatives (Pectinoidea) have tens to hundreds of eyes on a single animal and broad bathymetric distributions spanning the taxonomic and ecomorphological diversity of the clade. The proposed work will use the Pectinoidea to understand eye evolution in association with functional and ecological changes that may drive eye regression and loss, such as oceanic depth. Harnessing the true potential of pectinoideans for macroevolutionary research is contingent on the resolution of a robust time-calibrated phylogeny and anatomical knowledge for the poorly studied taxa. This work will address three central questions: 1) What are morphological and functional changes of eyes among deep- and shallow- dwelling species? 2) When and how many times have eyes been regressed or completely lost among pectinoidean taxa? 3) Could the invasion of dim light or aphotic zones be related to eye regression and loss? The project will infer the phylogenomics of Pectinoidea using an anchored hybrid enrichment approach to understand the tempo and mode of eye evolution and regression. The project will 1) provide extended taxon sampling, a time-calibrated phylogeny, and taxonomic revision; 2) address major gaps in knowledge of the factors and forces that have contributed to the evolution and diversification of visual systems; 3) inform a broader understanding of evolutionary processes underlying new traits; and 4) generate new genetic resources for bivalves, an understudied, but phenotypically diverse, group. All materials will be archived through publicly accessible repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many STEM education efforts address secondary STEM teacher needs. Yet, high-quality STEM education needs to begin for students during the elementary school years. The elementary teacher education program at the University of Northern Iowa is the largest in the state. However, most elementary school teachers have minimal experience with integrated STEM teaching prior to certification. This is due to the emphasis on English/Language Arts and Mathematics at the elementary level with less attention to science, especially in high-need schools. Further, few elementary teachers have science or STEM endorsements, which results in few high-quality elementary teachers who can practice and model best STEM teaching practices. This project will build capacity to develop an elementary STEM teacher leader program that would provide STEM professional development and leadership development for practicing elementary school teachers. In turn, these elementary STEM teacher leaders will model effective STEM teaching and support high-quality student teaching experiences in STEM for future elementary school teachers. <br/><br/>This Capacity Building project at the University of Northern Iowa includes partnerships with stakeholders from local high-need schools, including Hoglan Elementary School and Dr. Walter Cunningham School for Excellence. The goal of the project is to investigate the current state of elementary STEM education in Iowa and then to design a program that will develop elementary STEM teacher leaders. The project team will learn from faculty at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who have successfully created an elementary STEM teacher leader program in their state, which shares educational similarities with Iowa. Additionally, the project team will adapt Horizon Research?s National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education and use this survey to collect evidence about the current state of elementary STEM teaching in high-need elementary schools from administrators and teachers. Survey results and follow-up interviews will be analyzed to establish the strengths and needs of elementary STEM educators in Iowa. Information from survey data analyses, combined with insights from the Nebraska program, will be used to design an elementary STEM teacher leader program at UNI. A four-member external Advisory Board representing STEM education university faculty, state-level STEM education professional development leaders, and administrators from high-need elementary schools in Iowa will guide and evaluate the project. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.  It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models are programs whose behavior is learned from data. Creating these models can be computationally and economically expensive. Fortunately, many powerful models are shared openly by their creators. The most popular models are re-used millions of times and form the backbone of many important pieces of software. However, these models are seldom updated - they are often left frozen in their originally-released form. Furthermore, the cost of creating these models excludes most people from their development. In contrast, the paradigm of open-source software development provides a means for a distributed community to collaboratively build software. This kind of collaborative development is currently infeasible for machine learning models. The goal of this award is to develop the fundamental research to enable community-developed and continually-improved models. Moreover, in order to foster a diverse community of contributors, this award includes collaborative educational activities that include researchers from groups that are historically underrepresented in the development of machine learning models. Finally, the award contains an educational component that focuses on the development of ""role-playing"" courses, where students present the material to one another from different perspectives.<br/><br/>A major challenge to community-developed and continually-improved models is that the de facto status of gradient descent as an optimization method for machine learning models prevents any kind of collaboration because any change to the model involves updating all of its parameters. This award considers two alternatives: The first focuses on methods for allowing sparse and low-rank updates that are cheap to communicate and store and the second considers model architectures where submodels are devoted to specific capabilities that can be independently updated. In both cases, it will be made possible to ""merge"" conflicting updates that were proposed by contributors performing training in parallel. Separately, the ability to propose updates to a model necessitates the ability to determine whether a given proposed update should be accepted. This award therefore includes a parallel focus on rapid adaptation and evaluation. Throughout the duration of the award, a software framework will be developed that enables true iterative version control of machine learning models. The research advances in the award will therefore see direct practical application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists are becoming better and better at predicting new materials, but it can often be challenging to make them. In this project, which is funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Ray Schaak and his group at Penn State University use simple chemical reactions to replace certain elements in a nanoparticle material with other elements. These reactions transform simple nanoparticles into nanoparticles that are much more complex. The researchers are studying how these reactions occur and how they can be used to make new types of nanoparticles that could help to advance applications in clean energy. This project is establishing new rules for how to control the arrangements of atoms and materials within a nanoparticle that contains various metals along with sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and/or oxygen. The PI and his group are applying these rules to many different materials so that they can make large collections of nanoparticles using the same methods. This knowledge will allow researchers to more quickly make and study new materials that are predicted but have remained out of reach. The PI and his group are partnering with a network of faculty and students at local colleges and are providing new educational resources for helping students to understand how atoms arrange in solid-state materials.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>There is a growing disconnect between the scope of materials that can be predicted, including computationally, and those that can be made experimentally. Many materials of interest, especially metastable phases and complex nanoparticles, have no known pathways for synthesizing them. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, uses cation exchange reactions to modify the compositions of nanoparticles, producing large libraries of previously inaccessible nanoparticle materials through rational synthetic pathways. The PI and his group are establishing when and why existing synthetic guidelines break down and defining an expanded set of design rules that are broadly applicable across diverse metal chalcogenide and oxychalcogenide systems, including semiconductors having tunable band gaps. The researchers are studying how interfaces in heterostructured nanoparticles form and evolve and how layered intergrowth and superlattice compounds can be targeted through partial and complete cation exchange reactions that are chemo- and regio-selective. They are developing rational pathways to heterostructured nanoparticle megalibraries having millions of possible members, as well as new chemical reactions that break symmetry and introduce new structural motifs. This project is helping to bridge the gap between materials that can be predicted and those that can be synthesized, which will help to accelerate rational materials development.

This interdisciplinary field, which encompasses geography, computer science, and mathematics in spatial problem solving, is used in governmental agencies and private companies to solve many U.S. and global societal challenges. As employees within these companies retire or as these industries expand, employees with the most current knowledge of technologies and practices are needed. This project will support the growing need for well-educated surveying/mapping technicians in the region. Since STEM fields have not historically attracted many women, students of color, and low-income students, this project will focus on evidence-based interventions that support student recruitment, retention, and program completion for people from groups underrepresented in STEM. To recruit more diverse students the project will partner with culturally relevant community-based organizations (CBOs) and women STEM educators to identify high school and community college students interested in geospatial technology. Project-based learning using geospatial technology and paid internships will engage students in work-based skill development. This project will provide innovative opportunities for students, who never considered working in this STEM field, to enter an exciting new career. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to improve student recruitment, retention, and program completion in the Geospatial program, and position the program for future growth with regional GIST partners. The strategies that provide the foundation for this work include: 1) expanding partnerships with community-based organizations, 2) increasing recruitment efforts of specific student populations on campus and in the community, 3) conducting summer institutes for high school teachers and community college faculty in geospatial technologies, 4) creating a ""Women in Geospatial Careers"" workshop series, 5) redesigning a capstone course to incorporate more advanced technical skills, 6) expanding partnerships with regional industries, 7) collaborating with a regional geospatial association to provide mentors for the GIST students, and 8) equipping classrooms and labs with appropriate equipment and software to address the competencies needed for this emerging technical workforce. Results of the project will be made available to other community colleges and GIST partners to demonstrate the value of the recruitment and retention strategies and how they can be incorporated into existing pedagogical approaches. This project has potential to advance knowledge in the evolving GIST fields by implementing recruitment and retention strategies that have the greatest impact on individuals from groups underrepresented in geospatial programs.

When a user asks a simple question, these systems can typically return an answer directly rather than just linking to a webpage. However, these systems still fail on more complex questions, and when they fail, they may mislead their users. They lack an important capability that humans have: the ability to reason about and synthesize the information they see, retrieve and integrate additional information, and arrive at a justified conclusion.  This CAREER project aims to address this shortcoming by developing systems that ""think through"" textual evidence, leading to more reliable answers that can be explained to a user. Such advances fit into a broader thread of building trustable AI systems that explicitly show their work and are auditable before and during their deployment.<br/><br/>This project specifically addresses the problems of question answering and fact-checking by developing a learning-based system that reasons in natural language. The system takes text as input, then applies pre-trained neural network models to reformulate that text, derive conclusions from it, and eventually check a claim or verify an answer. This process produces a series of logically connected statements understandable by a human. This outcome is enabled by two modules. First, a deduction module repeatedly combines two statements and generates a third that follows from the inputs, encapsulating common logical rules. Second, a verifier determines whether the final deduced evidence validates the original claim. Both systems are built from pre-trained models like T5 that have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities. Collecting training data for these models constitutes a core challenge; the project's approach blends multiple strategies including synthetic data generation and human-in-the-loop annotation. These techniques are applied to the domains of question answering and fact checking, problems where providing additional explanation and justification instead of just giving a best-effort answer are essential to make usable systems. This system paves the way for NLP tools that know what they don't know, provide interpretability for end users, and enable system developers to better understand and improve their models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This framework arose from a challenging problem, which is how to treat critically ill patients who are at risk for seizures (subclinical seizures) that can severely damage a patient's brain. In this high-stakes application of artificial intelligence, the data are complex, including noisy time-series, medical history, and demographic information. The goal is to produce interpretable causal estimates and policy decisions, allowing doctors to understand exactly how data were combined, permitting better troubleshooting, uncertainty quantification, and ultimately, trust. The core of the project's framework consists of novel and sophisticated matching techniques, which match each treated patient in the dataset with other (similar) patients who were not treated. Matching emulates a randomized controlled trial, allowing the effect of the treatment to be estimated for each patient, based on the outcomes from their matched group. A second important element of the framework involves interpretable policy design, where sparse decision trees will be used to identify interpretable subgroups of individuals who should receive similar treatments.<br/><br/><br/>The matching techniques developed in this project will be within the new family of ""almost-matching-exactly"" (AME) techniques. AME techniques use machine learning on a training set to determine how to construct high-quality matched groups. In applying AME techniques to analyze seizure risk and treatment for critically ill patients, there are two major challenges that this project addresses: how to incorporate mechanistic models for drug absorption, and how to perform uncertainty quantification. Importantly, the project also addresses the release of AME code in several formats to be used by non-experts. The policy design aspect of the project involves the optimization of sparse decision trees. This project involves a close collaboration between experts in machine learning, causal inference, databases, and neurology, with the goal to improve patient care in high-stakes hospital settings where experiments cannot be conducted, and the only way to assess causal effects is through the analysis of observational data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most digital media today consist of flat, two-dimensional images and video, virtual reality technology will allow for sharing a complete three-dimensional representation of a scene, for a truly collaborative experience.  With virtual reality technology, schoolchildren could virtually stand at the entrance of an ancient pyramid, look at paintings in a renowned museum, or explore a rainforest.  Towards this high-level objective, the aim of this project is to enable anyone with a smartphone to easily capture and share a highly immersive virtual reality experience of their surroundings.  The development of widespread and consumer-accessible technology for sharing high-quality virtual reality experiences would enable the creation of more impactful and lasting learning experiences, support the development of empathy by enabling people to experience the lives of others more convincingly, and allow for more faithfully recordings of important experiences that might otherwise be lost.  The research objectives of this project will be integrated with several education and outreach activities. The investigator will work with an interdisciplinary team of students and faculty in biology and geography to develop immersive educational content about biodiversity in California and will implement an outreach workshop for California students to introduce them to the concepts behind three-dimensional reconstruction and view synthesis and have them create their own virtual reality experiences using the tools developed. Datasets generated as part of the research activities will be made public, serving as a great resource for other researchers and application developers.<br/><br/>Despite a groundswell of recent developments, critical issues remain in terms of reconstructing virtual reality experiences from casually captured video, handling dynamic scenes, and rendering speed.  This project aims to close these gaps by exploring novel techniques for capture and reconstruction of dynamic physical environments. To address challenges in content capture and reconstruction, the project will explore new methods for automatic self-calibration and dynamic scene reconstruction from casually captured video using a neural implicit scene representation. This becomes a challenging task for more complex and dynamic scenes, where it might be tough to find a single transition (from scene to scene) which appears seamless across the entire volume. For faster capture and better handling of dynamic scenes, the project will develop deep learning techniques to automatically convert consumer panoramic video into a dynamic and immersive multi-layer representation.  Addressing storage efficiency and fast rendering, the project will investigate image-based capture and reconstruction of neural light fields.  The project will also produce new datasets for training and evaluating immersive view synthesis methods in dynamic scenes and develop new measures/metrics for the evaluation of the generated immersive content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis of integrable random systems is powered by explicit formulas and various symmetries coming from algebraic structures.

The project provides research opportunities for graduate students as well as training activities through organization of summer school on integrable probability. <br/><br/>The project revolves around new and known integrable stochastic systems whose structure is accessible through the Yang-Baxter equation or symmetric functions. The scope of the studied models includes interacting particle systems on the one-dimensional lattice with local or global interaction (asymmetric simple exclusion process and discrete analogs of the Dyson Brownian motion, respectively), random tilings, and other statistical mechanical systems. The goals are three-fold: (1) discover new models with integrable structure (such as q- and Macdonald analogs of Dyson Brownian motion); (2) find previously overlooked symmetries in well-known models (such as time-reversal symmetries in particle systems with arbitrary initial data); and (3) probe new asymptotic phenomena and establish their universality (such as inhomogeneous deformations of pure Gibbs states and the Gaussian Free Field). The goals will be achieved by finding and analyzing exact formulas for moments and correlations (with the help of symmetric functions and vertex models), and also by developing distributional symmetries using Markov maps, or by introducing many inhomogeneous parameters into the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, it plays an important role in carbon storage and climate change. The components of dissolved organic matter are the remains of biological products. As a result, the chemical make-up of dissolved organic matter (DOM) can provide important clues about the processes affecting this carbon pool. By learning more about the chemical structures and reactions that produce DOM, connections can be made to biological and biochemical processes and their importance. This project will study the distribution, production, and removal of one important class of molecules called carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). These molecules are abundant in marine DOM and play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle. They also affect the supply of the micronutrient iron, and thus have an important influence on primary production and ocean food webs. The research includes field and laboratory experiments and takes advantage of ocean locations with long-term data. Together, the lead scientists will provide training and resources for the graduate students, undergraduate research opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, and direct outreach to the public through a website, articles in local newspapers, and talks at public venues. <br/><br/>CRAM make-up 8 to 25% of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and represent a carbon reservoir of >65 Pg C that is equivalent to at least 8% of the atmospheric CO2 pool.  CRAM play a central role in the functioning of the microbial carbon pump, a conceptual framework for producing refractory carbon by microbial processes in the ocean. Further, CRAM act as an important ligand of Fe(III) in the ocean, thereby playing an important role in regulating marine primary production.  The main project objectives are: (1) measure the variable distribution of CRAM in the ocean, and (2) determine the dominant mechanisms of CRAM production and removal. The project will leverage an extensive set of already collected samples across the world?s oceans and new field work within the framework of the Bermuda Atlantic and Hawaii Ocean Time Series. Field measurements will be combined with experimental approaches to specifically address microbial and photochemical reactions leading to CRAM production and removal. This research will fill important gaps in resolving the key questions about organic carbon cycling in the ocean and explore the role of DOM in mediating the cycles of iron and other trace elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DAS allows geoscientists and civil engineers to collect seismic vibration data more easily and at low cost, to opportunistically use telecommunications infrastructure, to leave sensors in place for long-term studies with little maintenance, and to collect data in new locations such as glaciers, cities, and offshore environments. DAS could transform approaches to numerous societally important problems: environmental monitoring, groundwater studies, earthquake hazard analysis, infrastructure resilience monitoring, and other applications requiring high resolution vibration data across large regions. However, the scientific and societal benefits of these DAS-enabled applications will only become reality if appropriate user-friendly software is freely available to scientists and engineers. This Geoinformatics Catalytic Track project will develop new software, the Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Analysis Ecosystem (DASDAE), to lower the barrier to entry for the growing community of scientists working with DAS. DASDAE will provide convenient programming interfaces to read/write DAS file formats and for analyzing and visualizing data. The DASDAE team will build a user and developer community by organizing tutorial workshops, distributing training videos and notebooks (i.e., documents that mix text explanations, computer code, and images), and hosting hackathons. This project will support cross-disciplinary training for diverse students and postdocs, including through use of software in course materials.<br/><br/>Large DAS data volumes and ongoing development of data standards have created a barrier for many geoscientists wishing to use DAS in their research projects. Without an open-source community software package to complement investments in DAS instrumentation, the data acquired are unlikely to be fully utilized. DASDAE will be an open-source software development environment for the geoscience community to collaborate, share methods, access open data, and efficiently reproduce results from DAS experiments. It will be integral to new geoscience discoveries, particularly for disciplines that rarely use large-scale seismic data. DASDAE will include a broad suite of DAS data analysis tools, implemented for dense arrays with modern software optimizations, integration with existing open-source computational science software for array analysis where appropriate, and robust testing and verification practices. This software will follow a modular design to allow for reuse of code across computing paradigms: field laptops, desktop workstations, high performance computing (HPC) clusters, and future cloud and edge computing. The DASDAE team will develop three scientific analysis modules that advance earthquake hazard, smart city, and near-surface geophysics related research, which also serve as examples for future software development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemists rely on representations to describe, communicate about, and understand the behavior of particles that are far too small to be seen. Examples of representations include chemical formulas and graphical representations that use lines and symbols to show how atoms are arranged. College students enrolled in organic chemistry courses must learn to interpret and use such representations at the same time they are learning about complex chemical processes. This NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) project will generate new knowledge about how organic chemistry students learn to interpret a variety of representations and use them to solve problems. The project team will use the results of this research to develop and evaluate instructional modules to better support organic chemistry students? learning and problem solving.<br/><br/>This IUSE: EHR project intends to systematically investigate the effects of different molecular representations on students? success in solving organic chemistry problems. The representation types that will be explored include chemical formulae, line angle formulae, ball and stick figures, and electrostatic potential maps. The work will be guided by an Abstraction Framework, the Multimedia Learning Theory on Learning with Textual and Visual Representations, and the Actor-Oriented Transfer Framework to facilitate understanding of how students extract encoded information from each representation, make connections to prior instances, and extrapolate that knowledge for use in new problem contexts. The project team plans to use a mixed method approach across three studies conducted at the University of Northern Colorado and the University of South Florida. First, to identify which representations best facilitate student success in solving a variety of organic chemistry problem types, end-of-semester students will be randomly assigned to one of four problem sets that differ only in the representations provided and the results will be analyzed. Next, student problem-solving sessions using think-aloud protocols will be conducted to generate hypotheses regarding how particular representations facilitate student success. The foci of these analyses will be on how the different representations support student abstraction and transfer from one problem context to another. Finally, the hypotheses generated from these studies will be used to develop and evaluate an instructional intervention that will include the development of instructional materials and online modules. The intervention will be evaluated with respect to its impact on student learning, which will also serve as a measure for the utility of the hypothesized relationships. The materials developed will be disseminated and made freely available to faculty teaching organic chemistry. The research results will be presented at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. To broaden the impact even further, the project team intends to conduct four workshops involving a total of forty faculty members who teach organic chemistry. During the workshops, the team will assist the faculty members in integrating project materials and findings into organic chemistry instruction at their institutions.

It will explore new approaches to facilitating data sharing between collaborating life scientists by diving deep into the issues surrounding the challenges associated with access control through ethnographic interviews and by developing new systems that simplify and expedite data sharing. Data sharing is considered one of the biggest challenges faced by life scientists, as different disciplines produce data with different characteristics, methods, and data sharing needs and criteria. Improvements to the data sharing process will aid life scientists in advancing biological and biomedical research, which could dramatically improve the health and well-being of individuals in society.<br/><br/>Four key insights regarding current access control systems guide this research: (1) Lack of default or transferable access settings leads to inefficiency. (2) Lack of visible sharing settings can result in accidental data sharing. (3) Inconsistent ownership over files can lead to inaccessible data once researchers leave the collaboration. (4) Data-sharing technologies that are institution agnostic are the most used.

Horticulture-based jobs are now utilizing these advances such as drones, water-sensing technology, and automated weeding systems. Combining precision agriculture with horticulture in the emerging field of urban agriculture is therefore an expanding filed that needs a skilled workforce. This is particularly true in Nebraska, where one in four jobs is connected to agriculture and many are found in an urban and/or horticulture setting.  This project unites the fields of precision agriculture and horticulture to create a technical education program at a two-year college that provides a pathway to urban agriculture careers. Over its 3-year duration, current programming will be expanded to provide micro-credentialed courses related to urban agriculture technology, summer workshops for high school agriculture educators, and continuing education workshops for incumbent workers. These new resources will improve existing high-quality training to enrich student interest and skills in horticulture technology and enhance career pathways for incumbent workers.  <br/><br/>The following objectives will guide the project: 1) partner with local high schools to introduce students to career options and to provide active learning opportunities using horticulture concepts and precision technologies, 2) design and implement a series of six workshops for agriculture educators to enhance their ability to teach relevant courses in horticulture, precision technology, and urban agriculture, and 3) provide a series of five continuing education workshops for incumbent workers. This program will strengthen partnerships with area high schools and build new relationships within the horticulture and urban agriculture industries. In secondary schools, teachers will be invited to be true colleagues, by co-creating educational pathways that excite, encourage, and prepare students to consider careers in urban agriculture. A three-course modularized curriculum will be developed that can be used to supplement agriculture education courses in local high schools, and in some cases, will result in dual credit for high school students. Overall, the new curriculum will impact students and teachers at five pilot high schools and incumbent workers from around the state. Results of the project and the curriculum will be made available to other community colleges, the community of educators in agriculture education and the broader technician education community.

Today, an estimated one billion light duty vehicles are on the roads, consuming one fourth of global primary oil and contributing 10% to the global greenhouse gas emissions The adoption of electric vehicles (EV) can reduce dependency on oil and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, industry leaders agree that there is an immediate shortage of skilled technical workers across almost every sector required to support the EV industry. Workforce projections estimate that the all-EV industry will add 250,000 to 500,000 new high paying jobs by 2030. This project will establish a National Electric Vehicle Consortium (NEVC) to support the collaboration of academic, agency, and industry experts across all EV disciplines to help secure the nation?s EV workforce with partners from 15 community colleges, 19 industry partners, two research universities, and ATE Centers and projects.<br/><br/>The consortium will focus on the following fields within the EV sector: manufacturing; installation; operations, maintenance, and repair; vehicle conversion; safety and standards; and emerging technological advances in the sector. Goals for the consortia include: 1) provide a venue for national collaboration to network training needs with training providers to support broad scale outreach, community-building among educational institutions, industry, professional, trade, and regulatory associations, educators, and practicing technicians within the EV Ecosystem; 2) document workforce needs and skills and competencies, for all areas of the emerging EV sector; 3) collect data on academic programs and curricular resources across the EV sector; 4) align academic programs and courses with the EV industry sector needs and address programmatic gaps; 5) support institutions of higher education in adapting legacy programs or establishing new EV programs.

A daunting challenge facing biologists is how to accurately interpret this large and complex collection of genetic histories to identify which of these most likely represent the true relationships among living and extinct species. The rate at which chromosomes exchange information (i.e., recombine) has been shown to be one of the most reliable predictors of which DNA sequences within chromosomes can best reconstruct ancient relationships of living species. Our goal is to retrace the evolution of mammalian chromosomes and their recombination rates across time, from the genomes of living species back to their inferred 100-million-year-old ancestor. We will identify those shared chromosome regions that have recombined at the slowest rates and provide the greatest fidelity to reconstructing mammalian evolutionary history. We will also determine whether specific genes preferentially evolve within regions of historically high or low rates of chromosomal change. Our findings will greatly benefit researchers seeking to resolve other parts of the Tree of Life, by leading to more efficient approaches for determining evolutionary history at both shallow and deep evolutionary timescales. We will create a new public web-database for mammalian genetic maps that allows researchers to browse chromosomes, genes, and recombination rates across the mammalian Tree of Life. This project will train a diverse cohort of scientists across multiple academic levels. <br/><br/>Our proposal is predicated upon pairing new high-quality, chromosome-level mammalian genome assemblies with a recombination map. An explicit goal of this project is to generate a detailed history of mammalian genes and chromosomes annotated with their local recombination rates. We will create a novel, publicly accessible resource of recombination maps allowing researchers to trace the evolution of recombination rate and chromosome evolution across the mammalian tree of life, from the inferred ancestor to each living species. We will also generate the first mammalian phylogeny based on Y chromosome data, the only chromosome that contains regions that have historically lacked meiotic recombination. Our findings will contribute to the goal of resolving the mammalian tree of life and inform ongoing controversies surrounding the mode and tempo of early placental mammal evolution, while improving our understanding of the relationship between chromosome architecture, recombination, and local gene content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientific measurement is often based on indirect inference. A famous example is the prediction of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune in the 1840s based on observations of wiggles in the orbit of Uranus. That is, by making close observations of Uranus, the existence of Neptune could be inferred. That inference is the domain of the field of ""inverse problems."" Continued growth in distributed and remote sensing (e.g. data from satellites, imaging in the human body) opens a new realm of inverse problems, those with distributed and full-field data, that call for the creation of new solution methods. This project will focus on developing a special class of computationally efficient methods, called direct methods, to infer various quantities of interest from differential equation models of observed phenomena. The research will be conducted at Rochester Institute of Technology, an institution focussed mainly on undergraduate education, but with a recent push towards growing its research program by the creation of several PhD programs with small student cohort. This project aims to grow some of the PhD programs by recruiting students from groups underrepresented in the STEM field. These students will be trained in state of the art techniques to model and analyze data, and will disseminate their findings through publications and presentations at local and international workshops and conferences. These efforts aim to increase the number of underrepresented individuals in the STEM work force.<br/><br/>The project focuses on developing direct variational formulations to solve inverse problems governed by differential equation models where full field data are available. Specifically, the main focus is on developing the direct error in constitutive equations formulation (DECE) for a scalar wave inverse problem to solve for the wave speed of a material, given observations of time harmonic wave fields. Current inverse problems formulations for wave propagation problems either do not make full use of full field data when it is available, and are hence computationally expensive, or they completely fail for wave propagation problems with multiple observations and unknown parameters. The project is expected to advance the mathematical analysis of the DECE formulation for the complex scalar wave model by i) examining its well-posedness, and ii) determining the number of wave fields needed to find a unique solution. The DECE formulation will be especially useful in medical imaging fields, where full field interior data are increasingly available, and solving inverse problems efficiently is critical for practical detection and diagnosis of disease. The research conducted will be done with the help of students at all levels. Special effort will be made to recruit graduate students from groups underrepresented in the STEM fields to help grow the math modeling PhD program at Rochester Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phytoplankton serve as the foundation of the Arctic marine food web, and disruptions in the timing of growth can be detrimental to current ecosystems. Limitations of satellite remote sensing such as the inability to detect phytoplankton bloom activity throughout the water column, under ice, and in cloudy conditions dictate the need for shipboard based measurements to provide more information on bloom dynamics. This project refines a novel methodology to estimate the growing stage of phytoplankton blooms throughout the water column using satellite imagery as a reference. Estimated summer bloom stages will be used along with atmospheric and oceanic conditions to identify the drivers of fall phytoplankton blooms to better estimate where they might occur. This information will be beneficial for predicting late season biological hotspots for conservation, scientific, and marine subsistence impacts.<br/><br/>Repeat cruise measurements will be used to map modeled bloom stages throughout the water column in the summer and fall throughout the Pacific Arctic and northward to the ice edge. This research will also develop two models to (1) identify immediate drivers of observed late bloom growth and (2) identify midsummer preconditioning scenarios for fall blooms and validate model predictions with in situ observations. This research utilizes two NSF-funded cruises: the Distributed Biological Observatory in July 2013?2022 and the Synoptic Arctic Survey in fall 2022. Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and pheophytin (degraded chlorophyll) concentrations will be collected on the 2022 cruises. NASA MODIS-Aqua satellite chlorophyll-a and in situ pheophytin proportions will be used to develop bloom stage models that distinguish growing versus senescent blooms. The bloom stage model will be applied to measurements collected throughout the water column to extract more information from cruise samples, broaden the context of observations, and understand bloom progression. The fall bloom driver and preconditioning models will be developed using a machine learning regression approach. Variables that will be examined include remotely sensed and modelled datasets of high wind speed events, wind direction, sea ice breakup and freeze-up dates, and in situ measurements of nutrients, temperature, salinity, and stratification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate research plays an important role in showing students the scientific research process and inspiring students to pursue STEM-related careers. The focus of this project is students' academic-year research at primarily undergraduate institutions. The project seeks to expand current understanding, through social science research methods, of how the benefits of undergraduate research are achieved. This effort connects to the NSF?s mission to broaden access to and encourage participation in STEM-related activities among diverse student populations. Intended outcomes of the project are a blueprint and toolkit to help STEM instructors design successful undergraduate research experiences. <br/>	 <br/>The novelty of this project lies in the integration of well-established social science research with education research, where the former is focused on understanding how different aspects of work design influence motivation and the latter relates to STEM Undergraduate Research Experiences (UREs). Adopting a job characteristics theory lens, the primary goals are to develop and validate a multi-dimensional indirect URE-modified measure of the work-design structure. These goals will be accomplished by first adapting an established work-design measure from the domain of organizational psychology to the STEM URE context. The measure will be adapted through an iterative process of subject matter expert interviews. From the earliest stages of the project, bilingual participants will be included in the interview process to ensure the instrument functions reliably across linguistically diverse groups. This new measure will be used along with a survey of self-reported STEM-critical student outcomes (e.g., science identity, design thinking, data literacy) for relational assessment. The results from this project will be disseminated broadly via conferences, peer-reviewed academic journals, and science blogs. Creative Commons will be leveraged to facilitate wider access and an informational website will also be developed to disseminate the results from this project. This project will add new knowledge about the structure of UREs, what aspects of URE structure are most likely to generate critical student outcomes, and URE design insights to accelerate the motivational, attitudinal, and behavioral potential of diverse student populations.

Deforming rocks in a laboratory setting allows researchers to control precisely the conditions that they impose, and test systematically the responses of rocks and minerals to these conditions.  The data that are collected are used to better understand Earth?s structure, dynamics, and geologic hazards. For example, using rock deformation experiments scientists can determine the viscosity of rocks in Earth?s interior.  These data, in turn, help us to understand why plate tectonics is found on Earth, but is absent on the other rocky planets of our solar system. This project supports development of a new type of rock deformation apparatus, in which specimens are subjected to torsional deformation.  The particular capabilities of the Large Volume Torsion Apparatus (LVT2) enable experiments that reproduce conditions similar to those along boundaries between Earth?s tectonic plates.<br/><br/>The LVT2 will be a uniquely capable tool for investigating the microphysics of rock deformation, rheology at plate boundaries, and the origins of seismic anisotropy in the crust and upper mantle. Previous support made possible the design and construction of the LVT2. This current project will allow the investigators, including a postdoctoral scholar, to (1) develop calibrations, techniques, and standard operating procedures, and (2) conduct preliminary experiments of scientific merit to evaluate the efficacy these procedures. Precise calibrations and robust standard operating procedures will yield a high level of safety and reliability, making rock deformation experiments more accessible to undergraduate students, external collaborators, and other short-term visitors.

Through a cross-site collaboration, a plan for a longitudinal study focused on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools will be developed. The COVID-19 pandemic gives new urgency to video analysis as large numbers of teacher preparation programs have had to use digital libraries of classroom video cases in lieu of traditional field experiences in schools. In addition, the importance of how teachers are prepared to enact equitable, justice-oriented, culturally responsive, and linguistically sustaining pedagogies in support of the success of K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education cannot be underestimated.  This project builds upon five years of prior work of the seven institutions involved in which the partners discussed, designed, and studied video analysis within science teacher preparation and developed the Framework for Analyzing Video in Science Teacher Education (FAVSTE).<br/><br/>This project involves a collaboration of science teacher educators from partnering universities (the Collaborative) including Vanderbilt University, Texas State University?San Marcos, Teachers College?Columbia University, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, the University of Northern Iowa, Florida International University, and Kennesaw State University who will work with partner high-need school districts. The project has three main intents regarding capacity building intended to situate the Collaborative to be well-positioned to submit a Track 4 Research proposal. One is to continue to analyze and modify the FAVSTE framework and associated tools to ensure that they explicitly support noticing for equity. A second is to identify, modify, and pilot research instruments to analyze teachers? professional vision, its link to equitable science teaching practice, and how this vision changes over time in relation to teacher effectiveness and retention. And the third is to develop a cross-site, longitudinal research study that incorporates practical instructional tools for video analysis and research tools for studying effectiveness and retention of STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Data collection and analysis consistent with a design-based research approach will be used. The work will allow the Collaborative to deepen its theoretical and methodological understanding of how to use video in teacher preparation to support equitable science teaching practice. The project intends to disseminate insights and best practices emanating from this project through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), a partner of the Collaborative, as well as professional organizations including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE). This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce Program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

The project uses light trapped between a pair of very closely spaced mirrors to control the migration of energy between the molecules. Recent developments demonstrate that millions of molecules can collectively interact with a single mode of light when they are placed in a properly designed cavity. Although the molecules normally act like independently oscillating pendula (representing excited electron-hole pairs called excitons), the interaction with light inside the cavity results in a correlated motion of the pendula as if they are all attached to a single driving rod. When the energy exchange rate between the photons and the excitons (i.e., the light and the pendula) is faster than other energy loss pathways, new quantum states known as polaritons are formed with mixed light-matter characteristics. Polaritons have a low effective mass that allows the energy to travel at an extremely high speed, many orders of magnitude faster than the excitons alone. Thus, polaritons have the potential to enhance the speed of energy migration in molecular materials. However, the polariton states are very fragile and short-lived because the synchronization of millions of molecules can be easily disrupted. When the coherence is disrupted, energy becomes localized on a few molecules instead of being shared by millions of molecules. Understanding the competition between coherence and localization holds the key to harnessing the power of polaritons. The research team led by Prof. Huang is addressing this scientific challenge by developing microscopy techniques to record the propagation of polaritons with a resolution of 15 femtoseconds (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second) and of 50 nanometers (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). The team also images the direction of propagation to differentiate polariton and exciton contributions. The research activities are integrated with K-12, undergraduate, and graduate science education. Specific educational and outreach activities include developing an undergraduate-level quantum chemistry lab module on strong light-matter coupling and partnering with the Superheroes of Science YouTube channel to make short videos for K-12 students and the general public on topics related to the research. <br/><br/>Strong coupling between molecular excitons and cavity photons provides a new paradigm for achieving long-range coherent energy transport. A single mode of light can collectively interact with millions, or even billions, of molecules to form macroscopically coherent light-matter hybrid states known as polaritons. The formation of polaritons can dramatically alter the energy landscape and dynamics of the molecules. The photonic nature of polaritons enables fast propagation and long-range delocalization, which are beneficial for enhancing exciton transport. However, challenges remain in exploiting strong light-matter interactions for long-range energy transport in molecular systems, due to the inherent inhomogeneities and large vibronic coupling that result in ultrafast dephasing, a high density of dark states, and disorder-induced localization. This project aims to develop ultrafast microscopy tools in both real- and Fourier-space to provide a comprehensive picture of the competition between coherent polariton transport and decoherence processes in molecular aggregates. The measurements probe the transport of molecular polaritonswith simultaneously high spatial (~50 nm) and temporal (~15 fs) resolution as well as momentum selectivity by combining ultrafast pump-probe microscopy with Fourier filtering. Molecular aggregates in Fabry-Perot microcavities with tunable Rabi splitting are used to investigate the role of vibronic coupling, disorder, and dark states in the transition from coherent to diffusive transport regime, as well as the direct visualization of remote energy transfer on macroscopic length scales resulting from the collective coherence. Beyond the fundamental insights made possible by these measurements, comparison with quantum chemistry calculations in collaboration with theory groups provides valuable information to aid the development of quantum mechanical theories for modeling molecular polaritons. The broader impacts of the project are further enhanced through educational and outreach activities that make the research accessible to a wide audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plate tectonics appears to be unique among all planetary bodies in our solar system and plays a crucial role in making our planet hospitable to life. Continents are formed and modified by fundamental plate tectonic processes, including volcanism, mountain-building, collisions with other continental masses, and rifting or breakup of supercontinents. Understanding the evolution of continental lithosphere (that is, the crust and uppermost mantle beneath continents) through time remains one of the most important challenges in Earth science. This project will study the processes that have shaped the continental lithosphere beneath the New England Appalachians through geologic time using a multi-disciplinary approach that includes seismic imaging of the crust and upper mantle, the analysis of geological structures, and dating the motion on ancient faults. The investigators will carry out detailed imaging using seismic waves from distant earthquakes measured at seismometers deployed in two linear arrays (one across New York and Massachusetts, the other across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). They will pair their seismic imaging work with studies of geologic structures exposed at the surface that will provide essential context on its plate tectonic history. The integration of information obtained from both approaches will illuminate the processes that have shaped the lithosphere beneath New England through the geologic past, opening a window into how continental lithosphere evolves as a part of the Earth?s plate tectonic system.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand how rifting, subduction, and terrane accretion have shaped lithospheric structure beneath New England: Does the lithosphere preserve a record of subduction and accretion or does lithospheric structure heal over time? How do subsequent accretion events overprint the structure of earlier collisions? How did Mesozoic rifting affect the structure of Paleozoic accretions? Are recent to ongoing mantle processes modifying the lithospheric structure? The investigators will analyze data from the NEST (New England Seismic Transects) experiment, a deployment of ~25 broadband seismometers that is configured to resolve crustal targets on length scales that are appropriate for direct linkage with geological structures. They will apply a suite of imaging techniques (receiver function analysis, body wave travel time analysis, wavefield migration imaging, and SKS splitting measurements) that will provide a comprehensive view of both the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the New England crust and upper mantle, including the region underlain by the so-called Northern Appalachian Anomaly (NAA). The U-Pb geochronology work will focus on the identification and analysis of xenocrystic (inherited) cores in zircon grains from arc plutonic and volcanic rocks from the Shelburne Falls and Bronson Hill arcs, in order to understand the history and timing of Taconic (and later) orogenic processes. The investigators will also conduct field work and structural analyses to investigate the extent and relative timing on frontal thrusts of basement massifs and the Taconic Mountains in western New England and New York, and the Connecticut Valley border fault system in central New England. They will constrain the timing of deformation by collecting and dating samples via 40Ar/39Ar geochronology from these regions, in order to determine how widespread reactivation of old faults (and displacement on new faults) has been throughout the region. The project emphasizes undergraduate involvement in cross-disciplinary research and field work, particularly by participants from groups that have been historically underrepresented in Earth science, enabled by collaboration among faculty at a liberal arts college and research institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project will expand the breadth of tools available for manufacturing advanced biomaterials and facilitate the development of products and devices that enable better diagnosis, study, and treatment of numerous diseases and conditions. The project also includes the creation of a community of historically underrepresented and underserved rising researchers, from high school to graduate school. Participants will be connected across the educational continuum by a cooperative mentoring network and will engage in learning and research opportunities related to 3D-printed biomaterials. As such, the project will help to enhance the diversity and technical strength of the biomaterials manufacturing workforce. <br/><br/>Although photo-manufacturing is a promising technique for the creation of advanced biomaterials, its use is limited by several major barriers: i) many traditional photoinitiators are biologically disruptive, ii) controlling mechanophysical properties across the micro- and meso-scale continuum is challenging, and iii) innovation is hindered by historical underrepresentation of some groups in STEM and insufficient practical training opportunities. The research team will address these limitations by quantifying both the efficiency and cytocompatibility of biosourced photoinitiator candidates in two-photon polymerization (micro-scale) and digital light processing (meso-scale). Additionally, the team will develop mathematical relationships between crosslinking rate and final feature properties, then employ these relationships to determine appropriate methods for coupling micro and meso printing to create multiscale features with continuous and predictable mechanophysical properties. Furthermore, the research team will help to enhance the diversity and technical skill level of the medical device and manufacturing workforce by creating the ?3D Printing in Bioengineering Rising Researcher Community.?

These datasets are an increasingly important source of evidence about causal effects in health services, public policy, and the social sciences. Procedures for measuring the causal effect of a treatment of interest emphasize creating similar subgroups of individuals, one receiving treatment and another receiving control.  In practice, however, this process is not able to achieve perfect similarity in large administrative datasets, especially when the units in the study exhibit structure over time or space.  The methods to be developed will produce confidence intervals and hypothesis tests that account explicitly for imperfect design and structure over units. Careful analysis of these methods will lead to valuable guidance for how to make initial designs less imperfect.  The resulting tools will pair effectively with modern machine learning methods in a modular framework and will immediately be applicable to large-scale studies of health and educational outcomes.  Supported educational activities will engage undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds, groom graduate students for future roles as faculty mentors, and produce pedagogical materials valuable for training undergraduate students in the principles of causal inference. Open-source software also will be developed.<br/><br/>This project will focus on integrating design and inference for two widely used causal inference designs that attempt to create credible comparisons from initially different treatment and control samples: matching, which groups similar treated and control individuals together into small homogenous matched sets; and weighting, which constructs weights for study units with the goal of downplaying dissimilarities and emphasizing similarities between the groups.  Four specific tasks will be undertaken.  First, existing methods of permutation inference for matched designs, which reshuffle labels for treated and control units within matched groups to construct hypothesis tests, will be transformed by allowing permutation probabilities to vary according to the degree of remaining discrepancy in individual matched sets.  The resulting method, which will be easy to implement using estimated probabilities of treatment, permits sensitivity analysis for unobserved variables and suggests a new method of choosing an initial match that effectively manages tradeoffs between similarity on probability of treatment and similarity on outcome risk.  Second, new algorithms will be designed to efficiently sample from conditional permutation distributions that respect design constraints in matching including optimal pairing on estimated probabilities of treatment and constrained imbalance on multiple variables.  These tools will lead to reduced bias and improved precision by paying attention to aspects of the study's design.  Third, tools for matched permutation inference will be extended to clustered observational studies with treatment given at both cluster and individual levels and possible spillover effects. An accompanying sensitivity analysis that addresses unobserved variables at both individual and cluster levels also will be constructed.  Finally, a new measure for large-sample performance of weighting methods in the presence of unobserved variables will be constructed, quantifying the impact of design choices on robustness to bias from unobserved variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plate tectonics appears to be unique among all planetary bodies in our solar system and plays a crucial role in making our planet hospitable to life. Continents are formed and modified by fundamental plate tectonic processes, including volcanism, mountain-building, collisions with other continental masses, and rifting or breakup of supercontinents. Understanding the evolution of continental lithosphere (that is, the crust and uppermost mantle beneath continents) through time remains one of the most important challenges in Earth science. This project will study the processes that have shaped the continental lithosphere beneath the New England Appalachians through geologic time using a multi-disciplinary approach that includes seismic imaging of the crust and upper mantle, the analysis of geological structures, and dating the motion on ancient faults. The investigators will carry out detailed imaging using seismic waves from distant earthquakes measured at seismometers deployed in two linear arrays (one across New York and Massachusetts, the other across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). They will pair their seismic imaging work with studies of geologic structures exposed at the surface that will provide essential context on its plate tectonic history. The integration of information obtained from both approaches will illuminate the processes that have shaped the lithosphere beneath New England through the geologic past, opening a window into how continental lithosphere evolves as a part of the Earth?s plate tectonic system.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand how rifting, subduction, and terrane accretion have shaped lithospheric structure beneath New England: Does the lithosphere preserve a record of subduction and accretion or does lithospheric structure heal over time? How do subsequent accretion events overprint the structure of earlier collisions? How did Mesozoic rifting affect the structure of Paleozoic accretions? Are recent to ongoing mantle processes modifying the lithospheric structure? The investigators will analyze data from the NEST (New England Seismic Transects) experiment, a deployment of ~25 broadband seismometers that is configured to resolve crustal targets on length scales that are appropriate for direct linkage with geological structures. They will apply a suite of imaging techniques (receiver function analysis, body wave travel time analysis, wavefield migration imaging, and SKS splitting measurements) that will provide a comprehensive view of both the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the New England crust and upper mantle, including the region underlain by the so-called Northern Appalachian Anomaly (NAA). The U-Pb geochronology work will focus on the identification and analysis of xenocrystic (inherited) cores in zircon grains from arc plutonic and volcanic rocks from the Shelburne Falls and Bronson Hill arcs, in order to understand the history and timing of Taconic (and later) orogenic processes. The investigators will also conduct field work and structural analyses to investigate the extent and relative timing on frontal thrusts of basement massifs and the Taconic Mountains in western New England and New York, and the Connecticut Valley border fault system in central New England. They will constrain the timing of deformation by collecting and dating samples via 40Ar/39Ar geochronology from these regions, in order to determine how widespread reactivation of old faults (and displacement on new faults) has been throughout the region. The project emphasizes undergraduate involvement in cross-disciplinary research and field work, particularly by participants from groups that have been historically underrepresented in Earth science, enabled by collaboration among faculty at a liberal arts college and research institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project in combinatorics is driven by two related philosophies: many mathematical objects are best understood by studying the rich discrete structures underlying them, and many of those discrete structures are best understood by building geometric models for them. This grant constitutes the academic backbone of the San Francisco State University-Colombia Combinatorics Initiative, a vibrant research and training collaboration featuring research-based courses, research projects, and summer schools. Since 2007 the initiative has trained more than 250 pre-Ph.D. students; more than half of the US participants are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and more than 80 have gone on to Ph.D. programs. The initiative?s practices of excellence and inclusion are shared broadly by the PI and many others, and they serve as a model for other math and science programs nationwide and beyond.<br/><br/>This project studies two research directions at the intersection of combinatorics and geometry: 1. We construct and study several geometric models of a matroid. Using tools from tropical geometry, Hodge theory, and intersection theory, we derive novel combinatorial properties of matroids that do not seem accessible purely combinatorially. 2. Measuring polytopes is very difficult in general, but it can be done when the polytopes have sufficient combinatorial or algebraic structure. We construct and measure families of polytopes arising in various mathematical settings, and use those measurements to compute algebraic and geometric quantities of interest. In both of these research directions, relevant objects are often built from a configuration of vectors ? usually a root system. Polytopes and matroids offer a powerful toolkit to study such configurations. The proposed projects will further our understanding of fundamental questions in combinatorics, discrete geometry, representation theory, and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The degree of control over molecular structure and properties afforded by chemistry makes it possible to develop molecules and materials that take advantage of electron spin dynamics to implement new strategies for quantum information science. Molecular architectures provide unmatched flexibility for tailoring quantum properties using bottom-up synthetic strategies. The project lies at the interface of organic, physical, and materials chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels. This group is also well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science. Outreach activities involving K-12 students will also be part of the funded project.<br/><br/>This project will address several goals essential for exploiting spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) as spin qubit pairs (SQPs) that target quantum information science applications. Professor Michael Wasielewski?s group will 1) photogenerate SCRPs to produce well-defined initial SQP quantum states that can be addressed and manipulated to serve as targets for two-qubit quantum gates; 2) entangle the electron spins of SQPs with one or two nuclear spins to extend spin coherence lifetimes; 3) move (teleport) spin coherences between two sites, focusing on how SQP coherence lifetimes and increasing the teleportation distance affect teleportation fidelity; and 4) explore how chirality-induced spin selectivity influences SQP coherence and polarization using chiral electron donor-acceptor molecules. In topics 1, 3, and 4, they will extend the molecular architectures to include DNA hairpins, which will provide a scalable platform for the rapid synthesis of a wide variety of molecular quantum information science systems. The spin dynamics of these systems will be probed using time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, which will be performed using a short laser pulse to generate the SCRP following by probing the spins using constant or pulsed microwaves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current art employs spatial multiplexing at the transmitter which is computationally expensive and brittle under statistically non-stationary xG channels, complicating the receiver as well.  At best, these methods are only able to achieve a modest error rate that is inadequate to support high data rate wireless applications like mobile AR/VR/XR, aerial communications and 4K/8K HDR video streaming services. This CAREER research generalizes the architecture of a Deep Learning (DL) based wireless transceiver that will consistently operate with low error rate in all types of wireless channels, but especially outperform the state of the art in future xG channels. Overall, it is envisioned to achieve 3-5 orders of magnitude improvement in reliability across all types of channels and applications. The education plan focuses on a web-learning platform that augments traditional textbooks with interactive elements, multimedia and adaptive content to promote self-learning. Further, an extended reality platform is envisioned for virtual laboratory experience that currently limits the hands-on aspect of engineering education.  Collectively, the education plan broadens the participation of students beyond the boundaries of the PI?s home institution. <br/><br/>This project expands the understanding and applicability of deep learning (DL) for practical wireless transceivers in four fundamental areas: 1) Reliability: It takes a mathematically principled approach towards understanding the generality of DL models for wireless communications that can adapt to changing wireless environment without compromising reliability; 2) Generality: Current art often lead to over-optimized models that are brittle when exposed to non-stationary changes in the channel state. This research takes a holistic approach by innovating adaptive algorithm for accurate spatio-temporal decomposition of the channel state and pre-condition the waveform for error free communications; 3) Complexity: Low computational complexity of the proposed methods will make DL transceivers easy to reconfigure with minimal to no retraining and operate with guaranteed error performance; and 4) Adaptability: Data dependent, inverse model design and transfer learning will ensure the DL models can adapt quickly to ephemeral channel states without compromising on reliability and complexity. Finally, the research is made practical by prototype hardware implementation of the transceiver architecture and validated with extensive over-the-air experimentation. Overall, the transmitter and receiver work together to adapt in any and all channel conditions that balances model complexity and error performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These measurements are taken at all US locations, and updated each week.  Using these data to make accurate predictions of future drought would assist water resource managers, agriculture producers, and other crucial sectors of society plan for the risk of drought.  However, statistical methods needed to analyze this type of data can be impractical due to computational limitations of fitting the model.  With ongoing advances in data collection and storage, the size and computational demands of spatio-temporal ordinal data like the US Drought Monitor will continue to increase.  This project will address the challenge by producing new statistical tools which enable the analysis and forecasting of spatio-temporal ordinal data at a controlled computational cost, and thereby support drought research and prediction for the US.<br/><br/>The primary objective is to develop novel statistical methodology to efficiently fit a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model for ordinal data. The model will be interpretable, scalable to large data sets, and specifically designed to support probabilistic predictions reflecting all sources of uncertainty.  The approach will address spatial and temporal dependence through low rank projections of random effects onto suitable basis functions, which avoids known problems of confounding with fixed effects, aids with interpretation, and substantially reduces the computational cost of fitting the model.  By viewing the data as areal rather than point-referenced, the cost of sampling from the posterior is reduced by avoiding dense matrix inversion, a major limitation of existing methods.  The investigators will develop this model with a goal not always at the forefront of other spatio-temporal research efforts --- how to update the model rapidly to incorporate newly emerging observations, without resorting to re-fitting the full model each time.  The model will be deployed to study US drought, capturing how prediction uncertainty propagates forward in time, and documenting when and how this uncertainty overtakes the ability to make meaningful predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is estimated that 30-50% of the nation's water operators will retire within five years and only 5% of operators are under age 25. This project will address the critical infrastructure need for licensed water technicians by expanding the quality and capacity of training available for this field. In alignment with the mission of the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, this project will advance the delivery of technician education by creating high-quality, cost-effective, technology-based online resources for water operator technology. These new virtual resources will supplement the existing high-quality training offered by the South Carolina Environmental Training Center at Central Carolina Technical College (CCTC) with virtual reality (VR) modules developed collaboratively with Clemson University as a tool to enrich curriculum components identified as the greatest barriers to water operator licensure. This project also benefits operators in rural environments who have less access to professional development and training. Availability of virtual labs will further enable women, veterans, persons from  groups underrepresented in the field, and persons with disabilities to obtain certifications. Unlike immersive VR, these systems require no additional equipment as they are designed to run simulations on a standard laptop using a keyboard and mouse. Project outcomes include increasing: 1) the number of water operators prepared for the transition from learning to workforce, 2) recruitment and mentoring material to attract people from underrepresented groups to water treatment technology; and 3) the assessment of the use of these technologies with diverse groups of students in different educational settings. This work will contribute to the NSF's Big Ideas, including ""The Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier"" and ?Growing Convergent Research? by conducting fundamental research investigating the benefits and risks of integrating virtual labs in educational settings for water treatment education.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) Design, integrate, and develop VR enabled curriculum resources for water treatment training to address workforce preparedness and close the skills gap based on current and future workplace needs. 2) Implement the developed resources for online and hybrid approach, conduct rigorous evidence-based assessment of these modules, and provide the content to the ATE community. 3) Recruit and retain students including women, veterans, and persons from groups historically underrepresented in advanced-technology fields. 4) Create professional development resources and conduct workshops for water technology educators. The project will provide alternatives for place-bound and capacity-constrained water treatment programs via technology resources. Virtual labs will allow students access to realistic lab experiences in highly engaging VR environments that will address the most prevalent educational barriers to licensure. Key stakeholders from Association of Boards of Certification, community partners, NSF ATE centers, two-year partner institutions, and industry will guide the content development to ensure its relevancy. Evaluation and assessment will be led by an external evaluator who will provide both formative and summative evaluation of the implementation of the virtual resources in CCTC's existing curriculum utilizing Kirkpatrick's four-level model. Both the pre- and post-surveys will utilize the following validated constructs: perceived learning outcomes, engagement, usability, and satisfaction and perception.  The community of educators in water treatment technology, along with the broader technician education community, will receive implementation information on the modules created. Conferences for dissemination include an annual symposium hosted by CCTC, water treatment conferences, Technology Education Conferences, the NSF ATE Principal Investigators conference, and other professional association conferences. The findings will also be disseminated as journal papers, webinars, and presentations at professional development workshops. All materials developed will be distributed through ATE Central, CCTC's learning management system, and the EducateWorkforce portal hosted by Clemson University.

Yet most U.S. adults are skeptical of scientists? goodwill (e.g., commitment to public good). Goodwill is a key dimension of source credibility, a shortcut used by the public to interpret scientific findings and recommendations. Despite its key role, little is currently known about how goodwill emerges, varies and is contested across individuals and groups to motivate (or not) evidence-based action. This project will address this gap by identifying the key drivers of perceived technoscientific (TS) source goodwill and determining when and how technoscientific goodwill and communication shape responses to environmental messages among agricultural land operators (i.e., farmers, foresters, ranchers). Research findings will encourage efforts to incentivize evidence-based land stewardship that mitigates land-based climate emissions and maximizes the benefits of conservation science for people and the environment. <br/><br/>The proposed CAREER project will identify an improved evidence-based model of the factors shaping public perceptions of technoscientific (TA) source credibility and further efforts to measure, test, and employ goodwill as a means of promoting effective public communication. This research uses latent semantic analysis and mixed-methods content analysis to identify and compare the socio-cultural beliefs undergirding agricultural land operators and TS sources? mental models of source credibility. An online message experiment will be used to test the effects of goodwill signals and hedging on perceptions of TS source credibility and support for conservation practices on agricultural lands. Furthermore, this CAREER project integrates research and teaching with the development and evaluation of a novel educational curriculum that engages agricultural communities and prepares natural resource professionals to signal goodwill and recognize the cultural realities informing responses to evidence-based messages. As such, this project will provide a foundation for improved science communication training, more effective and evidence-based environmental messaging, and enhanced goodwill between agricultural communities and TS sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MESA participants at Bakersfield College have improved course completion rates and other outcomes, and are on a path to graduate with an associate degree in a STEM discipline and/or transfer to four-year institutions. The project has three main goals: (1) expand the number of MESA program student participants from 107 to 200 students per semester to establish a baseline for future study and give preliminary insight to challenges that might exist for further expansion; (2) determine which of the general MESA program components have the greatest impact on student success; and (3) build awareness and explore how to better integrate MESA into the Guided Pathway organization of Bakersfield College. Major components of the MESA program that will be explored include workshops, informal and peer mentoring, volunteering in the community, undergraduate research, opportunities to attend conferences, industry and laboratory field trips, and job shadowing. Understanding how to grow the program while maintaining positive outcomes will provide important insights, particularly for community colleges that serve rural populations as they look to implement successful strategies for bridging the gap for underserved groups to access the STEM professions.<br/><br/>Often at community colleges, the path to transfer in STEM takes longer than two years and the number of students who successfully transfer can be low. This project will contribute to the knowledge base in STEM education by studying how key components of Bakersfield College?s MESA program, which accounts for 48% of STEM pathway degrees while only engaging 6% of STEM pathway students, can be scaled up without diminishing outcomes. Major data sources include focus groups of current MESA program participants, a survey of MESA graduates, and a survey to gauge awareness of the MESA program across the proposing institution. The expected results are to identify the critical elements of the program needed to increase the number of participants and maintain its level of effectiveness. The results of the research study will be disseminated amongst similar institutions, particularly those that serve large minority populations and may be looking for scalable strategies to support STEM degree completion.

These agents create new and powerful types of interactive stories for art and entertainment, training applications, and personalized education. A central problem for experience managers is avoiding dead ends, which are situations where story structure is broken due to a choice by the player. This problem results in experiences with un-interesting stories, missed training sequences, and long spells without appropriate targeted educational content. This project will develop a novel experience management architecture to quickly navigate around dead end situations during real-time interaction with a human participant. The architecture is based on recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for general game playing. This experience management platform will enable new forms of real-time training and education applications.<br/><br/>This work addresses a fundamental gap in existing experience managers that do not adversarially plan against sequences of player actions that lead to dead end situations. The specific research objectives are to create a deep reinforcement learning-based gameplay agent platform that (1) builds state spaces described by an action language, (2) identifies dead end states without performing exhaustive search, (3) relaxes assumptions of zero-sum and symmetric gameplay, and (4) solves narrative planning problems by compiling specialized narrative reasoning into a standard action language domain description. If successful, this research will significantly improve the speed and control of experience management agents and provide a pipeline to controlling existing and future specialized interactive narrative formalisms. These improvements will allow control of larger and more immersive narrative, training, and pedagogical environments compared to current systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematically, we make the notion of symmetry precise via group theory. Fundamental objects in quantum physics include abstract things like von Neumann algebras and quantum field theories. In the past several decades, it has become clear that fundamental objects in quantum physics have symmetries that are best described by certain generalizations of groups, called tensor categories. This project will provide mathematicians, physicists, and other scientists invested in quantum science with a deeper understanding of how tensor categories are structured, new examples of tensor categories, and their concrete data related to these examples. The PI will look for interesting examples via classification and constructions, which would be useful not only to the theory of tensor categories itself but also to related areas of mathematics, such as topological quantum field theory and the study of vertex algebras. The educational component of this project will establish networks of diverse voices in quantum symmetries research and in the mathematical community more broadly. The PI will organize collaborative research workshops at Indiana University (IU) for junior mathematicians start a 4-week long summer program at IU for underrepresented incoming graduate students. <br/> <br/>In more detail, the PI will study the cohomology of tensor categories, classify modular categories, and find new tensor categories via constructions, which would be useful not only to the theory of tensor categories itself but also to related areas of math, such as topological quantum field theory and the study of vertex operator algebras. In the non-semisimple setting, the PI will incorporate geometric techniques in the study of the cohomology, via support varieties, to learn about the structure of these categories. The PI will utilize Lie theoretic techniques to construct Hopf algebras and Nichols algebras in some symmetric tensor categories in positive characteristic with the aim of advancing their classification. To deepen the understanding of the structure of fusion and modular categories, the PI will focus on perfect fusion categories and on the classification program for ""small"" fusion categories. Studying perfect fusion categories will enable mathematicians to understand weakly integral fusion categories and would yield, for example, insights into the detection of universal anyons by experimental physicists.

Exams are dependable and convenient assessment tools for educators, however, they can cause student anxiety. Exams are often one-shot events resulting in no incentive for students to correct any learning deficiencies. Timely feedback on student exam answers can help students identify knowledge gaps. This project will develop and assess a two-stage exam process for an introductory computer programming course. Students will take a multiple choice exam in which they will provide a justification for each selected answer. For students who have significant knowledge gaps, an interview will follow, providing a second opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding. After the interview, a plan of action will be provided for each student to help them achieve the learning outcomes. It is expected that the project will help improve student learning outcomes in a foundational computer science course, which will help prepare students for professional practice in the computing workforce.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: (1) improve student learning outcomes, (2) reduce test anxiety, and (3) support academic integrity. This project builds on previous work on two-stage exams in the physics education community. In the first stage, an improved multiple-choice assessment will be used to identify student knowledge gaps. The second stage consists of a one-on-one interview which will focus on questions related to the knowledge gaps identified in the first stage. Instructors will then develop a plan of study that will be personalized for each student. Research questions include: (1) What additional insights will the improved multiple-choice exam provide over a standard multiple-choice exam? 2) To what extent does the interview stage help to improve students? learning outcomes? To answer these questions, test results will be compared using traditional versus the improved multiple choice exam. Student learning gains will be assessed with and without the interview stage. The results of the proposed project will be disseminated at computer science education conferences and one computing education community site organized by Association for Computing Machinery education board.

Since RL can provide optimized policies to achieve certain goals, people are eager to use advanced RL techniques to solve real-world decision-making problems. Despite its huge success in AI domains, RL has not yet shown the same degree of success for real-world applications because RL largely relies on simulation, and there is rarely a good simulator for real-world systems. Unlike simulated environments such as games where data could be unlimited, real-world physical systems like traffic systems are quite the opposite: data is small (i.e., sparse and hard to obtain). This raises important research questions about building realistic simulations from small data that can mimic complex and stochastic real-world dynamics. The solution from this project can help policymakers choose a better policy before implementing it in the real world, greatly facilitate the adoption of reinforcement learning techniques in the real world, and benefit many applications in which one would like to use real data to learn or understand real-world physical systems better.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a realistic traffic simulator by investigating data mining algorithms and provides solutions toward mimicking real-world simulations with small data with applications to traffic simulations.

First, the project will try to learn data-driven models from incomplete and indirect observations from the real world. Second, this project will seek to innovate the data-driven model to meet with human knowledge, as human knowledge could guide us to learn a model that is not only relied on small and possibly biased data.

Through a cross-site collaboration, a plan for a longitudinal study focused on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools will be developed. The COVID-19 pandemic gives new urgency to video analysis as large numbers of teacher preparation programs have had to use digital libraries of classroom video cases in lieu of traditional field experiences in schools. In addition, the importance of how teachers are prepared to enact equitable, justice-oriented, culturally responsive, and linguistically sustaining pedagogies in support of the success of K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education cannot be underestimated.  This project builds upon five years of prior work of the seven institutions involved in which the partners discussed, designed, and studied video analysis within science teacher preparation and developed the Framework for Analyzing Video in Science Teacher Education (FAVSTE).<br/><br/>This project involves a collaboration of science teacher educators from partnering universities (the Collaborative) including Vanderbilt University, Texas State University?San Marcos, Teachers College?Columbia University, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, the University of Northern Iowa, Florida International University, and Kennesaw State University who will work with partner high-need school districts. The project has three main intents regarding capacity building intended to situate the Collaborative to be well-positioned to submit a Track 4 Research proposal. One is to continue to analyze and modify the FAVSTE framework and associated tools to ensure that they explicitly support noticing for equity. A second is to identify, modify, and pilot research instruments to analyze teachers? professional vision, its link to equitable science teaching practice, and how this vision changes over time in relation to teacher effectiveness and retention. And the third is to develop a cross-site, longitudinal research study that incorporates practical instructional tools for video analysis and research tools for studying effectiveness and retention of STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Data collection and analysis consistent with a design-based research approach will be used. The work will allow the Collaborative to deepen its theoretical and methodological understanding of how to use video in teacher preparation to support equitable science teaching practice. The project intends to disseminate insights and best practices emanating from this project through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), a partner of the Collaborative, as well as professional organizations including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE).

Compared to the terrestrial cellular base stations, drones equipped with wireless transceivers can serve as mobile base stations, and stand out in providing highly on-demand services with flexible 3D mobility, better wireless connectivity with higher chance of Line-of-Sight links, and much lower deployment cost with almost infrastructure-free network construction. Promising as it is, drone based communication networks still face fundamental regulation challenges: i) as drones are highly mobile, the dynamically changing network topology may make it unpractical for a centralized control unit to collect complete network information and make collective decisions; ii) the environment in which drones operate may be dynamically changing or unexplored without a priori knowledge of the environment modeling, making the conventional optimization or rule-based methods hardly applicable; iii) the research is still embryonic on how to optimally regulate the drone network when the lineup of the serving drones dynamically change, which, however, will be a common event in realistic implementation. To this end, this proposal is aimed to crack the nut of the above identified issues, and develop an effective framework for distributed network regulation solutions that are environment-model-free and well adaptive to the dynamic drone lineup. The research outcomes are expected to provide valuable inspirations and benchmarking to the distributed, scalable, and artificial-intelligence powered management of aerial access communication networks under a dynamic network setup. Such networks will be embraced as a key component in the larger-scope Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks for the beyond-5G mobile telecommunications. The success of the project will potentially contribute to the leadership and competence of the United States worldwide in future generation mobile telecommunications as well as elevating national communication welfare with more integrated and on-demand communication infrastructure.<br/><br/>In this project, multi-agent reinforcement learning will be applied to establish a distributed and model-free network regulation framework. The framework will feature strong capability in making sequential decisions in complex time-varying environments. Under the developed framework, the project aims to investigate how the drone communication networks should responsively handle and further proactively control the dynamic change of the drone lineup in a distributed yet coordinated manner. Specifically, responsive strategies will be first designed for a general drone communication network. The strategies will jointly optimize the radio resource management and trajectory design for the drones when the drone lineup change dynamically. The learning algorithm design will be investigated with different levels of inter-drone information exchange. The learning exploration will be promoted by adopting the structure of asynchronous parallel computing. The network will be prototyped leveraging on programmable drone products and simple-yet-effective communication protocols. To move one step further, proactive control strategies will be derived for the solar-powered self-sustainable drone communication network, which proactively control the quit and join-in of the drones by pre-shaping their solar-charging plan. The strategies will consider dynamic user spatial and traffic distributions by combining Fourier analysis, Long-Short Term Memory and Gaussian process regression for distribution prediction, and enabling predicting while learning to significantly reduce the reinforcement learning complexity. The hybrid cooperative-compete relationship among individual drones will be handled by exploiting Nash Q learning and correlated Q learning. The anxiety on the high-dimension state-action space in learning will be relieved by adopting problem decomposition techniques. The proposed project will advance the research on autonomous regulation of drone communication networks by filling the gaps of missing control strategy design to responsively handle and proactively control the drone lineup change. In addition, the introduction of game theory into the distributed framework makes the research more realistic with diversified autonomy in individual drones. The prototyping plan will complement the simulation evaluation on the time complexity and communication overhead/latency in the real-world implementation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One approach to manipulate neurons, which is termed ?optogenetics?, uses visible light to activate light-sensitive ion channels on the cell membrane of neurons. Since visible light does not penetrate deep into the brain, this approach usually requires the invasive implantation of an optical fiber, which delivers light of desired wavelengths into the brain. The aim of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to improve the penetration depth of light for manipulating specific neurons in the brain, thus eliminating the need of an optical fiber and allowing the subject animal to behave freely. The results obtained from this project will enable noninvasive approaches to modulate brain activity through the intact scalp and skull. This project will also include research training opportunities for underrepresented minority (URM) high school students, with efforts to guide their pursuit of careers in STEM-related work.<br/><br/>Understanding neural computation requires causal manipulation of neural activity to dissect the complex circuit connections and the relationship between neural activity and certain behaviors. Optogenetics enable precise modulation of neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution and neuron-type specificity. Conventional optogenetics is performed in the visible spectrum; however, the delivery of visible light usually requires invasive implantation of an optical fiber into the brain, due to light attenuation (i.e., scattering and absorption) in cranial bone and brain tissue. This tethered fiber interface usually leads to acute tissue damage, chronic immune responses, and restriction of the subject?s free behavior. To address these challenges, the Investigator aims to investigate the feasibility of in vivo neuromodulation with light up to 1,500 nm in wavelength in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) spectrum. NIR-II light benefits from much reduced scattering and absorption compared to its visible counterpart, and it has been demonstrated to enable deep-brain imaging through the intact scalp and skull in mice. The Research Plan is organized under three objectives: (1) Synthesize biocompatible polymers with NIR-II absorption in the range of 1,000~1,500 nm; (2) Target NIR-light sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons with NIR-II absorbing polymers for in-vitro neuromodulation; and (3) Demonstrate the feasibility of NIR-II neuromodulation in the mouse hippocampus through the intact scalp and skull. The knowledge gained from this project will shed light on the feasibility of optogenetic neuromodulation in the NIR-II window and thus offer more guidance on NIR-II light-based approaches in biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such algorithms will be used not only to match current scientific and engineered solutions but also, given enough data, to rival years of future effort. This project proposes framing optimism in terms of competitive learning, where a single algorithm performs as well as a family of bespoke algorithms, each for a specific true nature. Thus, even without knowledge of the truth, a competitive algorithm is guaranteed to deliver the best feasible performance in each case. This approach shows that much more is possible than the pessimistic outlook of judging performance against a worst-case nature. It can also help better understand the limits of (human) discovery, based on how amenable nature is to being discovered. By cutting right to the heart of the philosophy of acquiring knowledge from observation, this work weaves research with data science education efforts at several levels, to help nurture and train the next generation of data scientists and engineers, with active outreach and engagement of traditionally underserved students.<br/><br/>The project fully explores the competitive perspective for contextual distribution learning, a problem that permeates data science and machine learning, with natural language modeling as a specific use case. Here, the goal is to demonstrate an algorithm that learns to predict, by building a stochastic matrix or tensor from data. It is successful if its performance rivals that of a rich array of specialized algorithms aware of potential underlying structures, such as rank, sparsity, or low manifold dimension, despite no single algorithm being worst-case optimal. The larger premise of the project is that the principles that enable competitiveness are fundamental and cut across multiple domains. These include: (i) the back-off principle, which demarcates between abundant and rare data regions and applies structure only in the latter, where it is needed, achieving competitiveness through nimbleness, (ii) the empirical-Bayes principle, which offers a mechanism to share data across rarely represented regions, allowing them to help each other, and (iii) tail structures, which ground the first two principles in a tractable framework and can be used to establish fundamental limits, by characterizing conditions that are necessary and sufficient for competitiveness. By rigorously establishing the foundations of these principles, the goal of the project is to streamline the design of competitive algorithms that simultaneously find the truth of nature and adapt to it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

JCC is located one hour south of Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, where the demand for well-trained and diverse biopharma technicians is growing and exceeding the number of technicians currently produced from local and regional community colleges. Bio Blend 2.0 will further modify Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology curriculum to provide access to distributed control system software (DeltaV), work-based learning, and internship opportunities with a goal of enrolling 50 students in years two and three of this project. The project will broaden participation of students with autism at JCC by 150%, leading to greater participation of neurodiverse individuals in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) related programs. This three-year project will provide opportunities for DeltaV certification, Bio Blend certification, and Associates Degrees in Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology. Project results will include an increased number of trained technicians for local partners with national scalability for other colleges and industries.   <br/><br/>Bio Blend 2.0 seeks to accomplish three goals: 1) Modify Bio Blend curriculum, course progression, and resources based on stakeholder feedback and expand to all degree students across both the Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology programs; 2) Improve the Talent Pipeline to meet workforce and industry needs by developing a work-based learning experience and soft-skills training; and 3) Increase neurodiversity in the Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology programs to include more individuals from the autism spectrum. As part of the Bio Blend 2.0 project, DeltaV, the distributed control system used by many biotech companies, will be embedded into the curriculum across both programs. The project will also increase diversity and inclusion as it relates to the neurodivergent population. This is based on local industry feedback, unemployment rates for this population, and familiarity with a successful STEM program specifically for individuals with autism at other colleges. Faculty will receive training in Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to support diverse learners. JCC will also offer summer professional development opportunities for middle and high school educators and career counselors to strengthen the pipeline from public schools to postsecondary technician education. Industry feedback through advisory council meetings, classroom support, and on-going communication will improve student engagement and project outcomes. JCC?s Career Coach will facilitate learning communities for all students with specific focus for neurodiverse students on the autism spectrum. Bio Blend 2.0 will ultimately produce a more diverse and talented group of students from Applied Engineering and Biotechnology, ready to enter the workforce with hands-on applicable experience and certifications to fill the local industry need.

Scientists, businesses, governments and independent organizations want to learn from this data so they can understand basic biological mechanisms, invest capital, allocate aid and design coherent policy in a changing world. Analyzing spatial associations within viral contagion is, unsurprisingly, an area of immense scientific interest, but the task requires accounting for the dynamic and multiscale transportation networks that shape the global economy. This project seeks to advance knowledge of statistical inference from stochastic process models in the context of massive amounts of dynamic and network-indexed data. The proposed research ideas will avoid costly direct representations of network structure and instead use Bayesian dimension reduction to probabilistically map network dynamics to a continuous domain. The project combines theoretical and methodological developments in scalable Bayesian dimension reduction; develops efficient algorithms into open-source, high performance computing (HPC) software; and applies them to the high-impact analysis of viruses including, but not limited to, SARS-CoV-2. The project will emphasize the combination of rigorous statistical methodology with parallel computing techniques available to any scientist with moderate resources.<br/><br/><br/>The project will combine theory, methods and applications in advancing knowledge of statistical inference for network-indexed processes.  Bayesian multidimensional scaling (BMDS) stands as an established tool for probabilistic dimension reduction of network data but the method's quadratic computational complexity prohibits big data application. The project will extend BMDS to the analysis of millions of data points using a multipronged approach.  From a theoretical standpoint, the investigators will show that the classical BMDS model is strictly equivalent to a modified BMDS model with sparse couplings between observations. This 'free lunch' result will amount to a linear reduction in the computational complexity of the classical algorithm, but its use will require an upper bound on the rank of the traditional BMDS distance matrix. A jointly methodological and theoretical investigation will develop a cutting-edge rank estimation procedure for Euclidean distance matrices (EDM) and derive non-asymptotic and asymptotic bounds for the rank estimation error and its impact on the modified BMDS posterior. Bayesian inference with the developed sparse BMDS (S-BMDS) will amount to simulating a massive N-body problem with sparse pairwise couplings. A primary methodological investigation will develop fast parallel algorithms for computing (1) the S-BMDS likelihood and gradient, and (2) the EDM rank in ways that efficiently use multi-core and vectorized central processing units (CPU) and multiple graphics processing units (GPU). The investigators will then allow trends in Google mobility data to inform effective distances between viruses and use our developed machinery to model the spread of, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 through global mobility space. The project also includes an expansive plan for educational, outreach and mentoring activities and will  actively disseminate the research findings in a form of open-source HPC software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include fault detection in manufacturing, disease outbreak detection in public health, spectrum sensing in signal processing, item change detection in educational testing, and fraud detection in e-commerce. While traditional methods mainly focus on identifying data points deviating from their normal states independently, new challenges arise in the big-data era as the anomalies often involve massive data with complex structures. This project will develop novel statistical methods and theoretical results along with computational tools to systematically deal with the detection of structured anomalies in large-scale data. In addition to the technical contribution, the methods developed in this project will positively impact research in other disciplines. For instance, the change detection method developed in this project will aid the monitoring of item pool quality in educational testing to improve the validity and reliability of the tests. This project will also implement an educational plan which includes engaging graduate and undergraduate students in research activities, creating a new curriculum, and outreach to educational institutes. The outcome of the project will be broadly disseminated through journal publications and conferences, and publicly available statistical software will be developed. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project will focus on two classes of problems in large-scale sequential decision-making and latent variable models. The first class of problems involves large-scale streaming data, which have become common in recent years, owing to the rapid development in data acquisition technologies. The project will establish a general compound sequential decision theory framework to quantify the performance of procedures for large-scale online change detection problems and develop efficient sequential decisions under this framework. The second class of problems is on high-dimensional generalized latent factor models with structured outliers. The project will develop efficient model estimation and statistical inference methods and provide theoretical guarantees on their accuracy and reliability. Fundamental issues such as identifiability and estimability of the model will be addressed. Moreover, novel technical tools will be developed to address theoretical and methodological challenges in the above problems. For example, a monotone coupling technique for stochastic processes living on a non-Euclidean space will be developed to enhance the understanding of sequential decisions for multi-stream problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When liquids are cooled to low temperature, they form solids. Often that solid is a crystal in which molecules are arranged in an ordered structure. However, sometimes the liquid freezes into an amorphous glass and in this case the properties of the solid depend strongly upon how it is made. Working with their students, Professors Ediger and Richert are creating glasses by vapor-depositing molecules onto cold surfaces and using sophisticated experimental methods to understand the unusual glasses that form. Their discoveries could have implications for advancing technologies based on organic electronics, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).  The project contributes to the development of the Nation's scientific workforce by providing research opportunities for graduate students in advanced experimental methods.  The team is also working to prepare high school students from under-represented groups for college, through partnership with the University of Wisconsin-Madison?s Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE).<br/> <br/>In contrast to crystallization, fundamental questions about glass formation remain unanswered, including the possible existence of underlying phase transitions and diverging time scales. Professors Ediger and Richert are creating amorphous molecular films through physical vapor deposition (PVD) of low molecular weight organic molecules onto cold surfaces. The resulting films are then characterized by in situ dielectric relaxation measurements, nanocalorimetry, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Experiments performed at (or near) the glass transition temperature (Tg) aim to determine if a single component system can possess multiple long-lived liquid states. Dielectric relaxation measurements performed during vapor deposition directly characterize surface mobility and test a proposed model for vapor-deposited glasses based upon surface equilibration.  Finally, the kinetic stability of co-deposited PVD glasses made from two different organic glass formers are investigated for cases where each component forms a highly stable glass as a pure material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, geometric objects described by polynomial equations. To study algebraic varieties, it is often convenient to divide them into different classes according to their geometric properties. An important class of algebraic varieties is given by those whose first Chern class, a basic invariant of algebraic varieties, is zero. A fundamental result from the 1980s, called the Beauville-Bogomolov theorem, states that there are exactly three kinds of building blocks for smooth compact algebraic varieties with zero first Chern class: complex tori, strict Calabi-Yau manifolds, and irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. This project focuses on the last of these three building blocks, which traditionally has been the least studied. Thanks to some fundamental theorems in differential geometry, irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds admit a special metric called a hyper-Khler metric. The geometry of holomorphic symplectic manifolds is relevant not only to algebraic and differential geometry, but also to representation theory and mathematical physics. As part of this project, the PI will organize activities to strengthen the hyper-Khler research community in the United States, activities for undergraduate students from under-represented minorities in math, and K-12 activities in the broader community around Columbia University.<br/><br/>K3 surfaces constitute one of the most studied types of algebraic surfaces, and irreducible symplectic manifolds are arguably their higher dimensional analogues. In this analogy, Lagrangian fibrations on compact hyper-Khler manifolds are the natural generalizations of elliptic K3 surfaces. Together with symplectic resolutions, Lagrangian fibrations provide one the strongest means to study, classify, and construct this class of manifolds. The PI aims to advance the current knowledge of (compact) hyper-Khler manifolds through the systematic study of Lagrangian fibrations. More specifically, the PI will introduce new techniques to compactify quasi-projective Lagrangian fibrations and will study the cohomology, derived categories, and Chow groups of Lagrangian fibered compact hyper-Khler manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plate tectonics appears to be unique among all planetary bodies in our solar system and plays a crucial role in making our planet hospitable to life. Continents are formed and modified by fundamental plate tectonic processes, including volcanism, mountain-building, collisions with other continental masses, and rifting or breakup of supercontinents. Understanding the evolution of continental lithosphere (that is, the crust and uppermost mantle beneath continents) through time remains one of the most important challenges in Earth science. This project will study the processes that have shaped the continental lithosphere beneath the New England Appalachians through geologic time using a multi-disciplinary approach that includes seismic imaging of the crust and upper mantle, the analysis of geological structures, and dating the motion on ancient faults. The investigators will carry out detailed imaging using seismic waves from distant earthquakes measured at seismometers deployed in two linear arrays (one across New York and Massachusetts, the other across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). They will pair their seismic imaging work with studies of geologic structures exposed at the surface that will provide essential context on its plate tectonic history. The integration of information obtained from both approaches will illuminate the processes that have shaped the lithosphere beneath New England through the geologic past, opening a window into how continental lithosphere evolves as a part of the Earth?s plate tectonic system.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand how rifting, subduction, and terrane accretion have shaped lithospheric structure beneath New England: Does the lithosphere preserve a record of subduction and accretion or does lithospheric structure heal over time? How do subsequent accretion events overprint the structure of earlier collisions? How did Mesozoic rifting affect the structure of Paleozoic accretions? Are recent to ongoing mantle processes modifying the lithospheric structure? The investigators will analyze data from the NEST (New England Seismic Transects) experiment, a deployment of ~25 broadband seismometers that is configured to resolve crustal targets on length scales that are appropriate for direct linkage with geological structures. They will apply a suite of imaging techniques (receiver function analysis, body wave travel time analysis, wavefield migration imaging, and SKS splitting measurements) that will provide a comprehensive view of both the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the New England crust and upper mantle, including the region underlain by the so-called Northern Appalachian Anomaly (NAA). The U-Pb geochronology work will focus on the identification and analysis of xenocrystic (inherited) cores in zircon grains from arc plutonic and volcanic rocks from the Shelburne Falls and Bronson Hill arcs, in order to understand the history and timing of Taconic (and later) orogenic processes. The investigators will also conduct field work and structural analyses to investigate the extent and relative timing on frontal thrusts of basement massifs and the Taconic Mountains in western New England and New York, and the Connecticut Valley border fault system in central New England. They will constrain the timing of deformation by collecting and dating samples via 40Ar/39Ar geochronology from these regions, in order to determine how widespread reactivation of old faults (and displacement on new faults) has been throughout the region. The project emphasizes undergraduate involvement in cross-disciplinary research and field work, particularly by participants from groups that have been historically underrepresented in Earth science, enabled by collaboration among faculty at a liberal arts college and research institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many enzymes contain iron, and the metal plays a major role in determining how nitrogen oxides species are chemically transformed. However, the exact role of protein-encapsulated iron in directing the mechanisms of nitrogen oxides metabolism remains relatively unexplored. This collaborative project will utilize a combination of synthesis, electrochemistry, and computational chemistry as guides for the isolation and characterization of unstable iron nitrogen oxide intermediates along biological reaction pathways, and to allow for a better understanding of the chemical role of iron in enabling the interconversions of biologically relevant nitrogen oxides. The collaborative team combines a Ph.D. environment and a primarily undergraduate environment to provide high-level research training to a diverse group of students.

In this project,  the factors that lead to heme-mediated interconversions of nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide, nitroxyl (HNO), and (alkyl)hydroxylamines (RNHOH) will be studied. The research team will utilize a combination of synthesis, spectro-electrochemistry, and computational chemistry to determine experimental conditions that will allow for the isolation and characterization of unstable intermediates, to help elucidate the mechanisms of (i) the critical N?N bond forming step involved in NO coupling to form the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, and (ii) the N?C bond forming steps in inorganic-NOx to organo-NOx conversions.

Sustaining performance of protective barriers over time within evolving geoenvironments is critical to preserving national water quality and public health. However, variable chemical, temperature, hydraulic, and stress conditions that occur in bentonite in the field have complex, coupled effects on the rate of contaminant transport through the barrier. Until recently, research on these coupled phenomena has primarily focused on overly-simplified conditions that do not represent the real-world dynamics of clay barriers exposed to wastes. This research includes comprehensive experimental and analytical evaluation of coupled contaminant transport properties of bentonite barriers under more realistic conditions. The results will improve prediction and modeling of how contaminants escape through clay barriers over time, supporting design of resilient barrier systems and improved protection of public health and the environment.  The integrated education and research objectives include research experiences for undergraduate students, middle and high school STEM outreach that broadens participation in engineering, and development of an activity library to advance geoenvironmental engineering education. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to advance scientific understanding of how environmental dynamics and coupled phenomena impact long-term resiliency of bentonite-based containment barriers.

Continents are formed and modified by fundamental plate tectonic processes, including volcanism, mountain-building, collisions with other continental masses, and rifting or breakup of supercontinents. Understanding the evolution of continental lithosphere (that is, the crust and uppermost mantle beneath continents) through time remains one of the most important challenges in Earth science. This project will study the processes that have shaped the continental lithosphere beneath the New England Appalachians through geologic time using a multi-disciplinary approach that includes seismic imaging of the crust and upper mantle, the analysis of geological structures, and dating the motion on ancient faults. The investigators will carry out detailed imaging using seismic waves from distant earthquakes measured at seismometers deployed in two linear arrays (one across New York and Massachusetts, the other across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). They will pair their seismic imaging work with studies of geologic structures exposed at the surface that will provide essential context on its plate tectonic history. The integration of information obtained from both approaches will illuminate the processes that have shaped the lithosphere beneath New England through the geologic past, opening a window into how continental lithosphere evolves as a part of the Earth?s plate tectonic system.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand how rifting, subduction, and terrane accretion have shaped lithospheric structure beneath New England: Does the lithosphere preserve a record of subduction and accretion or does lithospheric structure heal over time? How do subsequent accretion events overprint the structure of earlier collisions? How did Mesozoic rifting affect the structure of Paleozoic accretions? Are recent to ongoing mantle processes modifying the lithospheric structure? The investigators will analyze data from the NEST (New England Seismic Transects) experiment, a deployment of ~25 broadband seismometers that is configured to resolve crustal targets on length scales that are appropriate for direct linkage with geological structures. They will apply a suite of imaging techniques (receiver function analysis, body wave travel time analysis, wavefield migration imaging, and SKS splitting measurements) that will provide a comprehensive view of both the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the New England crust and upper mantle, including the region underlain by the so-called Northern Appalachian Anomaly (NAA). The U-Pb geochronology work will focus on the identification and analysis of xenocrystic (inherited) cores in zircon grains from arc plutonic and volcanic rocks from the Shelburne Falls and Bronson Hill arcs, in order to understand the history and timing of Taconic (and later) orogenic processes. The investigators will also conduct field work and structural analyses to investigate the extent and relative timing on frontal thrusts of basement massifs and the Taconic Mountains in western New England and New York, and the Connecticut Valley border fault system in central New England. They will constrain the timing of deformation by collecting and dating samples via 40Ar/39Ar geochronology from these regions, in order to determine how widespread reactivation of old faults (and displacement on new faults) has been throughout the region. The project emphasizes undergraduate involvement in cross-disciplinary research and field work, particularly by participants from groups that have been historically underrepresented in Earth science, enabled by collaboration among faculty at a liberal arts college and research institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a cross-site collaboration, a plan for a longitudinal study focused on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools will be developed. The COVID-19 pandemic gives new urgency to video analysis as large numbers of teacher preparation programs have had to use digital libraries of classroom video cases in lieu of traditional field experiences in schools. In addition, the importance of how teachers are prepared to enact equitable, justice-oriented, culturally responsive, and linguistically sustaining pedagogies in support of the success of K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education cannot be underestimated.  This project builds upon five years of prior work of the seven institutions involved in which the partners discussed, designed, and studied video analysis within science teacher preparation and developed the Framework for Analyzing Video in Science Teacher Education (FAVSTE).<br/><br/>This project involves a collaboration of science teacher educators from partnering universities (the Collaborative) including Vanderbilt University, Texas State University?San Marcos, Teachers College?Columbia University, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, the University of Northern Iowa, Florida International University, and Kennesaw State University who will work with partner high-need school districts. The project has three main intents regarding capacity building intended to situate the Collaborative to be well-positioned to submit a Track 4 Research proposal. One is to continue to analyze and modify the FAVSTE framework and associated tools to ensure that they explicitly support noticing for equity. A second is to identify, modify, and pilot research instruments to analyze teachers? professional vision, its link to equitable science teaching practice, and how this vision changes over time in relation to teacher effectiveness and retention. And the third is to develop a cross-site, longitudinal research study that incorporates practical instructional tools for video analysis and research tools for studying effectiveness and retention of STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Data collection and analysis consistent with a design-based research approach will be used. The work will allow the Collaborative to deepen its theoretical and methodological understanding of how to use video in teacher preparation to support equitable science teaching practice. The project intends to disseminate insights and best practices emanating from this project through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), a partner of the Collaborative, as well as professional organizations including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE). This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce Program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This paradox has puzzled scientists for centuries. While several organisms have been suggested to support life on reefs, when, where, or why they emerge as critical players for coral reefs is largely unknown. This project examines how the characteristics of a coral reef shape its reliance on different organisms to sustain all the large fishes typically associated with reefs. By quantifying fine-scale features of small reef patches, such as their temperature, wave energy, architecture, and small, hidden species assemblages, and combining these findings with a detailed analysis of what large fishes residing on the reef have eaten over time, this research reveals the circumstances under which different coral reef organisms ? from minute algae to corals, plankton, sponges, microscopic invertebrates, or tiny fishes ? take on important roles in feeding larger fishes. Using aerial drone surveys to scale up these fine-scale patterns to the area of an entire reef, the project then provides a whole-reef estimate for the contributions of different organisms to life on a reef. In doing so, the research offers a new opportunity for coral reef stewardship: if the most important organisms for coral reef productivity can be identified reliably from a few features, a much more targeted, context-specific management framework is possible. Finally, the project yields training opportunities for young, emerging reef scientists from coral reef nations, and a plethora of attractive digital coral reef media to engage the general public and increase awareness of the fragility of coral reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>The movement and storage of energy underpins the functioning of all ecosystems on Earth. The extreme diversity and productivity of coral reefs, despite their location in oligotrophic waters, has long generated substantial interest in the role of different organisms for coral reef energy fluxes. Yet, to date, these findings appear to be highly context-specific, and no general understanding exists concerning the environmental, structural, or biological drivers that cause reliance on one or more sources or pathways of productivity on coral reefs. As the first project to combine underwater data loggers, structure-from-motion photogrammetry, biological collections, underwater stereo-video, and compound-specific isotope analyses of amino acids, this research investigates how various interdependent attributes of small reef patches?such as wave exposure, rugosity, and cryptobenthic community structure?affect the relative contributions of different organisms to coral reef energy fluxes. By integrating the resulting relationships with aerial drone surveys and an exploration procedure based on quantitative color pattern analyses, the research then scales up the uncovered patch-dynamics to the area of an entire reef, ultimately revealing the contributions of different sources and pathways to reef fish biomass at the scale of the ecosystem. This reveals the potential pathways that can sustain coral reefs and their environmental and structural drivers. In doing so, the project offers a more general solution to a centuries-old question, while providing a new lens through which coral reefs can be managed in the Anthropocene.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Jin Suntivich and Hctor Abrua of Cornell University are investigating the mechanism of surface hydrogen formation on transition metals with well-defined structure and orientation. Electrochemical and non-linear spectroscopic measurements facilitate the formation of a conceptual framework for proton and electron transfers across the metal-water interface. Drs. Suntivich and Abrua and their students examine the electrode potential-dependent formation of surface hydrogen on metal single crystals because this reaction represents the first step in the evolution/production of hydrogen and involves only one electron and one proton. The team also investigates the influence of local variables such as interfacial electric field and surface chemistry on proton and electron-transfer kinetics. Non-linear spectroscopy is used to provide local electric field information at the metal-water interface. By advancing the mechanistic knowledge of electrochemical reactions, future catalysts that efficiently generate or evolve hydrogen from water could be designed. The team also  translates concepts in electrochemical and optical sciences to outreach activities through the New York Stat 4-H Youth Development program. The team is developing new curricular materials on chemical circularity for first year students at Cornell University.<br/> <br/>This project investigates the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism on well-defined single-crystal metal surfaces such as platinum and palladium. These heterogeneous electrochemical reactions are common in electrocatalysis; however, they are complex because most PCET reactions involve the transfer of multiple protons and electrons. The research team applies a time-dependent electro-analytical method and non-linear spectroscopy to probe surface hydrogen formation, which involves only one proton and one electron. These studies examine the surface hydrogen formation kinetics on single-crystal metal surfaces as a function of proton donor and metal chemistries as well as local electric field and surface oxide. Phase-sensitive second harmonic generation measurements are employed to characterize the local electric field during the electrochemical reaction. These investigations foster a deep understanding of the molecular picture during the heterogeneous PCET electrocatalysis mechanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These methods reveal the motions and interactions of molecules during the course of chemical reactions in a manner that has been previously inaccessible.  Single molecule (SM) methods have had enormous impact describing molecular processes that occur on surfaces and in biological processes, but their application to problems in solution-phase chemistry remains a persistent challenge. This project attempts to overcome earlier limitations by using a new high-sensitivity detection strategy, fluorescence-encoded infrared spectroscopy (FEIR), with the goal of using vibrational spectroscopy to track how chemical bonds and molecular contacts evolve in time for single molecules in solution.  Students working on this project receive training in a cross-disciplinary setting that provides experience on an array of topics including instrument development, optics and spectroscopy, and chemical dynamics. This training in the Tokmakoff group prepares students for leadership roles in scientific research at academic and national labs, or in high-tech companies.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant builds on recent work by Prof. Tokmakoff and his team demonstrating the single-molecule sensitivity of the FEIR approach using photon correlation spectroscopy (CS). The team is now expanding the capabilities of the FEIR technique using new types of chromophores to target a variety of chemical applications. For example, the research team is developing IR vibrational contrast mechanisms for FEIR-CS that use vibrational frequency shifts as reporters of the chemical dynamics for applications such as site-specific bimolecular binding, protonation and deprotonation reactions, and ion transport through electrolytes. Additionally, the team is working to extend FEIR measurements to measure the dynamic information content of single-molecule photon streams that describe bond-specific histories of individual diffusing and reacting molecules. These research efforts are guided by the overarching goal of building a broadly applicable tool to study chemical dynamics and molecular transport processes in liquids, solutions, and other soft materials.

Chemists rely on representations to describe, communicate about, and understand the behavior of particles that are far too small to be seen. Examples of representations include chemical formulas and graphical representations that use lines and symbols to show how atoms are arranged. College students enrolled in organic chemistry courses must learn to interpret and use such representations at the same time they are learning about complex chemical processes. This NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) project will generate new knowledge about how organic chemistry students learn to interpret a variety of representations and use them to solve problems. The project team will use the results of this research to develop and evaluate instructional modules to better support organic chemistry students? learning and problem solving.<br/><br/>This IUSE: EHR project intends to systematically investigate the effects of different molecular representations on students? success in solving organic chemistry problems. The representation types that will be explored include chemical formulae, line angle formulae, ball and stick figures, and electrostatic potential maps. The work will be guided by an Abstraction Framework, the Multimedia Learning Theory on Learning with Textual and Visual Representations, and the Actor-Oriented Transfer Framework to facilitate understanding of how students extract encoded information from each representation, make connections to prior instances, and extrapolate that knowledge for use in new problem contexts. The project team plans to use a mixed method approach across three studies conducted at the University of Northern Colorado and the University of South Florida. First, to identify which representations best facilitate student success in solving a variety of organic chemistry problem types, end-of-semester students will be randomly assigned to one of four problem sets that differ only in the representations provided and the results will be analyzed. Next, student problem-solving sessions using think-aloud protocols will be conducted to generate hypotheses regarding how particular representations facilitate student success. The foci of these analyses will be on how the different representations support student abstraction and transfer from one problem context to another. Finally, the hypotheses generated from these studies will be used to develop and evaluate an instructional intervention that will include the development of instructional materials and online modules. The intervention will be evaluated with respect to its impact on student learning, which will also serve as a measure for the utility of the hypothesized relationships. The materials developed will be disseminated and made freely available to faculty teaching organic chemistry. The research results will be presented at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. To broaden the impact even further, the project team intends to conduct four workshops involving a total of forty faculty members who teach organic chemistry. During the workshops, the team will assist the faculty members in integrating project materials and findings into organic chemistry instruction at their institutions.

A focus of the project will be to prepare educators to teach social justice-oriented science with integrated technology to diverse populations of students. To accomplish this, the project will incorporate four underlying components. (1) Paid internships will be provided for freshmen and sophomore science majors to experience teaching youth science at community-based camps. (2) Two credential pathways for future science teachers will be offered - an Integrated Teacher Education Program (ITEP) for undergraduate science majors and special cohorts in the Credential Program for College of Science graduates. (3) One-year scholarships will be provided to prospective teachers who will complete the science teaching credentials via one of the two pathways. (4) After the prospective teachers graduate, two years of induction support will be provided during their early teaching period in a high-need school. The internships are designed to gain and foster students' interest in teaching science. Monthly workshops that integrate technology and social justice-oriented teaching approaches will be provided to the science-credential scholarship students. Likewise, a special course dedicated to teaching STEM and development of a community of practice will be part of the credentialing curriculum. Induction will include regular workshops with project team members, coaching meetings with the project's dedicated mentor, and continuation of communities of practice. The project will contribute directly to the development of a skilled STEM workforce in the United States.<br/><br/>This project at San Diego State University (SDSU), an Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), includes partnering with San Diego Unified School District, an ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse, high-need school district. As a result, the project represents an authentic, place-based partnership. The project has several goals. First, over five years, the project will recruit a diverse group of twenty-five (25) university freshman and sophomore science majors into paid field experiences to encourage them to consider science teaching as a career. Related to this, a second goal is to recruit a diverse group of forty-one (41) high-achieving students who are majoring in, or have received degrees in, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geosciences, mathematics, or physics in SDSU's College of Sciences to receive a one-year scholarship to complete a credentialing program for K-12 STEM teaching. For a third goal, project leaders will investigate the processes of recruiting, supporting, retaining, and empowering science majors to become STEM teachers who embody a dedication to technology-based and socially-just science teaching. Fourth, the project team will implement and study transitional professional development support for the recipients' first years of teaching. Through research-based learning experiences, this project will develop the recipients? expertise to enact justice-focused science instruction that is rich in technology. Comprehensive project evaluation, using qualitative and quantitative methods, will provide both formative and summative data and feedback. Proactive and robust dissemination of project outcomes and lessons learned from the SDSU model will have multiple branches. A project website, which will include announcements of events, updated project findings, and a repository of teacher education resources created by and for the project, will be maintained by SDSU's Center for Research in Mathematics and Science Education.

Stochastic spatial models are important for applications, so it is important to develop methods to understand their qualitative behavior. For many systems like the contact process, which is a simple model of the spread and competition of species, the nontrivial stationary distribution is unique and its density is a continuous function of its parameters. The research carried out in this project will investigate some systems that are exceptions to this rule. The PI's work on nonlinear voter models seeks to produce examples that can be rigorously shown to have two nontrivial translation invariant equilibrium states. The PI has recently shown that a susceptible-infected epidemics in which individuals drop connections to infected individuals can have a discontinuous phase transition. One of the goals is to extend this to the more realistic SIR model. In the other direction there is a process called explosive percolation that was conjectured in 2009 based on simulation to have a discontinuous transition, but one year later a rigorous mathematical proof showed that this system and a number of similar systems have continuous phase transitions. One of the goals of this project will seek to prove qualitative results about the phase transition in the explosive percolation model. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Work will be carried out on four challenging and long-studied problems in probability. For brevity only three are mentioned here: (i) Explosive percolation occurs on a dynamically grown random graph in which m potential new edges are chosen on each step but only is chosen to be added. Achlioptas, D?Souza and Spencer claimed in 2009 that these models could have discontinuous transitions, but one year later Riordan and Warnke showed that for a broad class of rules the transition is continuous. One of the goals of this project is to extend their results to other systems and to obtain more detailed information about the phase transition. (ii) In many cases the existence of stationary distributions for a stochastic spatial model has been proved by showing that the particle systems converge to reaction diffusion equations with positive wave speed. Recently Huang and Durrett have shown that several particle systems that converge to reaction-diffusion equations with zero wave speeds converge to motion by mean curvature as time is further sped-up. This opens up the possibility of proving the existence of discontinuous phase transitions. (iii) Durrett and Yao have recently given an almost necessary and sufficient condition for a discontinuous phase transition in the SI model on an evolving configuration model graph. One of the aims of this project is to extend this result to more realistic SIR and SIS epidemics. The latter question is a long standing open problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the investigators plan to create a unified and systematic framework for variational inference methods, making two key contributions. First, the investigators will establish the theoretical foundations for the proposed framework, which will support and justify using existing and new variational inference algorithms in machine learning applications. Second, the investigators will provide a systemic procedure to create new variational inference algorithms and apply them to emerging machine learning problems. In addition to these new scientific developments, the investigators will create new courses and workshops on machine learning, recruit both undergraduate and graduate students for summer, project-based research programs, and provide mentorship to local high school students through hands-on machine learning training programs. Collaborations are planned with industrial data science partners to apply these new algorithms in practice and to train the workforce with the start-of-the-art machine learning tools.<br/><br/>The proposed ""Energetic Variational Inference"" framework is based on an energetic variational approach, which has been successfully used to study complicated non-equilibrium systems in physics and biology.  The investigators will provide a blueprint for generating new algorithms by introducing various options for the four essential components of the proposed framework: the divergence functional, the dissipation functional, the representation of the probability density, and the temporal discretization. The investigators will study convergence in the continuous formulation as well as estimate the error bounds after temporal discretization of the underlying continuous dynamic system. More importantly, these theoretical results can be applied or extended to other flow-based variational inference approaches.

This paradox has puzzled scientists for centuries. While several organisms have been suggested to support life on reefs, when, where, or why they emerge as critical players for coral reefs is largely unknown. This project examines how the characteristics of a coral reef shape its reliance on different organisms to sustain all the large fishes typically associated with reefs. By quantifying fine-scale features of small reef patches, such as their temperature, wave energy, architecture, and small, hidden species assemblages, and combining these findings with a detailed analysis of what large fishes residing on the reef have eaten over time, this research reveals the circumstances under which different coral reef organisms ? from minute algae to corals, plankton, sponges, microscopic invertebrates, or tiny fishes ? take on important roles in feeding larger fishes. Using aerial drone surveys to scale up these fine-scale patterns to the area of an entire reef, the project then provides a whole-reef estimate for the contributions of different organisms to life on a reef. In doing so, the research offers a new opportunity for coral reef stewardship: if the most important organisms for coral reef productivity can be identified reliably from a few features, a much more targeted, context-specific management framework is possible. Finally, the project yields training opportunities for young, emerging reef scientists from coral reef nations, and a plethora of attractive digital coral reef media to engage the general public and increase awareness of the fragility of coral reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>The movement and storage of energy underpins the functioning of all ecosystems on Earth. The extreme diversity and productivity of coral reefs, despite their location in oligotrophic waters, has long generated substantial interest in the role of different organisms for coral reef energy fluxes. Yet, to date, these findings appear to be highly context-specific, and no general understanding exists concerning the environmental, structural, or biological drivers that cause reliance on one or more sources or pathways of productivity on coral reefs. As the first project to combine underwater data loggers, structure-from-motion photogrammetry, biological collections, underwater stereo-video, and compound-specific isotope analyses of amino acids, this research investigates how various interdependent attributes of small reef patches?such as wave exposure, rugosity, and cryptobenthic community structure?affect the relative contributions of different organisms to coral reef energy fluxes. By integrating the resulting relationships with aerial drone surveys and an exploration procedure based on quantitative color pattern analyses, the research then scales up the uncovered patch-dynamics to the area of an entire reef, ultimately revealing the contributions of different sources and pathways to reef fish biomass at the scale of the ecosystem. This reveals the potential pathways that can sustain coral reefs and their environmental and structural drivers. In doing so, the project offers a more general solution to a centuries-old question, while providing a new lens through which coral reefs can be managed in the Anthropocene.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In combinatorial representation theory we seek to make algebraic objects more accessible by relating abstract algebraic objects to combinatorial objects such as graphs and matrices.  The combinatorial objects are often easier to understand and more importantly they lead to more efficient computation.  In this proposal we are interested in using combinatorial objects to understand products of representations.  One product investigated in this proposal is the tensor product of representations of symmetry groups.  The goal is to devise an algorithm that uses combinatorial objects to understand the decomposition of this product into simpler representations.  The decomposition of tensor products is an important problem that has applications to a plethora of fields such as algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, physics, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication. Essentially, it is the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals. <br/><br/>There are three longstanding unsolved problems in combinatorial representation theory that seek to decompose representations into irreducible representations.  These include the Kronecker problem, the Plethysm problem and the Restriction problem.  These problems are interrelated and making progress in the understanding of any will lead to breakthroughs on the others. Zabrocki and the PI introduced a new basis of symmetric functions that arose from connections to the partition algebra and led to the introduction of new combinatorial objects in the study of the Kronecker problem.  This new basis of symmetric functions has provided a better understanding of the connection between the three open problems and the combinatorial objects introduced have made the problems more accessible.  In this proposal the PI and collaborators, including graduate students, will continue to develop algorithms using diagram algebras and symmetric functions that we hope will lead to advances in the understanding of the Kronecker problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the value of connecting students? life experiences with their mathematical learning, the practical implementation of this strategy has proven challenging in a classroom setting. EIM2 addresses this issue by supporting students to engage in equitable mathematical modeling, a process of using mathematics to analyze and quantify scenarios through a lens of equity. The EIM2 program involves collaborations with sixth and seventh grade students, a professional learning community series with their mathematics teachers, and the creation of the dynamic, online platform that hosts EIM2 modules. The EIM2 dynamic online platform allows students to easily select scenarios based on their interests; experience the scenarios with visuals and animations; and compare, synthesize, and refine their mathematical ideas.<br/><br/>The program development will be guided by design principles and hypothesized learning processes that support students? cultural competence, their evaluations of multiple mathematical solutions, and their mathematical identity development. Using multi-tier design-based research and a mixed-methods approach, the EIM2 program will be continuously evaluated and refined through multiple iterations to ensure usability and efficacy. Over the four-year project span, this project will (1) explore the nature and impact of the EIM2 program, assessing how it promotes a shared vision for the learning of all students, including racially and ethnically minoritized students, in classroom settings; (2) examine whether and how students? engagement in EIM2 supports their achievement and identity development in mathematics; and (3) understand how teachers enact EIM2 and whether they change their attitudes toward modeling over time and across contexts. The proposed project fills a theoretical gap related to scalable design models for interactive mathematical modeling curricula that are culturally sustaining for students. Our model improves upon current practices of mathematical modeling by transforming existing curricula to reflect students? lived experiences and to foster their active learning, leveraging the interactive nature of digital curricula. Our proposed work has the potential to be transformative for STEM education through the co-creation of asset-based instructional materials built on a deep understanding of students, which can be applicable for other STEM education fields of study.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Traditionally, a batteryless sensor is implemented as a passive resonator whose resonance frequency is responsive to physiological variation. When the embedded sensor is sufficiently close to the body surface, its resonance frequency can be directly estimated from radio frequency signals backscattered from the sensor. However, when the penetration depth is much larger than the passive sensor?s own dimension, backscattered signals can be too small to detect. In addition, a passive sensor has limited temporal resolution because repetitive averaging of backscattered signals is required to achieve a reasonable measurement accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this CAREER project will develop a generally applicable circuit that can significantly improve the remote detectability and temporal resolution of batteryless sensors. Using a very compact circuit design, this Self-oscillation Encoding Telemeter (SET) can utilize wireless power to self-oscillate and encode input signals over a wide frequency range. When the SET is utilized to simultaneously encode neuronal voltages and magnetic resonance images (MRI), it can provide correlated information between electrophysiology and imaging, revealing novel insights into the neuronal origin of MRI signal dynamics. Besides its immediate impact on neuroscience research, the SET can improve the sensing capability for many other types of input signals including pH, pressure, humidity, temperature, and strain. Owing to its novel concept, concise design, and broad impacts, the SET sensor will be used as an excellent vehicle to inspire scientific interest of K-12 students, and to educate STEM students (including those from underrepresented groups). It will also serve the national interest with potential transformation of this wireless sensing technology into many advanced sensor systems.<br/><br/>To significantly improve the remote detectability of batteryless sensors, Self-oscillation Encoding Telemeters (SETs) will be developed to encode various types of input signals over a wide frequency range. This project features three novel methods to retrieve multiplexed input signals. (1) When input signals with distinct frequency characteristics are encoded by the same SET sensor, they can be resolved by their different separations from the carrier wave. (2) When multiple SETs are concatenated into an array, each sensor will be wirelessly activated to have a unique oscillation frequency, so that input signals encoded by individual SETs can be identified by their sideband patterns. (3) When input signals of similar frequency characteristics are encoded by the same SET, they can be consecutively encoded by cyclically switching the pumping frequency at a faster speed, enabling selective activation of each encoding mode. These three novel methods will be implemented towards four research goals. Based on the sideband separation technique described in method #1, aim 1 will decode electrophysiology (slow) and MRI (fast) signals that are simultaneously encoded and broadcasted by the SET sensor. Based on the frequency-division multiplexing concept described in method #2, aim 2 will develop a planar SETs array and signal processing algorithms to retrieve encoded images from individual sensors, enabling high-resolution mapping of micro vessel distribution along the brain surface. Meanwhile, aim 3 will develop an insertion catheter aligned with a linear SETs array, revealing the underlying correlation between MRI and neuronal signals across multiple brain layers. Utilizing the time-division multiplexing concept described in method #3, aim 4 will consecutively encode multiple quasistatic sensing signals while continuously encoding high-frequency imaging signals at the same time. Collectively, advances from these endeavors will make the batteryless sensors useful for a range of applications from biomedicine to structural monitoring and environmental sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upper-limb prostheses are artificial limbs used to replace someone?s natural limb after limb amputation. These limbs are often motorized, featuring hands and fingers that move much like our natural hands and fingers. Unfortunately, these devices do not provide the wearer with haptic (touch-based) information. Haptic information is essential for many tasks, such as picking up an egg without cracking it, closing a resealable bag, or drinking from a plastic cup. This award supports fundamental research needed to develop a new type of prosthesis that intelligently interacts with the world like our natural limbs and provides wearers with haptic information of those interactions. This new prosthesis will interpret the wearers? task intent and assist the wearer in accomplishing tasks with minimal mental effort. Improving the usability of prostheses will ultimately lead to a better quality of life for individuals experiencing limb loss, including military veterans. Likewise, the knowledge gained through this research will prove beneficial to other types of assistive devices, allowing more individuals to return to the workforce after injury. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the US economy and society. This research involves several disciplines, including mechanical design, electronics, control theory, biomedicine, and robotics. Through this interdisciplinary approach, the research will broaden participation amongst the engineers, scientists, and physicians developing assistive technologies and those in society who directly or indirectly benefit from these technologies.<br/><br/>Dexterous manipulation with our upper-limbs originates from a hierarchical control scheme in which task intent is converted to operational motor actions in the peripheral limbs that appropriately tune the limb?s mechanical impedance to accomplish the task goals, all while haptic feedback from the limb is used to track task progress and refine the motor plan. Achieving comparable dexterous control capabilities with an upper-limb prosthesis requires a robust understanding of the appropriate means by which this hierarchical control scheme can be extended out through the prosthesis to the environment. This research seeks to fill this knowledge gap through investigations into intelligent control that will enable an amputee to perform dexterous tasks considered infeasible with current prosthesis technology. The research team will utilize data-driven approaches to model task intent from physiological and environmental interaction measures and derive and empirically validate impedance control and haptic feedback strategies that adapt to the amputee?s intent and the context of the task being performed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exams are dependable and convenient assessment tools for educators, however, they can cause student anxiety. Exams are often one-shot events resulting in no incentive for students to correct any learning deficiencies. Timely feedback on student exam answers can help students identify knowledge gaps. This project will develop and assess a two-stage exam process for an introductory computer programming course. Students will take a multiple choice exam in which they will provide a justification for each selected answer. For students who have significant knowledge gaps, an interview will follow, providing a second opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding. After the interview, a plan of action will be provided for each student to help them achieve the learning outcomes. It is expected that the project will help improve student learning outcomes in a foundational computer science course, which will help prepare students for professional practice in the computing workforce.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: (1) improve student learning outcomes, (2) reduce test anxiety, and (3) support academic integrity. This project builds on previous work on two-stage exams in the physics education community. In the first stage, an improved multiple-choice assessment will be used to identify student knowledge gaps. The second stage consists of a one-on-one interview which will focus on questions related to the knowledge gaps identified in the first stage. Instructors will then develop a plan of study that will be personalized for each student. Research questions include: (1) What additional insights will the improved multiple-choice exam provide over a standard multiple-choice exam? 2) To what extent does the interview stage help to improve students? learning outcomes? To answer these questions, test results will be compared using traditional versus the improved multiple choice exam. Student learning gains will be assessed with and without the interview stage. The results of the proposed project will be disseminated at computer science education conferences and one computing education community site organized by Association for Computing Machinery education board.

Heat is a particular problem for those who live in cities, which are typically hotter than non-urban areas, largely due to the role of the built environment in retaining heat. Exposure to heat can contribute to a range of health issues and can even lead to death. This project aims to contribute an understanding of how the ordinary experience of heat might be translated into expert conversations about urban climate that in turn contribute to shaping policies about how we live in cities. The project also has a significant educational component that involves establishing a pipeline to train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, scholars, and policy makers. This educational component includes developing climate-focused curricular enrichment modules for school-age children and an undergraduate Heat Lab through which students will learn to conduct interdisciplinary research. The data generated through this research will be shared to inform and advance policy related to urban heat mitigation and adaptation.<br/><br/>With the support of a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, the researcher will undertake a five-year study of the relationship between urban heat, bodies, and the built environment. Many generalized measures of heat response in urban environments suffer from sampling biases that make them less equipped to explain variability across different urban contexts. This project focuses on how experiences of heat are potentially shaped by the interaction of history, culture, and the built environment. It employs a mixed-methods approach, including ethnography, oral histories, archival research, and GIS-based mapping. The layering of these multiple forms of data will offer a more robust understanding of how the experience of urban heat is shaped by both environmental and cultural factors, as well as provide a more experience-near perspective on these factors that shape the distribution of thermal exposure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly one in three birds in the Neotropics is from a group called the suboscine passerines. The suboscines are diverse in form and function and are an important component of the bird life in habitats ranging from tropical rainforests to alpine grasslands and rocky coastlines. The origins of this diversity ? the tempo and mode of species formation ? have been studied through prior NSF-funded work. However, this work did not contain sufficient sampling to capture the most recent and ongoing speciation events. These recent speciation events are the most critical for evolutionary research because they tell us about where and why new species are forming currently. High-resolution sampling also provides the information necessary to identify new species and revise species classification. In this project, the investigators are completely sampling suboscine diversity, obtaining new vouchered samples and adding genomic data from 1,548 missing populations in order to resolve the species limits in the group and provide a comprehensive framework for research on diversification. This work integrates a concerted program for recruiting and retaining underrepresented students in biodiversity science in three underserved geographic areas: Appalachian Tennessee, Louisiana, and majority Hispanic communities in west Texas. It involves a new program on avian diversity at the K?12 level, development of a dedicated module on biodiversity genetics for undergraduate Genetics students, and support for graduate and post-graduate researchers to conduct research. <br/><br/>The unifying principle of this project is that a completely sampled phylogeny of all suboscine evolutionary units is needed to provide the foundation for systematic revision as well as improved capacity for research on speciation and evolution in the group. The researchers are leveraging the well-sampled suboscine passerine radiation (1,323 currently recognized species, plus 1,875 subspecies) to complete two primary aims. First, they are using field work, existing genomic resources, and historical DNA approaches to obtain genomic data from all 1,548 unsampled taxa, including all subspecies, in the group and estimate a complete, time-calibrated phylogeny. Second, they are using this phylogeny to conduct a re-assessment and revision of suboscine systematics at the genus, species, and subspecies levels within a hypothesis-testing framework. Because the phylogeny contains information on all lineage divergences in suboscines even those between the youngest taxa, it provides an invaluable resource for researchers interested in detailed diversification dynamics, modes of speciation, avian evolution at a range of timescales, molecular evolution, and species concepts and delimitation. The new specimens, genetic samples, and genomic data being obtained are also invaluable. Together, this work and its results are providing a high-resolution picture of how diversity has evolved in a species-rich tropical group that contributes to one of the major biodiversity hotspots on the planet.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, it plays an important role in carbon storage and climate change. The components of dissolved organic matter are the remains of biological products. As a result, the chemical make-up of dissolved organic matter (DOM) can provide important clues about the processes affecting this carbon pool. By learning more about the chemical structures and reactions that produce DOM, connections can be made to biological and biochemical processes and their importance. This project will study the distribution, production, and removal of one important class of molecules called carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). These molecules are abundant in marine DOM and play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle. They also affect the supply of the micronutrient iron, and thus have an important influence on primary production and ocean food webs. The research includes field and laboratory experiments and takes advantage of ocean locations with long-term data. Together, the lead scientists will provide training and resources for the graduate students, undergraduate research opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, and direct outreach to the public through a website, articles in local newspapers, and talks at public venues. <br/><br/>CRAM make-up 8 to 25% of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and represent a carbon reservoir of >65 Pg C that is equivalent to at least 8% of the atmospheric CO2 pool.  CRAM play a central role in the functioning of the microbial carbon pump, a conceptual framework for producing refractory carbon by microbial processes in the ocean. Further, CRAM act as an important ligand of Fe(III) in the ocean, thereby playing an important role in regulating marine primary production.  The main project objectives are: (1) measure the variable distribution of CRAM in the ocean, and (2) determine the dominant mechanisms of CRAM production and removal. The project will leverage an extensive set of already collected samples across the world?s oceans and new field work within the framework of the Bermuda Atlantic and Hawaii Ocean Time Series. Field measurements will be combined with experimental approaches to specifically address microbial and photochemical reactions leading to CRAM production and removal. This research will fill important gaps in resolving the key questions about organic carbon cycling in the ocean and explore the role of DOM in mediating the cycles of iron and other trace elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the photochemistry following UV absorption constitutes a fundamental step in radiation-induced DNA damage. UV photo-selection may have played a key role in prebiotic chemistry on an early earth. These same processes also find applications in a variety of modern materials. These topics, in combination with cutting-edge laser and computational techniques, lend themselves to outreach activities that will be based on this work.

This requires hundreds of trillions of kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, mainly generated through wind and solar power. One neglected but crucial question is whether extracting such huge amount of energy from the atmosphere's surface layer would alter the atmosphere's physics, leading to new climate change challenges. This CAREER project will focus on addressing whether large-scale solar photovoltaic plants alter the local climate. The research will parameterize the atmospheric response carried out by transport processes to facilitate the inclusion of solar plants in climate models. This project will pave the way for undergraduate and graduate students in middle Tennessee to become engaged in climate change education and discussion. The results of this research will enable a new ""Atmospheric Transport"" course at Tennessee Technological University, a textbook titled Atmospheric Transport to increase scientific literacy, and an educational mobile app ATMOSPort.<br/><br/>This project seeks to study the interactions between the near-ground atmosphere and an artificial canopy of millions of solar photovoltaic panels. A two-stage field campaign and computational fluid dynamics simulations are proposed to provide an understanding of thermal transport dynamics within the atmospheric boundary layer above thousands of acres of dark, hot, tall, and rough Photovoltaic panels of utility-scale solar plants. The knowledge gained will clarify whether such giant canopies alter the local climate and will lead to the creation of equations that accurately describe the affected atmospheric characteristics. The proposed research quantifies the significance of these impacts for various background surface conditions and parameterizes the thermal and mechanical effects of the plant to allow meteorologists and environmental engineers to incorporate them into their models efficiently.

This is of central interest in probabilistic combinatorics, and the study of random discrete structures is also closely related to several other disciplines, including statistical physics and theoretical computer science. This area has gone through major progress in recent years, and the PI has been working towards a deeper understanding and further development of the new tools and techniques. The project also includes classical enumeration problems on several discrete structures that are closely related to computer science. Studying these problems has been developing lots of interesting and beautiful techniques that cut across mathematical boundaries. <br/><br/>The project focuses on problems roughly relating to two topics. The first topic is the threshold phenomena of random discrete structures. A big goal here is to prove the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture, which concerns relationships between thresholds and expectation thresholds in random graphs and related systems. Other problems are mostly open questions about thresholds for increasing properties. In attacking these problems, the PI has been aiming to test the strength and limitations of the methods in the resolution of a conjecture of Talagrand, a fractional version of the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture. The second topic is asymptotic enumeration problems on the Hamming cube (and related structures), and related isoperimetric questions on the cube which are now of independent interest. Various tools (such as the graph container method, its combination with polymer models and cluster expansion method, stability for isoperimetric properties of the cube) are expected to be exploited and improved to solve the problems here.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a cross-site collaboration, a plan for a longitudinal study focused on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools will be developed. The COVID-19 pandemic gives new urgency to video analysis as large numbers of teacher preparation programs have had to use digital libraries of classroom video cases in lieu of traditional field experiences in schools. In addition, the importance of how teachers are prepared to enact equitable, justice-oriented, culturally responsive, and linguistically sustaining pedagogies in support of the success of K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education cannot be underestimated.  This project builds upon five years of prior work of the seven institutions involved in which the partners discussed, designed, and studied video analysis within science teacher preparation and developed the Framework for Analyzing Video in Science Teacher Education (FAVSTE).<br/><br/>This project involves a collaboration of science teacher educators from partnering universities (the Collaborative) including Vanderbilt University, Texas State University?San Marcos, Teachers College?Columbia University, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, the University of Northern Iowa, Florida International University, and Kennesaw State University who will work with partner high-need school districts. The project has three main intents regarding capacity building intended to situate the Collaborative to be well-positioned to submit a Track 4 Research proposal. One is to continue to analyze and modify the FAVSTE framework and associated tools to ensure that they explicitly support noticing for equity. A second is to identify, modify, and pilot research instruments to analyze teachers? professional vision, its link to equitable science teaching practice, and how this vision changes over time in relation to teacher effectiveness and retention. And the third is to develop a cross-site, longitudinal research study that incorporates practical instructional tools for video analysis and research tools for studying effectiveness and retention of STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Data collection and analysis consistent with a design-based research approach will be used. The work will allow the Collaborative to deepen its theoretical and methodological understanding of how to use video in teacher preparation to support equitable science teaching practice. The project intends to disseminate insights and best practices emanating from this project through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), a partner of the Collaborative, as well as professional organizations including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE). This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce Program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Effective thermal management technologies are essential to cool these devices to a safe temperature to sustain their high performance. Thin film evaporation, based on continuous evaporation of very thin films of liquid coolant, is a promising cooling strategy due to its simple design, high cooling capacity, and high stability. By incorporating micro/nano-structures such as micro-pillars and nano-pores, the cooling capacity of thin film evaporation has been significantly improved in recent years but is still much lower than theory predictions, due to the lack of fundamental understanding, especially the detailed flow and thermal characteristics at microscopic and nanoscopic scales. This CAREER project seeks to study fluid flow and thermal transport processes at evaporating interfaces by accurately measuring the flow speed, film shape and temperature within thin coolant films that are typically a few micrometers thick. The knowledge gained will be integrated into educational and outreach activities by establishing a thermal-fluid instructional laboratory at Montana State University and creating educational materials targeting the general public and school children.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of this project is to advance the fundamental understanding of the flow, thermal transport, and contact line dynamics at evaporating interfaces via quantifying 3D velocity fields, interface temperature, and interface profile, enabled by innovative experiments and modeling efforts. Specifically, the project team will (i) employ combined astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry, fluorescence thermometry and interference microscopy to perform measurements on micro-structured surfaces, (ii) quantify film temperature and meniscus dynamics within nanopores using nanoscale quantum dot thermometers and environmental scanning electron microscopy, and (iii) develop a microscale model for thin film evaporation on micro-structured surfaces with improved accuracy by incorporating Marangoni flows. The research will characterize the wicking dynamics, liquid-vapor interface temperature, curvature and meniscus dynamics of thin evaporating films with high spatial and temporal resolutions, which will allow precise determination of the accommodation coefficient and the quantification of Marangoni effects, thus filling in current knowledge gaps and informing the next generation of predictive tools.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the population of farmers ages and a larger proportion of farmers switch to farming part-time, agriculture has emerged as the one of the top industries aiming to increase the skilled workforce in the Miami Valley region. Over its 3-year duration, the Preparing the Agricultural Workforce in Southwest Ohio project will expand and enhance Sinclair Community College?s Agricultural Sciences (AGR) degree program to build capacity and provide agricultural training that meets the workforce needs of both urban and rural communities. To accomplish this, Sinclair Community College will offer five additional program tracks within the agricultural sciences program and create learning environments that are conducive to hands-on and experiential learning. Extensive outreach efforts to K-12 students, teachers, formally incarcerated individuals and incumbent workers will expand pathways aimed at training the next generation of the agricultural workforce in the region. In alignment with the mission of the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, these new resources will supplement existing high-quality training offered at Sinclair to enrich student interest and skills in agriculture technology and enhance career pathways for incumbent workers. This work seeks to diversify the agricultural workforce and address larger societal challenges such as urban food deserts and helping formerly incarcerated individuals obtain stable and well-paying employment.<br/><br/>The overall project goal will be to increase capacity of educational providers to meet agricultural workforce demands in Southwest Ohio. Five new short-term agriculture certificate tracks embedded within the associate degree program will be developed and implemented to support this goal. The five new certificate tracks (Greenhouse Management, Urban Agriculture, Agronomy, Large Animal Care & Husbandry, and Food Science) create a stackable credential model that will provide incremental preparation steps for students and adults with entry-level backgrounds in these areas. This model will also provide connections to entry-level jobs, pathways to further education, short-term solutions for those needing to earn a credential to enter the job market quickly, and ultimately lead to economic stability and mobility. To grow and diversify the future agricultural workforce in the region, the project team will create pathways and conduct outreach activities that target K-12 students and teachers, formerly incarcerated individuals, and incumbent workers. It is expected that project outcomes will lead to increased access to high quality educational programming and hands-on training to prepare students for in-demand occupations across the state. Ultimately, this project will improve student learning and increase Sinclair?s capacity to meet regional workforce needs. The community of educators in agriculture education, along with the broader technician education community, will receive implementation information on the curriculum created. The broad reach of the dissemination plan will allow for replication and adaptation at other colleges and K-12 dual-enrollment institutions across the country seeking to enhance agricultural science pathways. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many classic games of skill, players move alternately. In random-turn games, however, the players bid to win the right to move and must budget resources in their efforts to win the game. Analyzing such stake-governed random-turn games is a matter of understanding how a precious resource should be budgeted in the long-term in order to maintain strategic advantage; seeking a solution to how to play the game involves capturing the balance needed between the short-term territorial gain of spending big and the long-term cost in diminished capability that arises from such profligacy. Stake-governed random-turn games lie at the intersection of probability and geometry and are one of several directions that the Principal Investigator (PI) will explore in this project. Indeed, techniques from probability and geometry will be also used to address several important physical problems, including how trapping by obstacles impedes a linearly progressing particle, or how random fractals formed as a result of growth in a disordered random environment are sensitive to perturbation of that environment by random disorder. By dissemination, mentorship and collaboration, the PI  will seek to ensure that the research enhances the mathematical experience and trajectory of junior researchers including graduate students via joint research to develop fundamental tools,  and high-school students via coding projects.<br/><br/>The PI will develop robust geometric and probabilistic tools in order to elucidate several problems in the rigorous theory of statistical mechanics and in game theory on graphs.  The mechanism of trapping of a biased motion in the supercritical infinite open cluster in the Euclidean lattice will be studied. This work will harness basic tools involving resampling and surgical techniques in the Ornstein-Zernike theory of subcritical lattice models that will be developed under this grant.  The fractal structure of scaled universal objects in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class of models of growth in random media will be studied; as will  the sensitivity to noise of scaled KPZ structures. For the latter purpose, tools in discrete harmonic analysis, such as the spectral sample, which have been applied to solve problems in dynamics on critical percolation, will be redeveloped for last passage percolation models.

While the principles of mutant evolution in homogeneous populations are well-understood and are commonly part of textbooks, they do not directly apply to any realistic population with a spatial, hierarchical structure (such as stem cells that maintain the tissue and more differentiated cells that perform tissue function). These features are, however, a common theme of cell dynamics in tissues of higher organisms, as well as microbial populations such as biofilm forming bacteria, which are also characterized by both spatial and hierarchical structure (cell sub-populations with different specializations). This research project will extend fundamental laws of evolution to be applicable across a much greater variety of biological systems. The mathematical theory will be applied to experimental data that follow the evolution of cells in a mouse model of Rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a pediatric cancer. Finally, the project will develop a new mentoring program that facilitates interactions between students and professors, geared especially towards underrepresented students.<br/><br/>A large mathematical literature exists about mutant spread and invasion, focusing on measures such as the mutant fixation probability or the time to mutant fixation in constant populations, as well as mutant load in growing populations. Scaling laws of evolutionary dynamics have been derived, including the equilibrium population density in spatial models, the rate of stochastic tunneling (double-mutant generation from a minority of single mutants), and the mutant content in expanding colonies. In various biological scenarios, however, cells and organisms evolve in more complex settings than those traditionally considered by evolutionary theory. Of particular importance are spatially structured, hierarchically organized cell populations that are regulated by signaling mechanisms. Examples include tissues consisting of stem and more differentiated cells, solid tumors, and biofilms containing bacterial cells with specialized functions. A comprehensive evolutionary theory for such population structures currently does not exist. This project seeks to mathematically define evolutionary scaling laws for spatially structured populations that are hierarchically organized and contain regulatory feedback loops that control cell fate decisions.  This will be done by (a) developing efficient numerical methods that describe spatially expanding, evolving populations, and (b) deriving laws of spatial population dynamics, including rates of fitness valley crossing and scaling laws for the mutant load for different mutant types. The evolutionary theory will be applied to data on cellular evolution in Rhabdomyosarcoma mouse xenografts, which are characterized by both spatial and hierarchical structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each nose will smell only one kind of chemical. The chemicals could be anything that natural noses can detect, e.g., dynamite, drugs, viruses, toxic chemicals, etc.  Receptors from biological noses will be attached to tiny electrical sensors. This technique lays the groundwork for developing high precision chemical detection in general, which can be utilized in a variety of applications requiring high precision process control (i.e., advanced manufacturing.)  Since the sensor is electronic, it could be integrated into a massively parallel electronic nose system with signal recognition based on hundreds of different sensors onto one chip.   An educational outreach program to share the technology with K-12 will be implemented. This outreach program is designed to reach K-12 educationally disadvantaged students from local neighborhoods with predominantly ethnic-minority student populations. <br/><br/>The end goal of this project is an engineered electronic nose with specificity towards analytes that differ by as little as one carbon atom and with the sensitivity of a living system able to electrically register a single molecule of analyte. The analyte could be anything that natural noses can detect, e.g., TNT, cocaine, aromatics, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) etc. The strategy proposed is to genetically engineer a fused olfactory odorant receptor (OR, a membrane bound protein with exquisite selectivity) to an ion channel protein, which opens in response to binding of the ligand to the OR. The lipid bilayer supporting the fused sensing protein would be intimately attached to a nanowire or nanotube network (either via a covalent tether or a non-covalent physisorption process), which would electrically detect the opening of the ion channel, and hence the binding of a single ligand to a single OR protein domain.  In summary, the project?s goal will be achieved by the combination of these three technological advances (fused OR + ion channel protein, nanowire sensing of single ion channel activity, and lipid bilayer to nanotube tethering chemistry) with  the results of millions of years of evolution of OR proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a cross-site collaboration, a plan for a longitudinal study focused on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools will be developed. The COVID-19 pandemic gives new urgency to video analysis as large numbers of teacher preparation programs have had to use digital libraries of classroom video cases in lieu of traditional field experiences in schools. In addition, the importance of how teachers are prepared to enact equitable, justice-oriented, culturally responsive, and linguistically sustaining pedagogies in support of the success of K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education cannot be underestimated.  This project builds upon five years of prior work of the seven institutions involved in which the partners discussed, designed, and studied video analysis within science teacher preparation and developed the Framework for Analyzing Video in Science Teacher Education (FAVSTE).<br/><br/>This project involves a collaboration of science teacher educators from partnering universities (the Collaborative) including Vanderbilt University, Texas State University?San Marcos, Teachers College?Columbia University, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, the University of Northern Iowa, Florida International University, and Kennesaw State University who will work with partner high-need school districts. The project has three main intents regarding capacity building intended to situate the Collaborative to be well-positioned to submit a Track 4 Research proposal. One is to continue to analyze and modify the FAVSTE framework and associated tools to ensure that they explicitly support noticing for equity. A second is to identify, modify, and pilot research instruments to analyze teachers? professional vision, its link to equitable science teaching practice, and how this vision changes over time in relation to teacher effectiveness and retention. And the third is to develop a cross-site, longitudinal research study that incorporates practical instructional tools for video analysis and research tools for studying effectiveness and retention of STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Data collection and analysis consistent with a design-based research approach will be used. The work will allow the Collaborative to deepen its theoretical and methodological understanding of how to use video in teacher preparation to support equitable science teaching practice. The project intends to disseminate insights and best practices emanating from this project through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), a partner of the Collaborative, as well as professional organizations including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE). This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce Program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

They have remained largely unchanged morphologically over their 300 million year history, and are thus considered ?living fossils?.  Velvet worms are therefore an ideal model to investigate how animals successfully colonize different environments and locations over long periods of geological time in the absence of any significant morphological change. Because velvet worms are rare and mainly inhabit remote forests, they are relatively poorly studied. This research will focus on the least-understood group of velvet worms, the Neotropical Peripatidae. The researchers will document and describe all newly discovered species, assess their conservation status, and analyze the evolutionary processes affecting species diversity and distribution through geological time.  The research team and several trainees will combine cutting-edge molecular approaches with modern anatomical methods to advance our knowledge of the diversity and evolutionary history of this under-studied group. A 100-square-foot exhibit will be developed for the Harvard Museum of Natural History to explore the biodiversity, biogeography, ecology and evolution of velvet worms. The exhibit will also provide the opportunity for associated public programs, including lectures and K-12 activities. <br/><br/>A rigorous estimate of Onychophora species diversity in the Neotropical region will be provided by using high throughput sequence data and by the application of cutting-edge morphological techniques. This research will produce high-quality genomes for onychophorans and a UCE (ultra-conserved elements) probe set targeting about 1,000 genomic loci that will be applied to fresh and museum-preserved specimens. The resulting evolutionary groupings will be used to test hypotheses related to Caribbean biogeography, including specific radiations in Jamaica and Puerto Rico and the colonization of the Lesser Antilles.

However, there are many problem areas where collecting the data is time-consuming (e.g., cells need to grow in lab environments) or expensive (e.g., special materials or expert opinions are required). Ideally, in order to reduce the amount of data needed to reach conclusions, already-collected data can be leveraged to guide the selection of future measurements in a closed-loop manner. While the behavior and benefits of some closed-loop data collection strategies are well understood in simple settings, this family of strategies is not commonly employed in real-world scientific laboratories or in medical trials due to a lack of predictability and accuracy of the outcomes. This project seeks to make foundational contributions to the understanding of closed-loop learning strategies with a view towards designing new data-collection strategies that are both effective and reliable. In practice, this may lead to requiring fewer patients in a clinical trial or to halving the time to identify a disease-curing drug. The investigator also plans to engage with high-school students and machine-learning enthusiasts alike to increase their level of awareness around data collection -- for instance, how even a simple survey, if not carefully designed, can result in privacy violations, demographic under-representation and bias of many forms, all of which may lead to inaccurate conclusions.<br/><br/>For many problems of interest in closed-loop learning, prior art has focused only on minimax optimality, where the sample complexity of the worst-case problem instance is minimized. This approach leads to algorithms that are significantly inferior on ""easy"" or benign instances that may occur in nature but which are far from adversarial. In contrast this project will study the fundamental limits of instance-optimal sample complexity for problems of interactive learning and reinforcement learning in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) setting. The insights to be gained will be applied towards the design of algorithms that automatically adapt to the intrinsic difficulty of the particular problem instance being faced, be it benign or not. The proposed approach is motivated by the observation that the instance-optimal sample complexity decomposes into an asymptotic term, which is by now well characterized, and a moderate-confidence term, which is known to dominate the asymptotic term for all practical purposes. As the properties of the latter term are still poorly understood, lower bounds for it will be constructed together with algorithms that nearly achieve them. Such results will lead to algorithms that greatly reduce the overall instance-optimal sample complexity and vastly improve upon state-of-the-art algorithms that tend to cater to worst-case scenarios. The efforts will initially focus on structured linear bandits and reinforcement learning in the tabular and linear-function approximation settings. While these paradigms are of wide applicability to practice, they also have enough complexity to allow insights to be extrapolated to more generic closed-loop learning paradigms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these economic resources were brought to the surface along large faults which formed in the Late Cretaceous during a mountain building event, termed the Laramide orogeny. A key problem is that the timing and origin of the driving force behind this event and the formation of the Rocky Mountains are highly controversial and there is no consensus on the tectonic setting in which these mountains formed. The investigators hypothesize that the answer to understanding the origin of the Rocky Mountains and the Laramide orogeny lies in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California. This region contains two important features which make it the focus of this study: (1) they preserve a complete temporal history of the Laramide orogeny from the earliest phase until its termination, which is important in reconstructing the driving force behind the event, and (2) they contain a unique section of the deep crust including a major ductile fault system that was active during the beginning of the Laramide orogeny. Analysis of these features will offer critical insights on the beginning of the Laramide orogeny, which will be essential in resolving conflicting hypotheses. The research plan for this project will involve 3 seasons of field work and data collection in the San Gabriel and nearby mountains. Laboratory analyses of rocks collected from the San Gabriel Mountains will consist of geochronology, geochemistry and microstructural work at the California State University Northridge Laser Ablation and LatinXellence in STEM Laboratories. The project will advance societal outcomes through innovative summer workshops, and an academic-year mentoring program termed, LA-ROCS, both of which are aimed at providing research experiences to underrepresented students at minority-serving institutions in southern California. These mentorship and research opportunities for undergraduate students will expose them to cutting-edge analytical research facilities and will aid in developing a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.?<br/><br/>This proposal aims to resolve the controversial beginnings of the Laramide orogeny by testing conflicting hypotheses about the origin and tectonic effects of Laramide orogenesis on the evolution of the Southern California batholith at ca. 85-70 million years ago. This critical period in the development of the U.S. Cordillera is commonly associated with shallow-slab subduction beneath Southern California, which is thought to have driven the transition from thin-skin (Sevier-style) to thick-skin (Laramide-style) deformation. A key problem with the flat-slab model is that the team's preliminary geochronology data show that the initiation of the Laramide orogeny in Southern California is spatially and temporally linked to a magmatic flare-up event in the same region where flat-slab subduction is postulated to have occurred. This contradiction makes the Laramide orogeny distinct from other areas of flat-slab subduction, including the modern-day Sierras Pampeanas in Argentina, which is characterized by a magmatic gap. To resolve this problem, the investigators propose a multiscale approach that focuses on the roots of the Southern California batholith and combines field work with a variety of state-of-the art analytical techniques (Uranium-Lead geochronology, Hafnium- and Osmium-isotope geochemistry, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and microstructural analysis, structural analyses along continuous transects). These data will allow the investigators to link magmatism in the Southern California batholith with deformation and plate-kinematic information at mid-lower crustal depths to resolve conflicting models associated with the flat-slab paradigm and the initiation of the Laramide orogeny.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the performance of existing rapid and portable testing methods is often not sufficient for complex diseases such as infectious diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. The major goal of this CAREER project is to develop a new digital testing platform that offers high detection sensitivity and quantification accuracy without sacrificing the simplicity and the portability. The new testing platform is enabled by the unique fluid phenomenon induced by a vibrating capillary and 3D printed microdevices. Upon the successful completion of this project, integrated devices that can detect low abundance nucleic acid and protein biomarkers without the need of dedicated instrument and laboratory space will be developed. Such devices will have great potential to deliver high quality medical testing to a broad population including underserved communities and resource limited regions. This project is highly multidisciplinary and will produce low cost, and compact instrumentation. It therefore creates unique educational opportunities for students with different backgrounds. The proposal will enable 1) improved learning outcomes for students in quantitative chemical analysis lab through implementing project- and problem-based learning concepts to the curriculum; 2) novel microscale analytical chemistry experiments for undergraduate students, e.g., vibrating sharp-tip powered microfluidic enzymatic assay; 3) a research program that trains students to solve research problems using multidisciplinary approaches.<br/><br/>This project is to develop an integrated solution to perform complete digital bioassays under a point-of-care (POC) setting thereby addressing the unmet need of developing high performance POC tests. The proposed method is enabled by controlling the vibration of sharp tips, which can generate localized and individually addressable acoustic streaming in microchannels for fluid control and droplet generation. To achieve the proposed impact, three aims will be pursued: 1) Elucidate the sharp-tip droplet generation process through numerical modeling and streaming analysis and demonstrate a POC nucleic acids detection system; 2) Develop a simple dual flow droplet generation system for performing digital ELISA; 3) Demonstrate an integrated the sample processing system enabled by vibrating sharp-tip and composable microfluidic plates.

NLP-related research has generally focused on large models uniformly applied to everyone independent of their writing style and social norms, thus, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. Nevertheless, NLP-based models do not perform equally for all communities because of different writing styles (e.g., dialects) and choices of topical discussion (e.g., Sports vs. Technology). Furthermore, social norms vary between communities, making the original intended use of some NLP models potentially irrelevant. Hence, applying the same NLP model to everyone may cause harm if communities are not directly considered. Therefore, researchers and practitioners must evaluate NLP models on community data before they deploy them. They must also work with communities to determine whether the technology is sound given the community's social norms and needs. This project will address two critical questions: ""How can stakeholders know whether the model will harm specific communities when put into production?"" and ""What community-specific language patterns cause errors in various NLP models?"". By answering these questions, this project intends to develop tools to help communities participate in the technology development process, which will enable them to decide whether a specific technology is relevant to the community or not. Finally, this project will also create standards-based lessons for high school students in San Antonio by training local high-school teachers in community-driven NLP, which will potentially help local students better consider NLP applications in their lives.<br/><br/>Overall, this project will provide researchers and NLP practitioners with a better understanding of applying and developing NLP models for small communities rather than focusing on a one-size-fits-all framework. Specifically, to address this goal, this project has three objectives. Objective 1 will identify strategies to find correlations between community-specific language and NLP model performance. This objective will result in a better understanding of the inductive biases of NLP models for community-specific applications. Objective 2 will create a tool that can facilitate participatory NLP design by helping community-specific stakeholders identify potential good and harmful outcomes that may be caused by applying a specific NLP model. More importantly, the objective will help decision-makers decide when NLP should or should not be deployed in their communities. Objective 3 will identify methods to improve NLP models for specific communities. The goal is to identify methods to incorporate a community's unlabeled data into existing labeled NLP datasets to improve community-specific model performance. Finally, the project will impact the broader NLP community via the release of open-source software that implements the tools and techniques this award generates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Object grasping is an important prerequisite for various manipulation tasks. Humans are capable of grasping diverse objects dexterously even if their workspaces are cluttered. When an object is in a constrained space, such as a cardboard box or a shelf, humans often take advantage of the constraint by pushing the object toward a wall or a corner to grasp it. Even if a targeted object is hidden in a pile of objects, humans actively search for it by removing the clutter objects. While object grasping in such challenging scenarios seems effortless and natural for humans, current robots are still grasping objects in moderately cluttered tabletop environments. This project will develop computational algorithms to allow robots to perform such challenging object grasping. This project has the potential to broaden the application domains of robotic manipulation, such as flexible manufacturing (e.g., supporting human worker by providing right parts), agriculture (e.g., automated fruit and vegetable harvesting), warehouse fulfillment centers or grocery shopping (e.g., pick-and-place ordered items in shelves or bins), and eldercare (e.g., fetching a remote controller or pills), which have not been feasible with current robotic labor.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop novel computational algorithms that enable robots to visually understand scenes, learn to perform a proper manipulation action sequence, and adapt to different environmental settings. This project will address three fundamental challenges in robotic object grasping: (1) context-aware object grasping -- considering spatial contexts related to grasping, such as clutteredness, reachability, and collision, (2) object grasping via leveraging fixtures -- making use of environmental fixtures to grasp challenging objects by learning pixel-level or object-level affordances, and (3) object searching and grasping -- searching and grasping a hidden target object queried by either a reference image or a human natural language. All the algorithms and systems are designed to be self-supervised, meaning that they can learn and adapt to novel objects, environments, and tasks with minimal human interventions or guidance. This project will lay a solid foundation for the affordable and reliable robotic labor beneficial to the broad areas of our society, such as homes, factories, farms, warehouses, and eldercare facilities.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As one of the principal constituents of the Earth, and being of paramount importance to our technological civilization, iron is one of the most intensely studied materials, but quantum mechanical simulations that simultaneously include magnetism and the displacement patterns of iron atoms from their equilibrium positions due to temperature are computationally prohibitive. These simulations are nevertheless important because many physical and chemical properties of materials depend on the particular arrangement of atoms and their vibrations around equilibrium positions, and the ability to accurately predict such patterns can enable the design of materials using only computer simulations. <br/><br/>The research team will approach this computational challenge by using a particular computer algorithm to efficiently search for general parameters that result in predictions that are consistent with experiments, and by using these parameters to guide quantum mechanical and other simulations. The team will also spearhead the use of a machine learning algorithm capable of learning two or more features of the material and transparently showing their interaction.<br/><br/>This award also supports the creation of educational resources that will be used to expose community college students to concepts of computational materials science and will facilitate formal and informal mentorship for community college students by faculty and undergraduate researchers at the University of Texas El Paso, and establishing research collaborations with researchers at the University of California Berkeley.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This LEAPS-MPS award supports computational and theoretical research on how magnetic spin excitations (magnons) in the paramagnetic states of face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic iron affect the relative thermodynamic stability of the two phases at temperatures up to the melting point and pressures up to 15 GPa through their interaction with phonons. Simulations of the lattice dynamics from first principles are computationally expensive, and the inclusion of spin degrees of freedom can make the direct computation of the interaction prohibitive. Nevertheless, with an estimated contribution to the free energy of up to 35 meV/atom, the spin-lattice coupling cannot be ignored in calculations of the thermodynamics and phase stability of this system.<br/><br/>The research team will approach the challenge by (i) empirically constraining the interatomic force constants, from which phonon dispersion relations can be computed via evolutionary computation, and (ii) developing machine learning models based on mathematical graphs capable of learning both atomic and spin configurations to be used in dynamics simulations.<br/><br/>This award also supports the creation of educational resources that will be used to expose community college students to concepts of computational materials science and will facilitate formal and informal mentorship for community college students by faculty and undergraduate researchers at the University of Texas El Paso, and establishing research collaborations with researcher at the University of California Berkeley.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mantle rocks are rarely observed on the Earth's surface because they are covered by the crust. Yet, the upper part of the mantle, which is composed of peridotite, is commonly exposed on the seafloor, and occasionally exposed on land in geological features called ophiolites. When peridotite is exposed to, and reacts with, water, it undergoes chemical reactions that change the composition of both the rocks and the water. This process, known as alteration, results in carbon being transferred from the water to the rocks. Peridotite alteration is thus a natural process that sequesters carbon in the Earth's interior. This project uses data from a unique seismic experiment - conducted at the world's largest ophiolite in Oman - to determine how fast this natural process sequesters carbon. The project provides support to a post-doctoral associate at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  It fosters international collaboration with the Sultana of Oman, Czech Republic, and the UK.  Its outcomes are directly relevant to applications in engineered CO2 capture and enhanced geothermal systems.<br/><br/>Peridotite alteration is a fundamentally important process for a spectrum of geoscience topics. These include arc volcanism, earthquake processes, the carbon cycle, and chemosynthetic biological communities. Although fully altered peridotites (serpentinites, listvenites, soapstones) are commonly observed in outcrops, it is unclear how this can happen because alteration reactions are typically self-limiting. In most geological systems alteration products armor reactive surfaces and reduce pore space, which eventually halts the alteration process. It has been proposed that reaction-driven cracking - due to volume increase during serpentinization and carbonation of mantle rocks - is the key process that perpetuates alteration by creating and/or maintaining permeable pathways for continued fluid flow. In principle, this process should generate very small cracking events with volume change (isotropic) focal mechanism components. But such events have never been observed in situ. Here the team acquired a unique seismic dataset with short inter-element spacings (order meters) and 1 kHz sampling at a site of ongoing peridotite alteration to study its seismogenic character. They determine if the very small earthquakes detected by the seismic network represent cracking from peridotite alteration. They interpret the results in the context of the multi-disciplinary studies (hydrology, petrology, microbiology) conducted at the study site. The results provide new insight into the complex set of processes that occur when water interacts with peridotite. These processes occur over vast expanses of the Earth's solid surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical inorganic techniques will be relied on to elucidate trends in electron count, metal oxidation state, geometry, chelate coordination, and ligand redox activity that correlate with catalyst efficiency and lifetime. This effort will begin with the preparation of arene diimine compounds that are structurally related, yet electronically distinct from popular pyridine diimine compounds. As isostructural series and isoelectronic pairs are characterized, their ability to mediate the dehydrocoupling of amines and silanes will be evaluated. The most effective catalysts will be then used to prepare industrially-relevant aminosilane monomers and polymers. Catalysts developed during this project will also be screened for main group element dehydrocoupling reactions that have not been previously achieved. Applications will include the preparation of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition precursors that feature N-Ge, N-Al, and Ga-P bonds, quantum dot synthons that feature P-Si and P-Ge bonds, and reductive functionalization reagents that feature B-Si and Al-Si bonds. Overall, this project has the potential to expand the known scope of main-group element dehydrocoupling chemistry and elucidate halogen-free synthetic pathways that can be used to prepare a versatile set of products. The broader impacts of this project include the potential for positive societal outcomes in the fabrication of quantum dots  and the distribution of effective catalysts to members of the synthetic community.

The fate of muddy sediment is important in many ways.  Mud transport governs the fate of riverine pollutants, heavy metals and organic carbon; mud also is a key resource that can restore coastal areas and make flat, low-lying landscapes habitable. Growing evidence indicates that mud and organic matter in rivers are often bound together into large aggregates through a process called flocculation. This project will develop a predictive mathematical model for the transport of flocculated mud in rivers and apply the model to real-world coastal restoration problems in the Mississippi Delta wetlands. The project brings together a team from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of New Orleans (UNO), and the Water Institute of the Gulf, to solve environmental and societal challenges in the Gulf of Mexico region. The results will be shared with scientists in the Gulf Region from local, state, and federal agencies, academia, and environmental NGOs to influence coastal wetlands management decisions in the Mississippi Delta. The project will engage students from the University of New Orleans, who are directly affected by Mississippi Delta land loss, in a summer research program at Caltech.<br/><br/>Compared to sand, far less is known about the basic mechanics of mud transport and deposition in river systems. This is a major knowledge gap because mud adsorbs pollutants, nutrients and organic carbon, and the fate of this material directly impacts environmental quality and the global carbon cycle. Mud also is the primary building block of terrestrial and coastal landscapes: it builds floodplains, coastal wetlands and deltas, affects bank erosion rates and levee stability, and sets the depositional architecture of fluvial strata. In rivers, mud is typically considered as ?washload,? particles with settling velocities so small that they act as passive water tracers. However, growing evidence indicates that mud and organic matter in fluvial systems are often flocculated together into aggregates with settling velocities equivalent to sand. This project will develop a mechanistic model for freshwater flocculation using theory and semi-empirical relations from new flume experiments. A database of floc settling velocities from rivers will be compiled by inversion from concentration-depth profiles, to test the freshwater floc model using field data. The mud transport theory will be integrated into numerical models used for wetland restoration in the Mississippi Delta. A series of numerical experiments will evaluate the impact of flocculation on wetland accretion rates for engineered diversions that are needed to rebuild sinking wetlands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carlquist leaves behind a rich legacy and significant collections resulting from over 30 years of important botanical research. Over the course of his distinguished career, Carlquist published prolifically, with over 300 research papers covering such topics as plant anatomy and systematics, evolutionary and ecological theory, flower development, morphology, island biogeography, and taxonomy. As a researcher, Carlquist considered the biological elements within an environment as comprising a dynamic network. This network informed his method for collecting specimens and the rich array of materials and records he generated through that practice. The Carlquist Collection, housed at the California Botanic Garden Herbarium (RSA) and the Botanical Research Institute of Texas Library (BRIT), collectively contains 191,789 objects, including herbarium specimens, wood specimens, plant material preserved in spirits, wood anatomy microscope slides, field photograph transparency slides, black and white photographs, and field collection notebooks. A significant portion of the Carlquist Collection has never been curated or digitized, making much of the collection inaccessible. Further, some of the collection materials have faced varying degrees of deterioration owing to inadequate housing in non-archival materials. In a collaborative effort between RSA and BRIT, this project aims to curate and digitize these important collections and their associated data to provide long-term preservation and to create an Extended Specimen Network (ESN), wherein Carlquist?s specimens, field photographs, and collection notebooks will be linked to form an aggregated collection, thus creating limitless additional preparations and digital resources. The project will facilitate immediate application to a suite of research areas, including systematic, wood anatomy, ecology, biogeography, island biology, phenology, plant conservation, history of science, plant humanities, and archival theory and practices. The Carlquist Collection will be publicly available via online data portals.<br/><br/>Held at the Herbarium at California Botanic Garden (RSA) and the Library at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), the Sherwin Carlquist Collection encompasses more than 30 years of botanical field research comprising 30,770 biological collections and 161,019 archival objects. This project aims to (1) curate the Carlquist Collection for long-term preservation; (2) digitize and mobilize data for all collections materials held at both institutions; (3) link transcribed collection information, images, and metadata across all biological collections and archival objects; and (4) publish and make publicly available as an aggregated collection through online data portals, including iDigBio and GBIF. This project represents a unique collaborative and interdisciplinary opportunity between natural history collections and archives to create one of the first Extended Specimen Networks (ESN) for a renowned American botanist and serves more broadly to establish a new paradigm for how natural history collections and archives communities envision, implement, and utilize ESN?s within and among their collections. Integral to the project are the activities that involve participation from students at different levels in their academic career. The project will provide education, training, and capacity building for underserved youth and emerging professionals in a field that will greatly benefit from their participation. A workshop and symposium on ESN development are planned for the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections annual conference to provide training and resources to the collections community.

This pattern, together with the rapidly decreasing field strength, has led to hotly debated speculation that Earth is in the early stages of a geomagnetic polarity reversal. Principal limitations in this debate have been a lack of data for the last 1500 years from key regions in the Southern Hemisphere and theoretical understanding of deep Earth controls on magnetic fields. To address these limitations, this project will refine the archeomagnetic record of the southern Hemisphere, develop numerical simulations to explore the affect the deep Earth has on magnetic fields, and integrate these two components to explore whether the unusual mantle beneath South Africa and Patagonia (the African Low Shear Velocity Province) places a first-order control on the character of the South Atlantic Anomaly. This project will foster international collaboration with archeologists from South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, develop a revised geodynamo code that will be made available to the community, and support of graduate and undergraduate students who will receive a broad training in the field, experimental rock and paleomagnetism, and geophysical modeling.<br/><br/>This project will support a collaborative study that will bring together workers in disparate disciplines and subdisciplines to further refine the archeomagnetic record and more directly test the efficacy of Low Shear Velocity Province control on the character of the geomagnetic field. Specifically, the research team will: (i) conduct field studies including field surveys and collection materials with the goal of refining the Iron Age archeomagnetic record with potential application to both deep Earth and to archeological problems; (ii) conduct rock magnetic, analytical microscopy, and paleomagnetic analyses and processing of field magnetic survey data to define ambient magnetic fields of the collection sites, magnetic carriers in the collected archeological artifacts, and ancient recordings of direction and intensity with the goal of testing primary hypothesis of the proposed work; and (iii) use numerical dynamo simulations to investigate whether the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province can locally defect core flow, drive the magnetic Reynolds number toward unity, favoring magnetic diffusion and flux expulsion, and thus place first-order controls on geomagnetic observations made at Earth?s surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the origin of terrestrial volatiles remains enigmatic, with considerable debate and uncertainty surrounding regarding volatile source(s) and the overall timing of planetary accretion. Analyzing the composition of primordial gases emanating from Earth's mantle represents one of the best avenues to determine the origin of terrestrial volatiles. The Yellowstone?Columbia River volcanic mega-province is one of the few volcanic localities on Earth where pristine, plume-derived magmatic gas reaches the surface and can be easily collected for analysis. Geochemical data from previous studies in Yellowstone suggest that gas vents are sourced from a deep-seated mantle plume, that is dominantly chondritic in origin. In this project, a comprehensive study of gas emissions from Yellowstone National Park (YNP) will be conducted. The aims are to: (i) investigate the nature and extent of the Yellowstone plume's interaction with the Archean-aged crustal basement, which will provide further insight into (ii) the source of the YNP plume, and the (iii) processes acting to obfuscate mantle source signals. Specifically, the proposed research will constrain the composition of YNP magmatic gases and their parental plume mantle source with unprecedented spatial and analytical resolution. The PIs will employ static noble gas mass spectrometry techniques, clumped N isotope measurements and the first ultra-high-precision (sub per mil (?) precision) dynamic mass spectrometry measurements of magmatic gas to deconvolve mantle, crustal and atmospheric endmembers and to place firmer constraints on the origin of volatiles in the Yellowstone plume, which will help pinpoint the origin of volatiles on Earth.<br/> <br/>Questions pertaining to the origin of volatiles on Earth are of broad interest to the scientific community. Results from this study will provide insight into the relationship between mantle volatiles and Earth?s atmospheric composition, which is of direct relevance to understanding the drivers of Earth?s habitability and the subsequent evolution of life. Findings will be communicated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications and to the public through a multi-faceted outreach approach, including newsletter publications and field-based lectures that will be simulcast as a Facebook Live Event in coordination with YNP rangers. Further, the PIs will work with the YNP Exhibits Specialist to incorporate geochemical findings from this and other studies into a permanent ?wayside exhibit? within the park. If possible, a short geochemical synopsis will also be included in the YNP welcome packet (distributed to the >4 million annual visitors). Additionally, an interactive website presenting a ?Yellowstone Geochemical Trail Map.? will also be constructed and linked to the aforementioned wayside exhibit and entry brochure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the sixth largest flowering plant family, the mint family (Lamiaceae) is exceptionally important ecologically, ethnobotanically, and floristically. Within the mint family, the second largest subfamily, the lamioid mints (Lamioideae), serves as an excellent model for exploring global patterns of plant diversification and evolutionary radiation, or a rapid increase in the number of species in a clade. This research will use high throughput DNA sequencing technologies to build a robust understanding of evolutionary relationships in the lamioid mints. The findings from this project will be of broad value to systematists, evolutionary biologists, and ecologists by helping close gaps in our fundamental understanding of how plants diversify, including the evolution of early flowering plants and colonization of newly formed habitats, such as volcanic islands. Information gathered from this project will also improve our knowledge of the comparative biology of lamioid mints, guide new product discovery, and aid in the development of conservation measures for endangered species. This project incorporates extensive opportunities for education and career training at multiple levels, including high school teachers, undergraduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and an early-career female faculty. The project team will offer public seminars about lamioid mints, highlighting their research findings and broader implications. An important component of this project is to train and mentor undergraduate students, and twelve undergraduate students from Missouri Western State University will become actively involved in various aspects of this project.<br/><br/>The lamioid mints, which have been categorized into 13 tribes, have a near cosmopolitan distribution, with most taxa found in the Old World and only two lineages having colonized the New World and Hawaiian Islands. Despite this widespread distribution and diversity, a solid phylogenomic framework of the lamioid mints, from which patterns of diversification and links to shifts in distribution, ecology, and genome dynamics can be explored, is still lacking. This project will utilize next-generation sequencing approaches involving targeted enrichment, transcriptomics, and broad taxonomic sampling from field and herbaria across the US to build a robust phylogenetic platform of the lamioid mints. The following major goals will be accomplished: 1) Circumscribe the major clades of Lamioideae and their interrelationships and make necessary taxonomic changes, including determining the placement of the two tribes comprising New World members, Stachydeae and Synandreae, and the basal tribes, Gomphostemmateae and Pogostemoneae; 2) Estimate the timing of key evolutionary events and rates of diversification; 3) Link diversifications in Lamioideae, particularly within Stachydeae and Synandreae, with shifts in biogeography, whole genome and gene duplication, and character trait evolution to identify possible key innovations and apparent repeated evolution of morphological characters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elementary teachers are often uncomfortable teaching science, mathematics, and engineering as independent subjects, and STEM integration poses new challenges. Previous research has explored links between confidence (or self-efficacy), teacher effectiveness, and teacher retention, but self-efficacy for teaching integrated STEM (iSTEM) is largely unexplored. This project will include approximately 700 teachers who experienced ten different teacher preparation programs. It aims to identify programmatic features that support early career elementary teachers? self-efficacy in teaching integrated STEM within high-need school districts. It will examine relationships among self-efficacy, iSTEM teaching effectiveness, and teacher retention. The findings that result from this project have the potential to inform the design of teacher education programs and may contribute to the development of more highly qualified elementary STEM teachers.<br/><br/>This project at Southern Methodist University, University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Towson University, and Indiana University Southeast includes partnerships with the University of Massachusetts - Boston, Sacred Heart University, Alcorn State University, Bridgewater State University, Montclair State University, and University of Rhode Island.  Project goals include to:  (1) track changes in prospective elementary teachers? integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy as they shift from teacher preparation programs to teaching positions; (2) identify and describe key elements of teacher education that support the development of integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy among early-career teachers; (3) identify the relationships among integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy, teaching effectiveness, and teacher retention; and (4) build and support a community of elementary teachers focused on improving their STEM teaching. Grounded in self-efficacy theory, this project will use a sequential explanatory mixed methods design and include undergraduates, Master?s students, and current teachers who are within their first five years of teaching. The project?s longitudinal design, innovative focus on integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy and effectiveness, and investigation of links between integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy and teacher retention reflect its intellectual merit. Research findings will be published in research and practitioner journals and shared widely at international conferences to impact researchers, administrators, and educators beyond the immediate scope of this project. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

EVC is a community college in San Jose, California, which serves approximately 10,000 students. A particular impetus of the project will be to increase access to, and participation in, the biological sciences workforce with a particular focus on needs of low-income students. Community college students are a potential source of biology majors and future biologists, yet they often face financial and family demands that compete with their educational goals. This is particularly true for EVC students who live in the Silicon Valley, an expensive region in the country. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund forty-five (45) 2-year scholarships to help the Scholars work less and focus on their academic progress. Through a cohort model, targeted mentorship, internships, and enrollment in a first-year biology-focused seminar, these biology scholars will be supported in their pathway towards completion of an Associates with Transfer degree, which will guarantee their admission to a California public four-year university, the next step on their way to a biological science career. This project at EVC includes partnerships with local four-year institutions, biotech companies, and Iowa State University (ISU). ISU which will serve as the institution leading project research and evaluation.<br/><br/>To increase STEM Associates degree completion and transfer of low-income, high-achieving community college students with demonstrated financial need, the project will pursue an underlying project goal of advancing students' STEM content knowledge and pathway navigation from community college to baccalaureate completion in biology. The project will pursue this goal through a systematic study of biology students and their coursework in the community college context. In particular, the underlying goal will be achieved through mixed-methods evaluation and accompanying feedback of the efficacy of students? evolving science identity development, achievement, motivation, and campus engagement. Investigators will draw upon three complementary perspectives on learning and development in undergraduate science; namely, Perez?s extension of the Expectancy Value framework for STEM majors, Calderon?s science identity framework, and Stanton-Salazar?s agents of socialization. Project findings will contribute to the theoretical understanding of how motivation and science identity evolves over the community college experience.  At the same time, directions of investigation will address gaps in the literature and provide practical insight into how community colleges should organize programming in order to foster relationships that promote academic success and transfer. Project investigators will disseminate outcomes and findings related to project challenges and successes, especially to other community colleges in a similar setting. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To manage water insecurity, many communities will increasingly need to rely on mobile, adaptable, and decentralized water infrastructures, such as private water vending, rather than on centralized public systems alone. In the coming years then, it will be crucial to understand how market-based infrastructures can be designed to uphold local notions of water justice and advance the Human Right to Water. This CAREER project will examine when and how communities mobilize market-based moral economies to manage water insecurity in ways they consider to be fair and just. Moral economies are normative economic institutions in which shared notions of justice obligate individuals to provide access to vital resources. While scientists have documented reciprocity-based moral economies as a key human response to resource insecurity, we have little understanding of when and how people may use market-based moral economic arrangements to manage water insecure conditions within contemporary capitalist contexts. <br/><br/>In Phase 1 of the project, the researcher will ethnographically examine private water vending in a major U.S. water insecurity hotspot to understand if and when market-based moral economies for water arise. In Phase 2, the researcher will explore the generalizability of these findings through a cross-cultural study of market-based moral economies in six global sites (via collaboration with the NSF-funded Household Water Insecurity Research Coordination Network). Both phases of research will focus on three water markets (informal exchanges, semi-formal water hauling, and formal water retail stores) to examine how market formality enables or constrains moral economies for water. Within each market, the researcher will examine how social distance, dyadic social ties that are strong, weak, or absent, enables or constrains moral economies for water. Findings from this research will: contribute to anthropological knowledge of the social foundations of markets; further understand how humans respond to resource insecurity in market-based economies; advance interdisciplinary scholarship on the multi-scalar causes, consequences, and responses to household water insecurity. Funding for the project will also support the development of a novel research apprenticeship model that will integrate all phases of research with graduate and undergraduate teaching in order to train a new generation of social scientists in team-based interdisciplinary social science and community-based research methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a large fast developing area with deep ideas and powerful tools. The area also is closely related to other parts of mathematics, computer science and operation research. We consider two types of basic extremal problems on graphs and hypergraphs: on the existence of paths and cycles of a given kind and on special partitions of the set of vertices or edges of a (hyper)graph (mainly involving its cycle structure). Since cycles and paths are very natural substructures of graphs and hypergraphs, understanding problems on their existence will help in resolving other extremal problems. The PI plans to involve into work on the problems of the grant several graduate students and very recent graduates  of the University of Illinois. The research guidance for them contributes to their professional development and reputation.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study a series of extremal problems related to paths and cycles in graphs and hypergraphs and to colorings, especially when the answers depend on the cycle structure.  In fact, in most coloring problems the cycle structure is important. In a number of problems we will consider (hyper)graphs with restrictions on degree structure. Examples are: (hyper)graphs with bounded maximum degree, or with bounded maximum average degree, or with given degeneracy, or k-regular, or with high minimum degree. Among important topics are  Turan-type problems on cycles and paths in graphs and ordered graphs, problems on different kinds of cycles and paths in hypergraphs,  extremal problems on different types of coloring, Ramsey-type problems for cycles and paths, DP-colorings, list coloring,  improper colorings, graph reconstruction problems when the known subgraphs have less than n-1 vertices, saturation problems for hypergraphs.

The pioneering works of F. Murray and J. von Neumann from 1930-1940 already revealed that von Neumann algebras are complex objects that display extraordinary rich mathematical structures. Gradually, their study morphed into a stand-alone discipline which, over time, triggered the development of powerful mathematical theories and brought valuable insight to other sciences, including physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA molecule structure), engineering (cell phone network design) and computer science (error-correcting codes, theory of quantum information and quantum computing). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary, arising naturally from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time, their study maintained close connections with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently to continuous model theory and geometric group theory. This project investigates new research avenues at the rich interaction between von Neumann algebras and the aforementioned areas. The main goal is to identify new ways of classifying von Neumann algebras through the lens of rigidity - a condition where it is shown that an entire structure of a mathematical object can be unraveled only from very limited a priori known information on that object. The project provides ample opportunities for the training and professional development of graduate students. <br/><br/>Continuing prior efforts of the Principal Investigator (PI), this project is aimed at expanding the boundary of knowledge in the classification of group/measure space von Neumann algebras and their applications to related fields. Specifically, the PI pursues new ideas at the interaction between deformation/rigidity theory and geometric group theory to advance several fundamental problems: (i) identify new groups and algebraic group features that are completely recognizable from the von Neumann algebraic and C*-algebraic structure; in particular, find additional examples of property (T) groups satisfying Connes' rigidity conjecture; (ii) compute invariants like the endomorphisms and the fundamental group of property (T) group factors and reduced group C*-algebras; (iii) find new natural examples of W*-superrigid actions, a problem of continued interest as it unifies two extreme forms of rigidity both in orbit equivalence and von Neumann algebras; and (iv) unveil new invariants distinguishing ultrapowers of factors and explore in depth their applications to continuous model theory. Many of these projects are highly interdisciplinary in nature and results arising from these projects are expected to reveal new bridges between geometric group theory, ergodic theory, C*-algebras, model theory, and von Neumann algebras. To enhance the career development of the PI?s graduate students, the award supports a student visiting program to peer institutions aimed at exposing students to different expertise and research environments. To promote the visibility of and to attract new talent to this field, the PI will continue to teach advanced graduate courses and organize learning seminars in the field.

Access to CS education is disproportionately distributed across public schools. High-need schools have greater numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in computing fields; they are also more likely to have teacher turnover and less likely to have experienced teachers and CS opportunities. This research project will investigate how teacher preparation programs can increase CS teacher retention in high-need schools and prepare teachers to deliver effective, equitable CS instruction. This is essential due to the increasing demand for STEM teachers, particularly in high-need schools, and the call for K-12 CS teachers who are prepared to engage students from underrepresented groups. With turnover particularly high among secondary CS teachers, the goal is to generate information that can be used to increase the longer-term retention of CS teachers in high-need schools. The project will also identify the features of programs that prepare teachers to deliver effective, equitable CS instruction.<br/><br/>This project is led by ETR (Education, Training, Research) Associates in partnership with three Noyce-funded projects at New York University, California State University Fresno, and Louisiana Tech University and their surrounding school districts of New York City Public Schools, Fresno Unified, Central Unified, Sanger Unified, Bienville Parish, Caddo Parish, Lincoln Parish, Ouachita Parish, Richland Parish, and Winn Parish. Project goals include addressing research questions around what individual, interpersonal and institutional factors play a role in how teacher preparation programs can increase the retention of CS teachers in high-need schools. The research also intends to investigate how teacher preparation programs can prepare teachers to deliver effective and equitable CS education in middle and high school classrooms. The research will be guided by socio-ecological and social justice pedagogical content knowledge theoretical frameworks. An initial conjecture map that documents research-based hypotheses about how to prepare teachers to persist and engage in effective CS instruction will steer the work. The study aims to recruit up to 80 teachers who are being prepared to teach CS in high-need middle and high schools. They will participate during their pre-service preparation program and their 2-year in-service teaching requirement, as well as beyond this teaching requirement. Mixed methods will be used to collect survey, interview, observation, and institutional data over time. The data will be analyzed to describe teachers? development of CS knowledge and social justice pedagogy, their experience as a student teacher and a novice lead teacher, their community of support, their identity as a CS teacher, as well as features of the preparation program and school sites. Using a design-research approach, the team will use the data to iteratively refine the conjecture map and make changes at the program level at each institution. This project has the potential to contribute to understanding of how programs can prepare teachers to deliver CS content in an equitable and inclusive way, including identifying promising preparation strategies and supports to address factors that affect retention in high-need schools. It is intended to result in a theoretical model that can be used to inform the design of programs that can increase CS teacher retention and support equitable CS instruction in middle and high school. The geographic dispersion of Noyce projects will increase the likelihood that the results will be relevant to a range of populations and settings. An advisory board of experts on computer science education, teacher preparation, and equity in computing will monitor and provide feedback on project milestones, as well as contribute their expertise to the design of recruitment, data collection, and data analyses. Study findings will be disseminated to researchers and practitioners through publications, presentations, and a CS teacher professional development toolkit. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

However, the way people initially perceive others is often inaccurate and systematically biased towards negative perceptions. For example, when first exposed to faces that are hard to see or that have subtle expressions, people report that these faces look threatening (even when they are not). This project examines a bias to judge unfamiliar others in crowds as being angry. This research tests whether a perceiver's bias to judge others as angry depends on the others' race and gender, whether the others are alone or in a crowd, and the perceiver's own beliefs about race and gender. Racial and gender bias in crowd perception is not simply an academic issue. Crowds have been at the center stage of protest and social unrest moments that are causing vastly divergent interpretations of current events. This project reveals who may be most susceptible to negative crowd biases, the underlying visual and cognitive process that cause biased judgments, and the malleability of these biases. <br/><br/>This research utilizes state-of-the-art methods and statistical tools to examine visual attention to faces, and bias and accuracy in emotion judgments (specifically, eye-tracking data, signal detection methods, and drift-diffusion modeling). The approach makes it possible to track visual patterns ? for example, which faces people look at first in a crowd, how long they look at each face, whether they ignore anyone, whether faces appear alone or in a crowd ? all of which are likely to be affected by the racial and gender features of the faces. Newly-developed materials include an extensive set of computer-generated faces that have been designed with precise variations in gender and racial features. Tracking visual patterns and judgements of these computer-generated faces can establish at what point, for whom, and why bias occurs for crowd perception. Additional materials include a representative set of crowd images from real-life settings (i.e., published in popular news sources), which help to advance an understanding of how people perceive and react to crowds they typically encounter as part of their daily lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elementary teachers are often uncomfortable teaching science, mathematics, and engineering as independent subjects, and STEM integration poses new challenges. Previous research has explored links between confidence (or self-efficacy), teacher effectiveness, and teacher retention, but self-efficacy for teaching integrated STEM (iSTEM) is largely unexplored. This project will include approximately 700 teachers who experienced ten different teacher preparation programs. It aims to identify programmatic features that support early career elementary teachers? self-efficacy in teaching integrated STEM within high-need school districts. It will examine relationships among self-efficacy, iSTEM teaching effectiveness, and teacher retention. The findings that result from this project have the potential to inform the design of teacher education programs and may contribute to the development of more highly qualified elementary STEM teachers.<br/><br/>This project at Southern Methodist University, University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Towson University, and Indiana University Southeast includes partnerships with the University of Massachusetts - Boston, Sacred Heart University, Alcorn State University, Bridgewater State University, Montclair State University, and University of Rhode Island.  Project goals include to:  (1) track changes in prospective elementary teachers? integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy as they shift from teacher preparation programs to teaching positions; (2) identify and describe key elements of teacher education that support the development of integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy among early-career teachers; (3) identify the relationships among integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy, teaching effectiveness, and teacher retention; and (4) build and support a community of elementary teachers focused on improving their STEM teaching. Grounded in self-efficacy theory, this project will use a sequential explanatory mixed methods design and include undergraduates, Master?s students, and current teachers who are within their first five years of teaching. The project?s longitudinal design, innovative focus on integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy and effectiveness, and investigation of links between integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy and teacher retention reflect its intellectual merit.

Everyone has an accent, of course, but not all accents are alike, even when we speak the same language. ?English? in St. Louis, for example, is not the same as ?English? in Singapore or Glasgow. Relatively little is known about how we adjust our perceptions to each other's accents or what kind of effort that requires. In order to understand how such communication works, this project investigates why some speakers are more difficult to understand than others and how listeners adjust to unfamiliar accents. The research team will partner with the St. Louis Science Center, the local university, and other community groups to help others learn about accents and the rich world of linguistic diversity. Through its experiments and its educational outreach, the project ultimately aims to promote tolerance and better communication among speakers and listeners of all different backgrounds.<br/><br/>Research on accent perception has typically relied on measuring how many words a listener can correctly identify. However, some listeners may have to work much harder than others to understand an accented speaker. They may achieve the same outcome, but the processing involved may be very different. This project shifts the focus of accent research to the measurement of cognitive processing during listening, employing a combination of experimental methods from the listening effort literature and the field of behavioral economics. To identify the features of accented speech that most contribute to listening effort, the proposal also relates acoustic-phonetic analyses of the speech to experimental outcomes. Finally, it uses eye-tracking to test the hypothesis that listeners relax their linguistic categories to process unfamiliar accents.  This also has important scientific implications for automatic speech recognition, language teaching and language proficiency assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-profile data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other costly exploits and attacks have made cybersecurity a priority for all manner of public and private organizations. Organizations are increasingly adopting vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) as a key strategy for managing and mitigating cybersecurity risk. These programs crowdsource security work?they invite independent security researchers to report newly identified software bugs. Yet, the adoption and management of these programs is rarely simple or straightforward. They can create new points of stress and complication within organization. This project examines how these programs work and, importantly, how they can be improved. Protecting digital networks, devices, and software is a key national priority. Ultimately, the research project?s insights will help organizations improve their security.<br/><br/>While organizations have long relied on a blend of in-house information technology expertise and contracted computer services, VDPs are a different approach to harnessing expertise. This project uncovers the ongoing intra-organizational work required to integrate these new intuitional models of software review within organizations; and it assesses the ultimate effectiveness of VDPs to improve organizational cybersecurity. Specifically, the project addresses two related research questions: (i) What forms of institutional work are needed to create and sustain VDPs?; (ii) How effective are VDPs at improving security? To answer these questions, the project creates and analyzes a novel set of qualitative and quantitative data drawn from select ongoing VDPs. Collected data includes anonymized program data, administrative data, and interviews with staff associated with managing VDPs. This project provides a window into: (i) how new cybersecurity practices are adopted, maintained, and transformed by and within organizations; and (ii) the efficacy of VDPs to improve organizational cybersecurity. Answering these questions will provide insight into larger organizational dimensions of cybersecurity and the efficacy of VDPs to improve security outcomes. More broadly, in addressing these research questions, the project advances insights into the often-overlooked institutional work associated with adopting and sustaining new organizational innovations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A new framework, to enable an integrated experimental-mathematical study, will be developed to control the spatial distribution of the host cell population and to quantify how such spatial structure affects viral evolution and decay. The project has basic research, medical, and public health impact, since the analytical and experimental methods can be extended to elucidate mechanisms of infection spread by viruses of public health importance, including influenza A virus, Zika virus, and coronaviruses. As an interdisciplinary study, the research will cross-train mathematicians, biologists, and engineers, contributing significantly to workforce development. Broader objectives include increased participation and diversity in STEM fields while promoting a broader understanding of science and technology by the public through wide dissemination.  <br/><br/>The project goal is to determine both the probability of virus extinction during infection spread and the spreading speed in terms of the spatial structure of host cell populations. A new mathematical framework, stochastic reaction-diffusion equations on metric graphs, will be developed to study the dynamics of virus infections over any network structure. The biological experiments are cutting edge: virus infections will be performed on micro-patterned host cells that enable quantification of population level features of infection spread in any network structure, a key advantage over traditional Petri-dish studies. Analysis of the experimentally informed stochastic equations has the potential to push the frontier of current knowledge about the role of space and stochasticity in population dynamics. This new framework motivates problems that cut across several mathematical disciplines (probability, partial differential equations and mathematical biology) and that are of interest to a large group of applied mathematicians and applied scientists. These problems include (i) What is the probability of extinction of virus and the propagation speed in terms of geometric properties of the metric graph, such as the branching structure and the edge lengths of the graph? (ii) What is the probability of coexistence of virus and defective interfering particles during co-infection spread, and the effect of the underlying spatial structure on this probability? The project brings new probabilistic tools and perspectives to solve these problems and to generate mechanistic insights about virus infection spread. <br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) through the Systems and Synthetic Biology and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these powerful models have not yet become the predominant method in many data-driven domains because they are extremely resource-hungry: recent models cost millions of dollars to train. This project will tackle this challenge by thoroughly characterizing the theoretical properties of over-parameterization. Based on this solid foundation, the investigator will design resource-efficient methods to make modern machine learning technologies accessible to a broader audience.

The first thrust characterizes over-parameterization from width. The grand goal is to develop a unified theoretical framework, based on which the investigator will design new width shrinkage methods to reduce over-parameterized model resource requirements. The second thrust will develop principles on the acceleration and regularization effects of over-parameterization from depth. Insights will help us design more explicit optimizers and regularizers to compress the model so shallow neural networks can achieve performance similar to deep neural networks ones. The third thrust will identify conditions under which pre-trained over-parameterized models can learn representations that improve sample efficiency in downstream tasks. The investigator will then design methods that select a small subset of data in pre-training without degrading performance, reducing computational resource requirements.

The fate of muddy sediment is important in many ways.  Mud transport governs the fate of riverine pollutants, heavy metals and organic carbon; mud also is a key resource that can restore coastal areas and make flat, low-lying landscapes habitable. Growing evidence indicates that mud and organic matter in rivers are often bound together into large aggregates through a process called flocculation. This project will develop a predictive mathematical model for the transport of flocculated mud in rivers and apply the model to real-world coastal restoration problems in the Mississippi Delta wetlands. The project brings together a team from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of New Orleans (UNO), and the Water Institute of the Gulf, to solve environmental and societal challenges in the Gulf of Mexico region. The results will be shared with scientists in the Gulf Region from local, state, and federal agencies, academia, and environmental NGOs to influence coastal wetlands management decisions in the Mississippi Delta. The project will engage students from the University of New Orleans, who are directly affected by Mississippi Delta land loss, in a summer research program at Caltech.<br/><br/>Compared to sand, far less is known about the basic mechanics of mud transport and deposition in river systems. This is a major knowledge gap because mud adsorbs pollutants, nutrients and organic carbon, and the fate of this material directly impacts environmental quality and the global carbon cycle. Mud also is the primary building block of terrestrial and coastal landscapes: it builds floodplains, coastal wetlands and deltas, affects bank erosion rates and levee stability, and sets the depositional architecture of fluvial strata. In rivers, mud is typically considered as ?washload,? particles with settling velocities so small that they act as passive water tracers. However, growing evidence indicates that mud and organic matter in fluvial systems are often flocculated together into aggregates with settling velocities equivalent to sand. This project will develop a mechanistic model for freshwater flocculation using theory and semi-empirical relations from new flume experiments. A database of floc settling velocities from rivers will be compiled by inversion from concentration-depth profiles, to test the freshwater floc model using field data. The mud transport theory will be integrated into numerical models used for wetland restoration in the Mississippi Delta. A series of numerical experiments will evaluate the impact of flocculation on wetland accretion rates for engineered diversions that are needed to rebuild sinking wetlands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This property is crucial to many modern electronic and optical technologies, but there has been limited success directly integrating ferroelectric materials with electronics based on conventional semiconductors despite decades of efforts. Part of the challenge is that traditional ferroelectrics exhibit very different crystal structures, bonding, and defect densities from commercial semiconductors such as silicon. This project seeks to resolve this problem by introducing a new class of ferroelectric materials with a tetrahedral bonding structure common to commercial semiconductors. Introducing a new function to tetrahedral semiconductors will represent a step change in the capabilities of integrated electronic and optical devices. This project will discover and develop new tetrahedral ferroelectrics and result in a new mechanistic understanding of ferroelectricity. The project will emphasize workforce development, through the education of students and post-docs trained to accelerate materials discovery via modern approaches to integrated computation and experiment. Technological advances will be accelerated through close collaboration with an industrial partner, Broadcom, Inc. <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/><br/>Tetrahedral ferroelectrics such as modified aluminum nitride (AlN) offer a unique opportunity to extend our fundamental understanding of polarization reorientation and to discover new families of materials with enabling non-linear dielectric properties. The recent discovery of tetrahedral ferroelectrics has highlighted gaps in the scientific understanding of ferroelectricity and of polar semiconductors. The current project addresses three sets of fundamental questions: (1) How is switchable polarization related to coercive field, a paraelectric transition and/or stiffness? How is coercive field related to structure? (2) What is (are) the switching mechanism(s) in tetrahedral ferroelectrics? (3) How do local structure, individual and clustered point defects, and synthesis affect switching and breakdown? These questions will be addressed via integrated computation and experimentation, expanding the understanding of the fundamentals of ferroelectricity and of polar semiconductors alike. Enabling ferroelectricity in tetrahedral semiconductors represents a potential step change in semiconductor device capability and offers an attractive alternative to fighting defect accommodation in complex oxides. This project will expand ferroelectric and semiconductor physics, through a greater understanding of the mechanisms of polarization reorientation that welcomes a family of heretofore unknown tetrahedra-based systems to the universe of known ferroelectrics while simultaneously introducing a new intrinsic capability to the toolbox of tetrahedral semiconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In commutative algebra, one studies formal systems in which the rules for manipulating equations are the same as in high school algebra but done in more general settings. The field is related to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as number theory, the study of properties of the integers, and algebraic geometry, the study of geometric properties of solutions to systems of polynomial equations. Homological algebra is a branch of algebra related to the field of algebraic topology and is the study of topological spaces, that is, ""shapes."" A central object of study in homological algebra is that of a complex of modules, which can be thought of an abstraction of the notion of a topological space. This project aims to settle various open conjectures, including one on the possible values of Euler characteristics of certain types of complexes. Here, the Euler characteristic of a complex is a generalization of the integer invariant for polyhedra. The grant will also support graduate students working on affiliated topics.<br/><br/>The project involves four main topics: (1) lengths of modules of finite projective dimension and Dutta multiplicities of ""tiny complexes,"" (2) Ulrich modules and lim Ulrich sequences of modules, (3) cones of Betti tables and cohomology tables, (4) the nc-Hodge-conjecture for matrix factorizations. The central goal of (1) is to prove the conjecture that a module of finite projective dimension over a local ring must have length at least as large as the multiplicity of the module. This conjecture admits a generalization involving Euler and Dutta multiplicities of ""tiny complexes"". Part (2) concerns a primary tool used in tackling these conjectures: Ulrich modules, which are maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules whose multiplicities equal their minimal numbers of generates, and lim Ulrich sequences of modules?sequences of modules that asymptotically approximate the former. The central goal is to construct such things for a larger class of rings than previously known. Part (3) concerns the cones of Betti tables of modules over local rings and cones of cohomology tables of coherent sheaves on projective varieties. Ulrich sheaves and lim Ulrich sequences of sheaves?sheaf theoretic analogues of the module versions of these notions?play an essential role here. The central aim of Part (4) is to prove the non-commutative analogue of the classical Hodge conjecture for the category of matrix factorizations of a hypersurface with an isolated singularity.

Robots with even a fraction of human physical intelligence could revolutionize lives by automating repetitive tasks. Despite advances however, robots with such physical abilities remain elusive. This project takes a step towards more capable robots by building 3D computer vision and machine learning algorithms for automatically analyzing human skills from large-scale image and video collections readily available on the internet or captured in the wild. It will produce a large repository of high-level physical skills that can then be transferred to robots. The education and outreach activities of the project will impart theoretical knowledge in robot perception and provide practical experience to graduates, undergraduates, and high school students. Furthermore, the project will lead to advances in computer vision-based understanding of human physical skills, in-the-wild capture of a significant amount of skills data and help to solve problems outside of CS such as in the study of the neuroscience of hand manipulation in monkeys.<br/><br/>To meet the research goals, the project will advance the state of the art in computer vision-based modeling and estimation of human physical skills from large-scale visual data. Existing methods are limited to operating in structured environments and cannot capture interactions in unconstrained visual data taken in cluttered environments like homes.

Even while dormant, however, the magmatic heat present beneath a volcano?s surface can continue to drive hot springs in between eruptions. The focus of this study is hot springs at the Kama?ehuakanaloa underwater volcano (previously known as L??ihi), situated about 30 miles south of the Big Island of Hawai?i which last erupted in 1996. Prior studies between the mid 2000?s and late 2010?s have shown that the multiple hot-springs associated with that last eruption, at the summit of the volcano have been cooling down continuously. This study will investigate whether two sets of recent earthquakes at Kama?ehuakanaloa may have altered that cooling trend. In May 2020 earthquakes associated with magma intrusion into the chamber deep within the seamount were detected. In 1996 earthquakes similar to this accompanied a volcanic eruption. More recently still, in December 2021 the strongest earthquakes of any kind since the 1996 eruption were detected. This project will use a deep-diving robot to investigate whether lava was erupted on the seafloor during these earthquakes and also if the composition of the fluids (chemically altered seawater) flowing out of the seafloor at the volcano?s summit has changed.<br/><br/><br/>The L??ihi seamount (recently renamed Kama?ehuakanaloa) last erupted in 1996, significantly reshaping its summit and creating three collapse pits.  Inside one of these, Pele?s Pit, hot springs have been studied which exhibited temperatures in excess of 200C immediately post-eruption.  Since 2006, however, the multiple sites that have been subject to long-term study within Pele?s Pit and around its rim have shown more modest temperatures of 15-55C which, further, have exhibited progressive cooling at a rate of 1-2C over a 12-year period from 2006 to 2018 (the most recent year for which time-series data exist).  Thermodynamic modeling of the fluids collected in 2018 has provided new insight that the subsurface hydrothermal circulation within this steep sided seamount may extend much deeper than is typical at mid-ocean ridges (which are more elongate and exhibit shallower-sloping ridge flanks). Further, a geochemical consequence of L??ihi?s unusual circulation pattern may account for the unusually Fe-rich nature of the vent-fluids emerging from the seafloor at this intra-plate setting, and their impact on the surrounding ocean, when compared to mid-ocean ridges vents. This project will extend the 2006-2018 time-series of vent studies at L??ihi to investigate whether the subsurface hydrothermal circulation system has been perturbed by two significant episodes of seismicity that have subsequently occurred, as detected by the US Geological Survey?s Hawai?i Volcano Observatory.  In May 2020, a swarm of earthquakes was detected that were distinctive compared to all seismic activity since the volcano last erupted in May 1996 because they exhibited T-phase activity, recognized as being diagnostic of magmatic fluids migrating within the interior of the seamount and potentially indicative of magma replenishment. In December 2021, an even more pronounced episode of seismicity was detected, up to magnitude M4.9, which matched the strongest earthquakes detected during the 1996 eruptions. This project will use the ROV Jason to investigate whether the seafloor hydrothermal venting at L??ihi has been perturbed following these episodes of seismicity.  The project will test the hypothesis that the earthquakes, detected by T-phase seismic signals, perturbed the deep hydrothermal circulation cell at L??ihi, which in turn should be detectable at the seafloor through changes in vent-fluid temperatures and geochemical compositions.  Changes in seafloor morphology and locations of vent-sites compared to the previous ROV dives in 2018 may also be expected.  Conversely, the null hypothesis would be that the vent-sites that have been studied since 2006 continue to cool progressively (each vent should then be 62C cooler than when last studied in 2018) with compositions that will have changed accordingly.  Importantly, proving this null hypothesis would still be scientifically valuable.  It would extend the longest time series available for any intra-plate hydrothermal field worldwide and continue to collect pre-event data in anticipation of future extrusive volcanism at L??ihi that will occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While social robotics research has traditionally focused on one-on-one interactions, real-world applications typically require that robots interact in multi-party settings. Examples include robots that are deployed as information providers (in public kiosks or in museums), robots that work with group of people or with individuals, and robots that assist children or elderly people (in homes or elderly care centers). Such real-world contexts led to the emergence of group Human-Robot Interaction as a new area of study. This project is for a data-driven perspective for robot-group interactions that will allow robotic systems to reason about individuals and groups. Additionally, this project includes activities in pursuit of the researcher?s long-term goals of making Computer Science a more diverse and inclusive field, and increasing engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics via Artificial Intelligence technologies. For example, project activities include a partnership with the Yale Peabody Museum to help educate high-school and college students from primarily low-income communities, engage them in research, and engage the general public with Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. These synergistic activities complement the research by providing novel opportunities to study group human-robot interactions. <br/><br/>To unify many problems in computationally understanding group HRI, this project comprises a three-pronged approach that addresses: 1) data representation via graph abstractions, 2) learning via Graph Neural Networks, and 3) data collection in a scalable manner via self-supervision. The project will demonstrate this approach in a tangible manner by improving how robots initiate and sustain interactions. First, the team will study the problem of forecasting user engagement with a public robot as an example of reasoning about individuals in consideration of social relationships. Second, it will study the problem of identifying interaction breakdowns in HRI as an example of reasoning holistically about groups. Taken together, this project will demonstrate how the approach can be integrated with robot decision making, validate experimental protocols for data collection and algorithm evaluation in public settings, and advance our understanding of HRI at a fundamental level so that robots can better take part in group social encounters.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the sixth largest flowering plant family, the mint family (Lamiaceae) is exceptionally important ecologically, ethnobotanically, and floristically. Within the mint family, the second largest subfamily, the lamioid mints (Lamioideae), serves as an excellent model for exploring global patterns of plant diversification and evolutionary radiation, or a rapid increase in the number of species in a clade. This research will use high throughput DNA sequencing technologies to build a robust understanding of evolutionary relationships in the lamioid mints. The findings from this project will be of broad value to systematists, evolutionary biologists, and ecologists by helping close gaps in our fundamental understanding of how plants diversify, including the evolution of early flowering plants and colonization of newly formed habitats, such as volcanic islands. Information gathered from this project will also improve our knowledge of the comparative biology of lamioid mints, guide new product discovery, and aid in the development of conservation measures for endangered species. This project incorporates extensive opportunities for education and career training at multiple levels, including high school teachers, undergraduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and an early-career female faculty. The project team will offer public seminars about lamioid mints, highlighting their research findings and broader implications. An important component of this project is to train and mentor undergraduate students, and twelve undergraduate students from Missouri Western State University will become actively involved in various aspects of this project.<br/><br/>The lamioid mints, which have been categorized into 13 tribes, have a near cosmopolitan distribution, with most taxa found in the Old World and only two lineages having colonized the New World and Hawaiian Islands. Despite this widespread distribution and diversity, a solid phylogenomic framework of the lamioid mints, from which patterns of diversification and links to shifts in distribution, ecology, and genome dynamics can be explored, is still lacking. This project will utilize next-generation sequencing approaches involving targeted enrichment, transcriptomics, and broad taxonomic sampling from field and herbaria across the US to build a robust phylogenetic platform of the lamioid mints. The following major goals will be accomplished: 1) Circumscribe the major clades of Lamioideae and their interrelationships and make necessary taxonomic changes, including determining the placement of the two tribes comprising New World members, Stachydeae and Synandreae, and the basal tribes, Gomphostemmateae and Pogostemoneae; 2) Estimate the timing of key evolutionary events and rates of diversification; 3) Link diversifications in Lamioideae, particularly within Stachydeae and Synandreae, with shifts in biogeography, whole genome and gene duplication, and character trait evolution to identify possible key innovations and apparent repeated evolution of morphological characters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carlquist leaves behind a rich legacy and significant collections resulting from over 30 years of important botanical research. Over the course of his distinguished career, Carlquist published prolifically, with over 300 research papers covering such topics as plant anatomy and systematics, evolutionary and ecological theory, flower development, morphology, island biogeography, and taxonomy. As a researcher, Carlquist considered the biological elements within an environment as comprising a dynamic network. This network informed his method for collecting specimens and the rich array of materials and records he generated through that practice. The Carlquist Collection, housed at the California Botanic Garden Herbarium (RSA) and the Botanical Research Institute of Texas Library (BRIT), collectively contains 191,789 objects, including herbarium specimens, wood specimens, plant material preserved in spirits, wood anatomy microscope slides, field photograph transparency slides, black and white photographs, and field collection notebooks. A significant portion of the Carlquist Collection has never been curated or digitized, making much of the collection inaccessible. Further, some of the collection materials have faced varying degrees of deterioration owing to inadequate housing in non-archival materials. In a collaborative effort between RSA and BRIT, this project aims to curate and digitize these important collections and their associated data to provide long-term preservation and to create an Extended Specimen Network (ESN), wherein Carlquist?s specimens, field photographs, and collection notebooks will be linked to form an aggregated collection, thus creating limitless additional preparations and digital resources. The project will facilitate immediate application to a suite of research areas, including systematic, wood anatomy, ecology, biogeography, island biology, phenology, plant conservation, history of science, plant humanities, and archival theory and practices. The Carlquist Collection will be publicly available via online data portals.<br/><br/>Held at the Herbarium at California Botanic Garden (RSA) and the Library at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), the Sherwin Carlquist Collection encompasses more than 30 years of botanical field research comprising 30,770 biological collections and 161,019 archival objects. This project aims to (1) curate the Carlquist Collection for long-term preservation; (2) digitize and mobilize data for all collections materials held at both institutions; (3) link transcribed collection information, images, and metadata across all biological collections and archival objects; and (4) publish and make publicly available as an aggregated collection through online data portals, including iDigBio and GBIF. This project represents a unique collaborative and interdisciplinary opportunity between natural history collections and archives to create one of the first Extended Specimen Networks (ESN) for a renowned American botanist and serves more broadly to establish a new paradigm for how natural history collections and archives communities envision, implement, and utilize ESN?s within and among their collections. Integral to the project are the activities that involve participation from students at different levels in their academic career. The project will provide education, training, and capacity building for underserved youth and emerging professionals in a field that will greatly benefit from their participation. A workshop and symposium on ESN development are planned for the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections annual conference to provide training and resources to the collections community. Paired exhibits for the public and hosted at each institution will highlight the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to discover general mathematical laws that govern such systems. These systems appear quite different at small scales and large scales. So it is important to understand how different rules for small-scale evolution lead to different large-scale, system-wide behavior. Real-world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion of vehicles, packets in communication networks, fluid particles in a tube, fluid spreading in a porous medium, epidemics advancing in a population, and the fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that these mathematical models capture essential features of physical reality.  Over the long term, understanding complex interactions has profound implications for science and engineering and thereby for society. Mathematical systems of the kind described in the proposal are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.  <br/><br/><br/>This project investigates mathematical models of growth and motion in random media. Examples include first-passage percolation, the corner growth model, random walk in random environment, directed polymer models, and stochastic partial differential equations.

From the recruitment through the induction of scholars, the project focuses on community engagement. The incorporation of community-based inquiry as a form of effective STEM teaching positions school communities as sources of strength and knowledge. This project intends to prepare STEM teachers who will strengthen the STEM persistence rates of marginalized groups by providing anti-racist, community-based science and mathematics instruction that gives secondary students the skills and experiences to understand how STEM can positively impact their own communities. The project develops and evaluates a model for preparing high school STEM teachers who can use their instruction to positively address the very conditions that have limited who in our country takes part in mathematics and science. <br/><br/>This project includes partnerships among National-Louis University (NLU), a private university, Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), a private, technology focused undergraduate university, and Chicago Public Schools. The project will provide 22 Secondary-level STEM teacher candidates (Noyce Scholars) $15,000 scholarships over the course of the students? last two years (4 semesters) of their coterminous BS/MAT degree programs in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, or Physics. In addition to scholarships, the project will engage these students in activities that build their capacity for community-based STEM inquiry. The project centers on a liberatory form of education by preparing Noyce Scholars to be anti-racist, community-based STEM teachers. Through mentored cohorts, communities of practice, and structured and supported field experiences in Chicago Public Schools, scholars will develop three interrelated capacities, namely: 1) familiarity with and commitment to serving in high-need school environments; 2) a deep knowledge of the systemic inequities within STEM and how it impacts their students and their students? communities; and 3) the pedagogical content knowledge to enact STEM learning opportunities that connect to the reality of students? lives, including the strengths and sources of knowledge in their communities. Once the scholars graduate, they will continue to receive two years of support and guidance through an induction coach, a site-based school mentor, and a professional learning community. The induction process will include social-emotional support for Noyce Scholar graduates as they discuss and collaborate around different problems of practice related to being an anti-racist community-based STEM educator. Additional induction themes for the new teachers will include how to identify and leverage financial, human and social capital resources and development of an understanding of the ?hidden? or ?unstated? curriculum of and navigation within a high-need school or district. The project?s research and evaluation will generate new knowledge and fill gaps in the literature related to building engagement with community into teacher preparation and building the STEM engagement of diverse sets of students. The project?s commitment to community is further realized through the embedded Delphi study that applies a research process to understanding a broad range of perspectives on the possibilities of community-based STEM instruction. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these economic resources were brought to the surface along large faults which formed in the Late Cretaceous during a mountain building event, termed the Laramide orogeny. A key problem is that the timing and origin of the driving force behind this event and the formation of the Rocky Mountains are highly controversial and there is no consensus on the tectonic setting in which these mountains formed. The investigators hypothesize that the answer to understanding the origin of the Rocky Mountains and the Laramide orogeny lies in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California. This region contains two important features which make it the focus of this study: (1) they preserve a complete temporal history of the Laramide orogeny from the earliest phase until its termination, which is important in reconstructing the driving force behind the event, and (2) they contain a unique section of the deep crust including a major ductile fault system that was active during the beginning of the Laramide orogeny. Analysis of these features will offer critical insights on the beginning of the Laramide orogeny, which will be essential in resolving conflicting hypotheses. The research plan for this project will involve 3 seasons of field work and data collection in the San Gabriel and nearby mountains. Laboratory analyses of rocks collected from the San Gabriel Mountains will consist of geochronology, geochemistry and microstructural work at the California State University Northridge Laser Ablation and LatinXellence in STEM Laboratories. The project will advance societal outcomes through innovative summer workshops, and an academic-year mentoring program termed, LA-ROCS, both of which are aimed at providing research experiences to underrepresented students at minority-serving institutions in southern California. These mentorship and research opportunities for undergraduate students will expose them to cutting-edge analytical research facilities and will aid in developing a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.?<br/><br/>This proposal aims to resolve the controversial beginnings of the Laramide orogeny by testing conflicting hypotheses about the origin and tectonic effects of Laramide orogenesis on the evolution of the Southern California batholith at ca. 85-70 million years ago. This critical period in the development of the U.S. Cordillera is commonly associated with shallow-slab subduction beneath Southern California, which is thought to have driven the transition from thin-skin (Sevier-style) to thick-skin (Laramide-style) deformation. A key problem with the flat-slab model is that the team's preliminary geochronology data show that the initiation of the Laramide orogeny in Southern California is spatially and temporally linked to a magmatic flare-up event in the same region where flat-slab subduction is postulated to have occurred. This contradiction makes the Laramide orogeny distinct from other areas of flat-slab subduction, including the modern-day Sierras Pampeanas in Argentina, which is characterized by a magmatic gap. To resolve this problem, the investigators propose a multiscale approach that focuses on the roots of the Southern California batholith and combines field work with a variety of state-of-the art analytical techniques (Uranium-Lead geochronology, Hafnium- and Osmium-isotope geochemistry, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and microstructural analysis, structural analyses along continuous transects). These data will allow the investigators to link magmatism in the Southern California batholith with deformation and plate-kinematic information at mid-lower crustal depths to resolve conflicting models associated with the flat-slab paradigm and the initiation of the Laramide orogeny.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fate of muddy sediment is important in many ways.  Mud transport governs the fate of riverine pollutants, heavy metals and organic carbon; mud also is a key resource that can restore coastal areas and make flat, low-lying landscapes habitable. Growing evidence indicates that mud and organic matter in rivers are often bound together into large aggregates through a process called flocculation. This project will develop a predictive mathematical model for the transport of flocculated mud in rivers and apply the model to real-world coastal restoration problems in the Mississippi Delta wetlands. The project brings together a team from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of New Orleans (UNO), and the Water Institute of the Gulf, to solve environmental and societal challenges in the Gulf of Mexico region. The results will be shared with scientists in the Gulf Region from local, state, and federal agencies, academia, and environmental NGOs to influence coastal wetlands management decisions in the Mississippi Delta. The project will engage students from the University of New Orleans, who are directly affected by Mississippi Delta land loss, in a summer research program at Caltech.<br/><br/>Compared to sand, far less is known about the basic mechanics of mud transport and deposition in river systems. This is a major knowledge gap because mud adsorbs pollutants, nutrients and organic carbon, and the fate of this material directly impacts environmental quality and the global carbon cycle. Mud also is the primary building block of terrestrial and coastal landscapes: it builds floodplains, coastal wetlands and deltas, affects bank erosion rates and levee stability, and sets the depositional architecture of fluvial strata. In rivers, mud is typically considered as ?washload,? particles with settling velocities so small that they act as passive water tracers. However, growing evidence indicates that mud and organic matter in fluvial systems are often flocculated together into aggregates with settling velocities equivalent to sand. This project will develop a mechanistic model for freshwater flocculation using theory and semi-empirical relations from new flume experiments. A database of floc settling velocities from rivers will be compiled by inversion from concentration-depth profiles, to test the freshwater floc model using field data. The mud transport theory will be integrated into numerical models used for wetland restoration in the Mississippi Delta. A series of numerical experiments will evaluate the impact of flocculation on wetland accretion rates for engineered diversions that are needed to rebuild sinking wetlands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project has basic research, medical, and public health impact, since the analytical and experimental methods can be extended to elucidate mechanisms of infection spread by viruses of public health importance, including influenza A virus, Zika virus, and coronaviruses. As an interdisciplinary study, the research will cross-train mathematicians, biologists, and engineers, contributing significantly to workforce development.

A new mathematical framework, stochastic reaction-diffusion equations on metric graphs, will be developed to study the dynamics of virus infections over any network structure. The biological experiments are cutting edge: virus infections will be performed on micro-patterned host cells that enable quantification of population level features of infection spread in any network structure, a key advantage over traditional Petri-dish studies. Analysis of the experimentally informed stochastic equations has the potential to push the frontier of current knowledge about the role of space and stochasticity in population dynamics. This new framework motivates problems that cut across several mathematical disciplines (probability, partial differential equations and mathematical biology) and that are of interest to a large group of applied mathematicians and applied scientists. These problems include (i) What is the probability of extinction of virus and the propagation speed in terms of geometric properties of the metric graph, such as the branching structure and the edge lengths of the graph?

The recent advent of autonomous cars, drones and internet-of-things (IoT) further expands the reach of these ""real-time systems"". The limitations of such devices viz., small computing power, less memory, limited battery power, has serious consequences for security, specifically, they become much harder to protect and defend. This research develops systematic security mechanisms for real-time embedded systems in critical applications to control what can be observed about them.<br/> <br/>An important reason why real-time systems are vulnerable is the fact that they are predictable by design, thus leaking critical information. Leakage, say via timing ""side channels"", might be misused as part of a campaign to disrupt normal operations by knowing the schedule of when critical applications will run.  Any mitigations to information leakage must still allow real-time systems to operate within their required timing constraints. This project improves the security of real-time systems using concepts inspired from the area of differential privacy that was developed for database security, where the fundamental concept is to hide personally identifying information from queries on large databases by injecting ""noise"" in a systematic manner. By analogy for real-time systems, this project focuses on system states at runtime and develops the notion of ""schedule indistinguishability"" by strategically adding ""noise"" to the task scheduler, so individual tasks cannot be distinguished separately and cannot be known. The concept of ""epsilon-indistinguishability"" is developed to measure the probability of information leakage of schedule and timing information by observation of task-level behaviors. A task scheduler that effectively and efficiently uses indistinguishability is designed and prototyped.  In addition, the project focuses on developing metrics for real-time systems to measure and assess the risk mitigations of using schedule indistinguishability. The long-term goal of this research is to explore the relationships of ""indistinguishability"" for cyber-physical systems and their application domains with regard to security, safety, dependability, and resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the International Panel of Climate Change?s recent Sixth Assessment warns of an increase in the likelihood and magnitude of extreme flooding events in upcoming decades. Understanding the spatiotemporal variability of these changes is critical to mitigating their impact. However, current methods for spatial extreme value analysis are limited in their modeling flexibility and computational capabilities, and thus methodological work is required to analyze extreme events across the United States. Therefore, in this project, the investigators will develop new methodological and computational tools for spatial extreme value analysis and apply them to forecasting flood risk under a changing climate. The project team is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of statisticians and hydrologists to accomplish these ambitious objectives and ensure that the results are disseminated to the appropriate communities. The analysis combines fifty years of annual maximum streamflow observations at hundreds of gauges provided by the United States Geological Survey with CMIP6 climate model output produced under different climate scenarios. This analysis will provide high-resolution maps of anticipated change in flood risk and local flood frequency curves to inform water infrastructure projects. A highlight of the project is a workshop that will foster synergy between statisticians and hydrologists by encouraging the sharing of ideas, approaches and solutions to flood risk prediction, and aid in the formulation of a common language shared by statisticians and hydrologists for successful transfer of knowledge across disciplines. The overall objective is to improve resiliency to extreme flooding events in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>This project will result in major advances in both spatial extreme value analysis and hydrology. The investigators will pursue two methods that exploit recent developments in distributed computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, respectively, to improve computation for spatial extreme value analysis. Computation for spatial extremes is challenging because the most common model is the max-stable process, and this model gives an intractable likelihood function and is thus not conducive to direct application of maximum likelihood or Bayesian analysis. To overcome this difficulty, this project will develop a divide-and-conquer method that analyzes data separately by subregion and then combines the results using generalized method of moments techniques. It is shown that this procedure has desirable theoretical properties and gives substantial performance gain over state-of-the-art methods. The project also develops a new method under the Bayesian framework that is preferred for uncertainty quantification. The new method decomposes the intractable likelihood function into a sequence of simpler functions, and uses deep-learning distribution regression to approximate these simpler functions. This approximation can be arbitrarily precise with computational requirements that scale linearly with the number of spatial locations, facilitating analysis of large datasets. The project culminates with the analysis of flood-frequency curves across the US. Compared to current methods, by using spatial extreme value analysis the analysis borrows information across space to improve estimation of small probabilities and estimate the probability of multiple locations simultaneously experiencing an extreme event. This project will produce new software for extreme value analysis and also train two graduate students in theoretical, computational and applied extreme value analysis in hydrology with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elementary teachers are often uncomfortable teaching science, mathematics, and engineering as independent subjects, and STEM integration poses new challenges. Previous research has explored links between confidence (or self-efficacy), teacher effectiveness, and teacher retention, but self-efficacy for teaching integrated STEM (iSTEM) is largely unexplored. This project will include approximately 700 teachers who experienced ten different teacher preparation programs. It aims to identify programmatic features that support early career elementary teachers? self-efficacy in teaching integrated STEM within high-need school districts. It will examine relationships among self-efficacy, iSTEM teaching effectiveness, and teacher retention. The findings that result from this project have the potential to inform the design of teacher education programs and may contribute to the development of more highly qualified elementary STEM teachers.<br/><br/>This project at Southern Methodist University, University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Towson University, and Indiana University Southeast includes partnerships with the University of Massachusetts - Boston, Sacred Heart University, Alcorn State University, Bridgewater State University, Montclair State University, and University of Rhode Island.  Project goals include to:  (1) track changes in prospective elementary teachers? integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy as they shift from teacher preparation programs to teaching positions; (2) identify and describe key elements of teacher education that support the development of integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy among early-career teachers; (3) identify the relationships among integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy, teaching effectiveness, and teacher retention; and (4) build and support a community of elementary teachers focused on improving their STEM teaching. Grounded in self-efficacy theory, this project will use a sequential explanatory mixed methods design and include undergraduates, Master?s students, and current teachers who are within their first five years of teaching. The project?s longitudinal design, innovative focus on integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy and effectiveness, and investigation of links between integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy and teacher retention reflect its intellectual merit. Research findings will be published in research and practitioner journals and shared widely at international conferences to impact researchers, administrators, and educators beyond the immediate scope of this project.

Soft materials are found across a variety of engineering domains, ranging from elastomeric dampers in aerospace applications to compliant robotic devices designed for wearability. Traditional techniques for characterizing the response of material structures to dynamic loading fail for soft materials due to the combined effects of large deformations and complex material behaviors. In contrast, the experimental and theoretical framework developed in this project will focus precisely on resonant conditions that produce significant material deformations and activate the strongest dissipative and nonlinear forces. This framework will generate new insights into the occurrence of localized damage in soft materials, for example during transient loading events such as sudden impacts. These insights will be particularly transformative for structural health monitoring of soft structures, including biological systems such as human organs. Project outcomes have the potential to inform research in the biomechanics of traumatic brain injury, one of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents in the US. A closely integrated research and education plan will excite student engagement in STEM through curriculum development, outreach workshops on helmet design, and digital arts exhibits. A dedicated effort to increase participation from the LGBTQ+ community, where a STEM visibility and underrepresentation problem currently exists, includes annual events, workshops, and mentoring networks.<br/> <br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to a modeling and system identification framework for characterizing the deformation response of highly damped, soft materials to steady-state and transient loading, with particular emphasis on deformation localization and damage in heterogeneous, membranous material systems. It achieves this aim by analyzing amplitude resonance backbones in models of highly damped, soft material systems with complex, distributed internal forces, studying the correspondence between such amplitude resonances and the transient impact response, and validating these predictions using magnetic resonance imaging of silicone phantoms representing biological tissue. An efficient computational framework will be developed to enable parameter continuation of amplitude resonance backbones for large-scale models using an innovative combination of the method of harmonic balance, finite-element simulations, and a novel Bayesian Fourier Neural Operator-based machine learning technique. Computational modeling of real-world head impacts will be used to determine the relationship between amplitude resonance backbones and impact-induced strain localization patterns in the human brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simulations can play a role in this mission by enabling rapid virtual testing of combustors at various design configurations, so that promising designs can be selected for physical prototyping. However, turbulent combustion simulations involve solving for a large number of molecular species that are produced and consumed as part of the combustion process. Due to this, combustion simulations require the use of many computer processors for several hours on supercomputers or compute clusters. This limits the usefulness of promising computer models for practical design and optimization endeavors. This work contributes to the ongoing quest to develop reduced combustion models that decrease the simulation times and required computing resources, yet preserve accuracy.<br/><br/>In response to the excessive computational costs of turbulent combustion, physics-based reduced-order models have been introduced. These models often solve chemistry in an ?offline? phase, store the solution in a table, and then interpolate the table?s entries to retrieve the chemical state during the ?online? phase. The use of these lookup tables, however, suffers from the curse of dimensionality, wherein the size of the table and the interpolation complexities increase exponentially with the number of control variables. As a result, these lookup tables are limited to situations that employ a few control variables, thus preventing their application to many practical combustion devices. This work aims to address this problem by developing machine learning strategies to efficiently learn combustion physics within physically derived low-dimensional manifolds. This will be achieved by introducing machine learning models that are adaptive, consistent with the underlying physical laws, and suitable for high-dimensional combustion state spaces. This work will enable simulations at levels of fidelity that are currently impossible to perform using traditional tabulation techniques, and therefore, will aid in the design and development of clean and efficient combustion technologies. Furthermore, the tools developed in this study will be vital to the broad area of scientific machine learning, which continues to have an increasingly important impact on the modeling of many physical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the way people initially perceive others is often inaccurate and systematically biased towards negative perceptions. For example, when first exposed to faces that are hard to see or that have subtle expressions, people report that these faces look threatening (even when they are not). This project examines a bias to judge unfamiliar others in crowds as being angry. This research tests whether a perceiver's bias to judge others as angry depends on the others' race and gender, whether the others are alone or in a crowd, and the perceiver's own beliefs about race and gender. Racial and gender bias in crowd perception is not simply an academic issue. Crowds have been at the center stage of protest and social unrest moments that are causing vastly divergent interpretations of current events. This project reveals who may be most susceptible to negative crowd biases, the underlying visual and cognitive process that cause biased judgments, and the malleability of these biases. <br/><br/>This research utilizes state-of-the-art methods and statistical tools to examine visual attention to faces, and bias and accuracy in emotion judgments (specifically, eye-tracking data, signal detection methods, and drift-diffusion modeling). The approach makes it possible to track visual patterns ? for example, which faces people look at first in a crowd, how long they look at each face, whether they ignore anyone, whether faces appear alone or in a crowd ? all of which are likely to be affected by the racial and gender features of the faces. Newly-developed materials include an extensive set of computer-generated faces that have been designed with precise variations in gender and racial features. Tracking visual patterns and judgements of these computer-generated faces can establish at what point, for whom, and why bias occurs for crowd perception. Additional materials include a representative set of crowd images from real-life settings (i.e., published in popular news sources), which help to advance an understanding of how people perceive and react to crowds they typically encounter as part of their daily lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently there is a shortage of qualified technicians for the aerospace industry in Northeast Florida. To be successful in the aerospace workforce, students need to learn skills associated with the design and fabrication of products using lightweight materials. This includes an understanding of the technologies used to create these products such as additive manufacturing, fiber composites fabrication, polymer fabrication, and computer-numerical control in metal working. This project will create a new curriculum within an existing engineering technology degree program that focuses on these skills and techniques. As students complete courses in the program, they will have the opportunity to earn three industry certifications. Students will learn how to use these manufacturing technologies through hands-on training. To increase the number of students in the aerospace technician pipeline, dual enrollment courses will be offered for high school students. Project results and educational resources will be made available through the ATE Central Portal.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to increase the number of qualified aerospace technicians in Northeast Florida. The project will: (1) create a new Advanced Materials Design in Manufacturing track within the current engineering technology degree program, (2)  prepare students to earn at least three industry-recognized credentials in space materials manufacturing, (3) develop a Space Materials Manufacturing Laboratory to help students learn manufacturing techniques, and (4) create a career pathway for secondary students. Using best practices from the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center as well as existing institutional programs, the project team will recruit students from underrepresented groups to broaden participation in the aerospace technical workforce. Professional development for community college instructors and secondary teachers will provide hands-on training on space materials and fabrication techniques. The project will assess student learning gains due to the new curriculum by comparing the results of pre- and post-tests.

Speakers rarely produce identical versions of the same speech sound, because everyone has a personal way of talking depending on their dialect, gender, and age. Other factors, such as fatigue or excitement, might change moment-to-moment. Although listeners are usually able to adapt to these differences, research has yet to discover exactly how this adaptation works. This project establishes a new tool for creating experimental stimuli that can generate the wide variation that occurs in natural speech and uses this tool to examine how listeners adapt to talker differences. The experiments test the ways that listeners incorporate new evidence from a talker?s voice, how they use existing knowledge about the speech sounds in their language, how they learn what to ignore, and how individuals may differ in their ability to adapt to a talker. The project has potentially broad societal benefits because it will provide foundational knowledge on how people communicate with each other and provide hands-on education for undergraduate and graduate trainees who will develop skills for experimental design, computer programming, data analysis, and science communication. The project will also create tools for other researchers, including an open-access stimulus corpus and brief lecture videos and assignments that can be used to teach students and others about the physics of sound, thus promoting scientific literacy among the public. All materials associated with this project will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project unites psycholinguistic experimentation, signal processing, and computational modeling to test three key parts of a Bayesian belief-updating model of speech adaptation: (1) beliefs reflect listeners? knowledge of the relationship between cue distributions and phonetic categories, (2) adaptation reflects integration of observed evidence with prior beliefs that can be driven by both unsupervised and supervised learning signals, and (3) belief-updating is context-specific (e.g., conditioned on talker). The project will establish a novel method for creating fricative continua, create an extensive stimulus corpus, and compare learning between the stimulus corpus and natural stimuli. The novel method of stimulus creation will be used to generate sounds that independently manipulate frequency scaling (reflecting vocal tract size) and gain properties (reflecting specific speech articulations) of fricative cues to discover which specific cues guide learning and how that information generalizes (or not) across talkers. The experiments will also examine how listeners integrate unsupervised and lexically supervised learning signals over time, providing insight into the influence of prior exposure on lexically guided learning and individual differences in learning. These are important innovations because they address two weaknesses in the existing perceptual learning literature, including the practice of superimposing two sounds to create ambiguous input that might be unnatural and the failure to measure incremental change in perception over time. Theoretical benefits include a strong test of the Bayesian belief-updating model of speech adaptation, identification of specific cues that drive perceptual learning, and unpacking how perceptual learning integrates unsupervised and lexically supervised signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When extrapolated to Earth?s deep interior, to the boundary between the liquid core and overlying solid mantle, this weak surface field appears as prominent patches of reversed polarity beneath South Africa and Patagonia. This pattern, together with the rapidly decreasing field strength, has led to hotly debated speculation that Earth is in the early stages of a geomagnetic polarity reversal. Principal limitations in this debate have been a lack of data for the last 1500 years from key regions in the Southern Hemisphere and theoretical understanding of deep Earth controls on magnetic fields. To address these limitations, this project will refine the archeomagnetic record of the southern Hemisphere, develop numerical simulations to explore the affect the deep Earth has on magnetic fields, and integrate these two components to explore whether the unusual mantle beneath South Africa and Patagonia (the African Low Shear Velocity Province) places a first-order control on the character of the South Atlantic Anomaly. This project will foster international collaboration with archeologists from South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, develop a revised geodynamo code that will be made available to the community, and support of graduate and undergraduate students who will receive a broad training in the field, experimental rock and paleomagnetism, and geophysical modeling.<br/><br/>This project will support a collaborative study that will bring together workers in disparate disciplines and subdisciplines to further refine the archeomagnetic record and more directly test the efficacy of Low Shear Velocity Province control on the character of the geomagnetic field. Specifically, the research team will: (i) conduct field studies including field surveys and collection materials with the goal of refining the Iron Age archeomagnetic record with potential application to both deep Earth and to archeological problems; (ii) conduct rock magnetic, analytical microscopy, and paleomagnetic analyses and processing of field magnetic survey data to define ambient magnetic fields of the collection sites, magnetic carriers in the collected archeological artifacts, and ancient recordings of direction and intensity with the goal of testing primary hypothesis of the proposed work; and (iii) use numerical dynamo simulations to investigate whether the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province can locally defect core flow, drive the magnetic Reynolds number toward unity, favoring magnetic diffusion and flux expulsion, and thus place first-order controls on geomagnetic observations made at Earth?s surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field of conformal geometry has had rich interactions with both geometric analysis and physics, especially high-energy and condensed-matter physics, over the past three decades. The benefits have been bidirectional in both cases: conformal geometry has led to the development of new analytic tools infused by geometric intuitions, which in turn lead to the solution of important geometric problems. Similarly, physics is a source both of new problems and of important insights, while conformal geometry provides crucial tools in the solution of physical problems. This conference will bring together experts from all of these fields to share and discuss their research and benefit from each other's perspectives and tools. It is expected that the conference will stimulate further development in all three fields and cooperation across many kinds of boundaries. Facilitating entry of early-career researchers into dialog with all three areas is a particular goal for this event. A poster session will be held for students.<br/><br/>Conformal geometry is the geometry of spaces where angles are defined, but not lengths. It has had a long and, recently, fast-growing relevance in physics, where it is a tool that provides new perspectives on many old phenomena. Conversely, physics has been a rich source of insights and problems in conformal geometry. For many years now, conformal geometry itself has provided some of the most compelling problems in geometric analysis, while techniques from analysis, scattering theory, and partial differential equations have enabled tremendous progress in the field. The primary goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from the three title areas whose work overlaps, in order to disseminate progress, share interesting problems, build relationships, and broaden perspectives. The conference will allow exposure to relevant state-of-the-art techniques in conformal geometry, analysis, and physics to be shared with other interested practitioners in each field. It will foster international collaboration between the US and other countries, and also collaboration between mathematicians and physicists. Junior participants will gain valuable insights, and relationships with more senior practitioners that may shape both their career and their mathematical (or physical) perspectives. Opportunity will be given for them to present their own work, and collaboration opportunities will exist between researchers at all levels.

This project seeks to overcome these limitations through a new type of image representation based on neural networks that is more compatible with standard computational imaging models. The main research aims are to develop a theory quantifying the expected accuracy of computational imaging techniques using these neural-network image representations, and to derive efficient estimation algorithms applicable to practical high-resolution imaging problems.

Specific objectives of this project include (1) developing a sampling theory for the unique identifiability of CBNNs from a finite set of linear projection measurements and recovery guarantees for the associated non-convex optimization problem, and (2) developing efficient algorithms for accelerated training of CBNNs that scale to practical imaging scenarios.

At the same time, these ever-increasing data sets are used to harness information to make critical and everyday decisions. In that setting, data systems support every aspect of human activity by offering efficient ingestion of incoming data and quick access to perform analysis tasks. To ensure efficient data ingestion and analysis, data systems developers and administrators tune these systems based on the expectation (or knowledge) of the workload; that is, the operations to be submitted. Further, data systems aim to offer both fast and predictable performance; however, their deployment faces several challenges. On the one hand, many applications are volatile because of factors such as variations in access patterns or that the frequency of operations submitted varies wildly throughout the day. Thus, it is hard to know what workload to expect and, as a result, to tune them. On the other hand, data systems are increasingly deployed in shared infrastructure like public and private clouds, which brings a new set of challenges: the new, more diverse hardware and infrastructure makes the execution environment even more unpredictable, since compute, memory, and storage resource availability may also vary. Further, storing data in shared infrastructure must comply with new regulations, e.g., about privacy and data stewardship. The project will develop data systems that offer high and predictable performance and make regulatory requirements a first-class citizen. Ultimately, the project will make it easier for non-expert users to deploy data systems in the wild.<br/><br/>The researchers will develop a new breed of robust log-structured merge (LSM) based data systems that can offer near-optimal performance despite potential uncertainty in the execution setting and increase performance predictability. The project focuses on LSM-based data systems, a key technology used as the backbone of several data system designs today, including SQL, NoSQL, key-value stores, and time-series management. In order to address the execution setting volatility and provide an ideal LSM data system design, the project takes a new radical approach, one that incorporates uncertainty in tuning input (e.g., workload, resource availability) and addresses both the unpredictability of key LSM operations (like compactions) and the inaccuracy of cost-models. The proposal investigates techniques that combine state-of-the-art tuning methods with robust optimization while building on recent algorithmic and hardware advancements. This work will produce systems that depend less on the specific execution instance and exhibit stable performance despite workload and resource variability. As a result, robust LSM-based data systems will require less human intervention, and they will be more appealing to both users and administrators, allowing organizations to widely deploy reliable systems to accelerate and support data-intensive scientific discovery and applications. Such ease of deployment is timely as data management is increasingly becoming an automatic service, where human experts cannot always be in the loop to hand-tune and optimize data systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before children can speak, they feel emotions such as anger, joy, curiosity, and frustration and these emotions act as internal and external signals as they learn what words mean. For example, a child might show frustration when a caregiver does not understand what the child is saying, which in turn helps the child change what they understand a word or phrase to mean or how it is pronounced. The setting in which child language learning takes place is co-located where children are in the same physical location as the people they are learning language from, and the learning is through the communicative medium of spoken interaction. The information sources, emotions, and spoken interaction setting for children are in direct contrast to how machines learn language, which usually involves some kind of computational model that is given large amounts of text to learn from. This project aims to take inspiration from how children learn language in order to understand how to improve the models and methods of machines that learn language. Improved language learning in machines will enable machines to communicate with people more quickly, clearly, safely, and in ways that lower barriers for people to use complex technology with a natural spoken language interface. <br/><br/>This CAREER project examines a novel approach for computer systems to learn spoken language that will advance a theoretical model and improve how people and systems communicate. Research will improve language modeling in natural language processing by taking inspiration from how children learn language: they interact with others to learn words that denote physical entities and events, and, like all humans, often respond emotionally and embody how they feel in their behavior, whereas researchers currently largely train language models only on static text. The research team will use two robotic platforms for the research and significantly enrich model efficacy and will add knowledge of emotion by modeling it based on human perceptions of robot behaviors. The team will add embodied knowledge by grounding into vision and robot states, and finally, the team will train and evaluate a robot that uses the language model as it interacts with humans to learn language from them. The study will also result in two important datasets: robot behaviors with accompanying descriptions of those behaviors and emotion labels, and longitudinal data of robots interacting and learning language from humans. The objectives are to (1) Model emotion; test, and refine through interaction, (2) Develop a unified language model, and (3) Engage people and robots that learn language with emotional content.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CISE/IIS/Robust Intelligence Program and the NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building partnerships between academia, industry, non-profits, and economic agencies is an effective approach to improving educational pathways and leveraging local resources to help train students to meet this demand. The project team will work with industry partners to identify the skills that are needed so that students will be successful in the technician workforce. Community colleges rely heavily on adjunct instructors from industry to train students. Courses in advanced manufacturing technician degree programs require adjunct faculty with current and applied knowledge and skills which are continually changing in the rapidly automating manufacturing environment. This project will help industry employees engage in technician education programs as adjunct instructors, providing qualified educators for these programs. Better industry partnerships will help support recruitment and retention of students to produce more advanced manufacturing technicians. Industry employees will serve as adjuncts in the classroom to improve student competencies and outside the classroom to engage secondary and underrepresented students in advanced manufacturing. This project will advance understanding of the effectiveness of industry-academic partnerships in leveraging local resources and growing the advanced manufacturing workforce.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve advanced manufacturing technician training by: (1) growing industry partnerships to improve instruction and curriculum content, (2) training industry professionals to serve as faculty in technical education degree programs, and (3) strengthening career pathways for students through partnerships between industry, local economic agencies, and non-profits. This project will organize multiple Collaborative Working Groups for different industry sectors that have representatives from regional advanced manufacturing companies that currently have or will need technicians. These groups will review technical degree programs and make recommendations, participate in student outreach activities, and develop internship opportunities for students. A new online training course will be developed to provide training for industry adjunct faculty on effective teaching practices, the use of instructional technology, and communicating with students. This project will provide opportunities for secondary students to learn about technician careers in advanced manufacturing by bringing students to campus to participate in hands-on learning activities in the lab facilities.

As robots engage in tasks as diverse as helping with household work, deploying medication, and tutoring students, it becomes increasingly critical for them to interact naturally with the people around them. Key to this progress is the development of robots that acquire an understanding of goals and objects from natural communications with a diverse set of end users. One way to address this is using language to build systems that learn from people they are interacting with. Algorithms and systems developed in this project will allow robots to learn about the world around them from linguistic interactions. This research will focus on understanding spoken language about the physical world from diverse groups of people, resulting in systems that are more able to robustly handle a wide variety of real-world interactions. Ultimately, the project will increase the usability and fairness of robots deployed in human spaces.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will study how robots can learn about noisy, unpredictable human environments from spoken language combined with perception, using context derived from sensors to constrain the learning problem. Grounded language refers to language that occurs in and refers to the physical world in which robots operate. Human interactions are fundamentally contextual: when learning about the world, we focus learning by considering not only direct communication but also the context of that interaction. For much existing work on learning to understand physically situated language, text is the primary interlingua, and context is considered relatively narrowly. Additionally, reliance on pre-existing large datasets has begun to raise questions about bias and inclusivity in learning-driven technologies. To address these limitations, this work will focus on learning semantics directly from perceptual inputs combined with speech from diverse sources. The goal is to develop learning infrastructure, algorithms, and approaches to enable robots to learn to understand task instructions and object descriptions from spoken communication with end users. The project will develop new methods of efficiently learning from multi-modal data inputs, with the ultimate goal of enabling robots to efficiently and naturally learn about their world and the tasks they should perform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will support pre-service and in-service teachers in professional development that will prepare them to teach about climate change in community-specific ways. This project aims to advance elementary teachers' development in three high-impact areas: (a) their self-efficacy toward teaching climate change science or beliefs and attitudes about teaching climate change science; (b) their science content knowledge around climate change; and (c) their climate change identity, or how they view their agency and role in climate change. Participating in-service teachers will co-design a climate change instructional model by adding activities to the Global Climate Change and Urban Heat Island WISE unit and lessons around locally relevant phenomena--such as biodiversity loss and deforestation. The lessons will engage students in exploring the relationship between local environmental change and global climate systems through the use of data, simulations, and models. Community and school-based gardens are proposed as an instructional approach to support teachers in contextualizing climate science, building partnerships, and facilitating student learning through hands-on environmental action.

Understanding and controlling degradation of polymer networks plays a vital role in a multitude of applications from wound dressings and tissue adhesives to the delivery of drugs and the growth regulation of neural networks. Of particular interest is light-induced degradation with its potential to spatially resolve the control over physical and chemical properties of degrading polymeric materials. Current models, often analytic and continuum approaches that inform our understanding of polymer network degradation, focus on small or large length scales. Small and large length scales reach down to the level of individual atoms and extend to and beyond visible distances, respectively. Our understanding on intermediate length scales, from a few nanometers to tens or hundreds of micrometers that are known as the mesoscale, remains limited.  The development of an efficient computational approach for modeling the dynamics of degrading polymer networks on the mesoscale is expected to advance fundamental understanding and help establish guidelines for efficient design of degradable materials. The project includes ample research and educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students; strong emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups. Some of the outcomes of the research will be incorporated into courses taught by the PI, and relevant educational materials will be made available via a science and engineering gateway that is part of the Network for Computational Nanotechnology.<br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>This award supports the development of a computational modeling framework that captures photo-controlled degradation of polymer networks at the mesoscale. A suitable Dissipative Particle Dynamics approach capturing erosion, reverse gelation, and elasticity of the degrading network will be developed and validated. To establish a reliable model of degradation, a modified Segmental Repulsive Potential will be used to prevent unphysical topological crossings of bonded polymer chains. As a model system, hydrogels formed by the end-linking of four-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) macromolecular precursors, often referred to as tetra-PEG gels, are chosen. The four-arm PEG precursors can be modified during their synthesis by including photocleavable functional groups to enable controlled degradation. The applicability of the proposed model can be extended to various network architectures and used to study their behavior under externally imposed conditions. To demonstrate the utility of the developed mesoscale approach, it will be used to capture the effects of controlled degradation on spreading and reconstruction of nanogel particles at liquid-liquid interfaces. An original multiscale model of early stages of gel degradation will also be developed, where the mesoscale model will be effectively scaled up into the respective continuum model.<br/> <br/>       The development of an efficient computational approach for modeling the dynamics of degrading polymer networks will advance fundamental knowledge by accounting for the specifics of network architecture, diffusion of all the involved species, hydrodynamic interactions, network heterogeneities, and reaction rate constants that are locally controlled by the solvent quality. Proposed simulation methods will allow to probe the applicability of relevant network theories at the mesoscale and may establish guidelines for future design of novel degrading materials with dynamically and spatially controlled properties. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students and support diversity. Research outcomes will be incorporated into courses taught by the PI, and relevant educational materials will be made available through the NanoHub portal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contrary to conventional chemical reactivity, the rates for these reactions are expected to increase as temperature decreases; however, this inverted temperature dependence is challenging to measure in the laboratory. The experimental challenges will be overcome by devising new instrumentation to prepare reactants at low temperatures and measure reactivity through direct detection by mass spectrometry. The results will provide insight into a class of reactions occurring in cold astrophysical objects and test theoretical predictions at a fundamental level. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this multidisciplinary research, and the team will collaborate closely with faculty from nearby Prince George?s Community College to provide research opportunities for students in their associate degree program, many of whom are members of underrepresented groups. The broader impacts of this work will include a more complete picture of ion/molecule radiative association reactions that invites collaboration with theoretical chemists and contributes to the understanding of planetary and stellar evolution. <br/><br/>This project will develop the cryogenic cooling techniques necessary to study ion/molecule radiative association reactions at low temperatures (down to 10 K). The radiative association of metal monocations (such as magnesium) and cyanopolyynes is predicted to have a rate that depends strongly on the rotational energy and dipole moment of the neutral reactant. To directly measure the temperature-dependent rates, the cold ions and molecules will be produced independently prior to reaction. Gaseous atomic metal ions will be generated in a glow-discharge ion source and trapped and cooled in a cryogenic multipole ion trap. The cyanopolyyne neutral reactant will be cooled in a buffer-gas collision cell before being injected into the ion trap. Kinetics data will be obtained from the time-dependent ion signals. The dependence of the measured rate constant on reactant rotational energy and dipole moment will provide independent data necessary to test discrepancies between theoretical methods that currently differ by up to four orders of magnitude.

This type of injury is an important and dangerous type of head injury in which a person may be exposed to several repeated minor head impacts.

Over time, this increases the risk of serious brain injury. The connection between the brain and the skull determines how each impact affects the brain. This research will quantify how repeated head impacts damage the brain/skull interface and evaluate how this damage increases the risk of traumatic brain injury. Data and methods from this study will provide guidance to improve detection of mild traumatic brain injury.  These results will also enhance prediction of those at risk of severe traumatic brain injury.  Ultimately, these results will contribute to return-to-work/play guidelines.

This project will involve undergraduate researchers and contribute to their professional development.  Outreach to the general public will also expand the reach of the project.<br/><br/>Computational biomechanics of traumatic brain injury has historically focused on single head impacts and has not considered cumulative damage, ignoring a potentially critical component of individualized head injury risk.

To achieve this objective, the research team will experimentally measure tissue damage progression in response to repeated exposures in experiments on meninges and blood vessels, and generate constitutive models that capture damage with each exposure. A multiscale modeling approach will be used to efficiently incorporate the microstructural constitutive formulations into a macroscale model of traumatic brain injury.

Myriad studies have been performed to reconstruct the geologic and geographic histories of these blocks and to develop a chronology of how western North America was assembled. One of the enduring controversies is how far-travelled are some of these terranes. In particular, researchers debate the distance that one exotic block ? the Insular superterrane ? has been translated. Some argue that it has migrated >1500 kilometers northward ? and perhaps eastward ? along the North American margin, while others believe it has always remained near its present-day latitude. These hypotheses will be evaluated by looking for connections between zircons crystallizing in the Coast Mountains batholith (part of the Insular superterrane) and those that have been recycled into sedimentary rocks of interior Canada. The presence or absence of the distinctive Coast Mountains batholith zircon fingerprint in rocks at similar latitudes will either refute or support the idea that the Coast Mountains were far away at the time of deposition of the targeted sedimentary strata. The proposed research will support students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as a postdoctoral scholar. It will broaden and diversify the STEM workforce through promotion of early career female scientists and the inclusion of underrepresented minority students from Hispanic-serving institutions. <br/><br/>One of the most critical unresolved questions in the tectonics of the North American Cordillera concerns the degree of tectonic mobility of terranes during Late Jurassic and Cretaceous time. End-member hypotheses posit that terranes presently located in British Columbia and southeast Alaska were either: 1) translated from the latitude of (Baja) California, and perhaps outboard of the Mezcalera Ocean basin, or 2) have remained near their present position and along the continental margin. The debate between the two forms the basis for the enduring ?Baja-BC? controversy, which has been reinvigorated by discussion in recently published syntheses. These end-member hypotheses will be tested by determining whether detrital zircons in foreland basin strata of Alberta, Canada (part of stable North America) were derived from the Coast Mountains batholith (CMB; part of the purportedly mobile terrane). This test is enabled by the recent recognition that zircons from igneous rocks of the CMB are isotopically and geochemically distinct from other coeval arcs along the margin (e.g. the Sierra Nevada and Idaho batholiths). The study will: (1) define zircon age, Hf isotopic composition and trace element trends in plutons of the CMB, (2) generate similar data for plutons of the Omineca belt (a second suite of Cretaceous plutons in British Columbia), and (3) compare these igneous records with new studies of zircons in Cretaceous-Paleogene strata of the foreland basin in the northern Cordillera. Establishing connections between the CMB and inland foreland basin strata would provide strong support for models that invoke limited tectonic mobility, whereas the lack of such connections would support models that involve large-scale north-south and/or east-west displacements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will broaden and diversify the STEM workforce through promotion of early career female scientists and the inclusion of underrepresented minority students from Hispanic-serving institutions. <br/><br/>One of the most critical unresolved questions in the tectonics of the North American Cordillera concerns the degree of tectonic mobility of terranes during Late Jurassic and Cretaceous time. End-member hypotheses posit that terranes presently located in British Columbia and southeast Alaska were either: 1) translated from the latitude of (Baja) California, and perhaps outboard of the Mezcalera Ocean basin, or 2) have remained near their present position and along the continental margin. The debate between the two forms the basis for the enduring ?Baja-BC? controversy, which has been reinvigorated by discussion in recently published syntheses. We will test these end-member hypotheses by determining whether detrital zircons in foreland basin strata of Alberta, Canada (part of stable North America) were derived from the Coast Mountains batholith (CMB; part of the purportedly mobile terrane). This test is enabled by the recent recognition that zircons from igneous rocks of the CMB are isotopically and geochemically distinct from other coeval arcs along the margin (e.g. the Sierra Nevada and Idaho batholiths). Our study will: (1) define zircon age, Hf isotopic composition and trace element trends in plutons of the CMB, (2) generate similar data for plutons of the Omineca belt (a second suite of Cretaceous plutons in British Columbia), and (3) compare these igneous records with new studies of zircons in Cretaceous-Paleogene strata of the foreland basin in the northern Cordillera. Establishing connections between the CMB and inland foreland basin strata would provide strong support for models that invoke limited tectonic mobility, whereas the lack of such connections would support models that involve large-scale north-south and/or east-west displacements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work seeks to address critical gaps in knowledge of RBCs using a variety of techniques that will probe internal, external, and membrane alterations due to changes in RBC health. This will elicit further understanding of early changes in RBC-related diseases such as malaria, anemia, and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to progressing research, this CAREER award will educate the future workforce as well as the community, who need to make informed decisions regarding new technologies. This project will teach students research concepts, expose them to novel cell characterization and state-of-the-art technologies, and train them how to communicate their work with the public. <br/><br/>Current red blood cell (RBC) analysis often relies on manual observations to changes in cell morphology or behavior. Electrical measures of a cell contain vital information about their function(s). They are, however, difficult to measure. Standard techniques typically measure no more than a few cells and require skilled technicians to complete the analysis. Further, no technique accounts for all ionic currents present in a cell. Still, broader impact of these measurements remains high, particularly in drug discovery and disease progression. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to investigate the existence of an interconnected ?cell electrome? in the analysis of RBCs and RBC health monitoring. As the proteome is the complete set of proteins expressed by a cell, the ?electrome? represents the complete set of ionic currents present in a cell and includes cell surface zeta-potential, membrane potential, and Dielectrophoresis (DEP)-measured membrane conductance, membrane capacitance, and cytoplasm conductivity. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is an electrokinetic technique that relies on the electrophysiological properties of cells and the suspending media as well as the geometry of the applied electric field to induce movement of these cells. Since DEP does not rely on biomarkers or other fluorescent labels, it has become an increasingly popular method of cell characterization. The primary hypothesis of this work is that DEP parameters can robustly describe changes in RBC electrome due to oxidative stress, a dominant factor in RBC-related diseases, providing a rapid and label-free biomarker. How these parameters are linked will increase understanding of RBC electrophysiology and its role in RBC-related diseases. The electrome, once understood in RBCs, could be expanded to other, more complicated cell types and may also explain behaviors in these other cells such as electrophysiology alterations to influence cell-to-cell interactions in metastasizing cancer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, those who bear the heaviest burdens of racial injustice?namely, students of color and their families?are rarely meaningfully included in conceptualizing and implementing equity-oriented initiatives. Policymakers and administrators have often treated curricular and pedagogical change as something that should be done to or for these students and families, not with or by them. The proposed project seeks to investigate the possibilities and challenges of using a participatory approach to research and design, centering Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Hmong students and their families in imagining and creating change. This approach has the potential to disrupt inequitable practices of mathematics education as well as undemocratic processes for making decisions about mathematics education. Further, it will be a catalyst for developing racially just practices and processes in mathematics education. This CAREER award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is also supported by the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EHR Racial Equity), which supports projects that advance racial equity in STEM education and workforce development through research and practice.<br/><br/>This project will generate new knowledge about the possibilities and limitations of participatory design research (PDR) as a method for advancing equity in mathematics education through PDR cycles at three middle schools over the five years of the project. These cycles include families of color participating in mathematical activity, sharing their experiences, collecting data germane to their experiences, and making recommendations to create more equitable practices and policies in mathematics education. Thus, PDR cycles provide a more democratic and egalitarian means of understanding and addressing social problems than traditional research methods. Educational activities culminating from this research include the development of graduate-level curriculum related to PDR. This project will also contribute groundbreaking evidence of how families, educators, and school leaders can use PDR to shift power dynamics and make systemic change in mathematics education by centering the voices and knowledge of students of color and their families. It will add to the small body of literature regarding how students of color and their families understand racial equity and justice in mathematics education.

Such tasks require a careful representation of uncertainty so that we can protect ourselves against rare but costly mistakes and detect if we are operating outside of standard parameters. We can further improve performance if we can incorporate prior knowledge into how we represent uncertainty. For example, we may believe that the label of an image should not change if the image is rotated or translated. Incorporating this knowledge enables efficient learning from a small amount of information, as well as greater accuracy and reliability, often making the difference between which problems can be solved and which cannot. This research makes it possible to represent uncertainty in sophisticated models that learn from data, while specifying detailed prior knowledge, providing particular resilience to changing environments. It also significantly reduces the computations needed for a robust uncertainty representation, leading to computer models that can quantify uncertainty more quickly and reliably, at lower cost. With systems that can encode uncertainty and efficiently transfer knowledge to new environments, we facilitate accurate medical diagnoses, reliable infrastructure, and life-saving scientific discoveries. The scientific innovations we develop through this work will be included in popular educational textbooks, and used as the basis for projects in outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to have Bayesian deep learning guide the research trajectory of the deep learning community at large, with principled approaches to foundational questions, such as how to manage the trade-off between inductive biases and flexibility. This goal has implications for essentially any predictive task, improving accuracy and robustness, while providing reliable uncertainty estimates for decision making. There are three key parts to this research, which form a natural synergy. The first thrust pursues new priors that combine flexibility with useful inductive biases, and provide good out-of-distribution generalization. 	 These priors provide a mechanism for encoding high level concepts into prior distributions, such as locality, independencies, and symmetries, without constraining model flexibility. To realize the benefits of these priors, the next thrust focuses on accurate approximate inference procedures, inspired by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and deep ensembling. The last thrust pursues applications in medical imaging, autonomous driving, and protein design.

A BCI acquires brain signals and translates them into commands for the external device(s) to perform actions intended by the user. BCIs have shown great potential for helping people with severe motor impairments, detecting and diagnosing health issues, and providing new interfaces for applications such as gaming. Numerous methods have been used to process BCI data, which are mostly spatial and temporal in nature, e.g., multi-channel electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Unfortunately, existing techniques still suffer from low robustness and low reliability due to sensitivity to artifacts, noise and outliers, and require lengthy calibration. These challenges will be addressed by developing a novel framework which efficiently and robustly models the covariance matrices associated with the spatial and temporal patterns of BCI data as elements on the manifold of positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. Under this novel framework, BCI processing and calibration time will be significantly reduced, and the system will become more robust to small perturbations, with the potential to greatly benefit people suffering from severe motor impairments. This manifold-based framework can be broadly applied to other disciplines, including biology, agriculture, neuroscience, and computer vision. The research combines ideas from mathematics, statistics, and computational methods, thereby attracting students with diverse backgrounds and helping broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. The results will be integrated into both undergraduate and graduate Data Science courses; the mathematical foundations and computational implementation of this research will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations, and open-source code. <br/><br/>The novel framework being used is that of the manifold of PSD matrices equipped with a new metric known as the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) metric. This formulation has the advantage that the computation of the distance induced by the BW metric is twice as fast as for the usual Riemannian distance, hence more efficient, while being robust to small perturbations. The following research themes will be explored. First the mathematical properties of the BW distance and its induced geometry on the manifold of PSD matrices will be studied. Three algorithms will be developed for computing the barycenter (under the BW distance) of a collection of PSD matrices. A class of Gaussian-like distributions will then be introduced on the manifold of PSD matrices, and a theory of statistical inference will be investigated through maximum likelihood estimates. To classify PSD matrices into the distinct groups associated with the different actions intended by the BCI user, Gaussian mixture models will be developed, and non-parametric approaches used with the help of kernel functions on the tangent space of the manifold. Finally, two methods for generating synthetic PSD matrices on the manifold will be developed to shorten the calibration of the BCI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sustained DNA-protein crosslinks prevent segregation and transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells; hence, removal of DNA-protein crosslinks is critically important for cell survival. The overarching goal of this project is to determine how cells choose distinct cellular pathways to bypass or repair DNA-protein crosslinks. A multidisciplinary strategy combining biochemistry, molecular biology and yeast genetics will be employed to investigate how cells mark DNA-protein crosslinks for proteolytic degradation. Additionally, the project will engage a diverse group of students living in rural areas to provide training, skills, and experiences in scientific research and promote their participation in STEM careers.<br/><br/>The research project aims to elucidate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying selective targeting and removal of DNA-protein crosslinks that physically impede DNA replication, gene transcription and chromatin remodeling. Multiple, non-redundant pathways cooperate to repair or bypass DNA-protein crosslinks. SPRTN is the founding member of mammalian proteases dedicated to DNA-protein crosslink repair and several paralogues and orthologues have since been identified in species across multiple kingdoms, underscoring the conserved nature of DNA-protein crosslink repair. Given the multitude of proteins that can be covalently trapped on DNA, how SPRTN selectively targets them for removal in a crowded landscape of chromatin-associated proteins remains unknown. Aim 1 will investigate a unifying mechanism to target DNA-protein crosslinks, irrespective of their size and chemical composition.

Networks have long been common models in computer science for structuring data. However, only recently network visualization has become more commonly used tool; for instance, publishers are starting to use visualizations of networks in news articles. Layered network visualizations show either changes in networks over time or flows between states. They help visualize complex dynamics such as how water moves through the parts of a steam engine. Creating an optimal layout based on human readability criteria is an open challenge. Existing algorithms creating visualizations prioritize computational speed over human readability. The goal of this project is to create general and optimal layout algorithms for layered network visualizations that prioritize readability instead. Optimal layouts are particularly beneficial for domain applications where readability is paramount, e.g., in medicine where mistakes can have significant consequences. Through integrated research and education, the project will motivate students to work on meaningful human problems by combining applied and basic research; attract and train the next generation of visualization scientists, with a focus on people from underrepresented groups; and widely disseminate research results to help future researchers and designers create more effective visual data exploration and decision-making tools.<br/><br/>This research will advance the state-of-the art in visualizing layered networks and lead to more effective visual data exploration and decision-making tools. It will provide optimal layouts for critical tasks and baselines for evaluating layout heuristics. Five formative studies will produce a corpus of general requirements for layered network visualization which will guide future researchers and practitioners. These requirements will be integrated into a user-customizable optimal layout algorithm. The algorithm, as well as approximate and heuristic layout approaches, will be released in a free and open-source library for layered network visualization. Domain-specific and general computational and human-subjects research will provide evidence-backed design guidelines that are transferable across domains. Experiments will define scalability limitations both in terms of human readability and technical feasibility. This project will contribute to assessing future layout algorithms by providing benchmark datasets, evaluation methodologies, and optimal baseline implementations. Combined applied and basic research studies will lead early-career graduate students to publications and careers working on prosocial problems in cross-disciplinary teams. The project will engage grade 6--12 students from groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through summer camp activities and develop instructional materials for teaching graduate students in courses without prior visualization components.

Because modulation of frameshifting has been shown to dramatically influence viral viability, the RNA frameshifting element (FSE) has been an attractive anti-viral drug target. However, the complex aspects of frameshifting must be understood before therapeutic strategies can succeed. Following a 2020 NSF RAPID award, the Schlick mathematics/computational biology lab, in collaboration with the Laederach experimental RNA group, will combine graph theory applications to RNA (RAG: RNA-As-Graphs) with biophysical studies and biomolecular modeling/simulation to unravel structures and mechanisms of the RNA FSE of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. The collaborative research program will be the basis for interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral fellows in mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering, through computer program development, data analysis, and biological interpretations. Students and postdocs will learn to analyze, process, and visualize biological data; devise and validate models; develop simulation algorithms and coarse-grained models; and collect and interpret structural/functional patterns to yield new mathematical and biophysical relationships.<br/><br/>The project will describe conformations and structural transitions of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 from phylogenetic and biophysical viewpoints by exploiting global representation of mathematical RNA graphs. Specifically, the researchers will gain insight into the evolutionary path of the FSE of coronaviruses by computing and validating experimentally RNA secondary-structure conformational landscapes of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 relatives; probe frameshifting mechanisms by determining the SARS-CoV-2 FSE's transition pathway; and identify and test experimentally structure-altering mutations to transform the FSE into complex intertwined motifs by RAG inverse folding and genetic algorithms to hamper frameshifting. This unique approach applied to frameshifting elements in coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 using novel mathematical graph-theory tools and biophysical models will yield crucial insights into the structure, mechanisms, and evolutionary trends in related viruses to explain the relationship between viral structure and frameshifting efficiency/viral viability. By looking at structure from a global graph theory point of view, patterns can be discerned and related more easily than sequence or atomic-based models.

It occurs in areas from hardware/software failure, cyber-attack, human error to fraud. Risk is usually associated with extreme scenarios (also called long tail events) that are of a low probability of happening,  but, if once they happen, are tied to huge losses. Therefore, risk management is very critical to ensure robust information system and intelligence. This project will develop risk measurement for high-dimensional (HD) data with long tails. The project overcomes challenges caused by the lack of data on the tail, the dimensionality in risk measurement and parameter estimation, and the underdeveloped mathematical properties of HD risk measures. The investigator seeks to advance mathematical risk measures and contribute to research and education that enable resilient risk management in computing-driven decision-making.<br/><br/>To achieve the goal, this project will fill the knowledge gaps by advancing mathematical theorems and scientific methods for high-dimensional risk measures in data-intensive systems. The research activities include: (i) developing new high-dimensional risk measures, risk sharing, and risk aggregation methods for big data with heavy tails by integrating Copula, extreme value theory, and statistical inferences; (ii) understanding in-depth mathematical properties of risk measures and exploring new methods of statistical inference with theoretical guarantees (e.g., asymptotic property, convergence) for high-dimensional risk measures; (iii) expanding the dependence investigation between heavy-tailed losses, especially under extreme conditions, and proposing the optimal decision-making strategy given specific risk measures. If successful, this project will provide new scientific insights and mathematical theorems/tools for intelligent systems' risk quantification and risk management. It can improve the system safety, stability, and resilience, and increase U.S. competitiveness in risk management and optimal decision making.

Examples include bidders in an online ad auction, algorithmic trading agents in a financial market, (cyber)attackers and defenders in a network, a hierarchy of policymakers formulating a decentralized epidemic response plan in a decentralized manner, and so on. As such, game theory, the systematic study of such multi-agent strategic interactions (or, games as they are called), is becoming increasingly fundamental to AI research and practice. Empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA) is a principled framework for (approximately) reasoning about games that are beyond the scope of traditional, analytical game-theoretic methods either because the games are too complex or because obtaining information about possible plays of the game is too expensive. This project seeks to make fundamental methodological improvements to the EGTA framework by constructing finer- grained models (i.e., more accurate approximations) of the game under consideration than those prevalent in the state of the art.<br/><br/>Specifically, the aim of the project is to adapt EGTA to multi-level game model forms: strategic interactions that can be represented in the form of a directed, rooted tree. Extensive-form games (EFGs) are a classic example of this class of games that capture temporal patterns in agent activity, information revelation, and possible stochastic events (acts of Nature). Current EGTA practice abstracts all such temporal patterns away in a simulator (e.g., an agent-based model) that is queried to obtain payoff data for strategy combinations over players but induces a coarser game model that is essentially normal-form and does not reflect such patterns. This project will take the next step in EGTA design by explicitly incorporating features of the underlying game tree into the empirical game model itself and tackling the resulting conceptual and computational design challenges such as striking a balance between model granularity (which leads to better approximation) and per-iteration computational burden.  The second phase of the project will seek to transfer knowledge gained from development of EGTA for EFGs to similar treatments of other tree-based game model forms. Advances in this project can significantly improve our understanding of systems that comprise interacting AI agents employing highly sophisticated strategies (such as deep reinforcement learning algorithms), and in turn inform robust design of such agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Just like the radio of an old car has only two adjustable dials for frequency and volume, probability distributions, like the bell-shaped normal distribution, that are used in scientific models typically only have one or two adjustable dials. Underfit occurs when no combination of the dials ever produces a good signal, while overfit occurs when the dials produce an extremely good signal in particular circumstances that becomes poor in slightly different circumstances, such as the location of the car or a new group of observations in a scientist?s data set. Scientists should be able to add as many adjustable dials to their models as they need to avoid underfitting the data but also need the capability to avoid overfitting when simultaneously adjusting more dials. Doing so will promote the progress of science by allowing scientists to make decent predictions of their outcomes that readily generalize when circumstances change moderately. Since scientists in all fields face these ubiquitous problems, providing software to help combat them will have a broad impact.<br/><br/>Those metaphorical dials are the parameters in the likelihood function used by scientists when utilizing maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation techniques. Almost all likelihood functions are taken from the exponential family of probability distributions and have only one or two unknown parameters. In the past few years, a new continuous probability distribution from outside the exponential family has been derived where scientists can specify any fixed number of parameters, but this metalog(istic) distribution is difficult to use as a likelihood function because its density lacks an explicit expression. Moreover, while there is a convex set of parameters that produce a valid probability distribution, some combinations of parameters do not, and it is presumably impossible to characterize the admissible set explicitly. Nevertheless, it is quite possible to evaluate a metalog likelihood function numerically while imposing the required constraints on the unknown parameters, which would allow it to be utilized by scientists in many situations. The investigators will implement the metalog likelihood function in the free and open-source software known as Stan, whose algorithms have become the workhorse for Bayesian analysis in many scientific fields. The Bayesian approach also would permit a principled way to choose a model with the appropriate number of parameters in the likelihood in order to avoid overfitting future data. The project will also further advance interdisciplinary professional development of the next generation of researchers in statistical, data science, and other STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because modulation of frameshifting has been shown to dramatically influence viral viability, the RNA frameshifting element (FSE) has been an attractive anti-viral drug target. However, the complex aspects of frameshifting must be understood before therapeutic strategies can succeed. Following a 2020 NSF RAPID award, the Schlick mathematics/computational biology lab, in collaboration with the Laederach experimental RNA group, will combine graph theory applications to RNA (RAG: RNA-As-Graphs) with biophysical studies and biomolecular modeling/simulation to unravel structures and mechanisms of the RNA FSE of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. The collaborative research program will be the basis for interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral fellows in mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering, through computer program development, data analysis, and biological interpretations. Students and postdocs will learn to analyze, process, and visualize biological data; devise and validate models; develop simulation algorithms and coarse-grained models; and collect and interpret structural/functional patterns to yield new mathematical and biophysical relationships. <br/><br/>The project will describe conformations and structural transitions of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 from phylogenetic and biophysical viewpoints by exploiting global representation of mathematical RNA graphs. Specifically, the researchers will gain insight into the evolutionary path of the FSE of coronaviruses by computing and validating experimentally RNA secondary-structure conformational landscapes of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 relatives; probe frameshifting mechanisms by determining the SARS-CoV-2 FSE's transition pathway; and identify and test experimentally structure-altering mutations to transform the FSE into complex intertwined motifs by RAG inverse folding and genetic algorithms to hamper frameshifting. This unique approach applied to frameshifting elements in coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 using novel mathematical graph-theory tools and biophysical models will yield crucial insights into the structure, mechanisms, and evolutionary trends in related viruses to explain the relationship between viral structure and frameshifting efficiency/viral viability. By looking at structure from a global graph theory point of view, patterns can be discerned and related more easily than sequence or atomic-based models. The determined structures, mechanisms, and structure-altering mutations define gene therapy and anti-viral targets for therapeutic interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This flow carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste around the body. It also drives the development of blood vessels and other organs in vertebrate embryos. So, understanding how these hearts produce flow is key to understanding the development of vertebrate embryos and the evolution of their circulatory systems. This project will develop a computational model of the most essential features of this system: the electrical activity of the heart, muscle contractions of the tube walls, and the fluid-structure interactions of the heart walls and blood within. This computational framework aims to be faithful to that of a real, model animal (tunicate, or sea squirt). The model will then be analyzed with mathematical tools to determine the physical limits of the pumping system. Results of this project will improve the understanding of human heart development at the earliest stages. Also, it will point to how the large, multi-chambered hearts of vertebrates could have evolved from smaller structures. The results will be released through university courses, scientific conferences and seminars, online repositories, and regular publications. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. <br/><br/>An accurate computational model of flow produced by valveless tubular hearts will be developed and validated using observations and experiments on the solitary tunicate, Ciona savignyi. The Immersed Boundary Method with Adaptive Mesh Refinement and a Windkessel model will be used to mathematically model fluid flow within the system. A Mitchell-Schaeffer model of cardiac electrodynamics will be tuned using optical mapping of heart electrical activity. Measurements on live C. savignyi circulatory flow with micro-Particle Image Velocimetry will be used as model validation. With the completed model, uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques based on physics-constrained generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory will be used to study the uncertainty and analyze the parameter sensitivity on the model. The physics-constrained gPC expansion can construct a computationally cheaper surrogate based on the fluid flow simulations at the properly chosen input points in the parameter space. The mixed types of uncertainty in the fluid flow quantities of interest will be determined using DS theory combined with the gPC method, and the sensitivity of parameters will be used to develop hypotheses regarding parameter evolution. The performance data corresponding to various parameter combinations in live animals will be collected and used to improve the 2D computational fluid dynamic model by utilizing model correction methods. The improved model can be used to provide more accurate predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar wind is the medium through which harmful radiation travels. An accurate description of the solar wind is necessary to understand the propagation of these disturbances from the Sun to the Earth. This project studies solar wind physics. The work supports training of a graduate student and post-doctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The research aims to address the compelling science question of ""what regulates the solar wind heat flux?"" The electrons in the solar wind efficiently conduct heat, thus carrying the heat flux along the anti-sunward direction. Among physical processes that regulate the heat flux, whistler heat-flux instabilities are suggested as being important in the collisionless heat flux regime, while in the collisional regime, the binary collisions are the classical regulation mechanism. Both processes compete against the radial expansion effects. The relative importance of these competing processes, that is, instabilities, collisions, and expansion, remains an outstanding and thus, together they constitute a compelling research topic. The project will use the self-consistent quasilinear theory and kinetic theory of collisions in magnetized plasma to model the evolution of the waves and electron heat flux in the radially-varying solar wind. The theory will be driven by inputs from, and tested against, the well-calibrated measurements of the solar wind electron distribution function from various spacecraft between 0.3 and 1 AU, as well as proton parameters, magnetic field and plasma wave data. Such an integrated and collaborative research on the nature of solar wind electrons and the heat flux they carry will greatly contribute toward improving our understanding of the fundamental processes that take place within the heliosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coastal climate change is a grand challenge, and there is a need to generate actionable new knowledge and solutions to address this challenge, using convergent approaches. The Coastal and Marine System Science program (CMSS) will house the STAGES program and offer a convergent training experience. This experience will connect innovative research to practitioner and community needs to answer stakeholder-guided questions of national concern. The project anticipates training up to forty (40) Master's and Ph.D. students, including twenty-one (21) funded trainees from the TAMU-CC's Coastal and Marine System Science (CMSS) program, over four years.<br/><br/>STAGES will generate new knowledge: (1) from big data at the nexus of land-water-atmospheric connections to understand complex processes driving coastal environmental systems, and (2) regarding the integration of stakeholders and big data into academic research in ways that boost trainee involvement in convergent research and occupational readiness. CMSS faculty's long-standing relationships with stakeholders will be used for a new training model that is sustainable and scalable. This model will co-develop research projects suitable for trainee teams to tackle using Machine Learning (ML) methods. Stakeholders include government agencies on all levels, non-governmental organizations, and community groups, with a common goal to improve the resiliency of Gulf Coast communities and environment. STAGES will provide a curricular foundation for convergent environmental science that is data intensive, starting each spring with coursework and a week-long field trip to experience the interaction of land-water-atmospheric events firsthand. Late Spring Stakeholder Workshops pair trainees and stakeholders to formulate data-focused research questions. Summer Big Data Blitzes prepare trainees for team efforts to answer questions, culminating in Fall Capstones to refine and communicate research results. Trainees will benefit from an interdisciplinary cadre of deeply experienced faculty researchers with extensive field, data science, and student training experience. Anticipated findings are expected to include best practices for engaging stakeholders to identify data-intensive challenges and co-develop research questions; assimilation of the challenges by trainees with various backgrounds; and identification of problems appropriate for the trainees' different fields of study. During the training process, trainees will become better science communicators who can engage stakeholders and grasp the ethical dimensions of their decisions for long-term collaborations. STAGES will establish and disseminate transformative STEM training, research, and evaluation advances in coastal and marine system science that produce a sustainable and scalable graduate education model. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

This exchange is widely recognized as one of the primary mechanisms through which submesoscale processes affect upper ocean variability and biogeochemistry. However, despite extensive work demonstrating the impacts of submesoscale entrainment and subduction on diverse topics across the field of oceanography? including for example the global mixed-layer heat budget, primary productivity, and the export of carbon to the interior?the essential physical mechanisms remain incompletely described. In particular, next steps need to include the impact of the submesoscale interactions between the surface boundary layer and the interior on large-scale models, as parameterizations of submesoscale processes explicitly avoid entrainment fluxes. This avoidance severely underestimates submesoscale impacts on biogeochemistry and climate (e.g., long-term carbon and heat uptake). Recent work, some from this group, further indicates that cross-scale interactions between submesoscale flows, surface gravity waves, and turbulence may also significantly alter the exchange at the base of the surface mixed layer. However, the balance of several possible mechanisms for this exchange has not been established. This project will quantify the effect of these multiscale interactions using new theoretical and computational tools, resulting in more complete models of submesoscale exchange between the ocean interior and surface boundary layer. Advances for both climate-scale and high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation models will be shared with the science community. New techniques in tracer diagnostics and theory will be developed, and used to clarify the role of multiscale interactions in affecting exchange between the boundary layer and interior, providing guidance towards new approaches in multiscale numerical modeling, parameterization, and ocean observing. The majority of the funds for this project will go towards supporting early career scientists: a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher, an early career research scientist, and an early career faculty member.<br/><br/>Reynolds-averaged numerical simulations (RANS) will quantify the impact of incorporating entrainment fluxes into a widely utilized parameterization of submesoscale mixedlayer instability, including the impact of the improved parameterization on realistic simulations incorporating ocean biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean. Large-eddy simulations (LES) will determine the processes and parameter dependence through which submesoscale instabilities, surface gravity wave-driven effects such as Langmuir turbulence, and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence interact to modify entrainment and subduction of tracers. New insights into these multiscale interactions will be enabled by recent developments in boundary layer energetics, potential vorticity dynamics, and techniques for eddy-flux diagnostics developed as part of this project. These advances will be applied to a set of state-of-the-art large-domain LES that resolve scales of order 1 m to 10km, providing new benchmarks in exascale ocean modeling. Together these activities will simulate and quantify the essential mechanisms of entrainment and subduction at the submesoscale, their cross-scale interactions, and their accurate interpretation in observations and representation in numerical models. Community ocean and climate model improvements will be furthered through inclusion of improved and vetted representation of entrainment fluxes in two parameterizations, including the most widely used parameterization of submesoscale mixed-layer instability and a newer process parameterization. The LES that will be performed will be made available for immediate community use, providing a valuable new resource supporting other investigations into submesoscale-Langmuir-turbulence, and physical-biogeochemical interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The textbook model describing this arrangement goes back to the 19th century but describes only the location of the ions and it does not account for their motion. The actual situation is more complicated because the water molecules are arranged differently near the metal surface than they are in the liquid, and the ions move in and out of this interfacial layer near the electrode, called the electrical double layer, or EDL.  However, studying the EDL is challenging, as it is only a few nanometers thick, or about 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. Professor Geiger and his students are using laser techniques to directly observe the structure of the water molecules and the ions near the metal surface. Their discoveries could provide fundamental insight that advances technologies ranging from clean energy generation and energy storage to environmental remediation. The project is also contributing to the development of the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by creating research opportunities for students, and the team is integrating their research into the Evanston high school chemistry curriculum to increase participation in STEM through a science ambassadorship program. <br/><br/>By measuring the amplitude and phase of heterodyne-detected second harmonic generation (HD-SHG) signals from electrode:electrolyte interfaces, Professor Geiger and his students can directly probe the structural and electrostatic properties of the Stern and diffuse layers . Using this technique, the team is studying the dynamic exchange of ions between these two components of the electrical double layer that occurs in response to external stimuli (applied potential, pH, electrolyte concentration) and measuring the total interfacial potential drop across the EDL. The HD-SHG methodology is also being implemented in a wide-field microscopy mode capable of imaging spatial variations in the EDL across an electrode surface during electrochemical reactions. By quantifying the Coulombic and non-Coulombic contributions to the interfacial potential drop, and by learning about the structure of interfacial water molecules and ions, they are aiming to improve century-old models for describing electrode processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its origins are deceptively simple: a salesperson needs to visit a set of cities (visiting each city exactly once in a cycle, starting and ending at a home office) and wants to find the least expensive way to do so.  Despite these simple origins, it has important applications ranging from producing circuits to understanding protein-protein interactions, and research on the TSP has fueled progress throughout the broader algorithms research community. This project focuses on an important special case of the TSP known as the Circulant Traveling Salesman Problem (Circulant TSP).  This special case was first motivated in the 1970's by applications in reconfigurable network design and waste minimization, and the innate hardness of Circulant TSP has often been cited as an important question in TSP research.  This project proposes to capitalize on recent Circulant TSP results, and to develop a new approach to studying Circulant TSP with potential to resolve long-standing open questions.  Further, the TSP's notoriety and succinct statement make it an engaging problem for use in outreach.  The project will train and support undergraduate students to become researchers in theoretical computer science, and the project will lead to a new short-course for high school students on the TSP showcasing modern research. <br/> <br/>In more detail, the TSP is a notoriously and formally hard problem.  As such, some of the most exciting recent TSP results have stemmed from studying special, more structured cases of the TSP.  This project proposes a new approach to one such special case, Circulant TSP.  In Circulant TSP, the input costs of travelling between cities have to be particularly structured (specifically, they must exhibit a type of circulant symmetry).  Fundamental open questions revolve around the complexity of Circulant TSP.  The proposed approach to addressing these questions bridges techniques from polyhedral combinatorics and number theory.  Specifically, it focuses on using these techniques to describe the combinations of edge lengths that can be put together to form a feasible solution to the TSP (i.e., a Hamiltonian cycle visiting each of the input cities exactly once).  Because these techniques focus explicitly on understanding the edge lengths of feasible TSP solutions, they will likely extend beyond Circulant TSP and contribute to the broader TSP literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When developing deep-learning solutions, accuracy or performance metrics are often a key point of emphasis. While performance is critical, the computational load of the training process and security of the final solution play an equally important role in a real-world setting. Recent advances in adversarial learning models hold significant promise in improving various learning methods and defending against threats, but the fundamental aspects of these models are still poorly understood, which limits their performance guarantees for efficient and robust decisions. With this in mind, this project investigates simultaneously tackling three desirable properties when developing deep networks: 1) performance, 2) efficiency, and 3) robustness. This project also includes a comprehensive plan to integrate the research results into inclusive, diverse, and cross-disciplinary educational multilevel programs by funding graduate research assistants, summer research fellowship for high-school students and teachers, and organizing a hybrid (online and in-person) deep-learning boot camp. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research program is to develop a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the robustness and computational aspects of deep networks by leveraging tools and concepts from probability, information theory, and statistics.

These teacher leaders will be prepared to strengthen the ability of rural school systems to provide access to high-quality CS instruction for all students. In preparing CS teacher leaders, the project seeks to address the insufficient level of CS instruction in rural schools, a significant gap in the STEM knowledge pipeline. The project will prepare 16 exemplary and certified grades 6-12 STEM teacher leaders in southern Georgia schools. The preparation of CS teacher leaders will encourage continuing CS education in partnering school districts and provide CS learning experiences for current and future students. Project efforts are aligned with the Georgia Department of Education's CS Career Pathways and opportunities to pursue careers in a well-paying industry with a shortage of applicants. Partnerships with agriculture, health care, and the military will provide participating teachers with exposure to paths for students to pursue CS careers. Providing students with CS educational experiences that can lead to well-compensated jobs will provide economic benefits to rural communities across the entire region. <br/><br/>This project at Mercer University includes partnerships with Wiregrass Georgia Technical College, the Computer Science for Georgia Academic Partners Network, and Georgia high-need school districts in Clinch County, Coffee County, Dublin City, Evans County, Jeff Davis County, Tattnall County, Treutlen County, and Wheeler County. Unique to the proposed project is CS as a new teaching area for experienced STEM teachers. The project will implement and investigate a professional development approach to increase the number and diversity of CS teacher leaders in rural, high-need school systems in southern Georgia. Guiding the project's approach and evaluation is a research-based framework that extends the work of the Developing Master Teachers through the South Carolina Science and Mathematics Teacher Leaders program, which highlights areas of need for rural school systems and their teachers, specific to CS teaching and leadership. The project team will employ research-based strategies to develop a network of teacher leaders with CS content and pedagogical knowledge, understandings of instructional coaching, and awareness of content-specific teacher leadership. The strategies will be implemented through a 14-month online Educational Specialist in Teacher Leadership master?s degree program, followed by online CS mini-courses, in-person CS Leadership Assemblies, and CS system-level planning events. Evaluation and assessment data will be used to investigate how the project approach affects the learning, actions, and dispositions of the Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) and school and system-level factors impacting the MTFs' success as CS teacher leaders. Nonprofit and industry partners will provide the MTFs with CS career-focused links within rural communities. Project results will be presented at professional conferences and submitted for publication. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowship project is supported by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

Internet censorship is thus a significant and growing threat, making research into circumvention technologies an important priority. While in the past proxies and (Virtual Private Networks) VPNs could be used to circumvent censorship, today, censors use complex techniques to find and block existing circumvention resources. This project proposes new ways to study and combat Internet censorship around the world by adopting a perspective similar to the censor?s themselves, and leveraging Internet infrastructure in non-censoring countries. First, this infrastructure will be used to measure ?normal? Internet traffic, so that circumvention proxies can learn what to mimic in order to camouflage their activity and evade detection. Second, this project will use those findings and the network infrastructure itself to create new kinds of proxies that are harder for censors to block. Studying and combatting censorship from the network perspective will help level the playing field between censors and circumvention tool developers, ultimately supporting Internet users? autonomy and access to information globally, including the billions of people worldwide living in repressively censored regions.<br/><br/>This work will use network taps deployed at (Internet Service Providers) ISPs and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in non-censoring countries to measure popular Internet protocols and how they are used in practice, develop novel ways to detect new and emerging forms of censorship, and explore how existing proxies and circumvention strategies can be improved using ISP data. Building on the growing Refraction Networking deployment, this work also investigates new ways that the ISP perspective can be used to combat censorship directly, such as improvements in Refraction transports to better resist active probing attacks from censors,  implementing peer-to-peer proxy protocols that are harder for censors to detect and block, and finding ways to directly make censorship more expensive for governments in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research supported by this CAREER award will emphasize the importance of and expand understanding of the role that two-year colleges play in the engineering education and career pipeline. Yet, racial and location inequity in vertical transfer highlight a lack of access to life changing educational opportunities. This project will focus on identifying unique geographic and cultural assets to make pre-transfer engineering students, from a variety of backgrounds, locations, and opportunities, more successful thereby increasing the number and preparedness of transfer students. To make this information accessible to engineering transfer students, this project will also develop and test a first-of-its-kind digital Engineering Transfer Student Dashboard where students will receive custom reports identifying assets, areas of strengths, and suggestions for improving engineering transfer student capital. Further, this research aligns with the overarching goals of the NSF Engineering Education program in its focus on exploring diverse pathways to and through engineering degree programs. This educational research will enhance inclusion and participation in engineering which also supports the NSF Engineering Education program?s focus on developing a more innovative and inclusive technical workforce. This CAREER award will provide a foundation for future research supporting innovation at the intersection of two-year college, engineering education, human resource development, and educational leadership fields focusing on valuing education and career transition opportunities raising student success.<br/><br/>The purpose of this CAREER proposal is two-pronged. The first, is a mixed methods study to create new knowledge to increase engineering transfer numbers and preparedness more broadly through investigating the geographic and cultural assets of transfer intending two-year college students. The second is to integrate these research findings into digital educational interventions aimed at improving transfer student capital and to test the efficacy of those interventions. The research will be informed by Laanan?s theory of transfer student capital and examines core constructs of transfer student capital. The two research questions for the research portion of this project are: What are assets, factors, and strategies that enable access for two-year college students to engineering transfer pathways?  Do assets, factors, and strategies vary in magnitude and/or presence across student demographics, location, institutions, or intention to transfer? The educational portions of this project, directly integrate findings from the research, and aim to answer two additional research questions: How does use of digital learning tools and resources impact transfer outcomes for pre-transfer engineering students? To what extent can transfer outcomes be improved, through use of digital learning tools, for students from underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds? A multi-institutional team will support implementation of this project including Clemson University, TriCounty Technical College, Piedmont Technical College, Greenville Technical College, and the South Carolina Technical College System. This project aims to broaden participation through improving access to engineering education and baccalaureate degree programs. Increased transfer pathways and educational innovations specifically designed for marginalized communities can improve transfer outcomes and positively impact college affordability for students from communities not previously well served. This research is distinct from other transfer student research in its combined focus on geographic and cultural assets and needs, inclusion of multi-institutional data, pre-transfer student focus, data disaggregation, and disciplinary focus on engineering. This research will also inform institutional supports, pathways, and resources needed for increased transfer student capital, stimulate interaction of researchers and practitioners with policymakers and the public, and expand of stakeholder capacity to support and engage diverse populations in STEM education through new partnerships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as data sets continuously increase in both volume and dimensions, the performance of modern machine-learning methods has become critically dependent on the data representations being used. In the past decade, although many deep-representation learning methods have enjoyed remarkable empirical success, the underlying principles behind this success have largely remained a mystery, a situation which has hindered further development and broader adoption. A major difficulty stems from the nonlinearities of the data representation models that often lead to complicated and challenging non-convex optimization problems. This project aims to advance the theoretical foundations from shallow-representation learning (e.g., learning sparsifying dictionaries) to deep-representation learning (e.g., learning deep neural networks) by exploiting the geometric properties of non-convex optimization landscapes and the intrinsic structures of the data. The impact of this research will take the form of new guiding principles for better model/architecture design, optimization and robustness in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. The research program will be integrated with education activities that include training a diverse workforce in STEM at both undergraduate and graduate levels, designing machine learning modules appropriate for dissemination to K-12 students, and promoting women and underrepresented students through various outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project seeks to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of representation learning by developing a principled and unified mathematical framework based on recent developments in global non-convex optimization theory. The mathematical foundations for both shallow and deep representation learning will be advanced by leveraging both the geometric properties of the corresponding non-convex optimization landscapes, and the low-dimensional structures of high-dimensional data. The resulting geometric insights will clarify the kind of representations can be learned through optimization, and will guide the development of efficient and globally convergent training algorithms. The proposed framework will be applied to the study of a wide spectrum of representation learning problems in supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised learning; correspondingly, their generalization and robustness will be investigated by understanding the learned representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

McCoy of the University of Washington is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new theoretical and computational tools that will be used to explore the manifestations of nuclear quantum effects in hydrogen-bonded systems.  Hydrogen-bonding is ubiquitous, and there are often surprisingly large differences between properties of normal water (H2O) and heavy water (D2O).  Many of these differences are attributed to the quantum mechanical nature of molecular vibrations.  While knowing that these effects exist is easy to articulate, quantifying them is much more difficult.  Anne McCoy and her research group develop tools for exploring quantum mechanical effects in molecular vibrations, and through collaborations with experimental groups has worked to enhance our understanding of these effects.  The methods that she and her research group are developing can be applied to systems of up to 20 atoms that are small enough for detailed calculations and comparisons to spectroscopic experiments, but large enough to exhibit the types of nuclear quantum effects that affect properties of liquid water or ice.  In parallel with this work, Anne McCoy and her group are developing tools that can be used by the community to implement the approaches she has. She is pursuing a variety of activities that focus on development of the next generation of physical chemists including mentoring students and promoting early career scientists through her roles as chair of the International Advisory Committee for the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy and an officer of the American Physical Society?s Division of Chemical Physics.<br/><br/>The supported work focuses on the development of vibrational perturbation theory and diffusion Monte Carlo approaches and using these approaches to explore the manifestations of nuclear quantum effects in hydrogen-bonded systems.   The work on vibrational perturbation theory focuses on the development of approaches for identifying resonances and exploring the role of third and higher order corrections to the results obtained at second order (VPT2).  A key feature of this work is the exploration of the impact of coordinates in which the Hamiltonian is expanded on the insights obtained from vibrational perturbation theory.  The work on Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) focuses on the development of efficient procedures for evaluating the potential energies used in DMC using neural-network potentials, which are  based on the geometries evaluated from small DMC simulations.  These potential surfaces are then in larger DMC studies.  A central application of these studies is an exploration of how nuclear quantum effects are manifested in water through studies of water clusters.  This work focuses on probing relationships between spectra, large amplitude motions and how and why the structure of water and protonated water systems change with deuteration.  A theme that underlies these studies is the development of versatile approaches that can be used to explore a broad range of systems, and to develop general understandings that provide broader insights in quantum effects in hydrogen bonding that extend beyond the specific systems that are being studied.

This research lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and dynamical systems, which studies the behavior of repeated applications of functions on certain sets of points. A key component of this project is to bring the techniques from each of these disciplines to bear on questions from the other.  The project includes educational components at every level.  At the most advanced levels, the project focuses on introducing algebraic dynamics to new audiences, including graduate students in dynamics and researchers in algebraic geometry.  The project will also involve several undergraduate researchers learning the basics of the field, as well as the development of educational materials for younger students hoping to understand the breadth of mathematics beyond calculus.<br/><br/>More technically, a primary goal of the project is to understand the growth of degrees of iterates of rational maps, from both computational and theoretical points of view.

The investigator will partner with USC's Center for Engineering Diversity and Women in Science and Engineering, in order to recruit members of historically underrepresented groups for research on this project. The investigator will partner with USC's K-12 STEM Center to engage K-12 students from historically underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>This award will create a paradigm shift in the development of AI agents, by combining advances in neural language modeling with high-level explanations based on logical axioms and commonsense knowledge. State-of-the-art technology is not adequate for this goal: neural methods cannot infer causal links between events and the motivations and goals of the agents directly from narratives, whereas commonsense axioms and knowledge resources alone cannot handle the contextual variations in human language. The team of researchers will build AI agents that use common sense to explain their reasoning. To do so, the researchers will leverage commonsense knowledge and axioms about agent psychology and event causality in order to enrich story corpora. The enriched data will be used to pre-train neuro-symbolic agents to complete open-world narratives and justify their completion with commonsense explanations. The researchers will measure the impact of representative techniques, axiomatic theories, and knowledge dimensions on understanding narratives about situations and actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar wind is the medium through which harmful radiation travels. An accurate description of the solar wind is necessary to understand the propagation of these disturbances from the Sun to the Earth. This project studies solar wind physics. The work supports training of a graduate student and post-doctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The research aims to address the compelling science question of ""what regulates the solar wind heat flux?"" The electrons in the solar wind efficiently conduct heat, thus carrying the heat flux along the anti-sunward direction. Among physical processes that regulate the heat flux, whistler heat-flux instabilities are suggested as being important in the collisionless heat flux regime, while in the collisional regime, the binary collisions are the classical regulation mechanism. Both processes compete against the radial expansion effects. The relative importance of these competing processes, that is, instabilities, collisions, and expansion, remains an outstanding and thus, together they constitute a compelling research topic. The project will use the self-consistent quasilinear theory and kinetic theory of collisions in magnetized plasma to model the evolution of the waves and electron heat flux in the radially-varying solar wind. The theory will be driven by inputs from, and tested against, the well-calibrated measurements of the solar wind electron distribution function from various spacecraft between 0.3 and 1 AU, as well as proton parameters, magnetic field and plasma wave data. Such an integrated and collaborative research on the nature of solar wind electrons and the heat flux they carry will greatly contribute toward improving our understanding of the fundamental processes that take place within the heliosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Maitra and her research group will address some of the fundamental challenges in computational simulations of molecules in classical and quantized light fields by developing new methods for the correlated dynamics of electrons, ions, and photons from first-principles. The projects involve three areas, within which she will develop approximations that should increase the reliability of calculations today: electron dynamics via time-dependent density functional theory, correlated electron-ion dynamics via the exact factorization approach, and their extensions to quantized light-matter interactions for applications to hybrid light-matter states (polaritons). The developments impact applications where knowledge and understanding beyond equilibrium electronic structure are necessary: from photovoltaic design to quantum control of electronic and nuclear dynamics by attosecond and femtosecond laser fields, or by tuning cavity parameters. This project will have a broad educational impact through the training of undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research, co-organizing and participating in summer schools in her research field as well as continuing a Zoom PhD Student Seminar series, and establishing a high school outreach tutoring program to the underserved Newark Public School District to mitigate our society's uneven access to educational resources and promote the development of underrepresented minority scientists.<br/><br/>Time-dependent density functional theory for fully non-perturbative processes will be re-cast to require the exchange-correlation functionals only in the linear and quadratic response regimes, where the adiabatic approximations in use today are best suited. Improved approximations derived from exact expressions will be developed. This moves TDDFT towards being as confidently used for real-time non-perturbative processes as it is used for spectra and ground-state properties. Practical exact-factorization-based mixed quantum-classical schemes for correlated electron-ion dynamics after photo-excitation or in the presence of laser fields will be constructed, that include electronic decoherence and wavepacket branching from first-principles. Extension of these methods to polaritonic systems will lead to a fundamental understanding of how field quantization can alter chemical reactions, and to practical mixed quantum-classical methods for the dynamics and control of molecules confined in optical cavities. The research is providing new computational tools and impacts our fundamental understanding of chemical physics, atomic and molecular physics, materials science, and light-matter interactions. Maitra continues to organize summer schools and tutorials.

Service industries such as healthcare, communications, transportation and logistics, comprised over 67 percent of US gross domestic product and employed more than 78 percent of the working population in 2020, according to the US Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Engineering service systems to increase operational efficiency and cost effectiveness is a crucial task with significant socio-economic implications for the US Designing and operating these systems has benefited from the use of sophisticated mathematical models of these systems. However, identifying a model appropriate to a system of interest is a remarkably hard problem. This award supports a fundamental understanding of how to utilize large operational data sets and emerging machine learning technologies, to facilitate such model identification. The research products of this award will enable engineers, policy makers and academicians to better improve operational and cost efficiencies, and as a consequence improve overall national welfare. The educational plan as part of this award aims to radically improve student advising and mentoring in large, public universities and colleges, by utilizing machine learning to predict student performance and enable student advisors and faculty mentors to implement early advising interventions. These interventions can substantially improve student retention and graduation rates, particularly among at-risk populations such as first-generation college students.<br/><br/>Large service systems exhibit multi-scale spatiotemporal variations and they are naturally modeled using stochastic network models operating in random and nonstationary environments.  Model identification and calibration are fundamental to data-driven engineering. This research project fills an important gap in the literature, where most of the focus is on stationary models.  The research in this award proposes the development of novel semiparametric methods for model calibration in stochastic network models operating in random and nonstationary environments. The research leverages and extends state-of-art techniques from stochastic analysis, optimization over measure spaces and point process theory to develop these methods. In the case of model inference, the project investigates theory that builds on and significantly extends M-estimation, minimax and function approximation analyses to the semiparametric setting of service system models. The complex nature of stochastic network models creates a desideratum for an understanding of which classes of such models can be uniquely identified. The project addresses identifiability analyses and utilizes information geometry to understand the landscape or manifolds of the model space to address this question.  Together, the theory and methods will lead to a comprehensive ?graybox? methodology for calibrating service system models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of this project is to deepen our theoretical and mathematical understanding of disorder effects in key models of the quantum evolution of ""open"" quantum systems, with non-negligible environment interactions.  The equations studied in this project arise in the theory of disordered materials and quantum information science but are of general interest because of the fundamental nature of both wave motion and disorder.

This exchange is widely recognized as one of the primary mechanisms through which submesoscale processes affect upper ocean variability and biogeochemistry. However, despite extensive work demonstrating the impacts of submesoscale entrainment and subduction on diverse topics across the field of oceanography? including for example the global mixed-layer heat budget, primary productivity, and the export of carbon to the interior?the essential physical mechanisms remain incompletely described. In particular, next steps need to include the impact of the submesoscale interactions between the surface boundary layer and the interior on large-scale models, as parameterizations of submesoscale processes explicitly avoid entrainment fluxes. This avoidance severely underestimates submesoscale impacts on biogeochemistry and climate (e.g., long-term carbon and heat uptake). Recent work, some from this group, further indicates that cross-scale interactions between submesoscale flows, surface gravity waves, and turbulence may also significantly alter the exchange at the base of the surface mixed layer. However, the balance of several possible mechanisms for this exchange has not been established. This project will quantify the effect of these multiscale interactions using new theoretical and computational tools, resulting in more complete models of submesoscale exchange between the ocean interior and surface boundary layer. Advances for both climate-scale and high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation models will be shared with the science community. New techniques in tracer diagnostics and theory will be developed, and used to clarify the role of multiscale interactions in affecting exchange between the boundary layer and interior, providing guidance towards new approaches in multiscale numerical modeling, parameterization, and ocean observing. The majority of the funds for this project will go towards supporting early career scientists: a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher, an early career research scientist, and an early career faculty member.<br/><br/>Reynolds-averaged numerical simulations (RANS) will quantify the impact of incorporating entrainment fluxes into a widely utilized parameterization of submesoscale mixedlayer instability, including the impact of the improved parameterization on realistic simulations incorporating ocean biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean. Large-eddy simulations (LES) will determine the processes and parameter dependence through which submesoscale instabilities, surface gravity wave-driven effects such as Langmuir turbulence, and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence interact to modify entrainment and subduction of tracers. New insights into these multiscale interactions will be enabled by recent developments in boundary layer energetics, potential vorticity dynamics, and techniques for eddy-flux diagnostics developed as part of this project. These advances will be applied to a set of state-of-the-art large-domain LES that resolve scales of order 1 m to 10km, providing new benchmarks in exascale ocean modeling. Together these activities will simulate and quantify the essential mechanisms of entrainment and subduction at the submesoscale, their cross-scale interactions, and their accurate interpretation in observations and representation in numerical models.

A fundamental challenge in the development of qubits is their decoherence, i.e. the fact that they lose information over time. Professor Stoll and his research group are addressing this challenge by developing and validating a computational model that predicts qubit decoherence based on molecular structures. This model will have broad impact by guiding the chemical design of novel quantum materials. Additional broader impacts of the project include advanced training opportunities for students, outreach activities, and the dissemination of online educational resources, including an open-source software for EPR spectroscopy.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of the project include modeling and understanding the physical mechanisms that cause decoherence of molecular electron spin qubits. For this purpose, the research team led by Professor Stoll is working to develop and validate a novel computational approach that quantitatively predicts electron spin decoherence in molecular spin qubits from their spatial structure. The first-principles approach combines density functional theory and molecular dynamics with many-body spin quantum dynamics. This innovative approach and its quantitative predictions will be validated by comparison with experimental data from pulse EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy on a variety of molecular spin centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, although the high data rates offered by WiFi can satisfy the communication rate requirements of mission-critical applications such as industrial automation, the complexity and unpredictability of the WiFi stack make new applications development an impractical undertaking. The proposed research investigates and develops new methodologies, algorithms, and software frameworks to facilitate the development of new classes of WiFi-based applications and services.<br/><br/>This research targets two broad classes of applications: (i) non-mission-critical systems where regular user devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops) and IoT devices (e.g., cameras, thermostats, smoke detectors) coexist, and (ii) mission-critical systems where deterministic end-to-end delays<br/>between devices and controllers (i.e., control loop) must be enforced. Towards facilitating innovation in the realm of WiFi communication and investigating the operation of these networks, this research proposes a software framework for scalable and programmable monitoring of the<br/>WiFi stack.

The new methodology aims at closing the gap between theory and experiment, by focusing on measurable quantities and reducing the inputs to the minimum required in order to understand how those measurable quantities change over time. In addition, Eitan Geva will also advance a novel Compute-to-Learn (C2L) pedagogy, which is based on a peer-led honors studio where undergraduate students work collaboratively to create public-domain interactive computer demos that demonstrate physical chemistry concepts. With above 50% female enrollment, the C2L pedagogy is a model for how to make teaching programming inclusive. <br/><br/>Eitan Geva and his group will develop and benchmark new types of generalized quantum master equations that allow for much greater flexibility than is currently available with respect to the electronic observables of interest and their dimensionality, thereby giving rise to more streamlined, cost-effective and efficient implementations. Each generalized quantum master equation corresponds to the exact equation of motion for the electronic observable it is derived for. Within those equations, the effect of projected-out degrees of freedom is given in terms of compact memory kernels and inhomogeneous terms, which can be obtained from projection-free inputs by solving Volterra equations. Computational protocols are developed for calculating the projection-free inputs for all-atom models of chemical condensed-phase systems via either mapping onto harmonic models and using quantum-mechanically exact methods or using quasiclassical methods based on combining the linearized semiclassical approximation with the mapping Hamiltonian framework. In addition, multiple new perturbative quantum master equations that mirror the multitude of non-perturbative generalized quantum master equations are developed, as well as protocols for calculating the corresponding perturbative memory kernels via the same methods used for calculating the projection-free inputs. The quantum master equations developed will be applied to and tested on new benchmark models, all-atom models and polaritonic chemistry models. The potential of using initial state entanglement to achieve quantum control of chemical dynamics is also investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This flow carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste around the body. It also drives the development of blood vessels and other organs in vertebrate embryos. So, understanding how these hearts produce flow is key to understanding the development of vertebrate embryos and the evolution of their circulatory systems. This project will develop a computational model of the most essential features of this system: the electrical activity of the heart, muscle contractions of the tube walls, and the fluid-structure interactions of the heart walls and blood within. This computational framework aims to be faithful to that of a real, model animal (tunicate, or sea squirt). The model will then be analyzed with mathematical tools to determine the physical limits of the pumping system. Results of this project will improve the understanding of human heart development at the earliest stages. Also, it will point to how the large, multi-chambered hearts of vertebrates could have evolved from smaller structures. The results will be released through university courses, scientific conferences and seminars, online repositories, and regular publications. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. <br/><br/>An accurate computational model of flow produced by valveless tubular hearts will be developed and validated using observations and experiments on the solitary tunicate, Ciona savignyi. The Immersed Boundary Method with Adaptive Mesh Refinement and a Windkessel model will be used to mathematically model fluid flow within the system. A Mitchell-Schaeffer model of cardiac electrodynamics will be tuned using optical mapping of heart electrical activity. Measurements on live C. savignyi circulatory flow with micro-Particle Image Velocimetry will be used as model validation. With the completed model, uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques based on physics-constrained generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory will be used to study the uncertainty and analyze the parameter sensitivity on the model. The physics-constrained gPC expansion can construct a computationally cheaper surrogate based on the fluid flow simulations at the properly chosen input points in the parameter space. The mixed types of uncertainty in the fluid flow quantities of interest will be determined using DS theory combined with the gPC method, and the sensitivity of parameters will be used to develop hypotheses regarding parameter evolution. The performance data corresponding to various parameter combinations in live animals will be collected and used to improve the 2D computational fluid dynamic model by utilizing model correction methods.

It is well-established that microplastics exist in our oceans in ever-increasing numbers and cause great ecological harm. Physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of macroplastics change during the degradation process and make it challenging to detect microplastics and estimate their lifetime in water. To address this challenge, it is critical to understand the formation mechanisms of microplastics and the rates at which they are produced. The objective of this research project is to discover the mechanics of degradation and develop predictive models which can estimate the fate of macroplastics. The outcome can help ocean environmental scientists and the manufacturing practices and recycling processes. The research activities will be complemented with a series of integrated educational activities to train the next generation of engineers and researchers in the multi-physics and mechanics of soft polymers through combinations of undergraduate and graduate students training and outreach to high-school students. The award will also be used to contribute to public knowledge infrastructure and create workshops for the polymer industry. <br/><br/>Separate models exist for studying how polymers degrade due to two or three factors among mechanical loading, temperature, oxygen, salt-water, and UV irradiations. The principal emphasis of this project is on the nonlinear coupling effects of all these factors. Physics-based equations for degradation in microstructural properties will be established based on polymers' network statistics, chemistry kinetics, as well as stored and dissipative energies. The critical internal stress at which micro-cracks form in thin polymers will be determined using polymer statistics and conservation laws. A non-affine multiscale framework will be built upon the deformation and breakage in chains and crosslinks to predict heterogeneous damage initiation and propagation. A physics-guided machine learning algorithm will assist the development of the framework.

Flow batteries offer a compelling engineering framework for providing inexpensive energy storage because they permit independent scaling of their power conversion and energy storage components. This project supports investigation of the fundamental electrochemical behavior of metal chelate materials as sustainable and scalable energy storage materials in flow batteries. This project also supports the development of new education and outreach programs in battery chemistry, with the goal of creating a competitive and equitable US workforce in clean energy technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of the project aims to provide a fundamental molecular understanding of a broad class of metal chelate coordination complexes, coupled with the evaluation of these chemical phenomena to improve system level flow battery performance. This understanding will be accomplished through the evaluation of the ability of organic chelates to inhibit water splitting reactions and test its performance limits. This approach will then be expanded to develop metal chelate complexes that can undergo multi-electron redox reactions, which can further increase the energy density and performance of the flow battery systems. This project represents a new approach to address longstanding challenges in the field of energy storage with low-cost materials that are economically feasible for wide scale deployment. Moreover, this project not only could prove transformative for enabling high-voltage aqueous batteries, but the molecular inhibition of water splitting using chelates could also carry wider implications for controlling hydrogen evolution reactions in other electrochemical and electrocatalytic applications such as electrochemical fuel production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the growth of active wireless systems often increases radio frequency (RF) interference (RFI) in science observations. As it stands, very little of the RF spectrum is dedicated to science, and the small amount of spectrum available can fall victim to neighboring RFI or re-allocation for commercial use in the wake of the growing demand for bandwidth in commercial applications.  This project focuses on changing the paradigm of remote sensing methods and developing next generation technologies and ideas that are more spectrum efficient, more effective, and meet the challenges of present and future spectrum congestion.  In particular, the project will recycle existing RF communication and navigation signals to enable new remote sensing methodologies at these commercially protected bands for scientific use in a myriad of practical solutions for precision agriculture, forestry, water conservation.  This project will demonstrate new, low-cost sensing technologies in practical settings and contribute to the agriculture economy.  The developed technology aims to usher in a host of precision irrigation for agricultural applications in the nation and worldwide with emphasis in economically distressed areas and developing countries.  The complementary educational goals of the Principal Investigator (PI) are to generate a greater awareness and understanding among students, the public, and farmers about the amazing world of microwave remote sensing and its utility for non-intrusive tracking of the world?s most precious resource: water in plants and soil. The project will support the PI?s efforts to broaden the participation of today?s diverse students, including underrepresented minority groups, in STEM education though activities such as new mobile apps, drones, games, and fun facts. <br/><br/>This project will construct fundamental microwave remote sensing science, a disruptive sensing framework, and integrated ubiquitous platforms that are non-intrusive, widely accessible, and automated to improve water utilization. This goal will be realized by offering at least three specific new contributions: (1) generating fundamental knowledge needed for a paradigm shift towards microwave bands in UAS-based precision agriculture, (2) designing an integrated/connected RF testbed for evaluating the new paradigm, and (3) integrating smartphones into low-cost drones for broader adaptation. These objectives will be achieved by conducting advanced electromagnetic modeling and simulations, physics-aware machine-learning-based soil moisture retrievals, and field validation. Specifically, this work will generate the scientific basis for accurate water monitoring of root-zone soil moisture observations by recycling low-frequency emissions in microwave spectrum from small drones. Exploring the low-frequency microwave spectrum for remote sensing from drones is unprecedented because no existing small drone instrument is capable of remote sensing at such low frequencies in microwave spectrum. This project will fill in the necessary scientific basis to evaluate the approach?s feasibility and develop the foundation for the algorithms to support such a paradigm. This work will be important for developing the requirements for water utilization in irrigated and rainfed farming and creating algorithms for the new paradigm of RF-assisted UAS-based precision agriculture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the recent availability of inexpensive hardware above 100 GHz makes the time ripe for bringing D-band (110-170 GHz) mmWave networks to the masses. However, D-band mmWave networks bring new challenges in optimizing the deployment of picocells, coordination and adaptation of mobile links with unprecedentedly wide frequency options, and a disruption-free confluence of networking-imaging. This research project addresses these key challenges and improves the performance, reliability, and usability of mobile D-band networks. The project will design machine learning augmented scalable D-band systems and networks, and integrate them into applications, such as Augmented Reality (AR), drone delivery, and autonomous cars. The research outcomes will impact the broader population by: (1) bringing ubiquitous and high-quality bandwidth to underserved users; (2) enabling efficient use of spectrum to better utilize this nationally important resource; and (3) elevating the utility of networking devices by enabling several critical applications on them.

However, successful deployment is facing several challenges. First, automotive radars are required to have high angular resolution in both azimuth and elevation directions in order to produce point clouds representing the shapes of objects and enable target identification. Enlarging antenna array apertures by simply increasing the number of antenna array elements involves both a huge cost and a large form factor, and is not feasible in automotive radar applications. Furthermore, as more vehicles are equipped with radar, the probability of mutual radar interference increases. This project aims to explore a novel joint sparse-frequency and sparse-array signal-processing framework that enables high-resolution environment perception for autonomous vehicles with low-cost, small form factor and low probability of mutual interference. The project will result in algorithms that are applicable to various radar-sensing applications, including the remote sensing of vital signs of patients in telemedicine, a crucial need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed educational plan creates opportunities to guide senior Capstone designs, enriches curriculum in radar-signal-processing courses, and facilitates outreach for minority students through an existing multicultural engineering program. <br/><br/>It is challenging to achieve high angular resolution by adopting sparse arrays synthesized via multiple-input and multiple-output radar techniques because the high side lobe associated with sparse arrays would result in angle ambiguity. In addition, conventional radar chirps occupying a large bandwidth with a constant pulse-repetition frequency greatly increase the chance of mutual interference. The technical aims of the project are organized into two tasks. The first task investigates a matrix completion-based array interpolation approach to fill the holes of both one- and two-dimensional sparse arrays. The relationship between the recoverability of low-rank radar data matrices and the irregular sparse-array geometry will be investigated. In order to effectively complete irregular sparse arrays, efficient iterative hard thresholding matrix-completion algorithms will exploit the structures and properties of the underlying low-rank Hankel and block Hankel matrices. The second task investigates a cognitive approach to sparsely allocate the radar chirps in both frequency and temporal domains in order to synthesize a high-resolution range profile while significantly reducing the probability of mutual interference. This task will design novel optimization methods to dynamically allocate the transmit chirps under both interference and range-Doppler peak side lobe constraints by relaxing integer variables for efficient computations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The surface layer altered by machining subject to severe and localized thermal and mechanical loading and exhibit properties far different from the bulk material. Though shallow (order of 10 to 100 microns thick), it plays a critical role in part performance, especially, for dynamic loading. Furthermore, the surface material response in such finishing operations is complicated and challenging to study because of the small length scale and extreme deformation conditions. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will pursue fundamental knowledge of the effects of finish machining on the behavior and performance of advanced metals such as titanium alloys, using a digital process twin (i.e., virtual representation of a physical process) approach to increase the quality and life of high-value components. The research outcomes have a potential to improve productivity and competitiveness of the US manufacturing industry, with a broad application potential in the aerospace, biomedical, and automotive sectors.

This exchange is widely recognized as one of the primary mechanisms through which submesoscale processes affect upper ocean variability and biogeochemistry. However, despite extensive work demonstrating the impacts of submesoscale entrainment and subduction on diverse topics across the field of oceanography? including for example the global mixed-layer heat budget, primary productivity, and the export of carbon to the interior?the essential physical mechanisms remain incompletely described. In particular, next steps need to include the impact of the submesoscale interactions between the surface boundary layer and the interior on large-scale models, as parameterizations of submesoscale processes explicitly avoid entrainment fluxes. This avoidance severely underestimates submesoscale impacts on biogeochemistry and climate (e.g., long-term carbon and heat uptake). Recent work, some from this group, further indicates that cross-scale interactions between submesoscale flows, surface gravity waves, and turbulence may also significantly alter the exchange at the base of the surface mixed layer. However, the balance of several possible mechanisms for this exchange has not been established. This project will quantify the effect of these multiscale interactions using new theoretical and computational tools, resulting in more complete models of submesoscale exchange between the ocean interior and surface boundary layer. Advances for both climate-scale and high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation models will be shared with the science community. New techniques in tracer diagnostics and theory will be developed, and used to clarify the role of multiscale interactions in affecting exchange between the boundary layer and interior, providing guidance towards new approaches in multiscale numerical modeling, parameterization, and ocean observing. The majority of the funds for this project will go towards supporting early career scientists: a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher, an early career research scientist, and an early career faculty member.<br/><br/>Reynolds-averaged numerical simulations (RANS) will quantify the impact of incorporating entrainment fluxes into a widely utilized parameterization of submesoscale mixedlayer instability, including the impact of the improved parameterization on realistic simulations incorporating ocean biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean. Large-eddy simulations (LES) will determine the processes and parameter dependence through which submesoscale instabilities, surface gravity wave-driven effects such as Langmuir turbulence, and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence interact to modify entrainment and subduction of tracers. New insights into these multiscale interactions will be enabled by recent developments in boundary layer energetics, potential vorticity dynamics, and techniques for eddy-flux diagnostics developed as part of this project. These advances will be applied to a set of state-of-the-art large-domain LES that resolve scales of order 1 m to 10km, providing new benchmarks in exascale ocean modeling. Together these activities will simulate and quantify the essential mechanisms of entrainment and subduction at the submesoscale, their cross-scale interactions, and their accurate interpretation in observations and representation in numerical models. Community ocean and climate model improvements will be furthered through inclusion of improved and vetted representation of entrainment fluxes in two parameterizations, including the most widely used parameterization of submesoscale mixed-layer instability and a newer process parameterization. The LES that will be performed will be made available for immediate community use, providing a valuable new resource supporting other investigations into submesoscale-Langmuir-turbulence, and physical-biogeochemical interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fractals are examples of Peano continua which in turn include all compact limits of geodesic spaces in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Exotic continua, also, arise as boundaries of groups and spaces in geometric group theory, and as solenoidal spaces, generalizing original examples that are defined as inverse limits via covering maps of much nicer spaces, including manifolds, but which themselves need not be path connected.

Many critical applications rely on time-series analysis, including video analytics, stock market analysis, earthquake prediction, economic forecasting, healthcare monitoring and disease prognoses. Recent sequence machine learning (ML) models have achieved remarkable success in processing entire sequences of data (such as speech or video) and learning long-term dependencies of time-series. However, these sequence models are unable to understand or assess their uncertainty, particularly critical when predicting in heterogeneous and noisy environments or in the presence of an adversary. For example, missing a prediction of heart failure due to artifacts in the electrocardiogram (ECG) physiological signal or failing to detect a security vulnerability in a software product could cause tragic health, financial and societal damage to people and industries. This project will develop significant theoretical and algorithmic foundations for uncertainty quantification, self-assessment, and adversarial detection in modern ML sequence models towards safe and reliable time-series intelligent machines. The project will develop pioneering algorithms that are universally robust under noisy conditions and adversarial susceptions. The main focus is on sequential ML algorithms with quantified uncertainty for the provided solutions.

Such coatings must have a range of different properties, including both mechanical resilience and high refractive indices; the former is necessary to protect the underlying device, while the latter ensures maximum optical performance, because through the protection layer the light gets bent towards the device. However, most materials can only be optimized for one of these target criteria. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Prof. Rob Macfarlane and his research group develop new strategies to synthesize composite materials consisting of high refractive index nanoparticles embedded within a mechanically robust polymer matrix. These materials can be easily formed into appropriate macroscopic shapes at low temperatures, then thermally crosslinked into mechanically stable solids. The researchers study how and why significantly larger fractions of the high refractive index components can be incorporated in the matrix with this synthesis method, which then results in materials that have ideal mechanical and optical performance. The simple synthesis methods for these materials potentially allow for the fabrication of more complex devices in the future that can be used to tailor material reflection to either induce structural coloration or anti-reflective properties. Such materials have benefit as adhesives, coatings, and sensors coupled to optical devices. In addition, the project provides opportunities for community college students from underrepresented groups to participate in STEM research, allowing them to gain both experience in current chemistry research techniques and insights into potential career opportunities.

Systematic investigations of fundamental structure-property relationships are conducted to explain how the optical and mechanical properties of these materials are affected by the large amount of filler content. The target materials possess tunable refractive indices due to the controlled amount of inorganic content (up to 85 wt.%), but also possess superior mechanical properties that surpass the bare polymer alone. Specifically, the researchers study the following aspects I) Developing materials-versatile protocols to synthesize and crosslink PGNPs with different inorganic nanoparticle and polymer compositions, II) Fully characterizing the mechanical and optical properties of the resulting structures, and III) Developing methods to induce photonic band gap architectures through ordered nanoparticle organization or multi-layer stacks of different composite compositions. The basic synthetic science and materials characterization efforts conducted enable a new class of optical materials, and also provide better design parameters for both grafting polymer brushes to inorganic particles and inducing covalent bond formation on nanoscale surfaces.

Cyclic olefin compounds are a class of chemical compounds that are used widely in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries.  Their current manufacture, however, relies on inefficient catalysts and multistep processes that produce unwanted by-products, including hazardous and environmentally-unfriendly chemicals.  Moreover, current feedstocks primarily consist of aromatic hydrocarbons derived from fossil sources.  The project addresses the need for better fundamental understanding of the catalytic chemistry associated with cycloolefin manufacture.

Initial experiments will focus on previously identified promising catalysts consisting of supported Pd-Pt and Ni-Sn nanoparticles.  Additional catalyst formulations will be selected based on the initial results. Experimental studies will provide information for the development of calibrated molecular models, which in turn will provide a better interpretation of the experimental results, and guide the selection of follow-up experiments to further improve the models in an iterative cycle. The study will synergistically and iteratively combine: (1) kinetic reaction measurements at steady-state and transient conditions, (2) in situ Raman and infrared vibrational spectroscopic measurements and (3) quantum-chemical calculations for interpretation of vibrational spectra, and transition state calculations for identification of reaction mechanisms.

The research outcome of this project will be a one-of-a-kind hardware platform that expedites the research and development of practically reliable and secure implantable bioelectronic systems for pre-clinical and clinical applications. Meanwhile, this project targets reinforcing the semiconductor hardware workforce by engaging and educating graduate, college, and high school students. This highly interdisciplinary project spanning materials, integrated circuits, power electronics, security, wireless communication, and computing, targets promoting interests in semiconductor and hardware, by engaging students at all levels in high-quality scientific and engineering research activities and creating educational materials to reach a much broader group of K-12 students and the public. <br/><br/><br/>This project will investigate principled and proactive methods to enable reliable and secure Wireless, Battery-less, Minimally Invasive (WBMI) bioelectronic implants. The key idea is to exploit positional and contextual awareness of the device to build reliability and security assurances within the fundamental power, communication, and control mechanisms. The research tasks include (1) safe, efficient, and misalignment-tolerant wireless power transfer to WBMI implants, (2) WBMI-specific secure authentication scheme for remote telemedicine and its lightweight implementation, and secure access and communication channel in emergency scenarios, and (3) novel specification-based online monitoring for the bioelectronic implants and transmitters and its efficient, compact hardware implementations. This project involves designing, optimizing, and prototyping energy-efficient miniature circuits and systems that blur traditional design boundaries to realize proactive protections with low overheads. Proof-of-principle implants integrating all the reliability and security protections studied in this project will be fabricated and experimentally evaluated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has achieved impressive successes in simulator-defined problems, where the RL agent learns via trial-and-error inside a virtual ""online"" environment. However, it is difficult to apply these online algorithms to real-world problems, as trial-and-error is often expensive or impossible in real life. For example, it is unethical for an RL agent in personalized medicine to test a new treatment strategy that may harm patients, just for the purpose of gathering new information. A promising paradigm to addressing this issue is offline RL, where the agent learns solely from historical data. While the lack of direct interactions with the real environment prevents undesirable real-world consequences, it also gives rise to significant technical challenges in learning. This project aims to develop novel methods to address these challenges and provide a deep theoretical understanding for offline RL, and make significant progress in enabling offline RL in real-life applications such as robotics, adaptive medical treatment, and online recommendation systems. The research development will also be integrated into the project's educational plan, which includes advising underrepresented students and developing new courses and a monograph on reinforcement learning. <br/><br/>The technical aims of the project consist of two thrusts. The first thrust focuses on the problem of model selection: after training is completed, how should we select between candidate policies on a holdout dataset? Model selection enables hyperparameter tuning, which is the backbone of practical machine learning, yet it is notoriously difficult in offline RL due to the multi-stage nature of the problem. The proposal describes a promising approach that builds on the investigator's recent theoretical work on value-function selection. The project will devise empirically effective methods based on the theoretical insights and address practical issues such as poorly fitted candidate functions and data with insufficient coverage. The second thrust considers the theoretical foundation of offline RL training: under what conditions can we guarantee the success of training? The proposal lays out the theoretical landscape of offline-RL training, and identifies important open questions and opportunities for discovering novel theoretical and algorithmic insights.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The twofold purpose of the proposed activities are to gather leading experts and early-career researchers working in rapidly developing subjects, and to foster interaction between groups of mathematicians and physicists working on different aspects of related problems; this will facilitate cross-fertilization between different fields and disseminate the most recent results of current research. GAP XVII and GAP XVIII will allow earlier-career mathematicians to disseminate their ideas and to broaden their perspective, both mathematically and internationally. Both summer schools, which will provide the opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas with foreign peers and launch collaborations, will include a poster session for individuals to present their recent work. <br/><br/>The theme of both schools is ""Higher Structures: Deformations and Homotopy Algebras"". GAP XVII (2022) will be devoted to ""Deformations"" and GAP XVIII (2023) to ""Homotopy Algebras"". Higher structures has emerged as a new field in mathematics, as well as in mathematical and theoretical physics. Covering many different topics, this field encompasses deformation theory, quantization, homotopy algebras, derived geometry, enumerative geometry, representation theory, Poisson geometry, mirror symmetry, noncommutative algebraic geometry, string theory, and quantum field theory. The event will be devoted to bringing together different aspects of higher structures, in particular deformations and homotopy algebras, as well as identifying new emerging directions of investigation. Deformation theory has become an important area of mathematics. Deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking, it is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. Homotopy algebras provide a powerful machinery for studying many interconnected questions in different areas of contemporary mathematics and mathematical physics.

Jellyfish are among the most distant relatives of humans that have eyes that still use genes similar to those used in human eyes. Within medusozoans, eyes originated separately at least nine times from a common genetic toolkit. This research will first expand knowledge of medusozoan relationships to untangle the complex evolutionary history of eyes. Next, this research will determine how similar are the genes expressed in each of the separately originated eyes. The team assembled for this project represents a new collaboration of scientists from multiple institutions with distinct but complementary expertise. The research will promote participation of women and underrepresented groups in all aspects of the project, will improve STEM education through training in integrative biology, and will incorporate the research in STEM undergraduate courses and a biodiversity workshop at a field station.

Convergent traits that are also experimentally tractable, referred to as ?meta-models?, provide opportunities for biologists to address questions about how repeatable evolution is at different levels of organization. This project will bring together a diverse group of collaborators to develop medusozoan cnidarians as a phylogenetic meta-model to address convergent evolution of eyes at different levels of organization, including genes, cells, and morphology. This award will support research to: a) test homology of eyes by generating a data-rich phylogeny that includes new transcriptomes of Medusozoa to reconstruct presence/absence of eyes across the group; b) compare gene expression profiles of convergently evolved eyes and other tissues (as controls) from cnidarians to identify conserved and convergent patterns of gene expression, and c) incorporate ?tree-thinking? into single-cell transcriptomics to analyze cell-type phylogenies and quantify histories of cell-types in convergently evolved eyes.

This technique drives a wide range of tasks today, e.g., predicting the next word while typing on the phone, tagging photos with the names of people in it, transcribing speech, etc. Building the artificial network requires collecting a large amount of data from each of these tasks. But as we seek to apply deep learning to more and more diverse tasks, it is becoming difficult to collect such large amounts of data from every task. For example, a number of languages or dialects have much fewer speakers than English or Spanish, and so their data is more scarce. This data scarcity is even more acute in domains such as the clinical sciences. The goal of this project is to develop theoretical and computational tools that enable artificial neural networks to work well even with few data. Educational and outreach goals of this project include (a) development of new curricula for graduate and undergraduate students, (b) mentoring trainees who work across established disciplines such as computer science, physics and engineering, and (c) fostering an ecosystem for machine learning across high-schools, higher-educational institutions and industry in the Greater Philadelphia region.<br/><br/>In order to achieve these goals, this project will develop a foundational understanding of learning tasks.

It seeks to characterize the geometry of the function space of predictive models fitted on typical tasks to understand when learning one task helps, or does not help, reduce the amount of data required to learn another task. It aims to exploit this geometry to build Bayesian priors that automatically adapt to the amount of available data. It is expected that such methods will reduce the amount of labeled data required for training by up to 1000 times.

While the use of automated processes for the preparation of biomolecules, particularly DNA and proteins, has revolutionized the advancement of research in biology over the past two decades, challenges associated with the autonomous linkage of a wide range of different substructural chemical fragments have hampered the development of similar systems for the complete synthesis of organic molecules such as small-molecule pharmaceuticals, materials, and fine chemicals. Recent transformative advances in chemistry, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing have yielded new technologies that have the potential to overcome these hurdles and make automated chemical synthesis across a wider swath of chemical space possible. This workshop will consider the best way to organize a facility to maintain national competitiveness with the rapidly growing demand for molecules, to effectively function in a field that has not previously been facility-focused, and to serve as a disruptive game-changer for synthetic chemistry and all disciplines that benefit from on-demand synthesis of non-commercial compounds.

The first theme of this project involves the ability to control microscopic systems that obey the counter-intuitive laws of quantum physics.  Technological progress has brought us to the point where experimentalists can isolate, observe, and manipulate individual quantum systems.  The PI and his group will develop new strategies for controlling how quantum systems evolve with time. One approach will use impulses, in which the system is briefly subjected to very strong external forcing, causing its state to change quickly.  This project will develop the theory needed to design impulses to achieve a desired change in the system?s state.  Another approach will involve Thouless pumping, a quantum-mechanical analogue of Archimedes? screw that can be used to transport electrons.  The original theoretical proposal by Thouless in 1983, which has been verified experimentally during the past decade, requires that the pumping be carried out very slowly.  The PI and his group will apply new techniques from the field of Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, to accelerate the transport of electrons by Thouless pumping.<br/> <br/>The second theme of this project addresses systems that are driven by an external force that oscillates periodically with time, causing the system to absorb energy.  When these oscillations are very fast, it has been found that energy absorption is greatly suppressed.  This project will explore whether this behavior can be understood in terms of a simple picture in which the system?s energy performs a ?biased random walk?.  The PI and his group will investigate this question both for systems that obey familiar laws of classical physics and for those that obey the laws of quantum mechanics.  If the biased random walk hypothesis proves to be accurate, it will provide a quantitative theory for predicting the rate energy is absorbed by rapidly and periodically driven systems, which will be useful in proposed applications of such out-of-equilibrium systems.<br/> <br/>The educational component of this project will involve the training of students in a strongly collaborative, supportive and cross-disciplinary environment.

Impulses are familiar from undergraduate-level classical physics but have received less attention in quantum physics.  This project will specifically address ?super?-impulses, in which the strength of the impulses scales inversely with the square of its duration.  Preliminary results reveal that such super-impulses cause a wavefunction to change in a non-trivial manner that can be described entirely in terms of classical trajectories, without invoking the semiclassical limit.  The project will also address the phenomenon of Thouless pumping, in which electrons are transported via a topological effect.  While in its original version Thouless pumping is adiabatic (quasi-static), the PI and his research team will explore non-adiabatic extensions of Thouless pumping, making use of recently developed tools from the field of Shortcuts to Adiabaticity.<br/> <br/>The project will also investigate the phenomenon of prethermalization, which refers to the exponential suppression of energy absorption by systems driven rapidly and periodically with time.  In preliminary results, the PI and his group have proposed a Fokker-Planck equation describing energy absorption in this scenario.  The research activity will include validating this equation in a number of model systems, exploring whether it quantitatively describes prethermalization, and extending these results to quantum systems through a model that combines Fermi?s Golden Rule with a semiclassical treatment of quantum energy transitions.<br/><br/>The educational component of this project will involve the training of students in a strongly collaborative, supportive and cross-disciplinary environment.

Garcia-Garibay of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA will investigate the use of light and crystals to explore a new platform for Quantum Information Science (QIS). Crystals make it possible to design chemical processes and reactions that cannot occur in liquids or in gases. They open the door for a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms and for the exploration and design of solvent-free synthesis and applications in materials science.  While molecules in crystals do not have the freedom of motion that is expected for chemical reactions to take place, reactions in crystals can be engineered in a reliable manner by taking advantage of a strategy used by nature based on biological structures that can capture and guide the energy contained in sunlight.  Examples of such sunlight-induced, or ?photobiological? processes include photosynthesis, DNA repair, and the biological compasses used by birds to guide their navigation across the planet.  Similar to those systems, reactions in crystals rely on the capture of light to generate excited states that go on to form highly reactive intermediates, whose fate is controlled by the crystal?s rigidity, homogeneity, and order.  Pulsed lasers aimed at selected crystalline ketones will be used to generate relatively long-lived magnetic species known as ?triplet radical pairs?. These consist of two extremely close unpaired electrons formed by the cleavage of a single chemical bond, which causes their magnetic spins to be strongly entangled and be relatively impervious to external magnetic perturbations.  These characteristics endow them with great potential for applications in Quantum Information Science (QIS).  The second part of this project explores a relatively exotic type of chemical reaction where a single light particle, or ?photon?, leads to many chemical events. These so-called quantum chain reactions are enabled by the strong energetic interactions between neighboring molecules, which lead to the transformation of photons into ?excitons? and are helped by reactants that contain and unleash large amounts of energy.  The third objective of this project is to provide a multi-disciplinary training ground for students who will contribute to the intellectual and human infrastructure needed to support our country?s academic and industrial enterprises. The PI will lead the annual UCLA Physical Sciences Fair, ?Exploring your Universe,? which attracts ca. 7,000-10,000 visitors to campus, and group members will have a booth to share with the public the exciting things that can be done with crystals and light.<br/><br/>The Garcia-Garibay group has established the structural and energetic requirements needed to engineer a number of photochemical reactions in the crystalline solid state.  For the intellectual merit of this project, they will take advantage of nanocrystals (ca. 200 nm) suspended in water in order to detect the absorption spectra and decay kinetics of triplet excited states and triplet radical pairs to explore two photochemical processes that can only occur in crystalline solids: (1) the chemical and spin dynamics of highly entangled triplet radical pairs as a potential platform for quantum information science (QIS), and (2) the potential of quantum chain reactions with triplet chain carriers as a powerful signal amplification mechanism.  With triplet excitons providing efficient energy delocalization mechanisms, these reactions are expected to reach chain lengths with as many as 106-109 reactions per photon absorbed, depending on the lifetime of the triplet excited states.   For the first part, they take advantage of a series of 1,1-diphenyl-2-propanones and 1,1,1-triphenyl-2-propanones with a variety of substituents at C3 to study the kinetics of intersystem crossing of triplet radical pairs.  While ketones with radical stabilizing substituents at C3 are known to lose CO to form triplet alkyl-alkyl radical pairs that go on to give products from a radical-radical combination reactions, ketones with high C2-C3 bond dissociation energies can only undergo an alpha-cleavage of the C1-C2 bond to form triplet acyl-alky radical pairs. These intermediates go back to the starting material after intersystem crossing to the corresponding singlet acyl-alkyl radical pairs.  Much of what it is known about intersystem crossing in radical pairs comes from experiments where long inter-radical distances lead to weak exchange interactions with dominant hyperfine coupling (hfc) intersystem crossing mechanisms. By contrast, radical pairs in crystalline solids offer the opportunity to explore a new frontier: one where rigid radicals are highly entangled as a result of a very large singlet-triplet gap.  Long triplet lifetimes are observed despite having the two electrons within van der Waals distance as the result of (a) inefficient hfc, (b) unfavorable geometries for spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and (c) spin-lattice relaxation slowed down by crystal rigidity.  Long-lived entanglements makes these crystal-trapped radical pairs excellent qubit pair candidates for applications in quantum information science.  For the exploration of a triplet exciton-enabled quantum chain reaction, this research will study solid state reactivity of crystalline sensitized Dewar benzenes.  These are known to undergo an efficient triplet state adiabatic reaction where the triplet state Hckel benzene photoproduct is a competent energy donor that can carry out a quantum chain.  Altogether, the work covered by this project is expected to improve basic understanding of reaction mechanisms and chemical reactivity in rigid materials and provide students the  opportunity to receive a highly interdisciplinary training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scanning Electron Microscopes are powerful instruments used for imaging natural and manufactured materials beyond the capabilities of traditional light microscopes. Our department will use the SEM-EDS to support new research in understanding past climate and ocean change, in the evolution of mountain belts, and past volcanic eruptions, providing research opportunities for undergraduates at every stage of their college experience. PI Haynes will investigate how microscopic fossils called foraminifera record ocean acidification events in the geologic past. These shells of these creatures are ubiquitous in the geologic record and help to ground-truth the impacts of large warming events on the Earth system and its ecosystems. This SEM will form a significant portion of PI Haynes? research toolkit, supporting her establishment as an early-career scientist and providing opportunities for undergraduate research in her laboratory. The SEM-EDS will also be used at all levels of our curriculum; for example, students will have the instrument available to them as a tool to be used for final projects of their own design, providing primary research experience. Finally, new programming will be designed in our department?s Geological Museum that will help co-create new exhibits with SEM imagery collected with our local community members. We aim to increase the impact of our local museum to generate interest and connection with Earth Science topics and the Vassar community at large as well as marginalized members of the Poughkeepsie community.

Specifically, there is a need for a conference to meaningfully engage and support the intellectual and professional advancement of students involved in nanoscale research from diverse fields and diverse backgrounds. Given the breadth of the science, engineering, and applications of nanotechnology, there are many global international, national, and regional conferences that support the dissemination of research advances and the engagement and technical exchange between leading researchers and companies active in these fields. These conferences are typically quite large, intimidating, costly, and in some cases quite difficult to get student work accepted for presentation. These significant barriers can greatly limit the participation of students, particularly those involved in less well funded labs and at the early stages of their academic career. The NanoFlorida conference sets itself apart from the larger international, national, and regional conferences for nanoscale research by engaging students at an unprecedented level and not only involving them as technical contributors and presenters but also as conference organizers. NanoFlorida is intentionally sized to be small enough and low cost enough that students can present their research themselves and so that a broader range of students and faculty can build and strengthen a nanotechnology community of scholars. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The objective of this conference proposal is to support the expanded and inclusive engagement of more students from more background in the NanoFlorida 2022 Conference. Specifically, NSF funding will be used to support the involvement of more students in this enriching event, advance their understanding of cutting-edge nanotechnology research, facilitate their professional development, and greatly lower the student cost to register for the meeting and for in-state travel. The proposed objective will be achieved by offering the reimbursement of student registration costs and in some cases partial to full in-state travel support. By providing financial support for the NanoFlorida 2022 Conference, the NSF will advance the understanding of state-of-the-art research in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology by a larger and more inclusive student population that previous years. In addition, the student attending will have opportunities to improve key professional skills and expand their technical network.The success of the NanoFlorida 2022 Conference will be evaluated by using a pre-conference and a post-conference survey. The pre-conference survey will include questions about their pre-conference knowledge of / experience with nanoscale research concepts and their expectations for the conference. The post-conference survey will include questions about their improved understanding of nanoscale research concepts and the selection of keynote speakers, quality of presentations, conference amenities and services, usefulness of professional-development and networking activities for students, and the impact of the conference on their interest in nanotechnology, academic major, and future career. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>NanoFlorida conferences expose students to the latest nanotechnology research and its applications. A conference like NanoFlorida is an ideal venue for graduate and undergraduate students to hone their science-communication skills. The audiences are big enough so that the presentation is meaningful to the student but not too large and formal so that they are nervous to present. Students will meet researchers from other schools and from industry. These professional relationships will provide long-term benefits to student careers in science, technology, engineering, and math fields. Learning about nanotechnology, developing communication skills, and networking with researchers from academia and industry are important steps that prepare students to join the nanotechnological workforce upon their graduation. Using NSF funds to eliminate the financial barrier, which may have prevented the participation of some students from underrepresented groups, underrepresented Florida institutions, and less well funded research groups in the past, could enable more diverse students to attend, present their research, and benefit from the conference's intellectual, professional, and career development activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the case of breast cancer, the majority of patient deaths are as a result of metastasis to other parts of the body, including bones, lung, and brain. Thus, it is important to identify cells that have the potential to be metastatic cells early and reliably. This CAREER proposal aims to develop novel strategies based on measuring quantitative properties of cancer cells to better understand what contributes to metastatic cancer and what specific signature metastatic cells have that distinguishes them from non-metastatic cells. The proposed work integrates a comprehensive education plan for meeting the primary objective of increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in biomedical engineering. This plan will foster awareness and interest in biomedical engineering and research through research mentoring and programming developed to provide early awareness of biomedical career paths for students. In addition, educational outreach events for all levels will be implemented, including initiatives for K-12 and college students, as well as community-focused Health & Outreach Days. <br/><br/>The investigator's long-term research goal is to develop strategies and tools that will help to better understand the role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer metastasis, which will lead to improved health outcomes for patients with metastatic cancer. To make significant positive contributions to clinical outcomes, it is necessary to first have a better fundamental understanding of cancer cell processes and the effects of specific factors from the tumor microenvironment on cancer cell behavior to identify metastatic cells earlier and more reliably. Towards this goal, this CAREER project primarily focuses on understanding contributors to cancer cell metastasis, with a specific focus on the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and adipose-secreted factors. The research objectives of this CAREER proposal are aimed at testing the hypothesis that breast cancer cells have inherent phenotypical characteristics associated with impedance, morphology, and gene/protein expression, which distinguish metastatic cells from non-metastatic cells. Specifically, the aims of this work will: 1) assess the impedance profiles for breast cancer cells of varying type to identify distinct impedance signatures for specific cell types; 2) identify morphological features associated with breast cancer cell metastasis by quantifying changes in cell shape; and 3) assess the effects of cytokines on breast cancer metastasis using impedance and morphology-based analyses. Quantitative in vitro modeling approaches will be applied to obtain quantitative data that will be used to delineate the specific signature of metastatic cancer cells. Determination of specific characteristics useful for identifying metastatic cancer cells will have far-reaching impact for advancing future cancer research and clinical applications. Integrated into this work is a comprehensive educational plan towards meeting the PI?s long-term educational goal of increasing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) awareness and participation of underrepresented minorities in biomedical research and career paths. Specific educational objectives are to: 1) promote STEM and health awareness through educational and community outreach across generations, from K-12 through gray populations; and 2) support cross-disciplinary research mentorship and programming at all levels to increase the number of underrepresented minority students pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying the physical and chemical characteristics of the meltwater released from glaciers is important because it directly affects the quality of downstream lakes, streams, and coastal marine zones. The Coastal Mountains of southeast Alaska are experiencing some of the highest glacial melt rates on Earth. As the glaciers shrink, they leave behind newly formed landscapes and waterbodies such as lakes collecting water in front of the glacier (proglacial lakes) and lakes on the edges of glaciers that are dammed by the glacier ice (glacially dammed lakes). Such lakes can trap sediment, nutrients, carbon, and other elements, preventing them from moving downstream. Additionally, glacially dammed lakes can suddenly release massive outbursts of water if their ice dam fails, creating flooding hazards and sending a surge of sediment and dissolved chemicals downstream. With thousands of glaciers currently receding in Alaska, it is critical to characterize and quantify the ongoing changes in glacierized watersheds and to better understand their ecological impacts. We will track the quantity and quality of water and sediment moving through and out of a glacially dammed lake and a proglacial lake in southeast Alaska using the acoustic doppler velocimeter and other equipment acquired through this project. In doing so, we will involve and train undergraduate students from the University of Alaska Southeast and the local high school, helping to equip the next generation of earth scientists with the skills and tools they need to address glacier change, hydrologic dynamics, Earth surface processes, and natural hazards.<br/><br/>Climate change has triggered glaciers in the Coastal Mountain of Alaska to recede at some of the highest rates on Earth. Increased glacier mass loss is causing the growth of (1) proglacial lakes that can dramatically alter sediment and chemical export from watersheds and of (2) glacially-dammed lakes, which can produce hazardous glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and release a large pulse of biogeochemical elements and sediment to downstream ecosystems. Understanding the storage and release of carbon, water, sediment, and metals such as mercury in and through these glacier-associated lakes is important for explaining how glacier retreat and ensuing landscape change will affect current and future chemical and sediment fluxes. As warming continues and glaciers further diminish, the changing physical and chemical outputs from glaciated watersheds will have implications for recipient aquatic ecosystems, including food web structure and productivity, availability of contaminants, organic carbon burial in coastal sediments, CO2 outgassing to the atmosphere, and the seasonal timing and intensity of coastal ocean acidification. In this project, we will monitor the hydrometric impacts of glacial change in southeast Alaska by acquiring an Accoustic Doppler Velocity meter, water quality sondes, and a multi-probe water quality meter for use in the glacierized Mendenhall watershed in Juneau, Alaska. The hydrometric instruments will be used to train undergraduate students through class labs and research assistantships at the University of Alaska Southeast, which is a small, Alaska-native serving, undergraduate university, and to engage local high school students. The instruments will allow us to further develop a research program aimed at understanding the dynamics and consequences of glacier melt and GLOFs on sediment and chemical export to the highly productive coastal watersheds of southeast Alaska.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From our own experience, we know that measurements made on two independent particles, like the flipping of two coins, are uncorrelated. That is, whether the second coin lands heads (or tails) has no relationship to how the first coin landed.  However, this is not necessarily the case when the particles behave quantum mechanically.  In quantum mechanics, two particles can be entangled resulting in correlated observations.  It would be as if every time the first coin landed heads, the second coin would also land heads.  And if the first coin were tails, the second would be too, even if the two coins were separated by a great distance.  Working with his students, Professor Scholes is developing ways to quantify and demonstrate entanglement in molecular systems, which remains a significant experimental challenge. Their discoveries could have broad implications for quantum information science and engineering (QISE), and lead to new ways to create quantum-based technologies for computing, sensing, and communications. <br/> <br/>The project seeks to develop a general formalism based on quantum Fisher information (QFI) for quantifying quantum correlations (e.g., entanglement) and apply this formalism to experimental observations made on molecular chromophores and chromophore assemblies.  As an initial demonstration of the method, Professor Scholes and his students will attempt to use their approach to quantify quantum correlations by measuring the degree of QFI in the transient spectra of model molecular dimers and of the light harvesting complex (LH2) from purple bacteria. In addition, with the concept of classical phase synchronization used as inspiration, the team is also seeking to demonstrate that quantum effects might be discovered as a stable phase on large scales. The insights gained from this work could guide others seeking to quantify quantum correlations in complex molecular systems and assemblies, enabling new avenues of research. This project also will contribute to the development of a national quantum-enabled workforce by providing advanced training in QISE research for the students and postdoctoral scholars participating in the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This EV-mediated cell-to-cell communication has been implicated in the spread and progression of diseases such as cancer to other parts of the body. Current gold standard methods for EV isolation and analysis involve measurement of EVs contributed from multiple cells and cannot distinguish the differences in the quantity and phenotypes of EV secretion between cells. Addressing this gap in knowledge is key to enhancing our understanding of EVs and better enabling their applications in therapeutics and diagnostics. This CAREER proposal investigates novel optical nanostructures inspired by early theoretical works in quantum mechanics, which when illuminated with light will generate forces to selectively capture EVs as they are released by a single cell without damage, and analyze the single-cell secreted EVs to enable correlating the function of the EVs directly to their cells of origin. The PI along with graduate and undergraduate students will carry out strong outreach and education activities including the construction and placement of an optical tweezer system interfaced with an iPad at the Adventure Science Center museum in Nashville, Tennessee to educate k-12 students and visitors on how light can be used to hold and move small objects on a cellular scale. The PI and graduate students will also develop international education activities that will expose undergraduate students and researchers in West Africa to the computer-aided design of optical nanostructures.<br/><br/>The research project will investigate the physics of photonic Bound States in the Continuum for the generation of electromagnetic fields and optical force at the nanoscale. Bound States in the Continuum (BIC) was initially introduced as a mathematical curiosity in quantum mechanics and has recently emerged as a new way to engineer radiative losses for robust control of light at the nanoscale for a variety of applications in lasers, sensors, and chip-scale optical communications. This project brings BIC-inspired metasurfaces to the domain of single-cell omics towards the in-situ proteomics analysis of single-cell secreted EVs without any cross-contamination from other cells. The intellectual significance of the planned activities includes: (a) an understanding of the role of the geometry of the BIC metasurface elements in minimizing the in-plane and out-of-plane radiative losses to achieve superior electromagnetic field enhancements that is robust to fabrication imperfections; (b) demonstration of nanoscale optical trapping of nanosized EVs using BICs in dielectric metasurfaces for the first time; (c) an understanding of quasi-BIC induced optical force for trapping, three-dimensional transport, release and controlled uptake of EVs by a recipient cell, a capability not possible with any approach reported to date; (d) the in-situ proteomic analysis to profile single-cell secreted EV molecular cargos; and (e) an understanding of whether argonaute proteins are selected cargos in single-cell secreted EVs. The unique capabilities provided by the proposed BIC dielectric metasurface system will allow the PI and the team to associate the properties of EVs directly to their cell sources up to the resolution of single cells, a capability that has so far remained elusive.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By bringing together leading scholars in the economics of cybersecurity with the Israeli National Cyber Directorate (INCD), the project helps advance the cybersecurity of the state of Israel and its organizations. Moreover, it advances the scientific understanding of cyber risk management while serving as a model for future data collection and analysis undertaken in the U.S. and beyond. <br/><br/>The project focuses on three key research objectives. First, a series of empirical analyses examine how exposure and security precautions of enterprises affect likelihood of experiencing a cyber incident. The analysis leverages data from detailed firm-level surveys carried out by Israels Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), complemented by external measurements of enterprise cyber hygiene gathered directly from public sources. The second research objective is to quantify the harms resulting from experiencing an incident. For this effort, the project analyzes data gathered by the Israeli CERT hotline that asks enterprise victims about the impacts resulting from ransomware attacks. Additionally, CBS survey questions involving harm are analyzed. The third research objective is to develop and analyze longitudinal cyber risk indicators.

These materials are often functionalized with peptides, which are short protein fragments, so that the scaffolds better mimic the environment found inside the body. However, cells can degrade these peptides, and a better understanding of how peptide chemistry influences the degradation rate, and how this then changes how cells interact with these scaffolds is needed. This ERI project will first design a series of peptides with different chemical functionalities to understand how changing the end group chemistry can promote peptide stability, and then show that reducing degradation changes how cells attach and migrate within hydrogels. The research plan of this proposal will be paired with outreach efforts in collaboration with a local museum to develop modules for local middle school students to ?make? their own biomaterials using a variety of fabrication techniques. These short modules will show how technologies used during the industrial revolution, such as casting and extrusion, are still used today to make biomaterials.<br/><br/>Bioengineered systems will play a crucial role in improving our understanding of human physiology and developing future regenerative therapies. Many of these use biomaterials featuring a polymer or polymer network that is functionalized with bioactive groups for a variety of purposes, including cell adhesion and signaling. Peptides are commonly used in this capacity as they naturally interface with cells, are chemically stable, and can easily be incorporated into most biomaterial systems. However, the stability of many of these peptides against enzymatic degradation has not been quantified. The central hypothesis of this work is that non-specific cell-secreted protease degradation is present in biomaterial scaffolds, which decreases biological activity, and this can be prevented using nonnatural amino acids at the termini. The project will use a library of peptides to achieve two specific objectives: (1) Quantify the non-specific degradation of a library peptides with different terminal functionalizations and (2) Determine the extent to which cell adhesion, spreading, and migration depends upon the enzymatic stability of the cell adhesion peptide RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate). This information will help other labs design peptides for bioengineering systems with increased stability which will improve the efficacy of peptide-modified biomaterials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although students may be interested in STEM careers, they often lack place-based STEM learning experiences and advanced technology necessary to pursue information and communication technology (ICT) and STEM careers. The project, Teachers and Researchers Advancing Integrated Lessons in STEM (TRAILS 2.0), will expand, scale, and innovate a tested model of integrated STEM instruction and teacher professional development to enhance rural students? learning of STEM content while generating interest in technology-rich and ICT careers. Over four years, TRAILS 2.0 will involve up to 90 in-service secondary biology or agriculture (life science) and engineering/technology education teachers to impact over 10,000 students in the eastern Chesapeake Bay (Maryland and Virginia), Southeastern Colorado, Northern New Mexico, and native Hawaiian-serving schools. TRAILS 2.0 will increase STEM teachers? self-efficacy and expand and sustain their community of practice network. The project will also advance rural school students? learning of STEM content and career awareness.<br/><br/>TRAILS 2.0?s goals for teachers are: 1) strengthen and increase STEM teachers' community of practice, and 2) increase integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy. TRAILS 2.0?s goals for students are to: 1) improve students? capacity to pursue STEM careers by strengthening their 21st-century skills and 2) enhance socio-emotional outcomes (STEM career awareness, engagement in STEM learning, attitudes toward STEM learning, and STEM and ICT careers). TRAILS 2.0 will address Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) by blending science inquiry and engineering design to promote STEM practices and identify crosscutting concepts, which provides teachers with authentic STEM learning contexts they often struggle to locate on their own. TRAILS 2.0 will use local rural knowledge contexts, funds of knowledge, and Indigenous science knowledge (ISK) to create place-based STEM learning through a community of practice, 3D printing, and biomimicry engineering design that promote 21st-century skills. TRAILS 2.0 teacher professional development features a proven exemplar STEM lesson integrating biomimicry with engineering design called D-BAIT. In the D-BAIT unit, students research, design, and produce a biomimicry-inspired fishing lure that mimics aquatic insects or marine life using CAD and 3D printing to create testable prototypes. Teachers will integrate STEM content and promote 21st-century skills while engaging in the D-BAIT lesson as active learners, just like their students. Teacher teams then cogenerate and later implement their own place-based integrated STEM lessons using 3D printing and biomimicry engineering design challenges. TRAILS 2.0 will research place-based integrated STEM teacher professional development on teachers? practices, teacher self-efficacy, and expanded community of practice networks, expanding the knowledge base in STEM education. TRAILS 2.0 will also establish evidence of impact on students? socio-emotional outcomes, 21st-century skills, and STEM career awareness through multiple place-based and ISK STEM learning experiences, exposure to local STEM professionals, and collaboration with peers.

The expected outcome is an increased number of highly-qualified and diverse secondary STEM teachers.<br/><br/>This project at the University of Houston-Clear Lake includes partnerships with eight high-need independent school districts (Channelview, Dickenson, Goose Creek Consolidated, Hitchcock, Humble, Pasadena, Spring Branch, and Texas City), four community colleges (San Jacinto College, Alvin Community College, College of the Mainland, Galveston Community College), and four STEM organizations (Armand Bayou Nature Center, Children's Environmental Literacy Foundation, Environmental Institute of Houston, and Lunar and Planetary Institute). Project goals include 1) recruiting a diverse pool of 24 undergraduate mathematics, science, and computer science majors to the teaching profession, 2) increasing prospective STEM teachers' content mastery and pedagogical skills, and 3) enhancing new STEM teachers' retention and success in the teaching profession. Through lenses of financial support, academic support and enrichment, and social and career support, the project will explore two research questions: 1) How does scholarship support increase motivation to pursue STEM education careers? and 2) How does scholarship support increase student success? Data from this project, collected in the course of project evaluation, will increase knowledge of effective and replicable strategies to attract STEM majors to secondary STEM teaching careers and to improve effectiveness of secondary STEM teachers. These assessments will help inform how STEM pedagogy/content-rich experiences impact future STEM teachers' confidence to teach STEM and their effectiveness as STEM educators in high-need schools, including those with a significant number of English-language learners. Through both quantitative and qualitative measures, the internal evaluation will focus on examination of benefits to program participants, including academic success measures and future career plans. Both formative and summative evaluation of the project will use a concurrent mixed-methods approach, with program progress indicators and a feedback loop to inform program effectiveness. Results will be disseminated through a wide variety of media, including conferences, publications, presentations, and a project website. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spoilage is a large economic driver behind the high price of fresh foods, and strawberries are one of the fresh foods with the highest spoilage with upwards of 40% of harvested strawberries never being consumed and discarded due to microbial spoilage.  Established technologies like refrigeration fail to directly address microbial food spoilage as chilling the produce only delays an inevitable outcome.  The proposed technology is designed to directly address food spoilage through the elimination of microbes. This is not expected to replace washing or cooking foods before consumption but to delay spoilage prior to consumption.  In addition to strawberry preservation, other foods or microbial vulnerable biomaterials may be protected that are too sensitive for conventional packaging technologies.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development an activated carbon pad that delivers glucosinolates and myrosinase enzyme together to extend shelf-life of strawberries when exposed to moisture.  The unique properties of activated carbon allow for the glucosinolates and myrosinase to be separated but delivered together in one product.  The activated carbon may act to sort the molecules with its different pore sizes.  The large myrosinase enzyme will stay on the outer surface and glucosinolates will be adsorbed into the smaller micropores.  When moisture is introduced, the glucosinolates will be carried out of the pores by capillary action and diffuse across the surface.  The free glucosinolates will hydrolyze with the myrosinase enzyme on the carbon surface, releasing a gaseous antimicrobial compound, isothiocyanate.  This creates an atmosphere that has a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect, depending on the reaction rate and gaseous concentration of isothiocyanates.  In addition, the proposed technology has been shown to have a minimal impact on the taste and texture of food preserved with gaseous isothiocyanates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this ERI project is to advance the fundamental understanding of the bulk and surface aqueous photochemistry of CVOCs and its impacts on the size, composition, and physical properties of aqueous solutions of SOA.  To advance this goal, the PI and his team propose to carry out an integrated experimental program structured around three tasks. Task 1 will modify the Lafayette continuous-flow atmospheric chamber though the addition of UV lamp arrays to enable the exposure of aqueous SOA solutions to varying amounts of radiation under controlled relative humidity conditions. Task 2 will measure changes in the size distribution, composition, and surface tension of SOA solutions using aerosolized aqueous mixtures of CVOCs as model systems. Task 3 will analyze the collected data and compare the changes in the physical/chemical properties measured in Task 2 to those from analogous bulk solution and droplet samples.

Across the past decade, 40%-50% of college students in the United States each year started their postsecondary education at a two-year college. Students enrolled at two-year colleges are more likely to be low-income and from historically underrepresented groups, compared to students who start postsecondary education enrolled in four-year colleges. Led by a collaborative team of universities and community colleges representing 9 current NSF S-STEM projects, the PROSPECT S-STEM research hub will explore how equitable partnerships between two-year colleges and four-year institutions can empower low-income STEM transfer students. Researchers at Clemson University, East Carolina University, Southeast Community College, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Augsburg University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of Texas at Arlington, and YNOTI Solutions along with 14 two-year college partners are united by their goal to support domestic, low-income undergraduates as they navigate the transfer process. Numerous challenges exist that can make it difficult for students to successfully transfer from two- and four-year colleges, which in turn can reduce the likelihood that these students earn a bachelor?s degree. This project will address this issue by collecting and analyzing national-level data to highlight transfer issues. The hub?s research will support the development of strategies and resources to build institutional partnerships designed to increase positive outcomes for low-income transfer students. <br/><br/>The PROSPECT S-STEM Hub will operate as a research and dissemination hub to investigate the nature of two- and four-year colleges? partnerships and how developing co-equitable partnerships can better support low-income STEM scholars before and after the transition process. There is a need to understand how two- and four-year colleges can effectively establish and maintain partnerships. Equitable partnerships that support transfer students necessarily involve a range of stakeholders across institutions. PROSPECT S-STEM will examine the nature of these partnerships through: a) longitudinal case studies of two- and four-year college partnerships trying to improve STEM transfer student success; and b) the establishments of professional learning communities with key stakeholders, including advisors, faculty, financial aid, student affairs professionals, and other administrators involved with transfer policies and programs. Our investigation of these partnerships is framed through the lens of community cultural wealth, partnership capital, and dimension of equity. The mixed methods research will include interviews, participant concept mapping, document analysis, and survey data from S-STEM Scholars. PROSPECT S-STEM will target dissemination to researchers, advisors, student affairs professionals, administrators and other stakeholders who support STEM transfer students, thus facilitating the scale up of this project?s practices and findings to others seeking to support low-income STEM transfer students. This hub is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

The proposed technology may be used by hiring managers in mid- to large-scale employers of entry-level service workers. It is anticipated that the beachhead market will be retail. The key insights from preliminary customer discovery were that in large stores with >10k employees, the turnover in entry level positions is very high (e.g., 76% in retail in 2019) and each entry-level vacancy attracts a high volume of applications (e.g., up to 1,000 applications per position). Applicants for these vacancies are often indistinguishable given limited technical skills and previous experience.  Therefore, current screening process for entry-level positions relies heavily on arbitrary filtering heuristics, individual judgement, and interviews, and, as a result, can be particularly prone to discrimination. In addition, employers aim to hire candidates with particular soft skills (e.g., conscientiousness, attention to detail, intrinsic motivation, communication), but find it difficult to objectively measure them. In addition, the cost of replacing a worker who leaves, excluding lost productivity, is high (typically 1.5 to 2.5 times the worker?s annual salary).  By focusing on psychometric and simulated tasks, the proposed technology: a) reduces the risk of systemic discrimination while hiring; b) allows employers to cheaply, quickly and fairly identify best-suited candidates from a pool of indistinguishable candidates; c) have the ability to match workers to best-suited occupations by documenting the transferability of skills across occupations and sectors. The hypothesis is that the technology may reduce screening and hiring costs by more than 60% per head hired, in addition to finding employees that attrit at a lower rate.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of machine learning classification algorithms that use psychometric profiles and performance on simulated tasks to identify best-suited candidates for entry-level customer facing occupations. These tasks have been designed in partnership with employers in each industry to mirror actual work. To select the optimal algorithm for each task, the proposed technology uses a cost function that takes into account the losses to the employer from wrongfully rejecting qualified individuals as well as from interviewing unqualified applicants. Additionally, the proposed technology uses labor market parameters in balancing false positive and false negative predictions in selecting and calibrating the algorithms, which pushes even the frontier in this space, and is beyond the capabilities of any practical solutions in the market today.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ever-expanding databases of genome sequences, protein structures, electronic health records, and biometric data may hold the key for solving crucial problems in many domains, such as biomedicine, agriculture, ecology, and forensics. Gathering useful information from this data requires advanced computer science skills as well as a deep understanding of biology. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Rutgers University-Camden will meet this national need by training Master?s and doctoral degree students in the fundamental biology and biophysics of DNA and proteins, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, and professional best practices for team software development. The traineeship follows a new model for students and faculty mentors that combines innovative training support with increased expectations. While the program is designed to make science graduate training of any discipline more efficient, effective, and accessible, the NRT is specifically designed to overcome the challenges in training students in new fields between traditional domains of expertise. The project anticipates training 30 M.S. and 25 Ph.D. students, with an additional 300 M.S. and Ph.D. students expected to participate in a subset of the activities. Trainees will graduate with a combination of skills that are highly in-demand across academic, government, and industrial workplaces.<br/><br/>The research and training activities of this NRT award are particularly focused on using AI and sustainably developed software to overcome the widening communication gap between genomicists and proteomicists. This communication gap, worsened by diverging scientific dialects, has prevented the synthesis of research advances and the development of new unifying biological principles. AI is a generalizable approach that is being increasingly used by both fields. Software is a powerful method for communication and bridging disciplinary divides. However, it must be accessible to both disciplines and developed to a standard that academic software rarely meets. The team proposes a new model for graduate training that combines evidenced-based methods, redesigned for improved sustainability, and original activities that satisfy an identified need. Training activities will include revised curricula, the introduction of efficient ?just-in-time? short format high-quality training, an industry mentorship program integrated with the trainee?s research, and peer mentoring for expanding perspectives and sharing strategies. The traineeship will introduce the new ?Codes for Life? track into an interdisciplinary graduate degree program at Rutgers University-Camden. Many activities will be extended to all students enrolled in this broad graduate program. As a result, this will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate activities with a large graduate student body without historical departmental constraints. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Precise knowledge of basic stellar parameters such as mass, radius, age, and luminosity are thus essential. However, substantial gaps in this knowledge exist for young, low-mass stars due to the paucity of known eclipsing and astrometric binary stars among this population that enable accurate determinations of these quantities. The proposed research will derive accurate luminosities, radii, ages, and masses for young, low-mass stars using binary systems recently identified by Gaia, K2, and TESS surveys.

Using these systems as ``benchmarks?? they will derive empirical mass-luminosity-age relations, investigate the impact of magnetic activity on the derived parameters, and determine empirical relations for stellar radii, luminosity, and surface temperature from direct observables given an age. They will further explore age distributions in star clusters using spectroscopically determined lithium abundances and through explicit modeling of multiple populations.

In response, many species have evolved internal timers called circatidal clocks to anticipate tidal changes. These clocks control when animals living near the coastline forage, rest and reproduce, for example. Understanding the mechanisms underlying circatidal clocks has proven challenging because of the lack of model organisms that are amenable to gene-level manipulations. Parhyale hawaiensis is a coastal crustacean in which such manipulations are possible. We have established protocols to synchronize and observe circatidal behavioral rhythms in Parhyale.  We are thus well-positioned to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying circatidal timing.  Our first goal is to elucidate the fundamental properties of circatidal clocks.  In particular, we aim to reveal how Parhyale uses cues, such as water levels and turbulence, to synchronize its behavior with tides.  Our second objective is to identify the genes that control the circatidal clock, and to determine which physiological processes are under its control.  Our work should thus provide a much-improved understanding of how animals cope with the challenges associated with ever-changing water levels at the coastline. In this work, we will involve undergraduate underrepresented minority (URM) students through the ?Biological Discovery in Woods Hole? REU program (NSF DBI 1659604).  We will also engage high school URM students in Worcester through the creation of a ?Chronobiology club? that will expose them to research in biological timing.  Finally, we will introduce students at the Puerto Rico Center for Environmental Neuroscience to methods of gene editing in non-standard research organisms.<br/><br/>Intertidal organisms use circatidal clocks to adapt their physiology and behavior to rhythmic tidal changes, in a similar fashion that circadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate daily environmental oscillations. Although the existence of circatidal clocks has long been established, little is known about how they operate. By contrast, the circadian clock is well understood and can therefore serve as a model for hypotheses regarding how the circatidal clock is constructed and functions. Parhyale hawaiensis is an intertidal crustacean amenable to genetic manipulations. We have developed methods to entrain Parhyale?s circatidal rhythms to artificial tides and observe circatidal swimming behavior. We aim to identify the environmental cues that entrain circatidal behavior and determine whether the Parhyale?s circatidal clock entrains to different natural tidal patterns. We also aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying circatidal rhythms. We will use CRISPR/Cas9-guided genome editing to determine whether core circadian clock genes also generate circatidal rhythms. We will profile gene expression across the tidal cycle to identify core circatidal genes and genes regulating organ-specific physiology. Our work should decisively advance our understanding of circatidal clocks, from their interactions with environmental inputs to the molecular mechanisms that generate them. URM students participating in the NSF-supported ?Biological Discovery in Woods Hole? program will be involved in this work.

Study sites will include multiple locations in McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea, Antarctica.  This study will establish patterns in plant properties, genetic diversity and reproductive characteristics of two species of seaweeds, Phyllophora antarctica and Iridaea cordata in relation to depth and light. Long-term changes will be assesed by comparing to results from a survey in 1980. This will be the first study in the region to estimate the potential effects of climate, in particular reductions in annual sea ice cover and resulting increase in light intensity and duration, on shifts in macroalgal communities in McMurdo Sound. Three-dimensional photogrammetry will also be used to evaluate benthic community structure on the newly discovered offshore Dellbridge Seamount. Visualization from the video footage will be shared with web-based interactive applications to engage and educate the public in polar ecology and factors causing changes in marine community ecosystem structure in this important region.<br/><br/>This project is evaluating macroalgae biogeography in Antarctic coastal waters near McMurdo Sound, a relatively understudied region that is experiencing large changes in fast sea ice coverage. The population ecology and genetic diversity of nearshore shallow and deeper offshore benthic macroalgal communities of Phyllophora antarctica and Iridaea cordata will be assessed for percentage cover, biomass, blade length, and reproductive characteristics at seven locations: Cape Royds, Cape Evans, Little Razorback Islands, Turtle Rock, Arrival Heights, Granite Harbor, and Dellbridge Seamount in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The team is also assessing differential reproductive successes at different depths and comparing results to populations surveyed in 1980. The genetic diversity of the two species is being estimated using a combination of whole genome sequencing and species-specific microsatellite genetic markers. Samples from this study will be compared to samples collected from other regions in Antarctica such as the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula. In addition, a macroalgal assemblage and 3D models of the community structure will be generated using photogrammetry from the newly discovered Dellbridge Seamount that is located 2 km offshore in McMurdo Sound.  With the addition of photogrammetry and 3D visualization to this research, web-based applications will be used to engage and educate the public in subtidal polar ecology, population genetics, and the importance of Antarctic science to their lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not everyone follows the same pathway to an engineering degree; current longitudinal research suggests that subpopulations of students take different routes to either completing or abandoning their studies. Accordingly, the BPE program seeks to support research on understanding systematic barriers that push out students from underserved communities. This project will examine a barrier that all students must overcome when pursuing an engineering degree, the curriculum itself. An emerging framework called Curricular Analytics has provided a new method of thinking about how curricula in engineering can be analyzed. The framework quantifies features of the curriculum that make it ?complex? such that they can be connected to outcomes like graduation rates. This project will use a longitudinal dataset called the Multi-Institution Database for Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD), which contains nearly two million records from undergraduate students at 21 U.S. universities from 1987 through 2018 ? 14.4 % of which are engineering students. Using these data, student course-taking trajectories will be created, clustered to find patterns based on measures of curricular complexity and compared to established curricula across engineering disciplines, then disaggregated into subpopulations. This project has the potential to empower administrators, curriculum designers, and advisors to understand how the complexity of the curriculum as defined by faculty and students? deviances from it affects the success of different subpopulations of students. The project will use the perspective of curricular complexity to examine what kinds of programs such as first year experiences, enrollment models, and course sequencing that support the retention and graduation of different subpopulations of students.<br/><br/>To explore what barriers curricular factors impose on different students, the Curricular Analytics framework?s measures will be applied to capture a curriclum?s sequencing and interconnectedness quantitatively and study diverse student pathways - both as codified and as experienced. The guiding research question is: what is the variation in curricular complexity among the following strata ? institutions, disciplines, matriculation models, populations, and pathways ? and to what extent does curricular complexity relate to outcomes for diverse population subgroups? This project will combine curricular complexity with student outcomes and course-taking data from the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) to understand curricular factors in broadening participation in engineering, including retention and degree completion. This project will involve creating trajectories from student course-taking data using association analysis. The curricular complexity for these trajectories will be calculated and disaggregated across the strata of interest. These new data will be used to explore how curricular complexity for ecosystem metrics like discipline stickiness and migration yield are related to the complexity of a curriculum. The combination of the MIDFIELD database with the curricular complexity framework can bring a new perspective on differences in longitudinal studies on engineering student degree attainment and retention in the context of broadening participation. Currently, curricular complexity is a nascent framework with descriptive and explanatory potential, such as correlating program quality with curricular complexity measures. The empirical results can directly inform future curriculum revisions and policy efforts at the studied institutions through unique reports delivered to the appropriate administrative stakeholders. By disseminating these results directly to institutional stakeholders, The project will leverage MIDFIELD?s potential for disaggregation to impact inclusion efforts of underrepresented students in engineering at the curricular and programmatic level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, generally favor a brittle behavior, which reduces mechanical stability of the electronics, photonics, and energy storage devices built with them. Two-dimensional high entropy materials are expected to possess substantially better fracture toughness owing to a greater asymmetry at the atomic level. Thus, this project supports fundamental research to synthesize monolayer and multiplayer two-dimensional high entropy materials, conduct experiments in electron microscopes to visualize fracture, and theoretically reproduce the experimentally observed behaviors. Insights from this study will broaden the family of two-dimensional materials and advance the understanding of the effect of defects and other factors on their mechanical properties and behaviors. With higher fracture toughness, two-dimensional high entropy materials could potentially replace or be integrated with existing materials to produce high lifecycle nanoscale devices. As part of the project, an integrated research and education program will strive for societal impacts through classroom/online education, knowledge dissemination, engineering training, and outreach activities. Research opportunities will be afforded to both graduate and undergraduate students, specially underrepresented minority students. Outreach activities will target K-12 students and, uniquely, homeschoolers to motivate them towards STEM education. <br/><br/>Confined to two-dimensional geometry, cracks generally lead to brittle behavior with minimum plasticity at room temperature, which forms the basis of the dilemma of mutually exclusive fracture toughness and mechanical strength performance in bulk materials. This research aims to investigate asymmetrical fracture of two-dimensional high entropy materials, where bifurcations, branches, and deflections emerge due to asymmetric edge elastic properties at the crack tip and edge swapping during crack propagation, thus, significantly increasing the fracture resistance. Various two-dimensional high entropy materials will be synthesized via solid state reaction and chemical vapor deposition methods. In situ tensile tests in SEM and TEM will be conducted to visualize the deformation and fracture evolution amid various microstructural defects and features, such as the competing ternary and quaternary phases. A multiscale modeling framework based on DFT calculations, data-driven MD simulations, and phase field modeling will be used to simulate fracture behavior with focus on crack initiation and propagation. Ultimately, the project will advance the understanding of the effect of lattice distortion, defects, strain rate, and crack geometry as well as composition on the mechanical behavior of two-dimensional high entropy materials.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 10-11 December 2021 tornado outbreak provides a unique and valuable opportunity to fill knowledge gaps by conducting both aerial and ground evaluations in forested areas damaged by strong tornadoes that passed over complex terrain. The primary objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics. The project team will conduct a high-resolution assessment of forest damage and terrain based on aerial imagery and ground surveys, and then develop a quantitative comparison of damage levels and tornado characteristics across terrain features using GIS tools, machine learning, and analytical vortex models. Results will inform simple engineering models to assess risk to the built and natural environment and will enhance general awareness of the threat of tornadoes in areas where the public may not recognize the dangers. <br/><br/>Existing research into the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics has substantial limitations, including a limited number of case studies, idealized simulation parameters, and inconclusive or contradictory results. A novel research approach will test the hypotheses that 1) tornado intensity decreases (increases) as the vortex moves uphill (downhill), 2) higher (lower) surface roughness leads to stronger (weaker) near-surface winds, and 3) terrain features can deflect the path of a tornado in predictable ways. This approach employs the structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetric range imaging technique to provide an extremely high-resolution characterization of both terrain and treefall at centimeter scales through the development of 2-D orthomosaics and 3-D point clouds that include information on the size, location, and disposition of hundreds of thousands of trees. The data collected here and the subsequent analyses will help the meteorological and engineering communities to move toward scientific consensus regarding the influence of terrain on tornadic circulations and will allow for new and more detailed research studies. Although large eddy simulation (LES) tests are beyond the scope of the work, the data collected here will also enable next-generation LES studies with far greater realism than has previously been possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer simulations provide a means to model and understand the structure, dynamics, and properties of these molecules at a level of detail inaccessible to experiment. The high computational cost of these calculations mean that the accuracy of their predictions is limited since it is difficult to simulate the dynamics of biomolecules for longer than microseconds even on the most powerful supercomputers. In this work, Ferguson will develop novel simulation approaches enabled by machine learning and new mathematical theorems to simulate biomolecules millions of times faster than is currently possible.

The approach is being developed and tested on well-understood fast-folding mini-proteins, and then applied to better understand dysfunction in proteins implicated in cancer, to control the kinetics of DNA double helix formation, and to determine how proteins recognize and bind to DNA. As part of the work, the new computational tools will be made available as free open-source software and Ferguson is offering mentored research experiences for undergraduate and high school students, serving as an instructor in workshops for City Colleges of Chicago students, and developing molecular simulation training materials for the NSF-supported nanoHUB.org.<br/><br/>Andrew Ferguson of the University of Chicago will develop the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of an approach to generate ultra-long atomistic molecular simulation trajectories of biomolecules that are continuous in space and time. This approach, termed latent space simulators (LSS), is trained over short, discontinuous, enhanced sampling simulation data, and then produces continuous all-atom simulation trajectories obeying the correct structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic statistics at several orders of magnitude lower cost than conventional molecular dynamics. Accelerations are realized by the vastly lower cost of propagating the dynamics within a low-dimensional slow subspace spanned by the collective variables governing the long-time dynamical evolution of the molecular system. The computational implementation employs three specialized deep learning architectures that (i) identify the slow collective variables, (ii) propagate the dynamics within this slow subspace, and (iii) decode back to molecular space. Ferguson is developing the approach for fast-folding mini-proteins Trp-cage and protein G, and then applying it to recover structural transitions in c-Src kinase that is overexpressed in cancers, to engineer sequence-dependent hybridization kinetics of DNA oligomers, and to understand binding of transcription factor proteins to DNA.

The increase in landslide susceptibility in post-wildfire environment has been attributed to the increases in soil moisture and reduction of covering vegetation and root anchoring effect. The post-wildfire hillslope stabilization and rehabilitation methods are strongly relying on the knowledge of the engineering behaviors of the wildfire-burnt soil and the effect of post-wildfire environmental factors (e.g., heating-cooling and wetting-drying cycles). However, the transitioning mechanisms from increasing soil movement to catastrophic landslide, along with the engineering characteristics of wildfire-burnt soil, remain unexplored. There is currently no readily available approach or framework to evaluate the wildfire-burnt slope stability or soil properties. This project seeks to serve the national interest by developing a multiphysics and multiscale numerical framework to analyze the engineering properties of wildfire-burnt soil under extreme conditions during and after a wildfire, thus informing our strategies for slope stabilization and remediation. Expected project?s outcomes, such as the physics-based models, multiphysics coupling algorithms, and decision-supporting numerical data, will promote the fundamental understanding of the multiphase granular flow and renovate the technology in wildfire-burnt slope stabilization. This project will also provide a multidisciplinary learning platform through project-based challenging activities to leverage a greater awareness amongst the engineering students about the effectiveness of numerical modeling in addressing engineering challenges related to sustainable and energy viable society.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to quantify the fundamental physics that govern the mechanical and hydrologic soil behaviors and therefore slope stability in post-wildfire environments.

The stability of wildfire-burnt slopes will, for the first time, be evaluated through physics-based correlations that are informed by the particle-scale measurements from the numerical models. The project puts forward an innovative cross-disciplinary multiphysics research that will advance our fundamental understanding of multi-phase wildfire-burnt debris flow and promote insights into the correlations between micro-scale physicochemical forces and macro-scale mechanical wildfire-burnt soil behaviors.

One of the major goals of quantum materials and matter is to understand how new kinds of organizations of electrons and atoms emerge from simple interactions, such as magnetism and superconductivity. Quantum information on the face of it is a very different discipline which deals with information coded in qubits rather than the classical bits, 0 and 1. This program brings together ideas of entanglement between qubits, explores their existence in quantum magnets, and elucidates their unique properties.<br/><br/>Quantum systems show unusual properties not exhibited by classical systems, for example a single electron can behave both as a particle and a wave. An even more mind boggling and ?weird? property, observable for two electrons or two photons (quanta of light), is quantum entanglement. If two electrons are created in a superposition of quantum states?say (1up, 2down) + (1down, 2up) where up and down indicate the direction of the angular momentum of the spinning electron. Now when one qubit is sent to observer A and the other to B, far apart so they cannot communicate with each other, something truly unbelievable happens: If A detects a spin up electron, B necessarily finds an electron with opposite spin. The two spins are entangled. Their precise spin orientations are revealed only when one of them is observed, at which point the spin of the other also gets precisely determined, even though physically very far from the observed electron. Recently, such entanglement was spectacularly demonstrated between photons separated by over 1200 km.<br/><br/>Such entanglement occurs not just between two spins but between billions of spins that exist in magnetic materials with frustration. The emergent state of matter is called a quantum spin liquid. Frustration can arise due to competing interactions and lattice geometry preventing the spins from ordering and forming a magnet. It may appear that with no ordering all is lost, but no! the entangled soup is useful for creating a<br/>special kind of qubit called a topological qubit in which information can be stored in a non-local manner and remains protected from environmental effects that can scramble the information they contain. The goal of this project is to put together the theoretical foundation for quantum entanglement and its signatures in quantum materials.<br/><br/>The research activity will go hand in hand with an education and outreach program. A holistic course on quantum information meets quantum matter that integrates the standard material with simulations, experiments, and current day research will be developed. The PI is a founder of the Scientific Thinkers program for elementary schools whose motto is ?Meet a scientist, Be a scientist, Think like a scientist?. By developing videos on experiments using easily available materials, the engagement of volunteers from Ohio State with the school children and teachers will be greatly enhanced.

Quantum systems show unusual non-classical properties, including quantum coherence, superposition and interference. But the most mind boggling and ?weird? of all is quantum entanglement. Two-particle entanglement has been verified experimentally primarily using photons. This project aims toward the next frontier of multi-particle entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) consisting of billions of entangled spins, thereby unifying quantum information and quantum matter. The excitations in QSLs are fractionalized and are strong candidates for topological quantum computing. The two main thrusts that will be investigated are: (1) the physical nature of non-local correlations imprinted by long range entanglement due to quantum statistics, interactions, and topological order; and (2) the real-time dynamics of fractionalized quasiparticles and how they create novel entanglement patterns in QSLs.<br/><br/>By now quantum phase transitions (QPT) between non-topological phases such as the superfluid-Mott transition in the Bose Hubbard model are well understood. This research activity will focus on understanding the QPT in the Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice between a gapped and gapless QSL driven by a magnetic field and between two topologically ordered gapped phases that harbor very different excitations as a function of exchange anisotropy. Topologically ordered phases harbor unusual fractionalized excitations, whose emergent exchange statistics, abelian and non-abelian, are richer than the standard bosons and fermions found in nature. The aim will be to make testable predictions for experimental probes by coupling an ancilla to the system and by using two-point correlated noise spectroscopy to probe quantum entanglement.<br/><br/>The research will go hand in hand with an education and outreach program. A holistic course on quantum information meets quantum matter that integrates the standard material with simulations, experiments, and current day research will be developed.

Large manufacturing and energy enterprises are comprised of multiple plants sites spread across different geographical locations. These plants contain critical processes and equipment that are monitored using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Predictive analytics, a key component in digital transformation, targets the analysis of large volumes of industrial data to generate insights to improve the efficiency of industrial operations, optimize processes, and reduce the life cycle costs of critical equipment and machinery. The prevailing solutions in today?s market rely on using the Cloud to consolidate data, perform analytics, and extract valuable insights. This process creates significant delays for many industrial processes that require immediate insights into their critical operations. The process is also not suitable for companies that have heightened security and privacy protocols (such as nuclear plants and defense manufacturing). The company seeks to enable companies to conduct predictive analytics on geographically distributed data silos without the need to move data from its location, thus reducing decision latency. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a technology stack that leverages the blockchain to train advanced analytic algorithms and Machine Learning models across data silos in different locations without relying on the Cloud or any corporate server.  Specifically, the project targets the innovative integration of the blockchain Smart Contracts with distributed memory programming frameworks like the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This integration raises several interesting research challenges one of which requires designing basic primitives similar in functionality to a Map-Reduce framework for the blockchain. The second research component revolves around the development of novel algorithmic decomposition schemes for popular Machine Learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) models to facilitate their training in a decentralized manner using the blockchain. If successful, this technology may provide analytic insights faster than the Cloud. It may also significantly reduce the cost and labor associated with implementing and deploying industrial analytics. Data science teams will be provided with the agility and flexibility to modify and redeploy algorithms without having to rebuild and redesign data pipeline infrastructure to a centralized server.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While no one doubts the importance of students? need to acquire technical engineering knowledge, professional skills including communication, teamwork, ethical understanding, and considerations of economic and societal factors are critically important for the professional formation of engineers. Entrepreneurial Support Programs [ESPs] are one mechanism by which students can gain these professional skills, both for students who aspire to be entrepreneurs as well as those who plan to work in industry settings. In fact, many ESPs across the country focus on the acquisition of skills or attributes comprising the professional skill set that engineering students can use in varied career settings, whether that includes venture creation, intrapreneurship, or in a leadership role in industry or even academia.  Over the past several decades, the number of entrepreneurship-focused courses, programs, and cocurricular and other training opportunities embedded into science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs across the country has increased dramatically. However, the impact of ESPs on students? professional formation and the acquisition of different attributes?such as creativity, risk taking, empathy, and curiosity is largely unknown. Though the social sciences have a strong and robust history of studying many of the attributes typically associated with entrepreneurship, there is little connection between this foundational research and the work of ESPs.  This proposal seeks to build a framework that serves as a liaison between social science research and practitioners, who typically do not have the bandwidth or background to engage in this research. <br/><br/>The goal of this proposed project is to bridge the gap between social scientists and engineering entrepreneurship practitioners by creating a research-based framework to guide the development, instruction, and assessment of ESPs. This project will initiate this process with a Delphi study and a set of three virtual workshops with interdisciplinary experts. The outcome will be an initial framework that identifies a clear set of antecedents, characteristics of the ESP context, and entrepreneurship-related outcomes, including career pathways, knowledge of entrepreneurship, and attributes that ESPs aim to influence, along with a set of white papers that describe a) existing measurement approaches and tools with reliability and validity evidence, and b) evidence-based instructional strategies that will impact these entrepreneurship-related student attributes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, soils are common to many parts of Antarctica, and these soils are often unlike any others found on Earth. Antarctic soils harbor unique microorganisms able to cope with the extremely cold and dry conditions common to much of the continent. For decades, microbiologists have been drawn to the unique soils in Antarctica, yet critical knowledge gaps remain. Most notably, it is unclear what properties allow certain microbes to thrive in Antarctic soils. By using a range of methods, this project is developing comprehensive model that discovers the unique genomic features of soils diversity, distributions, and adaptations that allow Antarctic soil microbes to thrive in extreme environments. The proposed work will be relevant to researchers in many fields, including engineers seeking to develop new biotechnologies, ecologists studying the contributions of these microbial communities to the functioning of Antarctic ecosystems, microbiologists studying novel microbial adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, and even astrobiologists studying the potential for life on Mars. More generally, the proposed research presents an opportunity to advance our current understanding of the microbial life found in one of the more distinctive microbial habitats on Earth, a habitat that is inaccessible to many scientists and a habitat that is increasingly under threat from climate change.<br/><br/>The research project explores the microbial diversity in Antarctic soils and links specific features to different soil types and environmental conditions. The overarching questions include: What microbial taxa are found in a variety of Antarctic environments? What are the environmental preferences of specific taxa or lineages? What are the genomic and phenotypic traits of microorganisms that allow them to persist in extreme environments and determine biogeographical differneces? This project will analyze archived soils collected from across Antarctica by a network of international collaborators, with samples selected to span broad gradients in soil and site conditions. The project uses cultivation-independent, high-throughput genomic analysis methods and cultivation-dependent approaches to analyze bacterial and fungal communities in soil samples. The results will be used to predict the distributions of specific taxa and lineages, obtain genomic information for the more ubiquitous and abundant taxa, and quantify growth responses in vitro across gradients in temperature, moisture, and salinity. This integration of ecological, environmental, genomic, and trait-based information will provide a comprehensive understanding of microbial life in Antarctic soils. This project will also help facilitate new collaborations between scientists across the globe while providing undergraduate students with 'hands-on' research experiences that introduce the next generation of scientists to the field of Antarctic biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An ongoing shortage of qualified mathematics teachers in the eight partnering high-need school districts is a critical need the project will address. Well-prepared mathematics teachers are important to ensure that all students, regardless of race or cultural background, develop the mathematical knowledge and dispositions needed for success in life. The project will recruit candidates from mathematics-intensive careers.  These individuals will be supported as Noyce Teaching Fellows (TFs) who will be receive funding as they complete a streamlined master's degree in mathematics education and teacher certification, as well as an annual salary supplement for four years as they teach in high-need school districts.  Project personnel and mentor teachers from the school districts will support the candidates? professional growth as they begin their careers. The project will produce 26 mathematics teachers who can effectively teach mathematics to students in partner schools, and 20 mentor in-service teachers will gain increased knowledge about the research-based teaching of mathematics. <br/><br/>This project at Auburn University includes partnerships with Tuskegee University, Alabama State University, both Historically Black Universities and Colleges, and surrounding high-need school districts (Chambers, Macon, Russell, and Tallapoosa Counties, and Alexander, Auburn, Opelika, and Pike Road Cities).  In addition, the Auburn University Foundation, the East Alabama Regional Inservice Center, and the Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative are non-profit partners in this endeavor. Project goals include recruiting 26 STEM professionals to become mathematics teachers, preparing them to teach mathematics using evidence-based strategies to support the learning of all students, and providing a minimum of four years of professional learning to help them develop into teacher leaders. A professional learning community of the new teachers and their mentor teachers will support mutual professional growth. The project is guided by the Standards for Preparing Teachers of Mathematics developed by the Association for Mathematics Teacher Educators. Research on the impact of preparing and supporting mathematics teachers to provide equitable instruction on their mathematics teacher identity and mathematics teacher leader identity will occur. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to develop annual snapshots of the new teachers? longitudinal development; a set of case studies will explore their professional growth. The evaluation will examine supports and impediments to implementation of the project activities along with progress toward sustainability. The project will disseminate its work through presentations at research and practitioner conferences, manuscripts submitted to practitioner and research journals, and social media platforms. This Track 2: Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

This CAREER project seeks to generate new knowledge about the approaches and strategies of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professors at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and how they successfully cultivate growth mindset classroom cultures, as experienced by their students, to create more equitable learning environments for minoritized students. Negative stereotypes about who can and cannot succeed in STEM adversely affect progress toward the U.S. goal of developing a high quality, diverse STEM workforce. STEM interest and persistence amongst minoritized students (e.g., Black, Latinx, Native American), in particular, are alarmingly lower when students encounter negative stereotypes and inequitable educational environments. Higher education faculty have the power and autonomy to directly influence STEM learning environments and bring about the changes necessary to support students? participation and persistence in STEM fields, but little is known about how professors? beliefs are communicated and how they can cultivate a growth mindset classroom culture. Furthermore, there is a need for exploration of how Black students experience mindsets in STEM classrooms where they are not the racial minority.   <br/><br/>Growth mindset is belief in the malleability of intelligence and abilities. This CAREER inquiry uses a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach to examine the relationships between STEM faculty beliefs, classroom culture, and the experiences, achievement, and persistence of Black students at HBCUs. The project studies HBCU professors of STEM introductory courses and their students to investigate beliefs and pedagogical practices, perceptions of classroom culture, and STEM engagement, persistence, and achievement. Classroom observations will enable investigation of the presence of mindset messages and climate. This work integrates research and education to generate new knowledge and explanations about how to cultivate growth mindset classroom cultures and the associated impact on minoritized students in STEM. Findings will inform the development of a workshop for STEM faculty, the creation and implementation of a graduate colloquium to support and prepare future STEM faculty and the development of course modules, case studies and presentations for broad impact.

Heavy-tailed distributions provide useful mathematical models for seemingly disparate rare events, such as the global pandemic, the 2012 blackout in India, and the 2007 financial crisis. Beyond such isolated catastrophic events, heavy tails are pervasive in large-scale complex systems and modern algorithms. A particularly simple and well-known manifestation of heavy tails is the so-called ?80-20 rule?, whose variations are repeatedly discovered in a wide variety of application areas. Under the presence of heavy tails, high-impact rare events are guaranteed to happen eventually, and may occur more frequently than decision-makers may account for.  Accounting for (or even utilizing) the impact inflicted by such rare events will support the design and operation of reliable and resilient systems in many important scenarios, including environmental catastrophes, power system failures, financial crises.  The accompanying educational plan aims to broaden STEM interest in underrepresented communities and train future leaders of academia, industry, and government by equipping them with fundamental skills in risk analysis.<br/><br/>This research will develop a comprehensive theory of large deviations and metastability for heavy-tailed stochastic systems. The classical theory of large deviations and rare-event simulation has a long history but these approaches and the metastability framework often fall short when the underlying uncertainties are heavy-tailed.  This project leverages and extends recent advances in extreme value theory, optimization, control, and stochastic simulation to fill the gap by building large deviations and metastability frameworks tailored for heavy-tailed systems.  With the new framework, the project will also address open problems in artificial intelligence and actuarial science.  This research will contribute to a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing reliable and accountable AI so that the technology can be applied to high-stake decision-making problems.  Successful implementation of such a program will expand our understanding of how system failures and phase transitions arise in many stochastic systems, which, in turn, will provide provably efficient computational machinery for insurance risk management and accountable AI design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) collaborative project is led by structural, geotechnical, construction, and lifeline engineers, many of whom are cross-trained in social science and policy, to investigate damage patterns to physical infrastructure (buildings, foundations, and retaining structures), and the influence of that damage on decision-making processes for planning and reconstruction. More immediately, the results of this research will inform policies on building regulations in wildland urban interface (WUI) communities.<br/><br/>This research will quantify the impact of building characteristics (year built, building and faade materials, foundation type and characteristics, proximity of other homes, presence/condition of fences or decks, proximity to vegetation) on housing survivability and re-occupancy in wildfires within grassland landscapes. Using the damage patterns and mechanistic behavior of the homes and their various structural components along with understanding of heat transfer and fire spread within a community, the PIs will develop a methodology to quantify exposure temperatures and duration. This data will be used to develop heat maps of the City of Louisville as a method to portray fire intensity throughout the town. These maps can be used by future research teams for benchmarking fire simulations and empirically-designed or validated predictive models. The research will also characterize the jurisdictional reconstruction decision-making processes and tradeoffs in the early post-disaster reconstruction phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, it will recruit undergraduate STEM majors to complete STEM degrees and support them in becoming certified as secondary teachers of mathematics or science. These individuals will receive scholarships and other supports designed to enrich their STEM knowledge, as well as their teaching knowledge and skills. To expand their STEM content knowledge, the Noyce Scholars will have the opportunity to participate in collaborative mentor-scholar projects, summer computational workshops, and a chemometrics course ((i.e., statistics and computer applications in analytical chemistry). They will also benefit from faculty mentorships that include opportunities to reflect on their academic and career pursuits. Monthly workshops will include sessions related to interpersonal skill development, such as grit, and cultural and linguistic competence. Such skills are important for effective teaching in high-need school districts. The project expects these undergraduate Noyce Scholars will gain the knowledge, skills, and perspectives needed to support student learners of science and mathematics in Pennsylvania in high-need secondary schools.<br/><br/>This project at Scranton University includes partnerships with Mid Valley School District and Luzerne County Community College.  There are three specific projects goals. The first is to recruit, prepare, and graduate 21 qualified undergraduate STEM majors to become certified as secondary teachers of science or mathematics. The second goal is to provide professional support for the long-term success of these STEM educators. The final goal is to place and retain a high percentage (90%) of these Scholars in teaching positions in high-need school districts upon graduation as they complete their teaching service requirement of two years of teaching for each one year of scholarship support. Early residency teaching experience will be part of the scholars&#39; coursework when they practice and hone their skills and knowledge alongside an effective teacher-mentor in a high-need classroom. Further, to ensure that the scholars have the necessary support for their Praxis tests, enrichment preparation and support will be provided to the Noyce Scholars through freely available online resources via a learning management software. A robust project assessment process, led by an independent evaluator, is intended to identify aspects of the program that are most effective in STEM teacher recruitment, retention, and preparation. The project intends to use results from this evaluation to improve the teacher education program and will disseminate the results locally and nationally via publications and presentations. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends Noyce project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary k-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Commercial toxic baits are currently the most efficient way to control invasive ants, but these baits negatively impact native biodiversity due to their lack of specificity. This, in turn, facilitates quick recolonization by invasive ants because no competitors are left to limit their spread. In addition, commercially available baits are incompatible with wet or sunny meteorological conditions as these events deactivate the bait?s active ingredient, and most commercial baits are attractive to ants mainly in spring and summer. The proposed technology provides a solution to these issues by delivering an ant bait formulation and delivery system that is 1) protected from moisture and sun, 2) attractive year-round, and 3) specifically targets invasive and pest ant populations. The proposed technology may allow pest-control companies to service parks and yards at any time of the day or year, yard owners to reduce the amount of insecticide applications per year, and ecosystems to recover through the recolonization of native invertebrate populations.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a formulation for an eco-friendly ant bait and a system to deliver it. The attractiveness of the bait was improved by the characterization of the key macronutrients required by Red Imported Fire Ants (Solenopsis invicta, hereafter RIFA) at different times of the year. Various proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates were tested, alone or in combination to create a bait that is highly attractive to RIFA populations in field conditions. The selected formulation combines the macronutrients that are the most important to the ants during each season, which ensures the attractiveness of the bait remains high at any time during the year. Unlike currently available products, this bait is not broadcasted over the infested area but is placed at the bottom of an opened, small, and biodegradable vial. The delivery of the bait into vials constrains foraging ants to compete for the access to the bait, passively selecting for the most abundant and competitive species: invasive ants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Asaduzzaman at the Pennsylvania State University Harrisburg and his students study the reactions of oxidized mercury species with snow and ice by performing quantum chemical calculations.  Mercury is a toxic element that poses severe health issues to the mammalian and human body. It can be transported long distances via the atmosphere and magnify in aquatic food ecosystems. After oxidation in presence of halogens, ozone, and nitro compounds in the Arctic atmosphere, it is deposited on snow and ice surfaces. The oxidized mercury compounds then diffuse through the ice and reach the aquatic environment, where they convert into methylmercury, which is then readily taken up by plankton and is biomagnified in the food web. This project focuses on characterizing the elementary steps for the interactions of oxidized mercury compounds with snow and ice, which control the process for mercury reaching the aquatic environment. This research has potential to understand the mechanism for mercury deposition, reduction, and diffusion on the Arctic surface. The project provides research opportunities for multiple undergraduate students and a high school teacher through a research experience for teachers program. <br/><br/>The research will focus on calculating the atomic scale interaction of oxidized mercury with ice and snow using the quantum chemical methodologies. The project will explore the deposition of oxidized mercury on the ice/snow surface, and the reduction and re-emission of deposited mercury into the atmosphere. This project can help understand many reactions of mercury with ice and snow, diffusion of deposited mercury into the ice, and conversion of inorganic to organic mercury compounds.  The results will aid in determining the rate-limiting steps in the mercury oxidation-reduction processes, and ultimately in developing more accurate global atmospheric mercury models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately one quarter of Earth?s population depends on karst (eroded limestone) water supplies that ? within coastal regions ? are directly threatened by rising sea level, uncontrolled groundwater extraction, and rapid coastal development. Yet, the role of these ecosystems in coastal biogeochemical cycling and groundwater health remains unknown. While pelagic constituents of flooded caves in KSEs have been studied for decades, the living benthic (cave floor / seafloor-hosted) fauna of these caves and caverns remains understudied. The overarching goal of this project is to better understand how benthic biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning across subsurface environmental gradients between freshwater aquifers and the marine environment. Flooded coastal caves allow the team to access the KSEs and make direct observations. Results of this work benefit marine benthic ecology and biology, biogeochemistry, paleoecology and biodiversity assessments. This interdisciplinary project establishes a multinational, multi-institutional collaboration, enhance research and scholarship opportunities at a predominantly undergraduate Hispanic-serving institution in Texas and support young investigators from under-represented groups in the sciences. For outreach, the project-associated PhD student, who is an African American female, is co-authoring a semi-autobiographical children?s book about cave diving and the wonders of cave-associated organisms. 	<br/><br/>KSEs influence coastal carbon and nitrogen cycling because they buffer terrestrial material inputs with groundwater discharge into the oceans. While pelagic communities of flooded cave environments in KSEs have been studied for decades due to their adaptations, biogeography, and evolutionary origin, the living benthic fauna and their role in KSE elemental cycling remains understudied. The overall aim of this project is to establish the diversity and ecology of benthic eukaryotes across environmental gradients in extensive coastal caves flooded by the KSE in the Yucatan Peninsula and Cozumel Island (Mexico) and determine how they interact with benthic elemental cycles. This study provides a holistic characterization of KSE benthos using interdisciplinary field- and lab-based approaches including barcoding/meta-barcoding, meta-transcriptomics, ultrastructural analysis, and lab culturing that are being integrated with biogeochemical and hydrological measurements. Specifically, the investigators are characterizing (1) the drivers of spatial biodiversity patterns in coastal cave eukaryotic benthic communities across salinity/oxygen gradients, relative to organic inputs; (2) the role of benthic meiofauna (to nanobiota) communities, with emphasis on foraminifera, in ecosystem function relative to dominant biogeochemical processes that mediate organic matter transformations and nitrogen cycling; and (3) the temporal constraints of benthic meiofauna (to nanobiota) biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in response to seasonal hydrological variation associated with meteorological events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will research the interaction of nanoparticles with specific cellular proteins that are important for life processes and to develop effective therapies for diseases such as cancer. The PIs will focus on microtubules, which are hollow protein cylinders that impart structural rigidity to cells, enable motility, and serve as conduits for intracellular transport. The ability of these materials to polymerize and depolymerize affects cellular processes and has been the subject of extensive research interest over decades. Understanding how to control the disruption of these protein structures can reduce cellular structural rigidity and serve as a target for cancer therapy. Nanoparticle-mediated inhibition of tubulin polymerization has been reported briefly; however, a general mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Such knowledge can not only further scientific understanding but pave the way to designing novel therapies. In this project the PIs will study the influence of nanoparticles on the polymerization of microtubules (and other filaments) both from a biochemical and structural perspective. To identify and quantitatively evaluate the chemical association of the nanoparticles with tubulin during polymerization, the PIs will utilize infrared spectroscopy, machine learning tools and other biochemical techniques. In terms of analytic ability, the integrated toolkit of measurement devices, imaging, and data analysis will be a valuable resource to investigate molecular-environmental interactions that may be expanded to other biological systems. This knowledge could have widespread implications for the comprehension of nanoparticle-based novel cancer therapeutics. For educational and outreach activities, the collaborating PIs will develop an exploratory program course intended for freshman (science/non-science majors) to enhance their education through greater interaction with faculty in small classes and share their research in nanotechnology. The team will specifically contribute to the education of early career and underrepresented students via university-wide programs. The algorithms and data generated during this project will be used as a basis for educational activities from the high school to professional levels. <br/><br/><br/>At the core of this project's technical approach is the recognition that a complete understanding of the influence of nanoparticles on microtubules polymerization is possible by applying molecular spectroscopy and imaging. Through this project the PIs will develop best methods to use for tubulin polymerization studies with nanomaterials having various chemical and surface properties . The PIs will harness the advantages of infrared spectroscopy by using recent advances in imaging technology to develop a spatially and temporally resolved approach that illuminates molecular details of microtubules dynamics and quantitatively evaluates the role of nanoparticles in tubulin polymerization. The project includes emerging infrared measurement technology coupled to an infrared transparent, cost-effective microfluidic platform that accurately controls biochemical environments spatiotemporally. Using this platform, the PIs will investigate the biochemistry, kinetics, and structural manifest of microtubules upon association with nanoparticles of varying composition, concentration, size, and surface functionalities. The extent of polymerization will be analyzed using a fluorescence assay. Gel electrophoresis studies will be used to assess the extent of polymerization and the phosphate release pathway will be analyzed to obtain possible mechanistic insight. Microfluidics-assisted infrared imaging of the nanoparticles will be employed to study the modulated microtubules formation to reveal manifestation of a completely different array of secondary structures that may arise from the propensity of select monomer units to adhere together during polymerization. Infrared images of the nanoparticles incubated with polymerized and dried microtubules will reveal nanoparticle spectral signatures of microtubules with aggregated proteins. The main technical contribution is a high-throughput IR imaging method to study protein polymerization in the absence and presence of nanoparticles in the microfluidic continuous flow mixing device and validate the results to facilitate understanding of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. The ]obtained data will further be investigated with statistical and machine learning approaches. The PIs will work to ensure that the protocols developed here are available to students of all levels, giving them an opportunity to understand the fundamentals of tubulin dynamics with nanotechnology and stimulating their creativity to develop new cancer therapeutics. In addition, the students will participate in dedicated projects, learning about future career opportunities in these fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 32 unique scholars, comprised of 20 full time and 12 part time students who are pursuing associate?s degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics. First year students attending full time will receive two-year scholarships, and those attending part time will receive four-year scholarships. Project activities include faculty and peer mentoring, cohort-building activities, and career exploration and networking. These are designed to increase motivation to pursue and persist in STEM fields, increase academic success, and improve time to graduation in the STEM disciplines. The project will be informed by expectancy-value theory (EVT), examining student perceptions of the costs of pursuing a STEM degree and the factors that motivate them to accept those costs to access the perceived values associated with it. By improving existing student supports and creating new programming using student feedback through EVT, all Merced students will benefit. The project will also provide a replicable model to be shared with other institutions, broadening the impact of EVT to additional underrepresented, first-generation, rural, and community college students interested in pursuing careers in STEM. Project scholars and their communities may also benefit from the higher wages available to those with STEM degrees. <br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Project goals and specific aims include increased transfer rates to four-year institutions in STEM fields; increased graduation rates of scholar cohorts; reduction in graduation times; increased enrollment of women in engineering, physics, and computer science majors; and wide dissemination of results of the study of Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT)-based supports and their impact on STEM majors at an HSI community college. EVT posits that motivation to engage in a program is informed by a student?s value and competence beliefs. Perceptions of cost are also important in EVT, and in a STEM education context can include time spent, tuition, and family sacrifices, among others. Existing research literature lacks assessments of EVT when applied to all components of students? perceived costs of attending college, which extend far beyond the price of tuition and supplies. There are also gaps in knowledge of EVT factors specific to STEM education among women and community college students. The project will investigate the research questions, ?What is the effect of a continuous Expectancy-Value approach to student recruitment, support, and career exploration on the academic success and persistence of STEM students to graduation or transfer in STEM majors?? and ?What impact does the Merced S-STEM project have on the rate of graduates seeking a career in a STEM field?? Focus groups and surveys will help identify different costs associated with pursuing STEM programs and the project team will adapt programming and activities to best address those costs and student needs. A case study approach will provide formative and summative assessment and findings from multiple data sources will be triangulated to build a coherent understanding of program intervention and impact. Key data sources will include: 1) student motivation surveys, 2) focus groups with students, 3) faculty interviews, 4) academic success metrics including performance, attainment of learning objectives in STEM courses, GPAs, graduation rates, post-graduation career plans, and placement in STEM fields. Knowledge generated will contribute to increased persistence, timely graduation, 4- year college transfers, and careers in STEM by developing and identifying best practices for this student population. The project will provide a model that can be replicated to benefit students at other two- and four-year institutions, with results disseminated through workshops, conferences, and scholarly articles. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

The project will advance understanding of the impact of these interactions on the Agulhas Bank and extend it to the Benguela region. Understanding shelf and deep-ocean interactions in the southern African region will contribute to the forecast of the impact of climate change on the regional ecosystems and the potential feedbacks that those ecosystems will have on the changing climate.<br/><br/>This project uses process-oriented modeling to characterize the shelf and open-ocean interactions between the Agulhas Current, Agulhas Bank (AB), and Southern Benguela Upwelling Region (SBUR) and to evaluate their sensitivity to climate variability and climate change.

It will also contribute to helping reduce the cost of higher education. The significant expense of modern college textbooks limits availability to those who can afford them. As computational thinking and programming increasingly become desired skills, the computing community needs low-cost curricular materials to make computing courses available to all students. Online curricular materials are readily available for introductory programming courses. However, such resources for advanced computing courses do not exist. To address this need, this project's leadership developed ?Dive into Systems,? a free, online textbook for teaching advanced computer systems topics. The goal of this project is to augment ?Dive into Systems? with dynamic visualizations, interactive exercises, and worked examples making it a complete textbook with online resource that will include exercises for students and supplemental resources for instructors.  The project?s focus is on resource development. Its main research questions are related to how the resources are developed, how well they are working, and how effective they are as aids to understanding textbook topics. The project has potential to help the field of computing become more equitable by developing a high-quality, free, online textbook that can be used by college students anywhere.<br/><br/>This project, a collaborative effort between Swarthmore College and the US Military Academy, will continue development of a freely available online textbook on computing systems, including systems software and computer architecture fundamentals. Project goals include four key areas. A primary focus is to develop interactive exercises for each chapter in a computer systems textbook that allow students to perform knowledge checks using an open-source, NSF-funded project called Runestone Interactive. Secondly, the project will expand the Runestone framework to allow for interactive systems programming, such as assembly code execution and stack tracing. As a third goal, the power of the computer science education community will be leveraged to create a rich assortment of instructor materials. Finally, the textbook chapters will be augmented with short videos visualizing key concepts and examples. The project will develop, implement, and evaluate exercises focusing on a subset of six total topic areas each year. Expert participants from the computer science community will work in smaller sub-topic focused groups which will include topics on C programming (e.g., GDB and Valgrind), assembly programming, binary representation, the memory hierarchy and caching, computer architecture, operating systems, and parallel computing and code optimization. The evaluation plan for the project will employ quantitative and qualitative methods. Following the model of early adopter evaluation in prior work, the PIs will distribute student and faculty surveys to gather data across multiple institutions. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

Thus, knowledge of the rates and processes that control nitrogen cycling are needed to understand marine ecosystem dynamics. Nitrogen exists in many chemical forms, and the processes that convert one form to another are mostly carried out by bacteria. However, new data suggest that nitrate stored inside the cells of more complex organisms accounts for a major pool of nitrate in marine sediments. This intracellular nitrate has not been adequately measured and integrated into an overall framework of nitrogen cycling. The investigators will address this issue in the proposed research to better understand and revise nitrogen inventories and flows in the oceans. This information can be used to increase understanding of controls on global carbon cycling and climate change feedbacks. One graduate student will be trained in using tools and techniques to solve complex marine systems issues, and three undergraduate researchers will participate in the work. The team will expand the impact of this research by 1) collaborating with the U. Maine Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning and the Institute for Broadening Participation to produce and distribute educational videos about this research and its implications for the environment; and 2) leading summer workshops to mentor high school teachers to develop ocean sciences curricula in partnership with the Gulf of Maine Institute. <br/><br/><br/>Key processes that influence nitrogen cycling in marine sediments are denitrification and anammox, which lead to a net loss of biologically available nitrogen, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which diverts nitrate away from denitrification back into the system. It has traditionally been assumed that these processes are controlled by bacteria lacking intracellular nitrate and driven by porewater nitrate pools. However, more recent data indicates that large intracellular nitrate pools are widespread in marine sediments and that eukaryotic microbes, particularly benthic foraminifera and diatoms, may be responsible for these pools. The team hypothesizes that the size and flux rate of this intracellular nitrate pool needs to be sufficiently accounted for to accurately measure and understand the nitrogen cycle in marine sediments. Intracellular nitrate presents significant methodological and conceptual challenges to current understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle. The investigators propose two objectives: 1) To measure rates of intracellular nitrate cycling and other major nitrogen cycling pathways in marine sediments across a depth gradient from photic subtidal to dark continental shelf sediments in the Gulf of Maine; 2) To further examine controls on intracellular nitrate cycling by conducting physiological experiments on different microbial eukaryotic cells isolated from the proposed study sites to measure their intracellular nitrate pool sizes and cycling rates. They propose a new strategy using nitrogen-15 labeled nitrate spike experiments to measure the role that intracellular nitrate plays in overall rates of nitrogen cycling in marine sediments. Through the proposed work, they aim to develop a model system to understand and integrate intracellular nitrate cycling into the nitrogen cycle in marine sediments more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Development of heart-on-a-chip technologies to quantify and evaluate the response of human heart to external stimuli such as drugs is of critical importance for determining effective treatments for heart disease. Limitations of current systems include insufficient mimicking of organ-level physiology and analysis methods that prevent continuous monitoring of heart behaviors over extended time periods. This project seeks to address those challenges and greatly expand the landscape for heart-on-a-chip technologies by developing automated systems integrating heart slice culture components with arrays of sensors and actuators for chronic on-chip assessing of organ-level cardiac physiology. This will enable study of heart disease mechanisms and facilitate drug screening. The outcomes of this project will broadly impact and transform the development of engineered biomedical systems and organ-on-a-chip technologies for drug screening and disease modeling applications. The project will provide cross-disciplinary education and research training opportunities in bioelectronics and cardiac physiology to undergraduate and graduate students, especially students from underrepresented backgrounds. Outreach activities to educate K-12 students and local communities will showcase heart-on-a-chip demonstration kits and summer programs.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop scalable heart-on-a-chip platforms that allow automated culture of human organotypic heart slices and real-time continuous on-chip multiparametric analysis of human cardiac physiology at cellular and tissue levels and their applications in drug screening, which lie outside of the capabilities of state-of-the-art biomedical technologies. This project relies on two investigators with complementary expertise in materials, microfabrication, bioelectronics, life sciences, and cardiac physiology. Specific research foci include: (1) developing high-density single-cell spatial resolution sensors and actuators for crosstalk-free mapping and modulation of essential cardiac properties; (2) designing scalable automated heart-on-a-chip platforms to support chronic culture of human organotypic heart slices and continuous on-chip electrical and optical mapping of human cardiac tissue physiology; (3) assessing the heart-on-a-chip systems by testing acute and chronic cardiac drug responses and cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs.

This has important consequences for their physiology and more broadly for the way marine ecosystems function. When ectotherms warm up, their metabolism increases; meaning they breathe more rapidly, and eat more just to stay alive. This is bad news for prey since a warm predator is a hungry predator. But warming also enables prey species to crawl or swim away more quickly when being hunted. Thus, everything speeds up in warm water. Energy flows more quickly from the sun to seaweeds (via photosynthesis), to the herbivores, then on up to the large predators at the top of the food chain. The research team is testing these ideas in the Galpagos Islands to determine how temperature influences marine ecosystems. Ongoing work in this iconic natural laboratory is helping marine ecologists understand the role of temperature and how this and other ecosystems could function in the future as climate change warms the ocean. Other broader impacts of the project include student training and on-site outreach to tourists and the local community about ocean warming and some of the lesser-known species that inhabit the Galpagos. <br/><br/>The broad goal of this project is to understand the effect that temperature has on patterns and processes in upwelling systems. Specifically, the team is measuring the temperature-dependence of herbivory and carnivory in rocky subtidal habitats of the Galpagos. They are performing field experiments to measure the relative and interactive effects of temperature, herbivory, and nutrient flux on the productivity and standing biomass of benthic macroalgae. Additionally, they are using in situ predation assays across spatial and temporal temperature gradients and mesocosm experiments to determine the relationship between ocean temperature and predation intensity for predator-prey pairings including whelk?barnacle, sea star?urchin, and fish?squid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the first time in the history of this conference series, the STDC will be open to both in-person and remote participants.  By allowing for both in person and remote participation, the 55th STDC will be able to bring together a broad and diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate research and establish connections for future collaboration. The organizers expect to host more than 100 participants from the United States and from abroad on-site, as well as more than 100 remote participants.  A crucial part of the STDC is its involvement of researchers at all career stages?graduate students and early career researchers as well as established researchers?allowing for younger generations of mathematicians to find mentors and to establish their research trajectories. In addition, the STDC makes a conscious effort to promote diversity in mathematics in its recruitment of organizers and speakers, with a focus on ensuring representation of women and underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>The 55th STDC is structured around five special sessions, each with a focus on one aspect of topology?continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric group theory, geometric topology, and set-theoretic topology. The invited and contributed talks of these special sessions and their associated plenary and semi-plenary speakers provide an opportunity for the announcement and discussion of the most significant advances in the various subfields of topology over the last year. In addition, the STDC reserves a plenary address for the winner of the annual Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher award, which is given to an early-career topologist with outstanding contributions to the field. This year, the STDC will also host a workshop on Linear Dynamics, a relatively young subfield of dynamics, aimed at graduate students and early-career mathematicians, as well as a series of open problem, collaboration, and mentoring sessions. These talks and activities provide an excellent framework for the establishment of new collaborative efforts in mathematical research and for encouraging full participation of graduate students and early career researchers.

The project, Teachers and Researchers Advancing Integrated Lessons in STEM (TRAILS 2.0), will expand, scale, and innovate a tested model of integrated STEM instruction and teacher professional development to enhance rural students? learning of STEM content while generating interest in technology-rich and ICT careers. Over four years, TRAILS 2.0 will involve up to 90 in-service secondary biology or agriculture (life science) and engineering/technology education teachers to impact over 10,000 students in the eastern Chesapeake Bay (Maryland and Virginia), Southeastern Colorado, Northern New Mexico, and native Hawaiian-serving schools. TRAILS 2.0 will increase STEM teachers? self-efficacy and expand and sustain their community of practice network. TRAILS 2.0 will also advance rural school students? learning of STEM content and career awareness.<br/><br/>TRAILS 2.0?s goals for teachers are: 1) strengthen and increase STEM teachers' community of practice, and 2) increase integrated STEM teaching self-efficacy. TRAILS 2.0?s goals for students are to: 1) improve students? capacity to pursue STEM careers by strengthening their 21st-century skills and 2) enhance socio-emotional outcomes (STEM career awareness, engagement in STEM learning, attitudes toward STEM learning, and STEM and ICT careers). TRAILS 2.0 will address Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) by blending science inquiry and engineering design to promote STEM practices and identify crosscutting concepts, which provides teachers with authentic STEM learning contexts they often struggle to locate on their own. TRAILS 2.0 will use local rural knowledge contexts, funds of knowledge, and Indigenous science knowledge (ISK) to create place-based STEM learning through a community of practice, 3D printing, and biomimicry engineering design that promote 21st-century skills. TRAILS 2.0 teacher professional development features a proven exemplar STEM lesson integrating biomimicry with engineering design called D-BAIT. In the D-BAIT unit, students research, design, and produce a biomimicry-inspired fishing lure that mimics aquatic insects or marine life using CAD and 3D printing to create testable prototypes. Teachers will integrate STEM content and promote 21st-century skills while engaging in the D-BAIT lesson as active learners, just like their students. Teacher teams then cogenerate and later implement their own place-based integrated STEM lessons using 3D printing and biomimicry engineering design challenges. TRAILS 2.0 will research place-based integrated STEM teacher professional development on teachers? practices, teacher self-efficacy, and expanded community of practice networks, expanding the knowledge base in STEM education. TRAILS 2.0 will also establish evidence of impact on students? socio-emotional outcomes, 21st-century skills, and STEM career awareness through multiple place-based and ISK STEM learning experiences, exposure to local STEM professionals, and collaboration with peers.

The format of the SBME will be a four-day summer bridge program with two major components: 1) math workshops and 2) campus-life orientation/career introductory field trips. The mission of the program is to assist students with their math preparation and adjustment of both academic and student life at SDSU-IV through workshops, activities, resources, and various experiences which prepare them for their successful academic and social transition to the University. Assessments will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in increasing students? math confidence level and for program improvement. Enrollment information and future course success will be used to evaluate program impact. The SBME at SDSU-IV will 1) bridge the community STEM workforce shortfalls and equity gaps, 2) maximize students' STEM and mathematics confidence, and 3) align STEM program outcomes with workforce needs. In addition, it will benefit society by improving the STEM education quality for underrepresented groups, at SDSU-IV directly, and bridge the gap between their desire for more diversified career choices and local community needs at Imperial Valley.<br/><br/>The primary goals of this project are to 1) provide an effective math learning experience, 2) facilitate a smooth first-year transition to the university environment, 3) connect newly admitted students to the SDSU-IV community by helping them build their support network (e.g. academic and student support services) to ultimately increase retention and college completion, 4) spark general STEM interest, and 5) attract minority students to enroll into the new B.A. in Mathematics. In addition, the program will help students: assume responsibility for their learning both in and out of the classroom; acquire academic, personal, and social skills essential to success in college and beyond; develop effective communication skills; establish a supportive cohort with fellow students; and gain campus knowledge to readily identify faculty, staff, and campus resources. Through targeted recruitment activities, the program will seek to increase STEM enrollments of underrepresented populations including women and students of color. Results from the project will inform activities at the University, but also improve STEM recruitment and retention activities across similar institutions that are rural HSIs and attend to economically disadvantaged, and geographically marginalized populations, particularly the US-Mexico border states. This HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs.

Students enrolled at two-year colleges are more likely to be low-income and from historically underrepresented groups, compared to students who start postsecondary education enrolled in four-year colleges. Led by a collaborative team of universities and community colleges representing 9 current NSF S-STEM projects, the PROSPECT S-STEM research hub will explore how equitable partnerships between two-year colleges and four-year institutions can empower low-income STEM transfer students. Researchers at Clemson University, East Carolina University, Southeast Community College, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Augsburg University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of Texas at Arlington, and YNOTI Solutions along with 14 two-year college partners are united by their goal to support domestic, low-income undergraduates as they navigate the transfer process. Numerous challenges exist that can make it difficult for students to successfully transfer from two- and four-year colleges, which in turn can reduce the likelihood that these students earn a bachelor?s degree.

However, these intelligent tasks become challenging on high-speed motion and edge devices due to limited computing resources and low power supplies. This research will explore a brain-inspired framework to process the visual information from two complementary visual sensors, event-based dynamical vision sensors (DVS) and frame-based standard cameras, in a sensor-fusion style.

Methods that use information about dental development are particularly useful for juvenile age estimation. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the developmental relationships between teeth and how these relationships affect error rates in juvenile dental age estimation. A better understanding of human variation in dental correlations can improve both methods of age estimation for bioarchaeological and forensic research as well as clinical understanding of human growth and development. The project supports graduate training in STEM, the development of open-source dental age estimation software, and online training workshops for researchers and practitioners.  <br/><br/>In order to simplify mathematical modeling, it is often assumed that dental developmental traits are independent from one another after accounting for the effect of chronological age. The problem with this conditional independence assumption is that if conditional independence is not biologically valid, resulting age estimates will be biased and have error rates that are larger than expected. This is a problem in both bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology because biased age estimates can compromise our understanding of past populations and unknown age interval error rates do not meet the Daubert standard for expert testimony. These issues are addressed through three specific aims: 1) characterize the extent of correlations between developing teeth, 2) characterize the degree of variability of correlations between developing teeth, and 3) develop, validate, and test an open-source developmental age estimation program that incorporates the correlations between teeth. These aims are approached using Bayesian statistical models and cluster analysis in R. Models are fit to dental development scores of living children and validated using dental development scores from existing decedent databases in order to develop the age estimation software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 10-11 December 2021 tornado outbreak provides a unique and valuable opportunity to fill knowledge gaps by conducting both aerial and ground evaluations in forested areas damaged by strong tornadoes that passed over complex terrain. The primary objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics. The project team will conduct a high-resolution assessment of forest damage and terrain based on aerial imagery and ground surveys, and then develop a quantitative comparison of damage levels and tornado characteristics across terrain features using GIS tools, machine learning, and analytical vortex models. Results will inform simple engineering models to assess risk to the built and natural environment and will enhance general awareness of the threat of tornadoes in areas where the public may not recognize the dangers. <br/><br/>Existing research into the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics has substantial limitations, including a limited number of case studies, idealized simulation parameters, and inconclusive or contradictory results. A novel research approach will test the hypotheses that 1) tornado intensity decreases (increases) as the vortex moves uphill (downhill), 2) higher (lower) surface roughness leads to stronger (weaker) near-surface winds, and 3) terrain features can deflect the path of a tornado in predictable ways. This approach employs the structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetric range imaging technique to provide an extremely high-resolution characterization of both terrain and treefall at centimeter scales through the development of 2-D orthomosaics and 3-D point clouds that include information on the size, location, and disposition of hundreds of thousands of trees. The data collected here and the subsequent analyses will help the meteorological and engineering communities to move toward scientific consensus regarding the influence of terrain on tornadic circulations and will allow for new and more detailed research studies. Although large eddy simulation (LES) tests are beyond the scope of the work, the data collected here will also enable next-generation LES studies with far greater realism than has previously been possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the above phenomena, whether related to climate change or the impact of people on the natural environment, have imposed significant and serious impacts on human health. To identify possible solutions, the Geological Society of America (GSA), a professional society of over ten thousand members and many affiliated geoscience societies will survey its constituents and collect input on where the geosciences are best positioned to make fast progress in ameliorating environmental impacts on human health. Results of their community survey will be summarized in a report that will be made available to the public. Key outcomes will be the identification of geoscience-related environmental processes that have the highest human-health impacts and are primed for immediate resolution and/or intervention. Broader Impacts of the activity will be to improve our understanding of and better management of environmental impacts on human health.<br/><br/>The Geological Society of America (GSA) will conduct a broad, inclusive, results-driven survey of its constituents.  Activities will include: feedback via a web-based submission platform for GSA members, Divisions, and Associated Societies. There will also be social media campaigns.

For example, the development of large-scale unmanned aircraft system operation in urban areas for package delivery depends on such a capability. The fundamental issue is to determine if there is a viable solution in a specific situation; at the present time the complexity of this problem is too high to guarantee that a solution can be found. The team of researchers is developing a lower complexity approach with wide application in artificial intelligence. The project engages student researchers from underrepresented groups in computer science, and the research results are integrated into the classroom through courses like artificial intelligence, theory of computation, and autonomous agent systems.<br/><br/>The project provides a new approach to agent planning at the cognitive level. The basic innovation is to convert the satisfiability problem into a geometric setting; in particular, the models of an n-variable logical sentence are viewed as the corners of an n-D hypercube, and interior points assign probabilities to the variables. Each conjunct in the conjunctive normal form sentence reduces the convex feasible solution region. Any non-empty feasible region indicates the existence of a solution to the probabilistic satisfiability problem and can also be probed with linear programming methods in polynomial time to seek an answer to the satisfiability problem. Particular approaches to be explored include: (1) modifications to the interior point method using barrier methods, (2) finding linear programming solutions in a non-Euclidean geometry, (3) applying random rotations to the feasible region to allow coordinate projects to determine if there is a solution, and (4) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to get a point near a corner.

Through this multi-faceted program, the DISCoVER Expedition will methodically lower the technology-transfer barriers related to physical scaling, integration complexity, tool support, and interfacing to room-temperature electronics. Through its curriculum innovations, DISCoVER will empower a new generation of engineers and entrepreneurs who will bring superconducting to the mainstream of computing. The hands-on superconducting labs housed at USC, combined with K-12 outreach across partner institutions, will allow the DISCoVER team to bring the excitement of computing hardware to future generations of the workforce.

Innovative aspects of this project are the collaborations with other federal agencies (e.g. the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration) and Pennsylvania State University, a major research-intensive university. The project will answer the research questions: (i) What evidence-based active learning strategies and interventions are successful at HSIs? (ii) What institutional programs lead to increased retention and graduation rates for students majoring in STEM fields?<br/><br/>Two goals guide the Strengthening Teaching and Advancing Research Partnerships(STARp) project. First is to implement new active learning pedagogies in gatekeeper STEM courses to increase the retention of students in STEM majors. Second is to involve students in undergraduate research and citizen science projects to increase their persistence in STEM education and pursuit of STEM career paths. The STARp project will use evidence-based approaches that have been shown to improve student success of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. This project will improve undergraduate education by using the flipped classroom approach where the professor delivers course content outside the classroom and then engages students in live problem-solving during class time. In addition, the STARp project will provide experiential opportunities for research and internships to improve students? transition to graduate programs and the STEM workforce. It will also target the critical second-to-third year transition through citizen science projects in which undergraduate students train and lead high school students in their creation of a community-based research project. The five-year project will identify factors that develop student interest to continue postgraduate studies and/or integration into the STEM workforce. A mixed methods research approach will be used to assess the impact of each intervention. The strategies employed by the STARp project are aimed to broaden representation in the STEM fields. The results are expected to be used as models for other Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) seeking to overcome obstacles to undergraduate student success in STEM. The project?s best strategies, activities, and success will be shared in publications, web pages, and social media. The knowledge generated by the STARp project has the potential to contribute to a diversified STEM Workforce. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity.  Projects supported by the HSI Program will also draw from these approaches to generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CPS project aims to investigate methods and computational tools to design a new user-centric paradigm for energy apportionment and distribution and, more broadly, for trustworthy utility services. In this paradigm, distributed networked systems will assist the end users of electricity in scheduling and apportioning their consumption. Further, they will enable local and national utility managers to optimize the use of green energy sources while mitigating the effects of intermittence, promote fairness, equity, and affordability. This project pursues a tractable approach to address the challenges of modeling and designing these large-scale, mixed-autonomy, multi-agent CPSs. The intellectual merits include new scalable methods, algorithms, and tools for the design of distributed decision-making strategies and system architectures that can assist the end users in meeting their goals while guaranteeing compliance with the fairness, reliability, and physical constraints of the design. The broader impacts include enabling the automated design of distributed CPSs that coordinate their decision-making in many applications, from robotic swarms to smart manufacturing and smart cities. The research outcomes will also be used in K-12 and undergraduate STEM outreach efforts.<br/> <br/>The proposed framework, termed Automated Synthesis for Trustworthy Autonomous Utility Services (ASTrA), addresses the design challenges via a three-pronged approach. It uses population games to model the effect of distributed decision-making infrastructures (DMI) on large populations of strategic agents. DMIs will be realized via dedicated networked hybrid hardware architectures and algorithms we seek to design. ASTrA further introduces a systematic, layered methodology to automate the design, verification, and validation of DMIs from expressive representations of the requirements. Finally, it offers a set of cutting-edge computational tools to facilitate our methodology by enabling efficient reasoning about the interaction between discrete models, e.g., used to describe complex missions or embedded software components, and continuous models used to describe physical processes. The evaluation plan involves experimentation on a real testbed designed for zero-net-energy applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, training the latest Machine Learning models continuously necessitates that new algorithms and techniques be developed to solve increasingly complex problems at much larger scales. This project is concerned with particular classes of min-max optimization problems as they  arise in many important applications of modern Data Science, e.g, training fair ML models that are not biased against individuals with certain sensitive attributes, designing AI systems that reliably perform against changes in the input data, and training ML models for generating artificial music. The research agenda focuses on developing new algorithms to solve various computational issues associated with such min-max problems; it will provide a natural vehicle to create educational content, and foster mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. A central component is outreach to high school students via the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI) and the USC Viterbi K-12 STEM Center; these programs serve K-12 schools and teachers in Southern California that face systemic inequities. <br/><br/>The main technical aim is to develop both theoretical foundations and scalable algorithms for (stochastic) non-convex min-max optimization problems. The efforts will address several longstanding open questions related to the robust operation of these non-convex models. Special attention will be given to designing provably efficient algorithms for computing first-order stationary solutions of certain structured non-convex (stochastic) min-max problems for which currently no algorithm with polynomial iteration complexity is known to exist. The envisioned algorithms exploit the structure of the objective function and of the constraint sets, leverage recent advances in the field of numerical differentiation, and explore tradeoffs in memory and processing capabilities offered by computational platforms. The fundamental minimum computational efforts required for finding stationary solutions will be studied under different scenarios motivated by a wide range of applications such as robust machine learning, fair statistical inference, and training generative models, and the research outcomes are expected to have an impact on these applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This invention performs real-time matrix-vector multiplication that is essential for classical and quantum optical information processing applications. In classical computing, this device is core for developing photonic chips for unconventional computing with photonic spin simulators, neuromorphic computing, and machine learning with analog photonic neural networks. In quantum information processing and quantum machine learning, a similar functionality is required for performing linear operations in photonic integrated circuits that manipulate quantum states of light. In addition to applications in optical computing, the proposed component may serve as a universal multi-input multi-output device for ultra-high-speed manipulation of light in photonic integrated circuits for a broad spectrum of purposes ranging from analog optical signal processing to metrology and sensing and involve applications in telecommunication and LiDAR.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of photonic integrated circuits that perform analog matrix-vector multiplications with light. A universal photonic device that can perform arbitrary linear operations is an indispensable component of classical and quantum optical computing, while it also serves as a critical multiport circuit for advanced manipulation of light in photonic integrated circuits. One of the main limitations of integrated photonic matrix multipliers is their relatively large, compared to the wavelength of light, feature sizes that prevents their scaling to large numbers of ports. The proposed technology introduces a new architecture for realizing compact photonic circuits that perform arbitrary linear operations by dense packing of two building blocks: waveguides and phase shifters. The plan is to develop scalable and energy-efficient integrated photonic circuits that can perform arbitrary complex linear operations with light by utilizing this architecture. In addition, the goal is to develop programmable photonic circuits for general-purpose applications by incorporating tunable phase shifters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will experiment with a novel rocket technology to obtain air samples in the mesosphere and use state of the art mass spectrometers to analyze isotopes in the samples.<br/><br/>The team plans to deploy a novel, zero-carbon emission rocket that will enable atmospheric sample collection at 37 km and 70 km altitude in the atmosphere. This will provide proof-of-concept for a clean, inexpensive, and efficient rocket sampler capable of atmospheric exploration well beyond the current altitude limit of conventional balloons (30 km). This rocket technology and platform will facilitate direct sampling of the upper atmosphere, especially the mesosphere on a scale that is currently economically and environmentally infeasible. Four atmospheric samples (2 launches at 37 km, 2 at 70 km) will be isotopically characterized using state of the art mass spectrometers at both UCSD and Harvard. The target atmospheric gasses are O2, CO2 and N2, which have either never been, or are severely under-sampled at these altitudes, limiting our understanding of mesospheric contributions to the stratosphere and troposphere. Isotopic analyses will also extend to the trace oxygen isotope ? 17O ? and isotopic ?clumping? in both O2 and CO2. The measurements will be compared to new laboratory experiments on the CO2-O2-O3 photochemical system, which aim to better constrain the characteristic isotope effects and physical chemistry of Mesosphere/Stratosphere O3 photolysis. <br/><br/>This new rocket borne sampling technology is more flexible in terms of altitude targets, cheap relative to other sampling platforms, and environmentally responsible.

Rainwater harvesting has emerged as a promising and sustainable technology to address both of those needs. Harvesting rainwater involves the collection and storage of rain for subsequent usages such as landscape irrigation, vehicle washing, and toilet/urinal flushing. With the appropriate treatment, harvested rainwater could also be utilized for potable needs including drinking, cooking, and bathing. However, for potable usage, rainwater must be treated to eliminate risks to human health including the complete removal of Legionella, a waterborne pathogen that has been detected in harvested rainwater worldwide. The overarching goal of this project is to advance the implementation of a novel and more effective assay for detecting and quantifying the presence of harmful Legionella bacteria in harvested rainwater. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator of this project will explore the use of ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR) as a new and promising assay that could accurately quantify the concentrations of viable and harmful Legionella bacteria in harvested rainwater. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the collection of new data and development of fundamental knowledge to prevent exposure to harmful Legionella bacteria when using harvested rainwater for potable and non-potable applications. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two undergraduate students at Longwood University. <br/><br/>Legionella is a waterborne pathogen, if inhaled, can cause severe illness in humans.  Legionella bacteria have been detected in rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) worldwide. Culture-based methods cannot detect viable but non-culturable cells and thus they tend to underestimate the concentration of harmful Legionella cells present in a water sample. Molecular methods such as qPCR cannot distinguish between living, viable, and dead cells and consequently they tend to overestimate the concentration of harmful Legionella bacteria in a water sample. The goal of this ERI project is to advance the implementation of a promising new technique (ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction or EMA-qPCR) that could lead to more accurate estimates of the concentration of viable and harmful Legionella bacteria in harvested rainwater. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator will conduct point-of-use sampling at 50 RWHS and measure the concentrations of Legionella bacterial species including harmful L. pneumophila bacteria using four methods including a cell culture-based assay, qPCR, an enzyme-based assay (Legiolert?), and EMA-qPCR. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact by providing data to support new and more accurate estimates of human health risks associated with the potable and non-potable usages of harvested rainwater.  The fundamental knowledge gained from this project could also enable engineers and communities to design, build, and deploy more effective and safer RWHS to augment potable and non-potable sources of water while reducing surface and groundwater pollution due to stormwater runoff.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology also may gather aggregate level data to understand what the thresholds are for social media engagement and emotional well-being. Currently, more than 90 percent of teens and young adults are social media users, and nearly half report being online almost constantly. Research correlates time spent on smartphones with high levels of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. The proposed technology aims to mitigate the effects of ?always on? social media culture. Current products that address this issue include apps that allow the user to briefly lock themselves out of their phones to limit screen time. These apps provide short-term solutions to a deeper problem ? a culture of social media that demands hypervigilance and constant engagement. Social media is designed to be an immersive environment where users ?lose time? mindlessly scrolling for hours on end. The proposed technology aims to provide a long-term, sustainable solution to social media dependence.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a diagnostic tool to promote mindfulness around social media use. The proposed technology is designed to: 1) raise awareness of unconscious social media habits, including time spent on these sites and socio-emotional triggers that prompt clicking on social media apps; 2) stimulating reflection of how time spent on social media affects emotional well-being; and 3) providing momentary interventions in screen time through suggestions for non-screen related brain breaks. The goal is to make visible unconscious, routinized behaviors related to technology devices and social media. The proposed technology addresses the harms of excessive screen time and social comparison on social media, especially among youth, a problem that has been well-documented in the research literature. This idea emerged out of findings from NSF research suggesting that youth struggle to self-regulate screen time and a break in routine may serve as a powerful catalyst for self-awareness of how social media affects self-esteem and emotional well-being.

These operations can affect personnel safety, loss of capital, significant damage to the environment, and increase emission of greenhouse gases. To optimize subsurface operations, knowledge of the state of stress in rock formations is essential. Failure to construct reasonably accurate stress models costs the oil and gas industry several billions of dollars annually. However, determination of in-situ stresses is one of the major challenges in the subsurface engineering and currently no technology directly measures these stressees in deep formations. This project advances a tool to measure these stresses directly.<br/> <br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and develop a robust an innovative downhole tool for direct measurement of all stress components and the stress orientation in deep wells with any well trajectories. The objectives of the Phase I research study include: 1) Develop analytical and numerical solutions to accurately obtain far-field stresses from near-wellbore stresses.  2) Design and render the tool and all its components for borehole sizes range 7? to 12 ?.  3) Develop numerical modeling and simulation of different downhole conditions.  4) Design the mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical components, materials, and sensors/transducers and preparation for prototyping.  The proposed tool has a novel modular design for wireline, drill-pipe and coil tubing applicable to vertical, deviated, and horizontal wells. This measurement can be repeated as needed to determine the full stress tensor. The technology is automatically operated from the surface. The exact position and orientation of the tool is determined by an assembly and magnetometer, respectively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most devastating effects of these fires are apparent: the loss of homes, communities, and sometimes lives. However, beyond the physical destruction, one of the unanswered questions about the environmental impact of structure burning is whether fire liberates metal particles from household and structural components. Metals are found in everything from pipes to electronics to paints and pigments. Metals such as lead, copper, zinc, cadmium, and others can be toxic to the environment and humans. Once released, the smallest of these metal particles can be transported by wind events with subsequent deposition by rain and snow throughout different environments. The December 31st 2021 Marshall Fire in Boulder County, Colorado resulted in over 1000 structures burned, with as yet unknown impacts on metal release to the surrounding environment. It is of pressing concern to rapidly analyze ash from burned structures for the presence of metal particles. In order to accomplish this, the research team at Colorado School of Mines is employing state of the art particle analysis techniques that are sensitive to specific metals to determine if metal particles are present in ash samples. If found, further analysis will determine if the concentrations are at significant levels, and if humans are at risk of toxicological effects. By leaching the ash with simulated biological fluids, the project will assess the potential for metals to be absorbed by human lungs. This project will provide essential information to increase understanding of fire-derived metals while furthering our analytical capabilities via application to complex natural systems. Beyond the scientific goals of this project, community outreach and education are of high priority. Community members will be invited to participate in sample gathering and data analysis. The research team seeks to hold virtual and classroom forums involving the Boulder community, from the high school level to others within  the general populous. These presentations will be aimed at educating the community on the findings of the research, sharing the health impacts of nanoscale particles, and providing hands on experiments for students.<br/><br/>As climate change induces desertification of the environment, wildfires are becoming more prevalent and more devastating. Wildfires are expanding out of wilderness areas and into the wildland-urban interface, including densely packed suburbs. The Marshall Fire in Boulder County, Colorado recently burned over 1,000 homes and many other structures.  The ash and smoke generated from this fire has the potential to be more harmful to both the environment and human health than materials generated from wildland fires.  Specifically, the anthropogenic materials burned may lead to the presence of metal-containing nanoparticles (diameter < 100 nm) in the resulting ash/soot.  The project goal over the next 12 months is to determine the amount of metal (Cu, Cd, Hg, Pb, Zn among others) present in the nanoparticle form in ash and soot. The research team will collect samples from the area impacted by the Marshall fire, focusing on ash from within burned homesites, nearby soils, and surface waters located downwind of the burned area.  Samples collected in non-urban, upwind sites will act as controls. This RAPID  project will utilize the novel technique of single particle ICP-MS to detect and quantify the nanoparticles present in deionized water suspensions.  The research team will investigate the effects of particle size on metal bioaccessibility by performing single particle ICP-MS analysis as part of dissolution experiments using simulated lung fluids.  Timely analysis of the burned materials will advance knowledge of metal speciation in post-fire debris and may inform a responsible remediation effort with respect to human health and environmental impact. Beyond the scientific goals of this project, community outreach and education are of high priority. Through a ?citizen science approach?, community members will be invited to participate in sample gathering, with results being communicated back to the participating homeowners. The research team will hold virtual and classroom forums involving the Boulder community, from the high school level to others within the general populous. These presentations will be aimed at educating the community on the findings of the research, sharing the health impacts of nanoscale particles, and providing hands on experiments for students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current shape-reconfigurable structures are limited in their achievable shapes, motions, and stiffness, making them unsuitable for some functional and load-bearing applications. The outcome of this research will provide theoretical models, experimental data, simulation tools, and new design methods for achieving structures that can extensively vary their shapes while maintaining stiffness as well as volume and mass efficiency. The knowledge generated will expand the capabilities of vehicles to adapt in remote and unknown environments and advance the frontiers of space exploration, targeted drug delivery, and robotic systems. For example, reconfigurable sensor and antenna structures equipped on swarms or constellations of small satellites could enable low-cost, large-scale measurements for inquiry in geospace and atmospheric science.

This project will develop protocols to use newly discovered microbes for efficient PHA production.

These applications provide, in part, the means to create an immersive experience for work, education, and healthcare which helps to bridge the gap in experience between in-person interaction and video telephony. Achieving the high data rates, though, requires going to higher radio frequency bands than are currently used for cellular communications. In the last five years, cellular communication has embraced the lower millimeter wave spectrum, which refers to radio frequencies from about 25 GHz to 100 GHz. Indeed, millimeter wave communication has become one of the defining features of fifth generation cellular communication systems. Going to terabit-per-second data rates will require higher bandwidths that are available above 100 GHz, in what is known as the sub-THz band. This collaborative project establishes fundamentals that will help realize sub-THz communication and drive the future of wireless technology. It develops new hardware and algorithms that help to create the required high data rate communication links to serve the applications highlighted above. For example, it develops technology that helps sub-THz communication signals better go around obstacles, by instrumenting the environment with smart reflective surfaces and reconfigurable antenna arrays. The results of the project will contribute to the development of new wireless technologies that are beneficial for personal communication, safety applications and industrial deployments. Industry impact and technology transfer will occur through frequent communication with the partners of the sixth generation North Carolina program. The project will lead to more undergraduate and graduate students with expertise on new and important technologies for wireless communications.<br/><br/>Sub-THz Augmented Routing and Transmission for 6G is a collaboration among experts in wireless communications at North Carolina State University (NC State) and Yonsei University (YSU). It addresses the design of reflective surfaces and reconfigurable arrays for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication at sub-THz frequencies. It devises methods for configuring the beams formed or reflected from those arrays in a way that routes around obstacles. It creates algorithms that exploit new levels of reconfigurability in the arrays to obtain higher throughput and more robust communications. Finally, it results in the creation of joint real-time hardware (H/W) and software (S/W) testbeds for sub-THz communications. The uniqueness of this project lies in the multi-domain approach for improving sub-THz communications. The intellectual merit will occur in several directions. (a) Intelligent reflective surfaces constructed from state-of-the-art meta-materials / meta-devices. (b) Reconfigurable antenna arrays with adaptable structures that are mechanically and electrically controlled. (c) Directional-beam-based initial access and beam routing algorithms that leverage channel map information. (d) Models of reconfigurable antennas arrays and performance limits of those arrays. (e) Algorithms that leverage true time delays to reconfigure those arrays to support high bandwidths. (f) A suite of evaluation scenarios that test the developed hardware and algorithms.

Such coated seeds boost crop yields and production, and reduce agricultural inputs (e.g. water, energy, fertilizers, land use, and pesticides). The unique coating could alleviate abiotic plant stressors such as soil salinity and drought, making the seeds more climate resilient. The project will provide tools that will make it easier for microbe-based agriculture companies to build and deploy their technologies more broadly.

The IoT revolution has significantly improved the efficiency of supply chains by providing unprecedent levels of data-driven insight but has opened up the dark side of cyberthreats. The key value of the proposed technology to adopters is minimized losses due to ransom payouts and system downtime that has significant downstream effects on the national economy and public confidence in national security. Investing in the proposed technology is expected to pay for itself multi-fold by preventing just one cyberattack each year. A nation-wide adoption of the technology would allow the energy industry to leverage the benefits of the IoT revolution without sacrificing security. In addition, the proposed technology may bring next-generation technologies to the forefront that can significantly reinforce the energy resiliency of the US and augment renewable sources. In light of the looming energy crisis, promoting such technologies plays a pivotal role in ensuring self-sufficiency and maintaining an edge against state-sponsored adversaries.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an active fingerprinting security feature embedded in sensors of cyberphysical systems that serves as a last line of defense against insider threats, while also providing an avenue for data recovery even if the system is hacked.  It relies on the inherent redundancy of the physics of the system to store a permanent incorruptible record of the system's operational history, which may then be cross-referenced for both intrusion detection and data recovery if the system is compromised. The proposed technology is designed with zero-impact and zero-observability conditions in mind, i.e., the implementation must not affect the system operation and remain covert to a third-party malicious agent inspecting the data. This significantly deviates from overt security measures such as encryption and other active techniques, which may be visible, leave a footprint on the system and/or be reverse-engineered by artificial intelligence (AI). To the contrary, the proposed technology is rendered immune to detection by AI and cannot be bypassed even by insiders intimate with the system due to its zero-impact and zero-observability conditions, and is further enhanced by a cryptographically secure one-time-pad. Due to the ability to understand the physics of the system, a key merit of the prosed technology is its ability to recover data immediately using the physics itself without requiring additional vault-like data storage and backup mechanisms, all of which cause significant downtime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technical outcomes of the project will facilitate the design and engineering of efficient electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. The educational efforts of the project will build and incorporate demo devices of electrochemical cells and materials imaging platforms into a series of education and outreach activities both domestically and internationally. The project will train the graduate and undergraduate students with skills in both experimental and simulation methods and provide them with an international collaborative research experience. The project will contribute to efforts to educate the public on the basic mechanisms of renewable energy conversion and storage.<br/><br/>The project?s aim is to achieve a thorough atomistic understanding of electrochemical processes by determining the 3D structure of electrode-electrolyte interfaces, including both the surface of the solid electrodes and the liquid solvation layers. The project?s approach will integrate molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations with 3D atomic-resolution force microscopy experiments to achieve a joint experiment-theory platform for precise understanding and prediction of electrochemical interfaces. The platform will be used to unravel the solvation layer structure that is responsible for energy storage in carbon-based supercapacitors, and the solvent-included atomistic kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions on single-atom catalysts. The project will produce fundamental models of solid-liquid interfaces that consider the inherent atomic-scale heterogeneities. Furthermore, the thorough determination of the atomistic interfacial structure and catalytic activities of single-atom catalysts will shed light on the unconventional scaling relationships of catalysts with nonuniform structures. This will be an important step towards a more predictive, molecular-level theory beyond the widely accepted ""Sabatier Principle"" for heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. The results will significantly foster the design and engineering of electrochemical interfaces for low-cost, highly efficient renewable energy applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The platform could revolutionize and automate the process of sorting and packing irregular-shaped objects, e.g., sorting plastic mail bags with various dimensions and weights for USPS; and packing irregular-shaped goods for Walmart and Amazon. The project could also revolutionize portable automation that relies on general tools in advanced manufacturing, e.g., enabling the large footprint of aircraft assembly in confined space access for Spirit AeroSystems; and automating manufacturing processes that require various kinds of manipulation such as placing, grasping, and capping.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform system extending robotic grasping towards dexterous strategies for multi-fingered hands, and increasing the capability of context perception by fusing novel sensors. To accomplish dexterous grasping and manipulation, a dexterous robotic hand was designed by tightly integrating anthropomorphic gripper mechanics, context perception, and task-oriented grasp planning. The robotic hand achieves in-situ perception of object affordances by fusing multimodal sensors, including object dimensions and object characteristics such as materials, rigidity, and mass. This is the first robotic gripper that perceives object characteristics by using infrared sensors and machine-learning methods. To deploy efficient strategies for various task requirements and object affordances, a knowledge-driven model is developed to resolve the planning of dexterous manipulation motion. The model represents human knowledge as hand topology and learns task-oriented manipulation plans to adapt to different work context. Due to the integrated structure of knowledge and learning, the model produces robust and adaptive plans with a high efficiency in learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

McCusker of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University will be exploring how certain aspects of the electronic structure of transition metal-based complexes manifest in their photo-induced chemical properties. The specific aspect being studied is electron spin, which is the origin of many properties that people are widely familiar with (e.g., magnetism) but whose influence on photochemical reactivity has not been elucidated. To achieve this goal, the research program will involve the synthesis and characterization of a range of chemical systems that have been designed to enable the establishment of a clear correlation between the spin properties of the system and the photo-induced properties that they exhibit. Working at the interface of synthetic organic and inorganic and experimental physical chemistry, the research will provide a fertile training ground for students to understand and appreciate the interconnection between these formally disparate subfields of chemistry while developing fundamental new insights into how a very basic component of atomic structure can be leveraged to create new molecular functionality for a wide variety of potential light-enabled applications.<br/><br/>Conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental property of Nature. While its influence on certain aspects of molecular science are well known, this research program is asking the following: to what extent does this concept manifest in photo-induced chemical processes? To address this fundamental question, the research will involve the synthesis of a series of transition metal-based donor-acceptor complexes whose spin properties can be systematically varied, either by judicious choice of a single metal ion (e.g., replacement of Cr(III) by Co(III)) or by exploiting the temperature dependence associated with the spin ladder of a Heisenberg exchange-coupled polynuclear metal cluster. Characterization of the photo-induced electron and/or energy transfer dynamics will focus on steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies, including variable-temperature ultrafast optical and x-ray methods. It is anticipated that the research will provide insight into how zero-field spin polarization manifests in the photophysics of molecular systems with the goal of demonstrating how consideration of these effects can suggest new approaches for the development of compositional platforms using spin as a design feature for creating and manipulating photo-induced molecular functionality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As uncontrolled bleeding remains the leading cause of preventable death from trauma, effective hemorrhage-control training may be the difference between life and death for a trauma victim. Though existing training programs have been successful in reaching large groups of people across the globe, these training programs are limited by the use of unrealistic training models. The proposed technology, while remaining portable and affordable, is designed to realistically simulate a hemorrhagic emergency. For institutions who educate the public, their students, or their employees on hemorrhage-control techniques, this technology may offer better training without increasing training time. As interest and mandates surrounding widespread hemorrhage-control training beyond the healthcare setting continue to expand at the local, state, and national levels, it is imperative that trainees are provided with a realistic training experience to ensure that they are prepared to act in a real-life hemorrhagic emergency.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable, affordable, and realistic hemorrhage-control training device that utilizes real-time biofeedback mechanisms to model a physiological response to application of proper hemorrhage-control techniques. Though hemorrhage-control training models exist, they are not feasible for use in widespread training due to high costs. Research suggests not only that current training programs lack realistic simulation, but that this shortcoming may compromise the effectiveness of these programs on preparing individuals to perform life-saving skills in a real-life trauma situation. The most commonly reported elements of hemorrhage-control training programs that lack realism include demonstration of bleeding, the actual pressure needed to stop a bleed, the stress and urgency of a real-life emergency, and the reaction of a wounded patient to intervention. To address these shortcomings, the proposed technology may include a traumatic wound with pressure sensors that read pressure applied directly to the wound as well as through application of a tourniquet. Upon application of adequate pressure, hemorrhage cessation will be demonstrated. Additionally, a speaker will be embedded to simulate a patient?s reaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response, many species have evolved internal timers called circatidal clocks to anticipate tidal changes. These clocks control when animals living near the coastline forage, rest and reproduce, for example. Understanding the mechanisms underlying circatidal clocks has proven challenging because of the lack of model organisms that are amenable to gene-level manipulations. Parhyale hawaiensis is a coastal crustacean in which such manipulations are possible. We have established protocols to synchronize and observe circatidal behavioral rhythms in Parhyale.  We are thus well-positioned to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying circatidal timing.  Our first goal is to elucidate the fundamental properties of circatidal clocks.  In particular, we aim to reveal how Parhyale uses cues, such as water levels and turbulence, to synchronize its behavior with tides.  Our second objective is to identify the genes that control the circatidal clock, and to determine which physiological processes are under its control.  Our work should thus provide a much-improved understanding of how animals cope with the challenges associated with ever-changing water levels at the coastline. In this work, we will involve undergraduate underrepresented minority (URM) students through the ?Biological Discovery in Woods Hole? REU program (NSF DBI 1659604).  We will also engage high school URM students in Worcester through the creation of a ?Chronobiology club? that will expose them to research in biological timing.  Finally, we will introduce students at the Puerto Rico Center for Environmental Neuroscience to methods of gene editing in non-standard research organisms.<br/><br/>Intertidal organisms use circatidal clocks to adapt their physiology and behavior to rhythmic tidal changes, in a similar fashion that circadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate daily environmental oscillations. Although the existence of circatidal clocks has long been established, little is known about how they operate. By contrast, the circadian clock is well understood and can therefore serve as a model for hypotheses regarding how the circatidal clock is constructed and functions. Parhyale hawaiensis is an intertidal crustacean amenable to genetic manipulations. We have developed methods to entrain Parhyale?s circatidal rhythms to artificial tides and observe circatidal swimming behavior. We aim to identify the environmental cues that entrain circatidal behavior and determine whether the Parhyale?s circatidal clock entrains to different natural tidal patterns. We also aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying circatidal rhythms. We will use CRISPR/Cas9-guided genome editing to determine whether core circadian clock genes also generate circatidal rhythms. We will profile gene expression across the tidal cycle to identify core circatidal genes and genes regulating organ-specific physiology. Our work should decisively advance our understanding of circatidal clocks, from their interactions with environmental inputs to the molecular mechanisms that generate them. URM students participating in the NSF-supported ?Biological Discovery in Woods Hole? program will be involved in this work.

This project will infuse Industry 4.0 skills within both Florida's Engineering Technology programs and the manufacturing technician workforce. The project is leveraging findings from a prior award, Technician Future of Work Issues Caucus for Florida Community Colleges and Manufacturers. The Caucus identified Florida-specific technician workforce skills deficiencies and a statewide collection of Florida manufacturers willing to work on this problem.

When conditions become too stressful on reefs, corals can lose beneficial microbial symbionts (e.g., dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae) that live in their tissues via a process called ?bleaching?. Although Symbiodiniaceae play key roles in the health of coral colonies, we know little about the processes that make symbionts available in the environment to prospective host corals. This research tests the extent to which the feces of coral-eating fish, which contain live Symbiodiniaceae, facilitate symbiont acquisition by corals in their early life stages. It will generate seminal knowledge on how corallivore feces impact coral symbioses and health, and will assess the ecological importance of corallivorous fishes as drivers of coral symbiont assemblages. This research also test the extent to which corallivore feces are a source of food and nutrients that impact coral health; this has particular relevance to the survival and recovery of bleached adult corals. This research can ultimately inform intervention strategies to support reef resilience and mitigate reef degradation. Results from this project will be communicated widely in scientific arenas, in undergraduate education programs, and to the public via multimedia content and outreach. The Houston Independent School District (HISD, Houston, TX) is the nation?s 7th largest public school system. This work will also support economically disadvantaged and first-generation undergraduate students in pursuing STEM majors and careers through multi-year research experiences.<br/><br/>Symbioses between foundation species (e.g., corals, sponges, trees) and microbiota (e.g., microeukaryotes, bacteria) underpin the biodiversity, productivity, and stability of ecosystems. Consumers, such as predators and herbivores, shape communities of these foundation species through trophic interactions. For instance, grazers contribute to the maintenance of coral dominance on reefs via consumption of macroalgal competitors. However, the indirect effects of other consumers on foundation species are rarely examined. Few studies have tested how consumers affect microbiota assembly in corals, even though coral symbionts (e.g., dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae) play key roles in reef function and persistence. Corallivorous (coral-eating) fishes were recently demonstrated to egest large quantities of live Symbiodiniaceae cells as they swim across reefs. This research is testing the hypothesis that corallivore feces promote coral dominance on reefs by supporting coral acquisition of key symbionts and nutrients. The following research objectives will be accomplished: (1) to quantify the contribution of corallivorous fish feces to coral symbiont acquisition; and (2) to test the extent to which corallivorous fish feces influence coral health and recovery from thermal stress. Reefs are being degraded globally due to climate-change induced bleaching and associated mortality. This project is teasing apart the extent to which nutrients and/or live symbionts associated with corallivore feces contribute to the resilience of bleached corals under ambient and heat stress conditions. The research is tightly integrated with two education objectives: (1) to organize a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program in which rigorous learning modules that high school teachers can incorporate into their Environmental Systems course offerings are developed and tested; and (2) to provide undergraduate students with a multi-year research experience through a partnership with the Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CIEDs are being implanted more frequently as patients are living longer with cardiac disease. Hematomas are a common complication following CIED implant procedures, occurring in up to 9% of patients. Most of these patients are on a combination of blood thinners, which further compounds the risk.  Hematomas are not only painful and disfiguring for patients, but they are the greatest risk factor for developing CIED infections as they increase the risk of infection by 20-fold. CIED infection is associated with high morbiditiy/mortality with an upwards of $50,000 in healthcare costs per infection. With over 3 million CIEDs implanted annually worldwide, reducing hematomas and subsequent infection may result in healthcare savings and risk mitigation for the hospital. There is additional incisional scarring on the chest wall for patients requiring battery and generator exchange procedures occurring every 6-10 years. Improvements in wound healing and scar cosmesis may result in improved patient satisfaction and quality of life. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a non-invasive, externally applied, pneumatic compression device that reduces the incidence of hematomas and improves wound cosmesis for patients undergoing CIED implant procedures. The proposed device is applied post-operatively to the surgical site for 2-4 hours in the recovery room. The design is a pneumatic compression system that consists of a transparent air inflation mechanism with an inflatable surgical balloon and an air release valve. The compression system is fixated to the surgical site via four circumferentially applied adhesive pads. The balloon is inflated to ~40 mmHg, a pressure that has been well tolerated in a clinical trial and sufficient to combat venous pressure to reduce bleeding. The device?s transparent material allows for direct wound assessment during device wear.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This situation is particularly relevant to the problem of replacement speech following a laryngectomy, where unsteady flow exiting a tracheoesophageal prosthesis produces pulsatile vortex rings that impinge on the curved wall of the esophagus. The resultant esophageal pressure field is responsible for successfully producing tracheoesophageal (i.e., replacement) speech. As such, understanding the mechanics that arise as vortex rings impact curved surfaces, in particular the pressure loading that is produced, could lead to improved success rates of replacement speech. This work is also more broadly applicable to both biological and engineering flows, such as cardiac hemodynamics, fluidic energy harvesting, wall-bounded turbulence, etc. The physics of these interactions will be investigated via flow visualization and both two-dimensional and tomographic particle image velocimetry. Acquisition of the velocity fields will enable determination of vorticity topologies, pressure field estimation, and identification of pressure source terms, as well as the resultant wall loading that arises during these interactions. This proposal blends the research efforts with a novel outreach plan to help high-school choral students envision how an interest in artistic expression in voice can lead to a career in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The proposed work plan will explore the mechanics of vortex ring-surface interactions with both hemispherical and cylindrical cavities. Flow visualization and particle image velocimetry will be utilized to explore how a primary vortex ring approaching a cavity induces flow on the surface of the cavity, and subsequently causes the flow to separate and roll-up into a secondary vortex ring, and potentially develop azimuthal instabilities. This interaction will be investigated in both axisymmetric (hemispherical) and two-dimensional cavity geometries as a function of cavity radius relative to the primary vortex ring radius. The pressure loading that develops on the concave surface will also be quantified to provide insight into the fluid-structure interaction. The outcomes from this research plan will improve success rates of tracheoesophageal speech. The project will also facilitate the training and education of one graduate and multiple undergraduate students. Finally, the outreach program will inspire high-school students to pursue careers in science and engineering fields, while also providing paid summer research experiences for two of them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current approaches to preparing prospective secondary mathematics teachers, such as building an equity mindset, implementing culturally relevant pedagogy, and developing academic literacy are typically pursued in silos. This project aims to transform a traditional teacher credential program into a subject matter-driven integrated program in which prospective mathematics teachers simultaneously undertake mathematics content and mathematics specific pedagogy while also learning evidence-based intervention strategies both for typically developing students and students with mild to moderate disabilities. This approach has the potential to revolutionize mathematics teaching and learning in high-need urban schools. Considering the reported number of students who do not meet standards in mathematics, especially students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and with disabilities, this project's innovative approach to mathematics teacher preparation is critical to disrupting the status quo. This project will support 30 mathematics majors over a period of five years who will develop, implement, and refine integrated instructional practices as they complete a B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in special education and a single subject credential in mathematics. <br/><br/>This project at San Jose State University includes partnerships with East Side Union High School District and Campbell Union School District. Three goals guide this project. First, the project will produce 30 new secondary mathematics teachers over five years with deep integrated instructional skills to serve the needs of all students. Second, the project will establish a STEM content-driven and integrated-by-design teacher preparation program. Third, the investigators will identify integrated strategies and examine outcomes of these strategies for effectively implementing mathematical literacy-driven instructional practices using culturally-relevant and social-justice oriented performance tasks. The underlying theoretical framework for organizing prospective mathematics teacher learning incorporates a formative-assessment design teaching cycle process along with the research-derived Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction resource guide and toolkit for supporting all learners. The project will advance knowledge of how to prepare 21st century secondary mathematics teachers who possess the mindset, skills, and knowledge to create and support high-impact mathematical literacy-driven instruction and learning in inclusive mathematics classrooms. Formative evaluation including surveys and interviews will provide ongoing feedback for continuous improvement in the following areas: how well the project attracts participants; how well prospective mathematics teachers are prepared for the work of teaching in high need schools; and how well the project is able to retain beginning teachers in high-need schools. The project team, Advisory Board, and external evaluation team will generate summative assessments, gauge success, identify concerns, and provide recommendations for implementing timely change. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM mentor teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, years of effort have had limited success: women and ethnic minority students remain severely underrepresented, starting with undergraduate engineering programs at universities. Most of the underrepresentation is due to chronic extremely low diversity in a few of the engineering disciplines (aerospace, mechanical, mining, electrical, and computer engineering in particular). In contrast, others (e.g. biomedical and environmental engineering) are roughly at gender parity. Ethnic diversity shows analogous patterns. Preliminary data from the University of Arizona suggest that this is due to female and minority students? disproportionately low levels of interest in these disciplines. This project will pilot a new approach to increasing diversity in engineering, at the level of individual disciplines where diversity is lacking. We further hypothesize that female and minority interest in mining and aerospace engineering would increase if they were presented with a greater connection to social benefit. Initially, the investigative team will carry out surveys and interviews at the University of Arizona College of Engineering to measure preexisting demographic differences in students? levels of interest in engineering disciplines. We will test these hypotheses with a mixed-methods intervention study focused on two specific non-diverse disciplines (mining and aerospace engineering) at the University of Arizona. Baseline data (surveys, interviews) will continue to be collected in Year 1. Then, a targeted intervention to two low-diversity majors (aerospace and mining engineering) will examine whether female and Hispanic students? interest and representation increases when introductory courses and recruitment materials change to emphasize their socially beneficial aspects as well as abstract engineering. Interventions in Year 2 will reorient the introductory mining engineering course, and the recruitment materials given to students for both mining and aerospace engineering, to address more of the socially beneficial aspects of both disciplines. Surveys and interviews with students over the course of the project will evaluate changes in women and minority (mainly Hispanic) students? interest in mining and aerospace engineering, compared to the non-intervention group (mechanical, electrical, computer engineering). Interventions will remain in place for Years 3-4 of the project while additional data are collected.  If successful, this project can point the way to improving diversity in engineering at the level of the specific engineering disciplines where it is most needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will determine the value of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite series (GOES-16 and -17), for tracking and characterizing volcanic lightning during eruptions, as this tool has been seldom used despite its ability to continuously monitor numerous active volcanoes in the Western Hemisphere, including the U.S.A. This project will launch the careers of several science students at two different Alabama universities and aid scientists at volcano observatories in using GOES satellite data to better assess volcanic hazards following eruptions. Additionally, project results will become part of the lightning exhibit at the Alabama Museum of Natural History in Tuscaloosa, which explains the effects of lightning on materials. Museum staff will develop grade school teaching materials focused on lightning and will freely distribute these materials on their website. <br/><br/>In the first analysis of volcanic lightning using the GLM, lightning jumps were identified during the 2018 explosive eruption of Volcan Fuego in Guatemala. Since the 2018 eruption of Fuego, several other volcanoes have erupted and produced lightning within the GOES field of view. To fully diagnose the impact of volcanic emissions on aerosol-cloud microphysical processes and consequently, lightning production, observations, laboratory measurements, and model results will be synthesized, using the following inter-related steps. 1) Identify explosive eruptions that produce lightning within the GOES field of view. 2) Acquire and analyze satellite retrievals of ash plume characteristics (i.e., ash/hydrometeor concentration, grain size) coincident with lightning occurrence. 3) Analyze lightning occurrence from both GLM and ground-based sensors to obtain the most complete picture of lightning activity over the timescale of eruption and specific characteristics (i.e., size, energy, current) of discharge events. 4) Determine if a quantifiable relationship exists between data collected during the second and third steps. 5) Measure ash sample properties in the laboratory to confirm/refute satellite retrievals and calculate variables for input into models. 6) Conduct, revise, and test various model simulations to constrain the explosive eruption source parameters that produce the observed data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Leveraging the ongoing investments for earth observation using satellites that provide free data, technology advancements like cloud computing and development of sophisticated algorithms, it is possible to automate the determination of water quality for every body of water in the world. Today, the methods and technology for monitoring lakes and field measurements are sparse with only on a small subset of lakes being monitored on a regular basis. Regulatory and policy entities could monitor water quality for every lake and reservoir on a regular basis with the capability of near real-time measurements to set policy and to better direct limited resources where they are needed most. The outcomes will be better management of a critical environmental resource for their constituents.  Commercial entities such as vacation property businesses and real-estate brokerages will be able to better deliver value by reporting to consumers about the quality of lakes when renting, buying or selling properties. Lake water management companies would be able to continuously monitor the water quality to target treatment if needed. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on a software technology that processes remotely sensed satellite data into water quality products from all available Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 imagery. Recent advances in satellite technology (improved spectral, spatial, radiometric and temporal resolution) and atmospheric correction, along with cloud and supercomputing capabilities have enabled the use of satellite data for automated regional scale measurements of water resource characteristics. Field-validated methods were developed and implemented in an automated water quality monitoring system on supercomputers. The system acquires satellite imagery, removes clouds, cloud shadows, haze, smoke, and land, and applies water quality models to deliver satellite-derived water quality products. Using these methods, a prototype database was created with monthly open water pixel level mosaics and lake level data for each clear image occurrence.  The lake level (2017-2020) data includes 603,678 daily lake measurements of chlorophyll, clarity, and color (1,811,034 total) that were compiled into a database that was used to calculate water quality variables for different timeframes (e.g., monthly, summer (June-Sept)) and linked to a lake polygon layer that was used for geospatial analysis and included in a web map interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across the past decade, 40%-50% of college students in the United States each year started their postsecondary education at a two-year college. Students enrolled at two-year colleges are more likely to be low-income and from historically underrepresented groups, compared to students who start postsecondary education enrolled in four-year colleges. Led by a collaborative team of universities and community colleges representing 9 current NSF S-STEM projects, the PROSPECT S-STEM research hub will explore how equitable partnerships between two-year colleges and four-year institutions can empower low-income STEM transfer students. Researchers at Clemson University, East Carolina University, Southeast Community College, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Augsburg University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of Texas at Arlington, and YNOTI Solutions along with 14 two-year college partners are united by their goal to support domestic, low-income undergraduates as they navigate the transfer process. Numerous challenges exist that can make it difficult for students to successfully transfer from two- and four-year colleges, which in turn can reduce the likelihood that these students earn a bachelor?s degree. This project will address this issue by collecting and analyzing national-level data to highlight transfer issues. The hub?s research will support the development of strategies and resources to build institutional partnerships designed to increase positive outcomes for low-income transfer students. <br/><br/>The PROSPECT S-STEM Hub will operate as a research and dissemination hub to investigate the nature of two- and four-year colleges? partnerships and how developing co-equitable partnerships can better support low-income STEM scholars before and after the transition process. There is a need to understand how two- and four-year colleges can effectively establish and maintain partnerships. Equitable partnerships that support transfer students necessarily involve a range of stakeholders across institutions. PROSPECT S-STEM will examine the nature of these partnerships through: a) longitudinal case studies of two- and four-year college partnerships trying to improve STEM transfer student success; and b) the establishments of professional learning communities with key stakeholders, including advisors, faculty, financial aid, student affairs professionals, and other administrators involved with transfer policies and programs. Our investigation of these partnerships is framed through the lens of community cultural wealth, partnership capital, and dimension of equity. The mixed methods research will include interviews, participant concept mapping, document analysis, and survey data from S-STEM Scholars. PROSPECT S-STEM will target dissemination to researchers, advisors, student affairs professionals, administrators and other stakeholders who support STEM transfer students, thus facilitating the scale up of this project?s practices and findings to others seeking to support low-income STEM transfer students. This hub is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to recruit and prepare 18 new STEM teachers over five years who will commit to teaching in high-need school districts. A partnership between Sacred Heart University and Housatonic Community College will help community college students enter the elementary education field. It is anticipated that this will increase the diversity of prospective teachers, as many community college students are from ethnically or racially diverse backgrounds, are often first-generation college students, or are from financially under-resourced families. To be effective in high-need classrooms, prospective teachers need to be culturally responsive while teaching students how to be a scientist. The proposed project will provide mentoring and professional development in culturally responsive STEM teaching, and it is expected the teachers will develop a strong STEM identity and understand the connections between different STEM fields. <br/><br/>This project at Sacred Heart University includes partnerships with Housatonic Community College and Ansonia, Bridgeport, and Stratford Public Schools. This project supports students who receive a Bachelor of Science degree focused on the biological and physical sciences and a Master of Arts in Teaching in elementary education. The project is based on the need for culturally responsive and trauma-informed pedagogy to effectively teach children in high-need classrooms. The development of a STEM identity in prospective elementary teachers will help them foster the same sense of identity in their future students. The project will research how project activities support prospective teacher understanding of how culture influences STEM learning and teaching. It will also investigate Scholar understanding of the interconnectedness of different STEM disciplines and their development of a STEM identity. Project evaluation will generate further evidence to demonstrate the ability of project activities to promote teaching efficacy. Joint programming with Sacred Heart University and Housatonic Community College will create a pathway from community college to elementary STEM education.

The project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science and advancing public health. The MPI is a promising and novel imaging modality because it can generate positive contrast signals directly from MNPs without using harmful ionizing radiation. The MPI has unlimited tissue penetration depth, low background signals, and high sensitivity. Nevertheless, the MPI is currently not available for clinical applications. One major obstacle is a lack of MPI-specific MNPs as tracers. High-performance MNPs are critical to materialize the potential of MPI in clinical translation. This project is inspired by Professor Yongfeng Zhao?s pilot study demonstrating that water-soluble MNPs can be synthesized in a continuous growth manner. The resulting MNPs show high MPI performance. However, the mechanism of the continuous growth is still unknown, and the correlation between water-soluble MNPs and MPI performance is not established. Addressing these questions will accelerate the design, synthesis, and manufacturing of high-performance MNPs for MPI. The knowledge obtained from this project will stimulate the controlled synthesis of water-soluble MNPs and clear the roadblock for the application of MPI in healthcare. This project will integrate the proposed research activities with education plans to train underrepresented students for advanced degrees. The outreach plan is to disseminate the research findings to the general public during the annual Science Maker event in the Mississippi Museum of National Science. <br/><br/>Technical summary:<br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to obtain a holistic molecule-level understanding of the continuous growth mechanism of water-soluble magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in polyols, aimed to enhance magnetic particles imaging (MPI) performance of MNPs. The research project is meaningful because MPI is an emerging tracer imaging modality that can overcome many limitations of existing imaging techniques. The properties of MNPs dictate their sensitivity and resolution, which are essential for the further application of MPI. To achieve this overarching goal, this project is designed to 1) explore the continuous growth mechanism for controlled synthesis of water-soluble MNPs; 2) unravel a living growth profile of MNPs in polyols; 3) manipulate the reaction parameters for the synthesis of water-soluble MNPs; 4) expand the mechanism to synthesize water-soluble MNPs with dopants; and 5) study the MPI properties of MNPs synthesized in polyols. This project will accelerate the selection, synthesis, and manufacturing of high-performance MNPs for MPI. The education plan is to integrate this research project with an education initiative that is designed to systematically train minority undergraduate students in the STEM area at Jackson State University (JSU) to obtain advanced degrees. The project will be integrated with a course offered at JSU through the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). JSU students will interact with research scientists from BNL and learn state-of-the-art technologies on materials characterization. This research will be presented as part of the ?You Be The Chemist? competition and help foster and enhance the passion for STEM among middle school students.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biomaterials program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is especially the case at the nation?s community colleges, where an estimated 1 in 2 graduates with degrees in a STEM field get their start. Many community college students face significant economic challenges, including growing evidence that many have inadequate and inequitable access to food, housing, and other essentials. Hub research focus on exploring how low-income students interact with various support mechanisms. These data will be used to develop and study interventions intended to connect low-income students with key supports, such as food or housing support.<br/><br/>The hub will collaborate with 10 community colleges in five states to examine the challenges community college STEM students face in covering non-tuition expenses. Research will focus on STEM community college students' specific challenges when it comes to addressing non-tuition expenses.  The project will examine practices and programs available to STEM community college students and explore how they are being used. It will also investigate how low-cost interventions can help connect STEM community college students to supports for addressing their non-tuition expenses. Each participating institution will administer the validated #RealCollege survey to all students and link the outcomes to student records. The instrument includes questions about the non-tuition expenses students? face and how they seek to cover them. Other data sources include an analysis of state-level programs and focus groups with administrators, staff, and faculty. These data will be used to design and deploy approaches intended to connect low-income STEM students with resources, and to assess whether these supports help students reach greater levels of success. Specifically, the hub will conduct a randomized control study to examine the impacts of low-cost, light-touch ?nudges? on students? usage of non-tuition support programs. Project outcomes will make it easier for millions of low-income adults seeking STEM credentials to obtain those degrees and certificates, improving effectiveness and outcomes for the nation?s community colleges.

However, immunotherapies ? one of the most promising types of medicines in the 21st century ? are typically given all at once as single therapies, without regards to the spatial and dynamic considerations of delivery. Additionally, materials capable of controlling the timing or sequence of delivery of immunotherapies are lacking. The current project seeks to overcome these shortcomings and radically improve our ability to program immune responses. To do so, new biomaterials that can deliver a diverse range of immunotherapeutic agents in precise sequences will be generated. If successful, the project will produce innovative new polymeric technologies with applications ranging from vaccine development to immuno-oncology, having the potential to significantly improve healthcare in the US. Outreach and educational programs that build from these research efforts will include: incorporation of the research findings into undergraduate teaching, recruitment and exposure of students, including from underrepresented groups, to research through a Nanoengineering Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), and establishment of a STEM Excursion Program where North Mississippi high school students visit the University of Mississippi to learn about the growing field of Nanobiotechnology, while undergraduate researchers serve as mentors/role models to solidify their identity in STEM. <br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>Existing immunotherapies involve either a single agent or multiple agents given in combination. However, due to both the complex nature of the immune response and the diverse physicochemical nature of immunotherapeutic agents, it is incredibly challenging to design combination immunotherapies with the spatiotemporal control of delivery needed to program holistic immune responses. Moreover, materials capable of sequentially delivering immunotherapeutic agents from diverse chemical classes with control over the timing and order of release are lacking. Thus, the central research goal of this project is to develop a new class of multimodal biomaterials capable of 1) delivering diverse immunotherapeutic agents from a single material and 2) programming sequential drug release to recruit, train, and sustain the immune system during response. The first objective of this proposal is to generate a new class of glycopolymer-corona nanoparticles (NPs) that can train the immune response by co-delivering antigen and adjuvant to the same antigen-presenting cell (APC) with precise targeting of each component to the appropriate subcellular location of interest. Importantly, glycopolymer coronas will circumvent the use of poly(ethylene glycol), which is responsible for negative reactions in some patients, target the NPs to precise subsets of APCs, and inherently enable cryoprotection and lyophilization of the NPs. The second design objective of this proposal is to generate multilayered films which surface erode and release cargo sequentially at pre-programmed rates. The films will be composed of poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) (PVDMA), which undergoes ring-opening reactions in the presence of nucleophiles such as primary amines to produce hydrolytically-stable amide bonds or alcohols to yield hydrolyzable ester linkages. Thus, by post-polymerization modification, we will produce crosslinked polymer networks with control over the crosslinking density, swelling and erosion rates, and scaffold hydrophobicity. The resulting multilayered films will be engineered with three distinct phases of release: 1) recruitment phase to attract APCs, 2) training phase to deliver antigen and adjuvant to APCs, and 3) sustainment phase to boost immunogenicity and maintain a robust immune response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project plans to create a new technology to enable environmentally-friendly coatings capable of adhering to a myriad of substrates under any conditions, while offering high abrasion resistance and exceptional weather resistance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace applications.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to validate pilot-scale production feasibility, enhance the weatherability, and enable the commercialization of fluorine-free, self-cleaning materials. Previous approaches toward self-cleaning coatings have had several limitations such as reliance on harmful fluorochemicals, high cost, poor scalability, poor optical properties, and low weatherability. The proposed technology is developed via a unique approach that enables higher performance, fluorine-free coatings (e.g., excellent mechanical properties, optical clarity, hydrophobicity, adhesion) while preserving the ease of manufacturing processes at a lower cost. The key objectives of this proposed project include: 1) pilot-scale production of the coating to set the stage for commercialization; 2) extend the weatherability for high-end applications such as those in the automotive and aerospace sectors; and 3) develop protocols for omniphobic additives for rapid implementation of the technology into  relevant applications. The anticipated results include successful pilot-scale production tests, accomplishing the long-term weatherability, and the successful synthesis of omniphobic additives with desirable compositions and performance. The successful completion of the project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar panels, and aerospace, to name a few.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

OME is one of the leading causes of medical consultations and the most frequent reason for antibiotic prescription and surgery in children resulting in over $5 billion annual expenditures in the United States. In the US, each year nearly 700,000 children have tympanostomy tubes inserted because of chronic middle ear fluid and frequent ear infections. Treatment-resistant children with ETD/OME are affected by conductive hearing loss, language development issues, poor school performance, and are much more likely to have chronic middle ear problems in adulthood. The problem is equally concerning for many adults who continue to suffer from ETD despite available surgical treatments. ETD/OME is one of the main reasons for office visits in the USA and is estimated to affect 11 million US adults. Patients with chronic ETD (which occurs in ~11% of all ETD cases in the US) get frustrated and anxious about recurring visits for ETD/OME issues, while clinicians cannot provide effective care for these patients and insurance companies incur losses by reimbursing surgical procedures with limited efficacy.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology for the treatment of the underlying causes of chronic eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and persistent effusions. Recognizing existing treatment limitations, the proposed technology is a non-invasive device for targeted delivery of medications into the eustachian tube (ET) pharyngeal opening. The proposed approach has the potential to enhance outcomes for chronic ETD/otitis media with effusion (OME) patients from combining therapeutic action of formulations delivered into the ET (e.g., in reducing mucosal inflammation, hypersecretion, adhesion), and airflow and air pressure-assisted opening and insufflation of the ET. The hypothesis is that the approach may enhance particle deposition in the posterior region of the nasal cavity and enable formulation delivery to the ET orifice and lumen. Local delivery into the ET potentially may be an efficient approach for treating underlying causes (e.g., mucosal inflammation) that contribute to chronic ETD and persistent effusions while minimizing systemic side effects. The proposed technology has the potential to become a new treatment for chronic ETD/OME.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposed battery management system has the potential to enable the prognostics, health management, and life-prolonging control of Li-S batteries, thereby accelerating the safe commercial deployment of this chemistry. From a commercial perspective, Li-S batteries are appealing because they can store a significant amount of energy per unit weight, which is important for cost-effective electrification in the aerospace, drone, robotics, transportation, and grid industries. The abundance of sulfur in the earth?s crust is also attractive from a sustainability, cost, supply chain perspective, and societal perspective. A battery management system optimized for emerging chemistries, such as the proposed Li-S chemistry, also has the potential to maximize overall system performance, safety, and longevity, leading to both societal benefits from safer energy storage and potential commercial benefits, including improved insurability. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a reconfigurable model-based battery management system for the prognostics, health management, and health-conscious control of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Li-S batteries have a theoretical energy density of around 2600 Wh/kg, substantially higher than typical Li-ion batteries. Instead of requiring expensive, rare raw materials such as cobalt, Li-S batteries use sulfur, the most abundant material in the earth?s crust, as their main cathode material. Therefore, from the perspectives of energy density, environmental friendliness, and economics, Li-S technology may offer advantages over lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The project builds on earlier research exploring the development of computer simulation models of Li-S batteries, the fitting and validation of these models versus laboratory test data, and the development of algorithms for estimating the current state of charge in Li-S batteries. Together, these innovations open the door to the potential development of a cohesive battery management system that provides monitoring and control functionalities, including the ability to balance the states of charge of different Li-S cells to prevent over-charge and over-discharge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is motivated by recent insights on emissions of volatile organic compounds and ozone precursors during the lifetime of asphalt-surfaced areas (e.g., roads, roofs bridge decks, etc.). This project will engineer functionalized carbon from biowaste to remove ozone precursors emitted from pavements. The functionalized carbon will be made via thermochemical conversion of a combined feedstock of food waste and algal biomass. Computational simulations, machine learning, optimization, and laboratory experiments will be combined to determine the underlying mechanisms controlling adsorption of known gases into functionalized carbon. This functionalized carbon will be introduced to bituminous composites to increase the retention of compounds that would otherwise be released to the surrounding atmosphere. The study presents a new vision where outdoor construction elements can positively contribute to environmental health. The proposed intervention is designed to simultaneously enhance the durability of outdoor construction elements and the quality of surrounding air by retaining compounds that otherwise leave bitumen and enter the air, with some serving as ozone precursors, negatively impacting air quality and human health outcomes. The project involving minority graduate students in education, outreach activities, and cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>This proposal seeks to promote the use of two waste streams (algal biofuels and food waste) to address ozone concerns while contributing to carbon sequestration and extending the service life of outdoor construction undergoing intense ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. This project will integrate computational modeling and data analytics for the design and synthesis of functionalized carbon with desirable retention characteristics for select bitumen compounds. It has been documented that aging is accompanied by the loss of alkane and aromatic compounds in bitumen, so retention of the latter compounds via functionalized carbon is expected to not only improve air quality but also delay the aging of bituminous composites, especially those used in outdoor construction that are subjected to various degrees of UV exposure, depending on their location. This proposal may result in significant resource conservation while promoting economic growth within a bio-mass value chain where waste from algal biofuel and food is converted into value-added products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although there is widespread literature in aerodynamic and physiological fluid flow research, many of the basic properties of unsteady flows are poorly understood.  A major limitation in the experimental validation of various unsteady flow models is insufficient flow measurement instrumentation, specifically a method of direct non-invasive measurement of wall shear stress.  The sensitivity and accuracy needed to evaluate the wall shear stresses in complex unsteady flows is not attainable with the existing state-of-the-art measurement technologies.  This research effort aims to investigate a multi-layered 3-D printed piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) copolymer sensor as a wall shear stress measuring device candidate. The proposed technology has an advantage in that it contains no moving parts, can potentially perform a direct measurement of wall shear stress, can be mounted directly to the flow surface with no modification, and can be manufactured easily as compared to existing methods. Preliminary results demonstrate that PVDF-TrFE exhibits exceptional sensitivity to deflection with high accuracy and sensitivity.<br/><br/>This research effort will focus on implementing this novel sensor technology to perform direct wall shear stress measurements in unsteady flow applications. This research effort will address issues related to sensitivity, installation of the sensor, validation of sensor measurements with particle imaging velocimetry wall shear stress measurements and with exact analytical solutions for Poiseuille, Womersley and Stokes flows, and issues of error introduced by the sensor thickness.  If the proposed effort is successful, the proposed methodology will provide ease of fabrication and implementation for a range of sizes of flush mountable sensors that eliminate moving parts increasing robustness, provides a reduction of cost in flow instrumentation tools, and provides a non-intrusive wall shear stress measurement. PVDF-TrFE sensors have never been tested or used for wall shear sensing, thus the electromechanical coupling mechanism that provides shear transduction is not fully understood. This pioneering research effort will determine the fundamental sensing properties of PVDF-TrFE under wall shear, improve sensor fabrication and packaging, and will develop a methodology for high frequency dynamic calibration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research could make a major contribution to improving the understanding of the role of BrC in earth's climate system.<br/><br/>The tasks to be conducted as part of this research are as follows: (1) Simulating wildland fires at the U.S. Forest Service facility; (2) Retrieval of BrC light-absorption properties (optical distributions); (3) Parameterization development; and (4) Chemical transport and radiative-transfer modeling. Biomass combustion experiments will be conducted that simulate wildfires and prescribed fires, and the effects of critical variables such as fuel type, firing techniques, and moisture content on emission profiles will be investigated. Three intensive measurement campaigns will be conducted at the newly built U.S. Forest Service Center for Forest Disturbance Science combustion facility. The BC and BrC emission factors, and their optical distributions, will be derived from these experiments and parameterized as a function of fire radiative power (FRP), a proxy of combustion conditions. The novelty of the framework lies in the utilization of correlations between BrC physicochemical and optical properties to retrieve optical distributions. The parameterizations developed through these studies will combine findings from the measurement campaigns with remote-sensing observations. The parameterizations then will be implemented in WRF-Chem, a coupled chemical-transport and climate model.<br/><br/>Both graduate and undergraduate students will receive training through this effort.

This project will research the interaction of nanoparticles with specific cellular proteins that are important for life processes and to develop effective therapies for diseases such as cancer.  The PIs will focus on microtubules, which are hollow protein cylinders that impart structural rigidity to cells, enable motility, and serve as conduits for intracellular transport. The ability of these materials to polymerize and depolymerize affects cellular processes and has been the subject of extensive research interest over decades. Understanding how to control the disruption of these protein structures can reduce cellular structural rigidity and serve as a target for cancer therapy. Nanoparticle-mediated inhibition of tubulin polymerization has been reported briefly; however, a general mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Such knowledge can further scientific understanding and pave the way to designing novel therapies. In this project the PIs will study the influence of nanoparticles on the polymerization of microtubules (and other filaments) both from a biochemical and structural perspective. To identify and quantitatively evaluate the chemical association of the nanoparticles with tubulin during polymerization, the PIs will utilize infrared spectroscopy, machine learning tools and other biochemical techniques. In terms of analytic ability, the integrated toolkit of measurement devices, imaging, and data analysis will be a valuable resource to investigate molecular-environmental interactions that may be expanded to other biological systems. This knowledge could have widespread implications for the comprehension of nanoparticle-based novel cancer therapeutics. For educational and outreach activities, the collaborating PIs will develop an exploratory program course intended for freshman (science and non-science majors) to enhance their education through greater interaction with faculty in small classes and to learn about research in nanotechnology. The team will specifically contribute to the education of early career and underrepresented students via university-wide programs. The algorithms and data generated during this project will be used as a basis for educational activities from the high school to professional levels. <br/><br/><br/>At the core of this project's technical approach is the recognition that a complete understanding of the influence of nanoparticles on microtubules polymerization is possible by applying molecular spectroscopy and imaging. Through this project the PIs will develop best methods to use for tubulin polymerization studies with nanomaterials having various chemical and surface properties. The PIs will harness the advantages of infrared spectroscopy by using recent advances in imaging technology to develop a spatially and temporally resolved approach that illuminates molecular details of microtubules dynamics and quantitatively evaluates the role of nanoparticles in tubulin polymerization. The project includes emerging infrared measurement technology coupled to an infrared transparent, cost-effective microfluidic platform that accurately controls biochemical environments spatiotemporally. Using this platform, the PIs will investigate the biochemistry, kinetics, and structural manifest of microtubules upon association with nanoparticles of varying composition, concentration, size, and surface functionalities. The extent of polymerization will be analyzed using a fluorescence assay. Gel electrophoresis studies will be used to assess the extent of polymerization and the phosphate release pathway will be analyzed to obtain possible mechanistic insight. Microfluidics-assisted infrared imaging of the nanoparticles will be employed to study the modulated microtubules formation to reveal manifestation of a completely different array of secondary structures that may arise from the propensity of select monomer units to adhere together during polymerization. Infrared images of the nanoparticles incubated with polymerized and dried microtubules will reveal nanoparticle spectral signatures of microtubules with aggregated proteins. The main technical contribution is a high-throughput IR imaging method to study protein polymerization in the absence and presence of nanoparticles in the microfluidic continuous flow mixing device and validate the results to facilitate understanding of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. The obtained data will further be investigated with statistical and machine learning approaches. The PIs will work to ensure that the protocols developed here are available to students of all levels, giving them an opportunity to understand the fundamentals of tubulin dynamics with nanotechnology and stimulating their creativity to develop new cancer therapeutics. In addition, the students will participate in dedicated projects, learning about future career opportunities in these fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this paradigm, distributed networked systems will assist the end users of electricity in scheduling and apportioning their consumption. Further, they will enable local and national utility managers to optimize the use of green energy sources while mitigating the effects of intermittence, promote fairness, equity, and affordability. This project pursues a tractable approach to address the challenges of modeling and designing these large-scale, mixed-autonomy, multi-agent CPSs. The intellectual merits include new scalable methods, algorithms, and tools for the design of distributed decision-making strategies and system architectures that can assist the end users in meeting their goals while guaranteeing compliance with the fairness, reliability, and physical constraints of the design. The broader impacts include enabling the automated design of distributed CPSs that coordinate their decision-making in many applications, from robotic swarms to smart manufacturing and smart cities.

Thus, knowledge of the rates and processes that control nitrogen cycling are needed to understand marine ecosystem dynamics. Nitrogen exists in many chemical forms, and the processes that convert one form to another are mostly carried out by bacteria. However, new data suggest that nitrate stored inside the cells of more complex organisms accounts for a major pool of nitrate in marine sediments. This intracellular nitrate has not been adequately measured and integrated into an overall framework of nitrogen cycling. The investigators will address this issue in the proposed research to better understand and revise nitrogen inventories and flows in the oceans. This information can be used to increase understanding of controls on global carbon cycling and climate change feedbacks. One graduate student will be trained in using tools and techniques to solve complex marine systems issues, and three undergraduate researchers will participate in the work. The team will expand the impact of this research by 1) collaborating with the U. Maine Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning and the Institute for Broadening Participation to produce and distribute educational videos about this research and its implications for the environment; and 2) leading summer workshops to mentor high school teachers to develop ocean sciences curricula in partnership with the Gulf of Maine Institute. <br/><br/><br/>Key processes that influence nitrogen cycling in marine sediments are denitrification and anammox, which lead to a net loss of biologically available nitrogen, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which diverts nitrate away from denitrification back into the system. It has traditionally been assumed that these processes are controlled by bacteria lacking intracellular nitrate and driven by porewater nitrate pools. However, more recent data indicates that large intracellular nitrate pools are widespread in marine sediments and that eukaryotic microbes, particularly benthic foraminifera and diatoms, may be responsible for these pools. The team hypothesizes that the size and flux rate of this intracellular nitrate pool needs to be sufficiently accounted for to accurately measure and understand the nitrogen cycle in marine sediments. Intracellular nitrate presents significant methodological and conceptual challenges to current understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle. The investigators propose two objectives: 1) To measure rates of intracellular nitrate cycling and other major nitrogen cycling pathways in marine sediments across a depth gradient from photic subtidal to dark continental shelf sediments in the Gulf of Maine; 2) To further examine controls on intracellular nitrate cycling by conducting physiological experiments on different microbial eukaryotic cells isolated from the proposed study sites to measure their intracellular nitrate pool sizes and cycling rates. They propose a new strategy using nitrogen-15 labeled nitrate spike experiments to measure the role that intracellular nitrate plays in overall rates of nitrogen cycling in marine sediments. Through the proposed work, they aim to develop a model system to understand and integrate intracellular nitrate cycling into the nitrogen cycle in marine sediments more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All these viruses cause dangerous respiratory disorders with high mortality and grave impacts on society. This virus destroys the cells that produce lung surfactants which, among other things, keep the alveoli air-sacks from collapsing, and eventually the lungs fill with liquid. The two primary functions of lung surfactants are regulating the interfacial tension and surface viscosities of the liquid lining of the alveoli, and providing a first line of immune defense against airborne pathogens.  The fluid dynamic interactions between the liquid lining of the lung, the lung surfactants, and the respiratory virus are presently not well understood. This project addresses this gap by conducting experiments and numerical modeling to capture the essential fluid dynamics of a model virus interacting with the primary insoluble component of lung surfactant. The expansion and contraction of the alveoli will be modeled using an open cavity with oscillatory sidewalls that expand and compress the liquid layer. The numerical models will then be used to simulate physiologically relevant scales, not accessible experimentally.  Aside from the flow in the lung liquid lining, the present knowledge gap in predictive modeling of interfacial dilation and compression is hampering developments in other areas, such as in water waves, which are of utmost importance in modeling of carbon dioxide gas exchange between the atmosphere and the oceans.<br/><br/>Predictive models for the transport of small particles in a surfactant-covered liquid layer will be developed. A key advancement in the proposed modeling of surface elasticity is to measure the equation-of-state of the monolayer in a state corresponding to that found when it has been subjected to a large number of dilation/compression cycles. The usual approach of determining properties of a recently spread monolayer undergoing slow compression is inappropriate for modeling monolayer hydrodynamics coupled to an oscillatory bulk flow, as the monolayer is in a different state with very different interfacial properties. The role of interfacial dilatational viscosity and its significance relative to surface elasticity remains poorly understood and presents a major impediment to the predictive modeling of free-surface flows.

The overall goal of the project will be to create the most powerful NMR network in the world with comprehensive resources and expertise, spanning key areas of NSF interest, that will be accessible to the entire scientific community within the United States. Gains in sensitivity, resolution, and information content are highly nonlinear with magnetic field strength, and ultrahigh fields combined with state-of-the-art NMR probes and pulse sequences will enable fundamental investigations, with atomic resolution, of emergent phenomena not accessible with the current technologies.  State-of-the-art UHF NMR instruments will be sited at strategically located public institutions geographically distributed across the US. The NMR network will be made available to researchers across multiple disciplines for advancing the development and use of in vivo, in vitro, in situ, solution, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy to address diverse problems of high fundamental and technological importance. Instruments will be connected through a central cyberinfrastructure hub and integrated with other high-field and UHF NMR instrumentation.  The proposed nationwide UHF NMR network will enable experts and non-experts to access both UHF NMR instruments and a diversity of NMR expertise. The intellectual framework established through the proposed network will provide unique training for students in state- of-the-art NMR methods and applications. The outreach program encompassing training in NMR instrumentation and application of NMR methods will be invaluable for the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Planning the UHF NMR network will set the stage to address the urgent nationwide need for ultrahigh field NMR infrastructure. The planning activities supported by this award will identify the primary scientific, technical and system performance requirements and associated designs and specifications for the UHF NMR network. Through these activities, the researchers will formulate a plan to execute and manage the UHF NMR network, including a project schedule with identified risks and plans to mitigate them, a governance plan and effective project management methods for tracking progress, costs and performance.  Outcomes from this effort will include sound baseline cost estimates for implementation and anticipated operations and maintenance costs. The researchers will also develop plans for effective student training and the involvement of a diverse workforce in instrumentation, facility development, and data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CPS project aims to investigate methods and computational tools to design a new user-centric paradigm for energy apportionment and distribution and, more broadly, for trustworthy utility services. In this paradigm, distributed networked systems will assist the end users of electricity in scheduling and apportioning their consumption. Further, they will enable local and national utility managers to optimize the use of green energy sources while mitigating the effects of intermittence, promote fairness, equity, and affordability. This project pursues a tractable approach to address the challenges of modeling and designing these large-scale, mixed-autonomy, multi-agent CPSs. The intellectual merits include new scalable methods, algorithms, and tools for the design of distributed decision-making strategies and system architectures that can assist the end users in meeting their goals while guaranteeing compliance with the fairness, reliability, and physical constraints of the design. The broader impacts include enabling the automated design of distributed CPSs that coordinate their decision-making in many applications, from robotic swarms to smart manufacturing and smart cities. The research outcomes will also be used in K-12 and undergraduate STEM outreach efforts.<br/> <br/>The proposed framework, termed Automated Synthesis for Trustworthy Autonomous Utility Services (ASTrA), addresses the design challenges via a three-pronged approach. It uses population games to model the effect of distributed decision-making infrastructures (DMI) on large populations of strategic agents. DMIs will be realized via dedicated networked hybrid hardware architectures and algorithms we seek to design. ASTrA further introduces a systematic, layered methodology to automate the design, verification, and validation of DMIs from expressive representations of the requirements. Finally, it offers a set of cutting-edge computational tools to facilitate our methodology by enabling efficient reasoning about the interaction between discrete models, e.g., used to describe complex missions or embedded software components, and continuous models used to describe physical processes.

All these viruses cause dangerous respiratory disorders with high mortality and grave impacts on society. This virus destroys the cells that produce lung surfactants which, among other things, keep the alveoli air-sacks from collapsing, and eventually the lungs fill with liquid.  The fluid dynamic interactions between the liquid lining of the lung, the lung surfactants, and the respiratory virus are presently not well understood. This project addresses this gap by conducting experiments and numerical modeling to capture the essential fluid dynamics of a model virus interacting with lung surfactant. The numerical models will then be used to simulate physiologically relevant scales, not accessible experimentally.  In addition to understanding flow in the lung liquid lining, the present knowledge gap in predictive modeling of interfacial dilation and compression is hampering developments in other areas, such as in water waves, which are of utmost importance in modeling of carbon dioxide gas exchange between the atmosphere and the oceans.<br/><br/>The two primary functions of lung surfactants are regulating the interfacial tension and surface viscosities of the liquid lining of the alveoli, and providing a first line of immune defense against airborne pathogens. Predictive models for the transport of small particles in a surfactant-covered liquid layer will be developed. A key advancement in the proposed modeling of surface elasticity is to measure the equation-of-state of the monolayer in a state corresponding to that found when it has been subjected to a large number of dilation/compression cycles. The usual approach of determining properties of a recently spread monolayer undergoing slow compression is inappropriate for modeling monolayer hydrodynamics coupled to an oscillatory bulk flow, as the monolayer is in a different state with very different interfacial properties. The role of interfacial dilatational viscosity and its significance relative to surface elasticity remains poorly understood and presents a major impediment to the predictive modeling of free-surface flows.

The project will address the need to prepare elementary teachers to effectively teach in alignment with new climate change education standards adopted by the State of New Jersey. To address this need, the project will partner with teachers from local high-need elementary schools to gather information about their STEM knowledge related to climate change and their interests in future professional development workshops and graduate program opportunities in this area. Based on these interactions and gathered evidence, The College of New Jersey will modify its STEM education graduate courses and Environmental Sustainability Education certificate program to serve future elementary STEM teacher leaders. The project could contribute to developing elementary STEM teacher leaders in the region, preparing them to support implementation of the new climate change standards and to promote high-quality STEM education for students more generally.<br/><br/>This project at The College of New Jersey includes a partnership with the Hunterdon, Somerset, and Mercer County STEM Ecosystem (HSMC STEM Ecosystem), a partnership between schools, communities, businesses, and nonprofits dedicated to providing equitable access to STEM. The goal of the proposed project is to spend one year building capacity for a program to develop K-8 Master level teachers? expertise in implementing STEM curriculum, with a specific focus on climate change. The project will build relationships with elementary STEM stakeholders from partner schools through introductory workshops and meetings exploring the new state K-12 climate change education standards. Additionally, the project will collect input from these stakeholders through surveys, site visits, and workshops. Evidence gathered will guide the revision of an existing 4-course graduate certificate program in Environmental Sustainability Education to address the new state standards for climate change content and to align with emerging elementary STEM teacher needs. Two leaders of a current Noyce Capacity Building effort in another state, also focused on elementary STEM teacher professional development, will serve as critical friends and mentors, providing feedback to the project. Additionally, an advisory board, which includes a STEM faculty member, an education faculty member, and a local elementary STEM teacher leader, will evaluate evidence gathered and progress towards project outcomes. The outcomes of this Noyce Capacity Building effort could produce a model for developing highly qualified elementary STEM teacher leaders generally, as well as elementary teacher leaders in climate change education more specifically. The involvement of stakeholders from local high-need elementary schools suggests that the resulting professional development and certificate program designs would effectively serve teachers in these contexts. The grounding of all efforts in the recently adopted New Jersey K-12 State climate education standards is likely to produce insights that could be a model for other campuses and teacher education programs across the state and beyond. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

This award will improve predictions of how these ecosystems will respond to future climate change. Worldwide, ecosystems like these play an important role in the global carbon cycle and support 40% of the human population. Improving predictive understanding of dryland responses to climate change is a critical challenge that will have benefits to society and also relevance to policy decision-making. Results from this award directly address an important knowledge gap, and will provide insights that have significance for management and conservation of dryland ecosystems worldwide. The award will leverage experimental infrastructure, already constructed, that alters the amount and the intensity of rainfall events throughout the year at the Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in New Mexico. Research will be conducted in four distinctly different ecosystem types, including two grasslands and two shrublands. Digital cameras will be installed overlooking experimental plots in each ecosystem type and will record thousands of photographs year-round. These photographs will be made publicly available, immediately and without restriction, for research and education. Responses to the experimental treatments will be quantified through automated, quantitative analysis the color of each picture. Broader impacts from this award will include both formal and informal science education. Graduate and undergraduate students recruited from traditionally under-represented groups, will receive training through this project. Public participation in scientific research will be achieved through ongoing collaboration with the Sevilleta LTER site?s ?Schoolyard? program, and will bring the science of this project to K-12 teachers and their students.<br/><br/>How future climate change will impact dryland ecosystems depends on how these systems respond not only to increases in temperature and changes in mean precipitation, but also to increases in precipitation variance. Researchers will test the overarching hypothesis that changes in the mean and variance of water availability will have independent as well as interacting effects on vegetation phenology, which then will then drive productivity via changes in growing season length. Based on environmental response function theory, unique responses of four distinct dryland ecosystem types are expected. Data products derived from digital camera imagery will be used to quantify the start and end of the active (growing) season, total active season length, as well as to estimate rates of primary production and total annual primary productivity by scaling gross primary productivity quantified from existing CO2 flux measurements at Sevilleta LTER. Project data will be assimilated into an already-developed ecosystem model, which will be used for forecasting and model-based tests of hypotheses. Outcomes from this project will include peer-reviewed publications as well as imagery and datasets that will be relevant to dryland researchers worldwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since its inception in 2007, MPOWIR has made substantial contributions to decreasing the attrition of women+ physical oceanographers. However, MPOWIR?s work is far from being done. Shifting demographics, the impact of COVID-19 on the careers of women+, and longstanding structural inequities remain challenges to retention. This project would sustain and enhance MPOWIR for another 4 years. It seeks to improve retention through a series of interrelated objectives that include: (1) providing continuity of mentoring from a woman?s+ career transition from graduate school to postdoctoral years to the early years of her permanent job, (2) providing mentorship training to MPOWIR participants, (3) fostering a sense of community in physical oceanography, (4) broadening participation in MPOWIR by providing training and professional development opportunities to all those who self-identify as physical oceanographers, and (5) engaging a cross-section of stakeholders to develop a shared vision for the next decade of MPOWIR. To meet the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, MPOWIR aims to enhance its design by incorporating a few new initiatives to provide additional professional development opportunities and support to the community of mentors and peers that MPOWIR has helped build over the past 16 years, and lead to improvement in the overall culture of the physical oceanography community.<br/><br/>Specifically, this funding supports the following MPOWIR activities:<br/>1. Pattullo Conference held biannually, brings ~25 junior women+ physical oceanographers together with 12 senior physical oceanographers of all genders for a 2.5 day meeting focused on discipline-based mentoring.<br/>2. Mentoring groups of ~6 junior and 2 senior women+ physical oceanographers meet for a monthly teleconference, for the purpose of confidential, personalized mentoring.<br/>3. MPOWIR website serves as a repository of resources for mentoring and physical oceanography careers.<br/>4. MPOWIR webinars and virtual discussions held semi-annually, focus on topics of particular interest to those in the early stages of a physical oceanographer?s first position, provide continued support for previous participants, expand gender neutral participation, and connect to the broader scientific community.<br/>5. Townhalls held at large conferences, such as the Ocean Sciences Meeting, provide a forum for dissemination of information and communication with the whole oceanographic community.<br/>6. Databases and surveys are conducted to assess the effectiveness of MPOWIR activities, determine community mentoring needs, and evaluate progress in retention.<br/>7.

This project will enable local communities, urban and rural alike, to create economic value (raw materials and jobs) out of textile waste, with a drastic reduction in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions compared to business as usual. This project will develop technology that has an impact on the security and sustainability of the US textile raw materials marketplace, by enabling a re-shoring of an industry in a distributed way that can affect every single American through their clothing purchasing options. If successful, the US could lead the world into a new era of a truly sustainable circular economy for fashion.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance knowledge and develop the core technologies required for widespread adoption and commercialization of cellulosic textile recycling within the American textile manufacturing industry. By leveraging core competencies and innovative models for polymer science and continuous process design, this project will develop a non-destructive extractive process that will locally and domestically convert end-of-life textile waste into high-value cellulosic circular economy feedstocks of equal or greater quality to virgin material at kilogram scale. As part of this project, the focus will be on extracting cellulose from mixed material textile waste that contain other contaminant components that often hinder its recycling. This approach involves innovative mixtures of green chemistry that enable the rapid extraction of cotton, the spinning of novel fibres, and the efficient recovery of the process chemicals.

This proposal aims to characterize past interglacial Pleistocene climate variability in mid-continental, subarctic Canada using a rare collection of slow-growing subarctic speleothems. The researcher will combine a set of analytical tools to these speleothems including, novel geochronological techniques (U-Pb), micro-analytical technique (secondary ion mass spectrometry, SIMS), and imaging (confocal fluorescent laser microscopy, CFLM) to reconstruct high-latitude North American paleoclimate. These new records will investigate whether high-latitude climates were more or less variable during past interglacial periods that were even warmer than today, such as the warmest interglacial period of the last 800 ka.  The potential results of this project will include resolving broad records of temperature changes across different interglacial stages of the last 1.5 Million years, as well as providing snapshots of high-frequency (sub-annual to sub-decadal) hydroclimate variability.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts are twofold: (1) professional development of the postdoctoral fellow, and (2) community engagement. The postdoctoral researcher will gain first-hand experience in novel geochronology methods to date speleothems records in one of the only labs in the United States that is set up for U-Pb dating of speleothems. Additionally, the postdoctoral fellow will gain mentoring experience through direct work and interaction with undergraduate and graduate students. The research finding of this project will be shared with local communities in Northwest Territories (Canada) by setting up a two-way collaborative network that will, 1) Expose and engage students and staff at Aurora College (the only post-secondary institution within the Northwest Territories) about active climate research projects at Northwest Territory caves, and 2) Teach the postdoctoral fellow and project colleagues about the impact Arctic warming has on local indigenous communities. As part of these outreach efforts, educational and interactive display materials will be distributed to local municipalities, specifically Aurora College. One of the goals of this outreach plan will be to share what is learned from the people living in the communities of the Northwest Territories to climate scientists at Geoscience meetings (e.g. AGU) to better science communication initiatives and relay the broader societal impact of climate science research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much previous literature has made associations between play with building toys and spatial cognition, other social-emotional cues experienced in the play environment that influence early engineering identity formation and self-concept have remained largely unexplored. This CAREER research project was developed to explore the recent and rapid growth of building toys designed ?for girls? that have relied on the premise that girls would be more interested in playing with these toys, and that they would bring similar benefits in cognitive and psychomotor development. By examining embodied play from both a phenomenographic lens to understand the variations in how children experience play with building toys, and an ethnographic lens to identify discernible play interactions that can be cataloged and counted, this project is positioned to make empirical connections between narrative contexts, factors of interest and access, and desired developmental outcomes that vary across different identities and groups. This project will integrate research and educational outcomes through community partnerships with local organizations focused on informal learning environments, where learning through play is most feasible and accessible. Specific outcomes will include professional development opportunities for educators, school administrators, and program directors to help facilitate programs that support the development of spatial cognition and early engineering identity formation that is accessible to all students. The research team will utilize a multi-phased mixed-method research design to create and evaluate empirically-based recommendations and curricular materials designed for informal learning spaces. We will disseminate findings and resources broadly to scholarly communities, as well as to parents, practitioners, and toy companies. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will utilize a two-phase mixed-method research design to study embodied play interactions and play experiences with building toys of 3rd-5th graders (girls and boys). The research methodology will use a concurrent design in Phase 1 with phenomenographic content analysis to understand how participants experience play differently and ethnographic video analysis to identify and catalog discernible verbal (indirect) and nonverbal (direct) embodied play interactions with building toys. In Phase 2, a sequential design will be used to quantify codified data and perform statistical correlations and comparison tests that define relationships to spatial ability, engineering identity, and demographic factors. The research activities will be organized and executed to interrogate three central hypotheses: i) girls will show higher levels of interest in playing with building toys when there are embedded narrative contexts that appeal to them, ii) girls who express interest in building toys also have regular access to them, and iii) girls and boys with similar levels of interest in and access to building toys will achieve similar benefits through their play experiences and interactions with them. Related educational activities will include the introduction of an afterschool program targeting spatial skill development with our Community Partners, which will also serve as the research context for large-group informal learning observations during Phase 2. Workshops will be developed and facilitated for pre-service and in-service teachers that present findings from this research to inform classroom practices that actively support the development of spatial skills for elementary school children, including at least one Train-the-Trainer workshop for directors of informal learning spaces. This study will inform efforts to broaden girls? participation in engineering by (1) defining empirical relationships between embodied play interactions with building toys and the development of spatial skills, which are fundamental to many engineering disciplines; (2) describing the ways in which embodied play experiences with building toys shape, and are shaped by early engineering identity formation; and (3) defining how aspects of interest in and access to building toys are related to toy narrative, family environment, and demographic factors (i.e., age, sex, race, SES, urban/rural). The project is supported by a strong research team with two well-known community partners that are representatives of national organizations who can help facilitate the mindful and strategic dissemination of this work through vast notational networks of community organizations and NGOs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These two-dimensional materials, or ?nanosheets?, can be stacked together in various configurations to make macroscopic materials with internal layered structures.  Such macroscopic layered materials find use in emerging technologies that include textile barrier layers for personal protective equipment, coatings to stabilize or protect surfaces, drug delivery patches and implantable biomaterials.  This project seeks to enhance the functions of these layered materials by incorporating biologically active molecules to make hybrids.  A major focus is to measure and predict the rates at which those imbedded biomolecules are released, and become active and functional on the outer surfaces and nearby fluid phases.  This controlled release can be used to create long-lifetime antibacterial and antiviral coatings for surfaces, textile layers that release insect repellants, or biomaterials that provide timed delivery of drugs.  The research will identify methods for controlling the release rate and thus controlling the active lifetime of these devices by manipulating the methods of synthesis and processing.  The research team will also be engaged in activities that motivate and prepare underrepresented groups for studies and careers in engineering and science.  The principal investigators will collaborate with societies promoting engineering career choices and advancement for women, Hispanics, and Native Americans and will host a Rhode Island Science Day event featuring tours, demonstrations and hands-on activities for upper elementary and middle school tribal youth in the state to introduce and promote opportunities in science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will create, characterize and apply a new set of hetero-structured layered materials with active biomolecular species intercalated in the van der Waals gaps between stacked two-dimensional nanosheets.  These frontier hybrids combine the novel properties of atomically-thin nanosheets with the targeted, chemically specific functions of biomolecules. The project will pursue the hypothesis that molecular release kinetics are governed by internal transport processes involving molecular diffusion through nanochannels. Nanochannel transport phenomena are poorly understood, as are the implications for the timing, location, and direction of molecular release from films or macroscopic layered monoliths. The research plan has three Objectives: (1) to synthesize and characterize a panel of hybrid layered materials; (2) to measure biomolecular release kinetics and elucidate release mechanisms to identify design strategies for control; and (3) to demonstrate multifunctional 2D hybrid devices and characterize their dynamic expression of biochemical surface activity in case studies focused on antibacterial and antiviral function.   Scientific outputs from this project will include a suite of new hybrid materials with information on their structures and properties, the first quantitative models for release rate prediction and control, and values of nanochannel diffusion coefficients for a range of molecules obtained by model-based extraction from molecular release rate data.  The investigator team will also engage in educational outreach to motivate and prepare students from underrepresented groups for studies and careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-folding material structures are poised to revolutionize manufacturing, particularly by allowing the fabrication of very complex three-dimensional structures from sizes less than a millimeter to human scale. Because they are fabricated flat, self-folding structures can be made cheaply, rapidly, and in bulk. However, one of the primary obstacles to realizing this technology is the proliferation of misfolded structures. <br/><br/>The PI and his team will develop new theoretical and computation tools to design material structures that will fold robustly, thus removing this manufacturing obstacle.

Self-folding origami structures are poised to revolutionize manufacturing by providing an easy means of creating complex three-dimensional geometries from an initially flat substrate on any length scale. Recently, there has been a great deal of effort devoted to creating material systems that can be fabricated to fold or unfold upon application of an external stimulus. While many complex folding structures fold robustly into their target shape, many do not, even when the fold patterns are simple. One of the primary obstacles to realizing such structures is the bifurcated nature of the configuration space, which exhibits a multitude of branches that are exponential in the complexity of the structure. This is a key and unavoidable feature of the way such structures deform and leads to apparent glass-like behavior in folding. <br/><br/>The PI will develop a theory for the mechanics of self-folding structures and devise principles by which those structures can be made to fold robustly. The scientific aims of this project, specifically, are to develop a theory for the configuration space of self-folding structures that incorporates the bending elasticity of folds, allows for the introduction of Gaussian curvature at vertices, and properly accounts for the geometrical rigidity of the structures at second-order and beyond. <br/><br/>This project will have an impact on the design of structured materials by introducing new analytical techniques for the prediction of three-dimensional structures. It will lead to the further development and documentation of a software package in Mathematica that can be used to perform complex calculations on rigid mechanisms. It also funds a number of education activities, including the training of a graduate student in cutting edge theoretical techniques.

Acquiring capabilities to establish relationships between the mental and emotional states of the users and the VR and real-world environment stimuli could be developed and used to identify patterns that may answer important questions about human behavior and help people with limited mobility.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the use of brainwaves to control VR environments. This project will develop techniques for inferring users? decisions while navigating a VR environment and for deriving insights into users? reactions to stimuli in real-world and VR environments. For this Phase I proof-of-concept work, these innovative techniques will be evaluated in jury consulting and game therapy scenarios. The research addresses four technical hurdles:  1) inferring users? decisions in virtual environments from brainwaves with reasonable accuracy, 2) deriving insights into users? intellectual and emotional states as a result of exposure to stimuli, 3) designing an architecture for useable brainwaves-based applications, and 4) designing security and privacy solutions for this VR system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diesel particulate pollutants are directly related to respiratory and heart disease.  Curently this is addressed with diesel particulate filters (DPF), devices that trap particulates and do not destroy them. Furthermore DPFs are prone to clogging, resulting in wasted fuel and costly engine maintenance. This project advances a non-thermal plasma (NTP) solution to destroy diesel particulates by converting them into non-hazardous compounds. NTP technology also has potential to be applied more broadly to power plant smoke stacks and other sources of particulate emissions.  The proposed solution will develop a NTP device for retrofitting diesel fleets, such as buses, waste haulers and utility trucks, improving engine performance and reducing operating costs. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project researches novel materials and components for use in a non-thermal plasma (NTP) reactor capable of withstanding the harsh conditions within the main exhaust stream of a diesel engine (e.g., 650 C temperatures and high exhaust flow). First generation NTP reactors capable of operating in low-temperature exhaust (e.g., 150 C) have already been developed and sold for use in diesel exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems; however, only about 30% to 50% of total diesel exhaust flows through EGR. The objective of this research is to demonstrate feasibility of NTP technology for use in the main exhaust stream to treat 100% of particulate emissions. The research plan will accurately characterize the working environment of the main diesel exhaust system and identify potential designs and parts/materials, creating hybrid or completely new components. Promising candidate components will be assembled into a prototype reactor and evaluated on an accelerated schedule to measure performance representing 6 months of typical operation.

Wind farm owners and operators face continuous pressure to reduce the price per megawatt-hour of the grid energy that they produce.  Improving the energy yield of existing wind farms by optimizing array yaw angles (known as ?wake steering?) may lower the cost of energy, increase our customer?s profits, and promote greater wind energy penetration in domestic and global grid energy markets.  <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a new model-free approach to maximizing the annual energy produced by wind farms. On most wind farms, the turbines are operated independently, relying only on their individual wind sensors to determine the wind direction and to make control decisions to orient themselves to generate maximum power. The proposed approach will allow arrays of turbines to work together to minimize losses by steering the wakes of upstream turbines away from the downwind rows, increasing net power production. While this technique has been proposed in the past, the methods employed have relied on control algorithms that use models to determine the key operating parameters. Since every wind farm is different, those parameters must be tuned on-site using expensive and time-consuming calibration campaigns. Moreover, as the turbines age, those parameters can end up far from their optimal values. The new proposed scheme takes a different, model-free approach that may eliminate the need for parameter calibration while ensuring that the array continuously operates at its peak performance even as atmospheric and other environmental conditions change and the physical conditions of the turbines deteriorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The seasonal timing of biological events such as leaf out, flowering, and seed production is especially critical for forest wildflowers that rely on high light in the spring, before trees leaf out and reduce light to the forest floor. New research suggests the timing of leaf out of overstory trees may shift faster than understory wildflowers in response to warmer spring temperatures. Such mismatches in leaf out timing of different plant species could reduce wildflower populations and affect forest diversity and productivity. The early leaf out times and dense foliage of nonnative, invasive shrubs could further reduce light levels for native wildflowers. This project explores how warming temperatures may cause a mismatch in lifecycle events of trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Specifically, the project measures whether trees, shrubs, and flowers respond differently to temperature cues, whether this mismatch is a global phenomenon, and how this affects the ability of wildflowers to grow and reproduce. This project connects the public interest in forests to environmental variability and invasive species. The public can access the results through popular media, public lectures, and social media. The project team will develop training for museum educators so they can infuse themes of forest change into exhibits and conversations with museum visitors. In collaboration with museum educators, the project will host K-12 teacher workshops to integrate forest monitoring and local examples of environmental variability into school curricula. <br/><br/>Direct measurements of the consequences of environment-induced phenological mismatches between interacting species are rare, and disruptions in non-trophic competitive interactions between plant species are often overlooked. In addition, related impacts of species invasions are not well integrated into phenological studies. The impacts of these phenological disruptions may be contributing to widely-observed population declines and poor performance of species that weakly respond to warming temperatures. This project will uniquely combine historical records (observations of Henry David Thoreau), contemporary phenological monitoring, museum herbarium collections, and field experiments to document and understand ecological mismatches between forest trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Field shading experiments will simulate effects of environmental variability, species invasions, and ecological mismatches on wildflower performance. Field and growth chamber experiments will test mechanisms determining leaf-out phenology. Thousands of recently digitized herbarium specimens will be leveraged to quantify how overstory-understory temporal mismatch varies across temporal, climatic, and biogeographic gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If successful, this would transform our ability to accurately measure air-water exchange of greenhouse gasses in shallow-water marine ecosystems.

More accurate and process-based knowledge on this topic is needed to allow better predictions of climate change impacts that would be expected and to outline local and global mitigation initiatives.<br/><br/>The accelerating warming of Earth has spurred an intense and global focus on greenhouse gas exchange between the atmosphere and aquatic systems, including coastal waters. As direct measurements of air-water exchange of greenhouse gasses, here defined as CO2, CH4, and N2O, are complex and challenging to perform, most estimates today are based on published general empirical relationships from which exchange coefficients are estimated and multiplied with site-specific concentration differences over the air-water interface. This EAGER research proposes to combine upside-down aquatic eddy covariance (AEC) measurements of O2 fluxes over the air-water interface with an array of the best of these new greenhouse gas sensors and, from the prior, to extract greenhouse gas-specific exchange coefficients in order to calculate air-water greenhouse gas fluxes. If the new approach works, it would be transformative and have two major outcomes: it will vastly improve estimates of greenhouse gas air-water exchange where it is applied; and it will lead to new lines of research on the complex controls of this greenhouse gas exchange. Both outcomes are urgently needed to fill important knowledge gaps on greenhouse gas exchange in aquatic environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include vertical fluxes of nutrients via the settling of plankton and marine snow particles, deposition of marine debris such as microplastics on river, lake and sea beds, and settling tanks in wastewater treatment facilities. An accurate understanding of settling velocities in such applications would improve efficiency and minimize environmental impacts, but gaining this understanding is challenging since such particles are often too large to be modelled as small points. Thus, the principal aim of this project is to understand the underlying physics that leads to altered settling rates of larger particles in turbulent flows. The project will also include the design of a bench-top experimental facility that will provide research, education, and outreach opportunities for undergraduate students in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at UW-Madison. <br/><br/>Settling of finite-sized particles in turbulence are characterized by (1) particle interactions with turbulent flow that occur at Reynolds numbers above unity and (2) complex and multiscale particle-turbulence interactions as the particles distort the local flow around them. Previous work in this regime has found that particle settling rates in turbulence are reduced relative to terminal velocities in quiescent fluid, but it is unclear how this should be understood in terms of the underlying physical mechanisms. This project seeks to fill this gap in understanding by conducting a thorough experimental investigation into settling regimes of finite-sized particles, exploring a range of particle sizes, densities, and volume fractions. The experiments will use the newly constructed octagonal turbulence chamber and three-dimensional high-speed camera measurements of flow and particle motion. The focus will be on identifying new scaling parameters that capture turbulence effects on particle settling rates, including the effects of particle clustering. It is expected that this approach will lead to the identification of mechanisms that alter particle settling rates based on scaling laws that collapse data across a range of parameters. In turn, this understanding will lead to a new predictive model that could inform future designs in water treatment and ecosystem engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the interactions between the heart, aorta, and brain is a key step towards detecting and treating both heart disease (i.e., heart failure) and brain diseases (i.e., dementia). The goal of this CAREER project is to understand how the heart and the brain impact each other so that easy-to-use and cheap heart-brain monitoring devices can be developed for underserved communities. The educational part of this CAREER project is based on the ?See One, Do One, Teach One? philosophy to encourage health monitoring and preventive medicine in low-income families. In addition, this CAREER award will generate a database that will benefit researchers in other fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine. <br/><br/>Heart failure (HF) is a condition characterized by the inability of the heart to circulate blood in the vascular network. Epidemiological studies have shown that simply being a member of a socioeconomically disadvantaged community is an independent risk factor for both incident HF as well as increased hospital readmission for HF. Additionally, reducing the risk for the development of dementia is of the utmost importance due to the absence of effective treatments. As is the case with HF, lower socioeconomic status translates to higher prevalence of dementia. Understanding the complex fluid dynamic coupling (hemodynamic interactions) between the heart, aorta, and brain is a crucial step towards diagnostics and therapeutics of not only HF and dementia, but also other related diseases. The general hypothesis of this proposal is that wave dynamics in the aorta dominate the pulsatile hemodynamics of the heart, the brain, and the nonlinear interaction between the two. The investigator?s main goal is to elucidate systems-level effects of aortic hemodynamics on heart-brain interactions. In order to achieve this goal, the investigator will combine state-of-the-art experimentation, cutting-edge numerical simulation, and novel hybrid physics-informed machine learning approaches. Ultimately, the outcome of this research will facilitate improved understanding of the pathophysiological pathways in highly complex diseases such as HF, Alzheimer?s, and dementia. The long-term goal of this CAREER project is to develop diagnostic and monitoring devices for heart diseases and vascular brain damage.

This has led to concerted efforts to locate specific memory engrams in the brain that we could eventually manipulate at will. For example, we often think about fear memories as being exclusively encoded in the brain?s ?fear center?, called the amygdala. If we could locate the fear engram in the amygdala, one day we might be able to erase problematic fear memories. However, our recent work has challenged this idea of regional specialization. Specifically, we found that a brain region usually restricted to encoding rewarding memories, the hypothalamus, can be recruited to encode future fear memories if subjects have recently experienced something rewarding. Now, we will 1) investigate if this constitutes a shift away from the traditional amygdala fear circuit, 2) reveal the wider circuit that supports hypothalamic regions in the encoding of fear memories, and 3) expose whether the recruitment of hypothalamic circuits to encode fearful memories is permanent or transient. Together, this work will reveal a more fluid approach to conceptualizing memory formation in the brain. We will disseminate this knowledge to the wider community in an undergraduate seminar course while trialing the teaching philosophy ?learning by observing and pitching in?, which is designed to accommodate the educational needs of the diverse student population at UCLA. Further, this project will support paid research opportunities for undergraduate students to work on the proposed experiments and prepare them for careers in scientific research.<br/> <br/>We generally conceive of particular neural circuits as being specialized to encode particular types of information. However, we have recently revealed a phenomenon that calls this into question. We have shown that lateral hypothalamus (LH) can be recruited to encode fear memories, given appropriate prior experience (Sharpe et al., 2021, Nature Neuroscience). That is, LH GABAergic neurons are not necessary to encode fear memories in experimentally-nave rodents. However, if rodents have had experience in reward learning, which is dependent on LH function, LH GABAergic neurons become critical for the encoding fear. This showed that reward learning ?primes? LH to encode fear memories. We hypothesize that reward learning recruits a novel LH fear circuit to encode fear, which constitutes a shift away from the traditional amygdala circuit, in a manner that degrades with time since reward learning experience. We will use cell-type specific optogenetics and fiber photometry of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor, to investigate the causal and correlative dynamics of this phenomenon. We propose to examine: 1) if reward learning reduces the role of basolateral amygdala in encoding fear, 2) where the LH receives the necessary aversive teaching signal to encode fear memories, and 3) if increasing the delay between reward and fear procedures attenuates the involvement of LH GABAergic neurons in encoding fear. This will reveal a dynamic system that shifts between circuits that encode information depending on prior experience, which may have evolved to help us adapt to changing environments by utilizing existing cognitive schema from recent learning episodes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately one quarter of Earth?s population depends on karst (eroded limestone) water supplies that ? within coastal regions ? are directly threatened by rising sea level, uncontrolled groundwater extraction, and rapid coastal development. Yet, the role of these ecosystems in coastal biogeochemical cycling and groundwater health remains unknown. While pelagic constituents of flooded caves in KSEs have been studied for decades, the living benthic (cave floor / seafloor-hosted) fauna of these caves and caverns remains understudied. The overarching goal of this project is to better understand how benthic biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning across subsurface environmental gradients between freshwater aquifers and the marine environment. Flooded coastal caves allow the team to access the KSEs and make direct observations. Results of this work benefit marine benthic ecology and biology, biogeochemistry, paleoecology and biodiversity assessments. This interdisciplinary project establishes a multinational, multi-institutional collaboration, enhance research and scholarship opportunities at a predominantly undergraduate Hispanic-serving institution in Texas and support young investigators from under-represented groups in the sciences. For outreach, the project-associated PhD student, who is an African American female, is co-authoring a semi-autobiographical children?s book about cave diving and the wonders of cave-associated organisms. 	<br/><br/>KSEs influence coastal carbon and nitrogen cycling because they buffer terrestrial material inputs with groundwater discharge into the oceans. While pelagic communities of flooded cave environments in KSEs have been studied for decades due to their adaptations, biogeography, and evolutionary origin, the living benthic fauna and their role in KSE elemental cycling remains understudied. The overall aim of this project is to establish the diversity and ecology of benthic eukaryotes across environmental gradients in extensive coastal caves flooded by the KSE in the Yucatan Peninsula and Cozumel Island (Mexico) and determine how they interact with benthic elemental cycles. This study provides a holistic characterization of KSE benthos using interdisciplinary field- and lab-based approaches including barcoding/meta-barcoding, meta-transcriptomics, ultrastructural analysis, and lab culturing that are being integrated with biogeochemical and hydrological measurements. Specifically, the investigators are characterizing (1) the drivers of spatial biodiversity patterns in coastal cave eukaryotic benthic communities across salinity/oxygen gradients, relative to organic inputs; (2) the role of benthic meiofauna (to nanobiota) communities, with emphasis on foraminifera, in ecosystem function relative to dominant biogeochemical processes that mediate organic matter transformations and nitrogen cycling; and (3) the temporal constraints of benthic meiofauna (to nanobiota) biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in response to seasonal hydrological variation associated with meteorological events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technical problems in connecting and controlling renewable energy resources have resulted in many large-scale failures and the interruption of energy production from these resources, jeopardizing the safe and reliable operation of the nation?s electric power system. The proposed technology seeks to overcome the limitations of existing systems, increase reliability for connecting the inverter-based resources to the electric power grid, and allow more renewable energy to supply American homes and businesses. Attaining these goals will increase customer adoption of electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The technology may increase the competitiveness of US companies in the global inverter, artificial intelligence (AI), and renewable energy markets. The commercial impacts of the project are augmented by an educational outreach plan that will engage student researchers in engineering design problems that integrate and address business-relevant constraints and customer needs.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to translate AI inverter control innovation into a commercial product, process, and/or service. There are two main gaps to overcome in the proposed project. One is a knowledge gap to extend the previous neural-network control technology to practical grid-following and grid-forming applications supporting the operation of inverter-based resources in grid-tied, islanded, and standalone conditions. The other gap is a technical barrier to move the proposed innovation out of the laboratory into real-world systems. Regarding the knowledge gap, research will equip the neural-network control innovation with modules that can support the inverter operation to meet various grid needs. Regarding the technical barrier, research will be performed in this project to enable the developed neural network inverter to satisfy the industry standards. The expected results include prototypes that can be applied to practical electric utility systems and AI-driven inverter technology that can meet strict reliability requirements of the electric power industry.

In most of these systems, the energy conversion and storage processes rely crucially on the interface between solid electrodes and liquid electrolytes. However, the fundamental atomic and molecular structure at these electrified interfaces remains elusive. The goal of the project is to achieve an atomistic understanding of the structure and reaction dynamics of electrode-electrolyte interfaces, and provide design principles for various low-cost, carbon-based electrochemical systems. Through international collaborations with the University College Dublin and Ulster University, the PIs will develop an integrated experimental imaging - atomistic simulation method. The technical outcomes of the project will facilitate the design and engineering of efficient electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. The educational efforts of the project will build and incorporate demo devices of electrochemical cells and materials imaging platforms into a series of education and outreach activities both domestically and internationally. The project will train the graduate and undergraduate students with skills in both experimental and simulation methods and provide them with an international collaborative research experience. The project will contribute to efforts to educate the public on the basic mechanisms of renewable energy conversion and storage.<br/><br/>The project?s aim is to achieve a thorough atomistic understanding of electrochemical processes by determining the 3D structure of electrode-electrolyte interfaces, including both the surface of the solid electrodes and the liquid solvation layers. The project?s approach will integrate molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations with 3D atomic-resolution force microscopy experiments to achieve a joint experiment-theory platform for precise understanding and prediction of electrochemical interfaces. The platform will be used to unravel the solvation layer structure that is responsible for energy storage in carbon-based supercapacitors, and the solvent-included atomistic kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions on single-atom catalysts. The project will produce fundamental models of solid-liquid interfaces that consider the inherent atomic-scale heterogeneities. Furthermore, the thorough determination of the atomistic interfacial structure and catalytic activities of single-atom catalysts will shed light on the unconventional scaling relationships of catalysts with nonuniform structures. This will be an important step towards a more predictive, molecular-level theory beyond the widely accepted ""Sabatier Principle"" for heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis.

The goal of authentic experiences is to model how scientists think about solving a problem. Authentic experiences provide a real-world context when learning state-adopted content standards. These experiences engage students in broadening their critical thinking skills while furthering their understanding of regional real-world STEM issues they will encounter during their studies and after graduation. For teachers to have the ability to create and implement authentic experiences for their students, they will benefit from being engaged in such experiences. This project will provide two real-world summer experiences where preservice teachers will work with university faculty, researchers, and mentor teachers to develop content and pedagogically rich curriculum to implement in their classrooms and field experiences. Likewise, they will develop assessments to explore the impact of the curriculum. High impact teaching practices can lead to higher engagement in STEM and build a strong STEM workforce to address national and global problems in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>This project at Georgia Southern University, a public research university, includes partnerships with Evans County Charter School System, Savannah-Chatham Public School System, Georgia Southern University Botanical Garden and Center for STEM Education, and Skidaway Island Marine Extension. The project has four fundamental goals. First, the project aims to provide K-12 internships for six freshman and sophomore STEM majors to help generate and sustain their interest in teaching. A second goal is to provide scholarships and to graduate eighteen (18) high-achieving undergraduate biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics majors who are certified to teach in their major areas at the secondary level. A third goal is to place these graduates in high-need school districts and then provide mentoring and other induction support for six years following their graduation. Fourth, the project team will create, implement, study, and maintain an integrated synchronous and asynchronous reflective teaching community of practice model. In the process, the investigators will explore how focused seminar experiences, in addition to program coursework, can impact preservice readiness to successfully complete clinical practice and first-year teaching. Project outcomes will provide insight into how a community of practice model can longitudinally impact program innovation and teacher retention in high-needs schools. In addition, the project will provide strategies for developing and integrating authentic contexts in secondary STEM classrooms. The project also has potential to impact how preservice teacher education programs are structured, how lesson planning strategies are taught, and how mentoring strategies to help preservice teachers develop skills and dispositions to work in high-needs schools are designed. Resources developed and project evaluation findings will be disseminated via regional, state, national, and international sources, including STEM conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and various internet applications.

Pack-ice is melting, water is warming, storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, and basic circulation patterns are being altered. This project focuses on the fate of the Pacific water that enters the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait, the narrow passage between the US and Russia. Pacific water plays a critical role in the western Arctic ecosystem. In wintertime the cold inflowing water provides nutrients that spur the growth of phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. In summertime, the warm water melts pack ice and provides fresh water to the Arctic Ocean. After the Pacific-origin water crosses the Chukchi Sea, north of Bering Strait, some of it forms a current that flows eastward along the edge of the adjacent Beaufort Sea. As part of the project, a mooring will be maintained in the center of this current to measure its physical and biological properties. The mooring has been deployed (with a few gaps) since 2002. By extending the measurements for another four years, this provides the chance to document and understand how this important part of the Arctic system is responding to the drastic environmental changes ? including the varying atmospheric conditions and evolving source waters from Bering Strait. The data obtained by the mooring, along with the shipboard measurements collected when the mooring is serviced, will continue to be widely used by the scientific community in both observational and modeling studies. A graduate student will be supported by the project, and community outreach will be undertaken during one of the expeditions in order to engage the public.  <br/><br/>The AON monitoring mooring is situated at 152W near the Beaufort Sea shelfbreak, roughly 150 km downstream of Barrow Canyon ? the main Pacific water outflow point from the Chukchi Sea. It will be deployed from fall 2022 to fall 2026, which will extend the timeseries to 21 years. The mooring measures the velocity of the water column, the thickness and velocity of the pack ice, and the temperature, salinity, and pressure throughout the water column. Chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrate are measured at the top of the mooring, and a passive acoustic recorder documents marine mammal calls. Zooplankton concentration is estimated using the ADCP backscatter data. Collectively, this information enables determination of how much water, heat, nutrients, chlorophyll, and freshwater are transported by the current, and assessment of how much exchange occurs between the interior of the Arctic Ocean and the boundary waters. This includes wind-driven upwelling and downwelling that take place throughout the year along the Beaufort slope, and appear to be increasing as the climate warms. During the biennial cruises to service the mooring, a hydrographic/velocity survey of the boundary current system is carried out to obtain a large-scale context for the mooring timeseries. The shipboard sampling includes occupations of some of the Distributed Biological Observatory transects. As in the past, the biennial cruises will provide a platform for a broad array of interdisciplinary projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One factor that may explain these observations is that ocean surface waters have warmed faster than deeper waters. Temperature differences may act as a physical barrier to mixing, thereby impeding deeper nutrients from reaching the sunlit surface where they are used by ocean plants in photosynthesis. With less mixing, the upper layers of the ocean may have become less productive, which may in turn impact marine fish, bird, and mammal populations of economic and cultural (ecological) value to society. To conduct this study, the investigators are examining the effects of ocean warming by depth on the abundance of plankton, small fish, and the breeding success of marine birds across the world using existing long-term data. They are developing mathematical relationships to understand how ocean warming at various depths is linked to plankton, fish, and bird productivity. Results will provide key information for selecting which seabird species may be best suited as ecological indicators of change for different ecosystems across the globe, and therefore has implications for remote-ocean monitoring. The project will contribute new scientific understanding for upcoming United Nation assessment reports and enhance public awareness of ocean health through outreach materials centered on popular seabirds such as puffins and penguins. It will support early career and postdoctoral scientists.<br/><br/>Ocean thermal stratification is an important factor determining primary productivity in epipelagic zones of the world?s oceans. A recent global analysis showed declining trends in the breeding productivity of fish-eating seabirds that forage in the epipelagic zone, but increasing stratification has yet to be investigated as an explanatory factor. The primary objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that seabird species groups vary in their responses to increasing thermal stratification through the indirect effects of stratification on epipelagic food resource availability and/or prey use by the birds. The investigators are testing the prediction that thermal stratification has the largest effect on breeding productivity of piscivorous, surface-foraging species. They are integrating a new global database on seabird productivity with high-resolution data on thermal stratification available from the European GLORYS model, as well as satellite-based chlorophyll-a data from NASA. They are using Generalized Linear Mixed Models to test for variation between seabird groups and Structural Equation Models to test direct and indirect pathways of response from stratification through prey availability to seabird productivity, focusing on mid-to-high latitude ecosystems across ocean basins in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Results will improve understanding of how seabirds respond to increasing thermal stratification in relation to fundamental differences in seabird life history traits. The retrospective analysis will advance knowledge of how seabirds that feed on different prey, and in different epipelagic habitats of the world?s oceans, have responded to recent increases in stratification. More generally, the study will contribute insight into how physical changes in the upper ocean affect predators through the availability of food resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aging infrastructure and insufficient weatherization measures have increased power and natural gas consumption levels and emissions. The best means of reigning in consumption rates are improved energy efficiency and weatherization enabled through proper quantified energy assessments. The proposed technology enables faster, safer, and more accurate thermal assessments for residential and commercial buildings, providing a data-rich source for identification of points of largest energy consumption and measures to improve thermal efficiency of structures. The primary market this technology is public and private educational institutions like higher-education universities and K-12 institutions. Facility and Plant Managers may be able to use the technology to rapidly identify measures to reduce utility charges and increase the lifespan of structures. The quantification of energy consumption also may enable these mangers to access further state or federal funding for structural improvements. In addition, the proposed technology may be useful for weatherization experts and structural engineers working on construction projects and aiding utility providers for energy infrastructure inspection.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology to quickly convert thermal images captured from a UAS mounted radiometric infrared sensor to energy utilization estimations using artificial intelligence, data analytics, and thermodynamics. The thermal images captured by the infrared sensors are corrected for atmospheric attenuation and processed by the artificial intelligence to identify individual components of a building?s faade and any thermal anomalies. Thermodynamic procedures are utilized to calculate the heat conductance or the U-value of each element and calculate the financial impact of heat loss from the building depending on the dimensions of the elements being considered along with the type of utility used for space heating/cooling. This technology solution is slated to automate thermal assessment processes for buildings and reduce the overall processing time by 90% and on-site inspection time by 60% compared to traditional assessment techniques. The initial research for the technology was performed over a three-year period where thermal images of various structures throughout North Dakota were analyzed and cross-referenced for their thermal profiles.

Many patients have limited access to nutrition professionals for reasons such as time and financial constraints and availability of a registered dietitian. In the US, 60% of adults have a chronic disease. People with a chronic disease are more likely to have a poor quality of life. The proposed software program may improve quality of life and increase access to nutrition services for patients. It is designed to show people what to eat and how to prepare foods based on his or her current diet-related behaviors and readiness to change. This is of great interest to leadership of insurance companies and employee wellness programs because research has shown that dietitian-led lifestyle management added to the usual medical care provided modest health care cost savings. The proposed program may increase access to nutrition care and disease management adherence while decreasing health care costs. Ultimately, the proposed technology may empower people to manage their chronic disease nutritionally so that they feel their best every day.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a data-driven software program with a collection of culinary medicine and nutrition education videos for chronic illnesses that also assists patients with goalsetting, self-monitoring progress, and provides feedback on behavioral goals. Developed by registered dietitians with over 30 years of combined clinical experience and a culinary educator with over 10 years of industry experience, the proposed technology is a program designed to support people with chronic and acute conditions in improving their diet quality and overall health. When patients have access to nutrition services their outcomes (laboratory tests, weight, blood pressure) improve. Thus, having a way to help patients manage chronic disease nutritionally by showing them what to eat, how to prepare it, and giving them on-demand access to nutrition information may benefit those involved with health, fitness, and chronic disease management. The software may be personalized with an interactive capability to tailor recipes and meal plans for each person?s level of readiness and confidence to help them set goals and reach them.

Importantly, the study will implement non-invasive scattering techniques to study the membranes, leveraging the powerful resources at national facilities such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The investigators will engage undergraduates and high school students who do not historically have access to research experience.

Moreover, these skills will give students an advantage applying for positions in academia, research organizations, and industry. <br/><br/>Biological membranes are highly complex structures consisting of a lipid bilayer and associated molecules. In this project the investigators aim to study the molecular origins of the force from lipids (FFL) principle and its role in the activity of ion channels. They will harness non-invasive scattering techniques, in conjunction with droplet interface bilayers (DIBs) measurements, to study these molecular mechanisms.  These conceptually distant techniques will allow the investigators to get a comprehensive picture of processes involved in ion channel activity at the molecular scale (via scattering) and its relation to stimulated learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity (via DIBs).  Synaptic plasticity describes biological processes that enable learning and memory due to the physicochemical and electromechanical activities between synapses. By controlling the activity of the pore-forming ion channels embedded in membranes, one can manipulate the membrane resting potential, and other signals, simply by controlling the flow of ions across the cell membrane.  Understanding the detailed, multi-scale molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity are of fundamental importance in gaining insights into the molecular basis of learning and memory.

The conference aims to bring together a group of mathematicians with expertise centered around an expanded notion of geometry. Two of the main sources of motivation for investigating these geometries are the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum physics and abstract algebra in mathematics. The conference will provide a setting for two largely distinct groups of researchers to come together, exchange ideas, and learn about recent developments. A central aim of the conference is to provide early-career mathematicians perspective and an entry point into this exciting and fast-moving field.<br/><br/>Noncommutative geometry is a general viewpoint in which one seeks to apply tools, perspectives, and intuition from geometry to noncommutative algebraic structures in the absence of a direct spectral interpretation as rings of functions. This viewpoint has been extremely fruitful in many settings, including representation theory, tensor categories, symplectic geometry, and quantum field theory, often without direct communication between the various groups. The conference will include participants who can illuminate different aspects of this overarching theme. The meeting is designed to provide a unique opportunity for an exchange of ideas and a stock-taking on the state of the field as a whole. The gathering is aimed at bringing together early-career researchers, primarily graduate students, postdocs and early-stage faculty, and introducing them to a broad vision and providing opportunities for forming new connections and collaborations. Attention will be paid to diversity, not only in the application process, but also in the funding of participants and creating a welcoming environment for traditionally underrepresented groups. The conference will focus on highlighting recent developments to inspire the next generation of noncommutative geometers.

For these and the growing number of communities facing a new set of risks due to climate change, key questions now emerge: Will these events strengthen communities? resolve to build climate resilience, or erode public support for such policies in favor of reducing short-term recovery costs? And do community members who live through rebuilding and recovery shift their opinions of and support for resilience policies? This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project focuses on local-level regulations that contribute to disaster and climate resilience of communities but that can make development more costly, particularly in the short-term. Prior work has shown that public support and the availability and requirements of external resources and programs shape these local government decisions, but it is unclear whether and to what extent this support changes after a shock such as a disaster. This study seeks to understand how these policy decisions are affected by and affect individual preferences and decisions by collecting perishable data after the Marshall Fire.<br/><br/>This study is guided by theories of post-disaster recovery and resilience that describe how local government policies succeed or fail after catastrophic events. The post-disaster planning and policy environment is characterized by time compression, when urban development processes occur within shortened timeframes. Some plans and policies are more compatible with time compression than others; in particular, time compression is challenging for bureaucratic activities like planning and regulation that ordinarily rely on lengthy stakeholder and public engagement processes to help balance short- and long-term policy considerations. Meanwhile, a substantial body of research shows that the process of government-led recovery ? how policies are formulated and the nature, quality, and coordination of stakeholder and resident engagement ? has significant influence on the breadth and scope of policy changes that local governments are likely to make after a disaster. The focusing events scholarship suggests that this relationship may be especially important after disaster when trust in government, policy preferences, and public involvement in decision making can vary significantly, sometimes being led by technocrats rather than through open consultative processes. Trust in government ? influenced by communication from government officials and staff to residents and also by the two-way consultative nature of disaster recovery processes established in a community ? is also an important determinant of whether policy changes to bolster resilience are made. What is unclear is whether previously established resilience policies can survive in the time-compressed recovery process after an unanticipated and un-planned-for disaster like the Marshall Fire. To investigate these questions, the research team will (1) administer a longitudinal survey of individuals who lived in three affected jurisdictions at the time of the Marshall Fire to assess their intent to rebuild or relocate, their engagement in the recovery process, their support for resilience policies, and their attitudes towards and trust in government over time. They will also (2) interview local government elected officials, (3) observe disaster recovery meetings, and (4) analyze recovery-related plans and documents during the first year after the catastrophic fire.

Because these networks propagate a radio signal that can be readily observed, security and privacy are major concerns. Much of security and privacy research focuses on protecting the content of messages from eavesdroppers, but there are important applications where even the detection of a communication signal's presence by an adversary is undesirable. In a civilian setting, the detection of a signal from an embedded medical device leaks health information, or the detection of encrypted signals transmitted between parties can lead to that communication being shut down by an authoritarian government. In a military setting, the presence of communication signals can be used as a proxy for troop activity. Hence, undetectable or low probability of detection (LPD) communications has motivated significant historical and recent study. Protection against the detection of a radio signal is challenging given recent advances in algorithms and computation. Algorithmic advances through techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) and computational advances based on quantum computing provide the adversary with a powerful set of tools for developing a signal detector. This has motivated a branch of information systems research initiated by a portion of this research team ten years ago, now termed ?covert communications,? that is developing a fundamental understanding of the ability of two parties to communicate without detection by an attentive and capable adversary. This project will develop results in covert communications for the models that underpin radio communications to allow for the protection of messages in the wireless communication systems that are crucial to modern society.<br/><br/>For discrete-time additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, Bash, Goeckel, and Towsley initiated recent covert communications work by demonstrating in 2012 that a transmitter Alice can reliably transmit O(sqrt(n)) bits in n channel uses (and no more) to recipient Bob without detection by an attentive and capable adversary Willie. And nearly all work in covert communications has been performed on discrete-time models, with the implicit understanding that the results would be applicable to the true continuous-time system. But this is not true for important emerging architectures for covert wireless communications; rather, the continuous-time channel must be considered directly. This project will consider the fundamental characterization of covert communication systems as they are considered for implementation in wireless communications through three research thrusts: 1. Foundations of covert communications in continuous-time systems: We focus on performance characterization and design in the face of tools available for the adversary Willie in continuous-time wireless systems: interference cancellation, cyclostationary detectors, and transmitter identification. 2. Covert communications in the presence of environmental interference: Covert communications hidden behind environmental signals is preferable to employing jamming. We focus on covert throughput bounds as a function of the interference dynamics and techniques to achieve those bounds. 3. Learning-based covert communication approaches: We design and analyze deep neural network (DNN)-based covert transceivers by the simultaneous training of an adversary whose performance is used as a regularizer in the training of the transmitter Alice. The training of a diverse workforce in security and privacy is an important aspect of the project. The third thrust that considers AI-based approaches at both the communication parties and the adversary provides an accessible and highly desirable research area for University of Massachusetts undergraduate students in engineering and computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Limitations exist, however, due to the high process temperatures, (often beyond the melting point of component materials), and the large associated thermal gradients and rapid cooling rates. On the other hand, non-melting metal AM such as cold spray technology, in which tiny powder particles are accelerated to a supersonic speed to collide, bond to and build up underlying materials upon impact, may considerably alleviate the melting-rooted challenges. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research in developing a fundamental understanding of the process-microstructure-property relationships for cold spray AM using novel high-speed single-particle impact testing, complemented by multi-scale numerical modeling, to study individual bonded particles, the building blocks of the cold spray process, and then expand to a part-level study. The research will enable reliable and performance-oriented processing design for cold spray AM, with a potential to strengthen the Nation?s defense and other industries through enabling sustainable and agile manufacturing and repair at the point of need. The knowledge gained may also be translated to other solid-state joining or additive technologies for aerospace, construction and energy applications. The team will engage K-12 students and educators through hands-on activities with a designed additive manufacturing toolkit. The project will also promote participation from underrepresented minority students in advanced manufacturing through 10-week summer camps in a research laboratory.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this CAREER project is to establish a unified framework to understand and predict the critical velocity, impact-induced microstructural development, micro-scale bond strength, and macro-scale mechanical properties of cold-sprayed deposits. Laser-induced micro-scale projectile impact testing will be conducted with high-resolution imaging to produce well-defined high-velocity individual bonded particles, with microstructures and properties characterized by advanced electron microscopy and micro-mechanical measurements. Both the first layer impacts and particle impacts on subsequent layers will be systematically investigated. The role of the impact velocity, oxide layer thickness, particle size and temperature, and impact angle in the characteristics of bonded interfaces and local bond strengths will be scientifically revealed. Further, finite element modeling incorporating a dislocation-based constitutive model, oxide layer fracture, and cohesive bonding will be established, which will be used to predict the impact-induced microstructure changes and bond strengths. The micro-scale simulations will inform a macro-scale model to calculate the mechanical properties of cold-sprayed specimens. Different sources of statistical effects resulting from the distribution of particle sizes, temperatures, and oxide layer thicknesses will also be considered in the multi-scale model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed project will create a new class of high-efficient and cost-effective equipment for energy recovery and energy efficiency improvement.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project develops a unique energy transfer concept for high-efficient and cost-effective phase-change energy conversion. State-of-the-art heat exchange processes use linear heat transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the proposed approach accounts for the non-linear heat distribution during the condensation process. As a result, the mass of partially condensed mixture changes along the flow channel, and thus causes a corresponding change in local dew point. This approach defines a design configuration for efficient capture and maximal recovery of latent energy from the wet gas flow. The proposed concept successfully exploits the thermo-fluid advantages of spiral channels and thermosiphons. The project will resolve key technological gaps and address issues including condensation sustainability at variable channel geometry and changing flow parameters, and the thermosiphon?s optimal performance at unconventional conditions.

Failing to disclose, or actively hiding, illness presents clear risks to individual, public, and even organizational health. For instance, pre-pandemic surveys indicate that up to 90% of U.S. employees still go to the workplace when sick, and productivity losses from the common cold alone are estimated at close to $25 billion annually. To help better understand decisions to conceal infectious disease, this project addresses two main themes: (1) What individual and social factors are associated with the concealment of sickness? For example, is concealing illness more common in specific types of relationships or by people with certain personality traits? Does it depend on whether the illness is particularly dangerous or not? (2) What are the psychological consequences of making this decision? For example, does the mental effort involved in concealing sickness interfere with people?s thinking and problem-solving abilities, does it impair their social relationships, and does it trigger feelings of guilt and shame that might contribute to antisocial tendencies?<br/><br/>To test these questions, one set of descriptive studies measures how often people hide sickness and what motivates those decisions depending on who is being concealed from (friends, coworkers, strangers) and features of the illness being concealed (transmission risk, harm severity, illness longevity). In a second set of experiments, study participants are enrolled when they report actually becoming sick with an infectious illness. The focus here is whether concealing one?s illness causes changes in cognitive functioning (intrusive thoughts, performance under stress), social relationships (feeling connected to and valuing others), and moral judgment (self-identification of dishonesty, guilt/shame). Finally, psychological processes associated with infection concealment are compared against processes associated with concealment of non-infectious conditions, such as stigmatized identities and secrets, to help determine whether concealing sickness is a unique behavior requiring unique solutions. The project informs future efforts to mitigate public health challenges associated with the spread of disease and associated workplace challenges. It also provides a basis for improving the welfare of infected individuals by advancing knowledge about perceived barriers to revealing one?s condition and the resulting cognitive and affective impact when one does not reveal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across the past decade, 40%-50% of college students in the United States each year started their postsecondary education at a two-year college. Students enrolled at two-year colleges are more likely to be low-income and from historically underrepresented groups, compared to students who start postsecondary education enrolled in four-year colleges. Led by a collaborative team of universities and community colleges representing 9 current NSF S-STEM projects, the PROSPECT S-STEM research hub will explore how equitable partnerships between two-year colleges and four-year institutions can empower low-income STEM transfer students. Researchers at Clemson University, East Carolina University, Southeast Community College, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Augsburg University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of Texas at Arlington, and YNOTI Solutions along with 14 two-year college partners are united by their goal to support domestic, low-income undergraduates as they navigate the transfer process. Numerous challenges exist that can make it difficult for students to successfully transfer from two- and four-year colleges, which in turn can reduce the likelihood that these students earn a bachelor?s degree. This project will address this issue by collecting and analyzing national-level data to highlight transfer issues. The hub?s research will support the development of strategies and resources to build institutional partnerships designed to increase positive outcomes for low-income transfer students. <br/><br/>The PROSPECT S-STEM Hub will operate as a research and dissemination hub to investigate the nature of two- and four-year colleges? partnerships and how developing co-equitable partnerships can better support low-income STEM scholars before and after the transition process. There is a need to understand how two- and four-year colleges can effectively establish and maintain partnerships. Equitable partnerships that support transfer students necessarily involve a range of stakeholders across institutions. PROSPECT S-STEM will examine the nature of these partnerships through: a) longitudinal case studies of two- and four-year college partnerships trying to improve STEM transfer student success; and b) the establishments of professional learning communities with key stakeholders, including advisors, faculty, financial aid, student affairs professionals, and other administrators involved with transfer policies and programs. Our investigation of these partnerships is framed through the lens of community cultural wealth, partnership capital, and dimension of equity. The mixed methods research will include interviews, participant concept mapping, document analysis, and survey data from S-STEM Scholars. PROSPECT S-STEM will target dissemination to researchers, advisors, student affairs professionals, administrators and other stakeholders who support STEM transfer students, thus facilitating the scale up of this project?s practices and findings to others seeking to support low-income STEM transfer students. This hub is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diatoms are among the most abundant microalgae, particularly in upwelling areas where nutrient-rich deep currents feed the ocean's surface and support the world's greatest fisheries. Yet this survey did not investigate high-productivity regions, leaving a significant knowledge gap. Diatoms may be successful in upwelling regions because they evade predators and parasites, but it seems more reasonable that they, like all other microalgae, also have biological enemies. In this study, the researchers use a large set of available samples from upwelling regions to investigate the effect of parasites on the proliferation of diatom communities and resulting primary production. The project supports a graduate student and provides hands-on research experiences for high school and undergraduate college students. The study data are also integrated into courses taught by the principal investigator. <br/><br/>The discovery that half of the eukaryotic diversity in the Tara Oceans sequence database belongs to putatively parasitic microbes implies a revolution in our understanding of biological control of primary production. Ecosystem models are only beginning to incorporate the effect of viruses on production and community composition, but eukaryotic parasites add yet another dimension with potentially vast biogeochemical implications. While viral predation is generally thought to divert material flux away from grazers and into the dissolved organic carbon pool, increasing community diversity and microbial biomass, phytoplankton biomass diverted into parasite biomass becomes available to grazers. Experimental determination of parasite activity is difficult in natural systems, so most of the evidence for diversity, abundance, and host interactions of eukaryotic parasites is based on DNA sequence data. The Tara Oceans database suggests that diatoms have very few biotic interactions, leading to a stronger dependence on bottom-up factors (e.g., nutrients). However, this database did not represent high productivity upwelling regions. This project addresses two hypotheses: 1) diatoms in highly productive episodic upwelling systems are involved in host-parasite interactions that can be identified in co-occurrence networks during blooms; and 2) the community composition and abundance of host-parasite pairs vary over the course of the bloom in a manner consistent with density dependence on the host. In this project, abundance, diversity, and dynamics of parasites in upwelling systems are investigated by tag sequencing, metagenomics, and targeted qPCR of diatom-parasite pairs identified from archived samples from diatom-dominated upwelling systems (California Current, Eastern Tropical Pacific), the North Atlantic Spring bloom, and from two mesocosm experiments of diatom blooms induced by inoculation of surface seawater into nitrate-rich Monterey Bay seawater. Biogeochemical parameters (nutrients, primary production, nitrate assimilation, etc.) for those samples are available. In addition, the research team is using the outputs of the bioinformatics analysis in network and time series analysis to discover links among hosts and parasites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The IRM is a multi-user facility for pure and applied research on the magnetic properties of rocks, sediments, and minerals. IRMS provides instrumental infrastructure, technical expertise, and educational outreach for the Earth Science community and related disciplines for research in Earth, planetary and environmental sciences. The IRM serves as a national facility for research into the physics and chemistry of magnetization in natural materials resulting from geologic, biologic, and anthropogenic processes in the Earth system and covering time scales from the present and recent past to billions of years ago. Natural-material magnetic research is an essential part of larger scientific efforts to understand the origin and evolution of the geomagnetic field and the deep interior of Earth and terrestrial planets; the history of tectonic plates; and the evolution of Earth?s surficial environments and climate. The five-year project will continue to strengthen opportunities for community-based research and promote the progress of science by: (1) maintaining the integrity, function, and accuracy of the facility instrumentation and computer resources, which maintains the IRM database; (2) providing access and support to over 150 visiting scientists from the US and abroad projected to use IRM facilities during the award period; (3) training and education of undergraduate, graduate students, and early career scientists; and (4) providing research-related information to the Earth science community and related disciplines through biennial conferences, website, online database, and a quarterly newsletter. The well-established biennial rock magnetism summer school provides a ten-day workshop for hands-on, lab-based, training for graduate and early career scientists.<br/><br/>The magnetic behavior of particle assemblages of iron oxides, hydroxides, sulfides and iron alloys is governed by a combination of physical and chemical processes at the nanometric to micrometric levels which makes magnetic measurements sensitive indicators of mineral composition, crystallography, microstructures, and particle size, shape and orientation distributions. The magnetization that emerges from these processes and properties is affected by time, temperature, pressure, external magnetic fields, and (bio)geochemical surroundings. Understanding how these processes operate is the foundation for determining magnetic mineral compositions, concentrations and size distributions in natural samples, and for understanding the origin and significance of natural remanent records of ancient magnetic fields on Earth and other planetary bodies. A suite of advanced instruments enables sensitive measurements of magnetization under controlled conditions of temperature, magnetic fields, time, and orientation, and allow detailed characterization of magnetic mineralogy in geological, extraterrestrial, biological, and anthropogenic materials. Research facilitated by the analytical and technical capabilities of the IRM improves our understanding of how the complex natural recording systems work, and to maximize the information that we can recover from magnetic analysis of natural materials. Research activities are carried out by IRM scientists and students and visiting researchers, and encompass a range of aspects, from basic understanding of rock and mineral magnetism, to applied studies in which magnetic characteristics of rocks and sediments are used as tools for investigating a wide variety of geological and surficial Earth processes. The scale of investigations extends from bacterial magnetic particles and environmental reconstructions to plate tectonic reconstructions and magnetic mapping of other planets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A relatively large percentage of falls in a patient?s room are associated with the IV pole, which introduces a serious risk.  The solution has potential applications in both hospitals and long-term care facilities, where IV pole-associated falls occur. Patient falls affect one million hospitalized patients and cost US care providers $50 billion annually. Hospital falls are ?Never Events? that are not reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In addition, more serious falls result in longer length of stay and may cause additional complications such as the increased risk of infections. The utilization of the proposed solution also may provide other tangible benefits to hospitals as it may improve the safety rating of hospitals, and the patient experience. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a smart intravenous IV pole device that is fundamentally different from the versions of this product currently in the market that may reduce the risk of falls at hospitals and other healthcare settings. The artificial intelligence-based features of this product may eliminate multiple risks associated with the current IV poles. Previous studies by the team show that 70 and 23 percent of all fall initiations, in a trip to the bathroom and around the bed respectively, are associated with the IV pole. Patients? forced postural changes resulting from subject-environment-equipment/furniture interactions were identified as a key determinant of fall initiations. Movement, while attached to an IV pole, involves constant pushing, pulling, and other forced postural changes, which introduce destabilizing biomechanical forces associated with fall initiations. Using the proposed technology solution eliminates postural changes forced by the IV pole, releases both hands of a patient for conducting tasks, and enables simultaneous use of a walker or wheelchair, among other safety improvements. A preliminary study with young, healthy subjects shows a substantial improvement in gait speed and trunk lean ? two factors associated with falls.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 10-11 December 2021 tornado outbreak provides a unique and valuable opportunity to fill knowledge gaps by conducting both aerial and ground evaluations in forested areas damaged by strong tornadoes that passed over complex terrain. The primary objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics. The project team will conduct a high-resolution assessment of forest damage and terrain based on aerial imagery and ground surveys, and then develop a quantitative comparison of damage levels and tornado characteristics across terrain features using GIS tools, machine learning, and analytical vortex models. Results will inform simple engineering models to assess risk to the built and natural environment and will enhance general awareness of the threat of tornadoes in areas where the public may not recognize the dangers. <br/><br/>Existing research into the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics has substantial limitations, including a limited number of case studies, idealized simulation parameters, and inconclusive or contradictory results. A novel research approach will test the hypotheses that 1) tornado intensity decreases (increases) as the vortex moves uphill (downhill), 2) higher (lower) surface roughness leads to stronger (weaker) near-surface winds, and 3) terrain features can deflect the path of a tornado in predictable ways. This approach employs the structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetric range imaging technique to provide an extremely high-resolution characterization of both terrain and treefall at centimeter scales through the development of 2-D orthomosaics and 3-D point clouds that include information on the size, location, and disposition of hundreds of thousands of trees. The data collected here and the subsequent analyses will help the meteorological and engineering communities to move toward scientific consensus regarding the influence of terrain on tornadic circulations and will allow for new and more detailed research studies. Although large eddy simulation (LES) tests are beyond the scope of the work, the data collected here will also enable next-generation LES studies with far greater realism than has previously been possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before harvesting the benefits from those LS-MAS, it is necessary to develop a feasible methodology that can enhance the efficiency and resiliency of LS-MAS in real-time even under uncertainties and disturbances. Although existing game theory, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) achievement in multi-agent systems optimization are exciting, there is still a gap for applying those theories and techniques to LS-MAS since a large number of agents will cause the intractable computational complexity in both optimization and learning, well-known as ?curse-of-dimensionality?. This project aims to investigate the new theory along with efficient and feasible AI/ML approaches that cannot only balance the LS-MAS optimality efficiency and computational complexity theoretically but also learn the LS-MAS optimal solution in real-time with resilience guaranteed. The research is complemented by the integration of research and education plan including a two-way education/research pipeline between UNR and PVAMU. Through the annual summer camp and graduate student joint-research program, UNR and PVAMU can exchange students and faculties.

To overcome this challenge, this project will provide several novel contributions, including i) A novel hierarchical game theory (HGT) that can maintain the LS-MAS optimal efficiency while simultaneously balancing computational complexity, ii) A new type of backward stochastic differential equation based actor-critic reinforcement learning to solve the high-dimensional HGT-based LS-MAS optimization problem, and iii) A quality-of-performance driven reliable, efficient, safe hybrid reinforcement learning framework that can balance learning efficiency and computational complexity with safety guaranteed and further pave the way to real-time learning-based LS-MAS optimization even with uncertainties from harsh environments. This project will lead a new direction in machine learning, optimal control, and game theory in real-time LS-MAS optimization, and also contribute to a variety of emerging LS-MAS, e.g. smart transportation, wide area power management systems, etc., which are of national priority.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, soils are common to many parts of Antarctica, and these soils are often unlike any others found on Earth. Antarctic soils harbor unique microorganisms able to cope with the extremely cold and dry conditions common to much of the continent. For decades, microbiologists have been drawn to the unique soils in Antarctica, yet critical knowledge gaps remain. Most notably, it is unclear what properties allow certain microbes to thrive in Antarctic soils. By using a range of methods, this project is developing comprehensive model that discovers the unique genomic features of soils diversity, distributions, and adaptations that allow Antarctic soil microbes to thrive in extreme environments. The proposed work will be relevant to researchers in many fields, including engineers seeking to develop new biotechnologies, ecologists studying the contributions of these microbial communities to the functioning of Antarctic ecosystems, microbiologists studying novel microbial adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, and even astrobiologists studying the potential for life on Mars. More generally, the proposed research presents an opportunity to advance our current understanding of the microbial life found in one of the more distinctive microbial habitats on Earth, a habitat that is inaccessible to many scientists and a habitat that is increasingly under threat from climate change.<br/><br/>The research project explores the microbial diversity in Antarctic soils and links specific features to different soil types and environmental conditions. The overarching questions include: What microbial taxa are found in a variety of Antarctic environments? What are the environmental preferences of specific taxa or lineages? What are the genomic and phenotypic traits of microorganisms that allow them to persist in extreme environments and determine biogeographical differneces? This project will analyze archived soils collected from across Antarctica by a network of international collaborators, with samples selected to span broad gradients in soil and site conditions. The project uses cultivation-independent, high-throughput genomic analysis methods and cultivation-dependent approaches to analyze bacterial and fungal communities in soil samples. The results will be used to predict the distributions of specific taxa and lineages, obtain genomic information for the more ubiquitous and abundant taxa, and quantify growth responses in vitro across gradients in temperature, moisture, and salinity. This integration of ecological, environmental, genomic, and trait-based information will provide a comprehensive understanding of microbial life in Antarctic soils. This project will also help facilitate new collaborations between scientists across the globe while providing undergraduate students with 'hands-on' research experiences that introduce the next generation of scientists to the field of Antarctic biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is one of the main reasons why 3D imaging is still not omnipresent in our society, and still solely trained experts with task-specific equipment are able to capture high-quality 3D models. This project seeks to build a ?one fits all? system that has the potential to change this. The targeted system enables precise 3D measurements of complicated surfaces/scenes in today?s billion-dollar industries, such as virtual reality, industrial inspection, autonomous navigation, or medical imaging. Many of these industries routinely run into particularly challenging scenarios for 3D scanning systems. Moreover, a scene-independent and precise 3D sensing system can have many applications. The produced sets of high-quality 3D data can usher the next wave in vision-related artificial intelligence research, leading to algorithms with unprecedented detection quality, prediction accuracy, or navigation precision. Given the current dissimilation of related techniques in all sectors of our modern society, everyone can profit. The project is accompanied by a comprehensive education program incorporating 3D imaging principles in a curriculum for Chicago afterschool programs to introduce at-risk youth to basic concepts in optics, image processing, and electronics.<br/><br/>The focus of this research is to solve a long-standing problem in Computer Vision: high-resolution active 3D scanning of scenes cluttered with objects of mixed specularity and polluted by undesirable light contributions such as ambient illumination or strong inter-reflections. Existing approaches for this challenging task deliver rather sobering results or rely on large training datasets or other extensive prior knowledge, such as the geometry and reflectance of objects in the scene.

This project will reduce the number of tags per product, exponentially decrease waste, increase supply chain efficiency, and prevent knockoffs or counterfeits from being added to the supply chain. All of this will help businesses run more effectively, better serve customers, and enable consumers to gain detailed knowledge of their purchases.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is development of the first commercially viable, cradle-to-grave inventory tag through optimization and scalability tasks. The innovation is a chipless inventory tag with a unique serial number for every product to provide the cradle-to-grave functionality. The underlying Material Adjusted Signature Tag (MAST) technology uses printable materials to create a unique radio frequency (RF) signal. The MAST tags will enable direct printing or application of a tag onto a product, allowing an efficient way to reliably identify, track, and attribute data to a product throughout its life. This project will improve the tag?s data potential, optimize manufacturability, and achieve greater readability. Beyond optimization and scalability milestones, this project will test the tags, readers, and manufacturing equipment in relevant environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lessons learned during the COVID-19 crisis have helped educators rethink teaching practices that are sustainable and safe after the pandemic era. Offering hands-on engineering labs in off-campus settings has presented significant challenges to educators. By taking advantage of advances in cloud computing, implementing a remote hardware laboratory will allow students to experience a full-fledged remote experience without compromising what they could have learned and accomplished if they were physically present in the lab. This project will advance the potential of using remote laboratories for electrical and computer engineering students in embedded computing and wireless communications courses. The proposed work is expected to allow educators and institutions to rethink the delivery of hands-on engineering labs via a cost-effective, broadly accessible, and equitable solution. The complete remote lab solution, including hardware and software, has significance to underprivileged universities and K-12 education.<br/><br/>The project?s goal is to develop a remote computing and wireless communication laboratory based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and software defined radio (SDR) platforms; provide a full technical evaluation of remote solutions; and perform a comprehensive assessment of student learning and engagement in remote settings for these engineering technologies. The scope of the work is scalable, and the open-source hardware and software toolkit that will be developed can be deployed at other institutions, as well as K-12 and underserved community settings, to provide access to industry-grade hardware to all students. The sustainability plan includes a scalable solution that allows universities to pool their individual remote labs together to further increase access and decrease equipment costs and foster further collaboration among institutions by sharing resources and pedagogical content. The open-source remote labs will be disseminated via a highly modular repository (GitHub), and partnerships between schools will be encouraged to improve course materials, perform version control, pull requests, provide issue tracking, and use the course materials at their universities. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, this project will develop and perform feasibility testing of a novel, objective, and machine learning-driven approach to analyzing student handwriting proficiency, a measure of cognitive and motor skills. Through the use of a smart device application, end-users (teachers, aides, and parents) will be able to take a photo of a student's handwriting and receive immediate results regarding proficiency, handwriting error types, and targeted intervention suggestions. Given the myriad of visual motor, fine motor, and higher-order cognitive skills needed to generate a handwriting sample and the fact that up to 30% of students have difficulties, there is a need for new and better detection schemes. The identification of cognitive and motor skill deficiencies is becoming especially important with the increased use of virtual learning environments due to the COVID-19 crisis. Students are interfacing more with computers, and teachers have decreased access to handwriting assignments.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate highly accurate, rapid, and objective predictions of handwriting proficiency. These algorithms seek to predict the handwriting error sub-type. ML analysis of handwriting images has never been done before. Through the use of data annotation schemes, highly sensitive and grade-specific algorithms will be created and accessed by a smart device application following the acquisition of a single photo of a single handwritten sentence. This technology is envisioned as a universal screening tool to be used at the beginning of each school year to identify students with subpar handwriting proficiency. The real-time analysis of handwriting proficiency will allow for earlier identification and earlier interventions to improve student outcomes and deliver cost savings to school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The global market for advanced upper-limb prosthetics is expected to be valued at $0.87 billion in the year 2024. However, despite their high cost, patient satisfaction for these devices remains low. Current solutions do not provide reliable or intuitive control of robotic hands and arms while creating a burden on the prosthetist trying to provide patients with a comfortable and functional prostheses. The I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a nerve interfacing technology by testing the hypotheses around these customer and end-user needs, as well as the needs of other stakeholders in the ecosystem such as physicians, surgeons, occupational therapists, and insurers. Beyond this application, the customer discovery model can be used to validate similar products for other patient populations who need to control prosthetic, rehabilitative, or digital devices.

It further advances a field that is vital for the United States to maintain a productive and competitive workforce.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of the regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI). The proposed RPNI technology is built by grafting small muscles on the ends of severed nerve branches that reinnervate the grafts. This technique has three key benefits. First, the muscle grafts naturally amplify small nerve signals into large amplitude electromyography. Second, it reduces limb pain by preventing the formation of neuromas. Third, it allows us to use muscle as a biological cuff to implanting electrodes for a prosthetic interface. Control signals may be read from the nerve with higher functional specificity, strength, and stability than current technologies. This technique has been validated in rodent and primate models and is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial. Research has demonstrated intuitive control of individual finger and grasp movements without the need for frequent controller adjustments or recalibration.

It covers nearly two-thirds of the Earth's surface, contains approximately 75% of marine water by volume, and is home to about 55% of all marine microorganisms. Deep-sea microorganisms can play important roles in shaping global chemistry and climate, for example producing and consuming greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide). However, the microbiology of deep-sea waters is understudied relative to that of the surface ocean. Recent data suggests a much more diverse and active microbial community at depth than previously thought, but much remains to be known. For instance, recent estimates suggest that approximately 60% of the microbial species in the deep sea are novel. This project investigates the metabolic activity of deep-sea microorganisms, focusing on chemoautotrophy and the carbon cycle. Chemoautotrophy is a microbial metabolism in which inorganic carbon (e.g., carbon dioxide) is converted to sugar and biomass using chemical energy. This project uses several state-of-the-art sampling and analyses techniques to determine which species conduct chemoautotrophy (who?), what types of chemical energy support it (how?), and at what rate it occurs (how much?) throughout the deep sea. Answering these questions provides insight into deep-sea microbial ecology and quantitative data on the sources and sinks of carbon in deep waters. Results will advance our understanding of the ability of our oceans to sequester carbon over long timescales. This work benefits society through the implications of its findings for our ability to predict and mitigate climate change, as well as its educational mission, which includes training high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in interdisciplinary, climate-relevant science through one-on-one mentorship, hands-on coursework, and the initiation of an annual regional symposium featuring student research.  <br/><br/>This project investigates uncultured microorganisms' genetic potential and activity in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic oceanographic layers (200 to 4000 m water depth) to characterize deep-sea microbiology and address a discrepancy in the marine carbon cycle, namely, that respiration rates consistently exceed estimates of vertical inputs of carbon to the dark ocean. Chemoautotrophy may explain at least part of this discrepancy, but known types of chemoautotrophy (e.g., coupled to ammonia and nitrite oxidation) are insufficient to bridge the gap, suggesting novel chemoautotrophs and diverse coupled catabolisms. The overarching hypotheses are that (1) deep-sea microorganisms are more active than currently appreciated, (2) the organic carbon required to support this activity is provided, at least in part, by higher rates of endogenous inorganic carbon fixation, and (3) carbon fixation is performed by more phylogenetically and metabolically diverse chemoautotrophs/mixotrophs than currently known. This study uses high-pressure sampling containers during two deep-sea oceanographic expeditions, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and stable-isotope experiments coupled to single-cell isotope analyses via nanoSIMS to (1) quantify microbial anabolic activity in general and chemoautotrophy, mixotrophy, and heterotrophy specifically at bulk and single-cell levels, (2) characterize the diversity and distribution of genes and transcripts involved in chemoautotrophy and heterotrophy, (3) identify novel chemoautotrophs and mixotrophs and quantify their contribution to carbon cycling, and (4) investigate the ability of a major chemoautotrophic deep-sea lineage, the Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota, to utilize organic matter. The results have the potential to reveal novel functions in uncultured microbes and change our understanding of marine carbon cycling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many existing machine learning works focus on making predictions on observational data (e.g., chance of death or risk of heart attack) instead of providing actionable suggestions to physicians (e.g., when to use which drug for a specific patient). Developing actionable models for observational data is challenging in three aspects: 1) complex confounding factors that infect both treatment assignments and disease progression outcomes; 2) interpretability of treatment recommendation for actionable decision support; and 3) transferability of well-trained models to different environments. To address these challenges, the project will integrate deep learning algorithms and causal inference techniques to develop actionable methods for observational health data. The research team will closely collaborate with medical researchers and physicians for model validation on various clinical problems, and will actively seek technology transfer opportunities. The project will provide graduate and undergraduate students with new programs, courses, research, and internship opportunities on machine learning for healthcare applications. The project will also actively include underrepresented students and outreach to high schools and the general public.<br/><br/>The project will integrate deep learning algorithms and causal inference techniques for modeling longitudinal observational data and adjusting confounding factors, and develop actionable methods for observational data with two complementary tasks: individual treatment effects (ITEs), which estimate improvement in the outcome of taking a particular action to a particular target; and dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), which derive a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of intervention, based on evolving treatment and covariate history. In the first thrust, the research team will model time-varying and hidden confounders by recurrently modeling historical information in observational health data for estimating ITEs; the researchers will generate a personalized treatment timing recommendation with an uncertainty quantification that achieves optimal causal effects; they will provide interpretability of treatment recommendations through both variable and global perspectives. In the second thrust, the research team will remove the confounding bias in observational health data via patient resampling and balancing weights; the researchers will develop a deconfounding reinforcement learning model for DTR learning, which simultaneously considers short-term and long-term rewards; they will introduce a policy adaptation method to the proposed model to transfer the learned DTR policies to new-source datasets. The project will result in the dissemination of new methods and software for irregularly spaced time series to the broader machine learning and healthcare communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It poses a major obstacle to real-world applications from industrial automation to general-purpose household robots. This research will accelerate the deployment of adept and reliable robots from research settings to real-world environments. It will make fundamental contributions to transformative robotics technologies in practical applications, including manufacturing, healthcare, and home assistance.

The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities.  It is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments.  Conference outcomes have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation.  PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, or persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities or traumas.  The PETRA proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2022 Doctoral Consortium will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution.  Over the past 14 years, more than 300 graduate and undergraduate students from U.S. educational institutions have been able to benefit from NSF support of the PETRA Doctoral Consortia.<br/><br/>The goals of the Doctoral Consortium, which will consist of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference, are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  The special program organized for the students includes sessions between the doctoral students and the faculty mentors, in which the students will discuss their work and ask questions; the faculty mentors will provide constructive comments on the students' work and address their questions.  Each student will be asked to submit a report that provides feedback about the conference, regarding the benefits they received, which presentations they liked and why, and how certain papers and topics relate to their work. After they finish these reports, students will participate in small group breakout sessions to discuss them, and the faculty mentors will provide guidance on how to proceed for further journal publication.  Students will also have the option to submit a poster paper and to attend conference workshops on special topics.  Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own ivestigators and component of the work.<br/><br/>The Cape Basin in the southeast Atlantic is a global hotspot of eddy kinetic energy, fed by a leakage of waters from the subtropical Indian Ocean via the Agulhas Current. A proportion of warm and salty Agulhas waters is vigorously stirred and mixed into the cooler and fresher Atlantic by co-interacting rings and eddies. This project will address the hypothesis that a large proportion of the Indian Ocean waters that leak into the Atlantic is to be found in submesoscale (less than approximately 1 km) features generated by deformations of the mesoscale (tens to hundreds of km) flow field. The project will observe and characterize, for the first time, submesoscale features generated by mesoscale recirculations within the Cape Cauldron. The observations will be used to estimate Agulhas leakage fluxes with theoretical eddy diffusivity and eddy flux frameworks. The results will be related to new and existing satellite altimeter observations to infer variability in Agulhas leakage. Outreach and education activities include production of two short films aboard ship, student and intern visits to the ship, hands-on experience building ocean drifters at Miami high schools, and creation of a popular science article and an educational, oceanographic card game for school children.<br/><br/>This project will entail the collection of new observations within the Cape Basin of filamentation and eddy interaction to measure the related submesoscale features and estimate diffusivities.

The investigator will advance our understanding of BHs and NSs by studying their collisions in space. The violent collisions of BHs and NSs produce bursts of light that can be detected with telescopes, as well as gravitational waves (GWs) that can now be detected with special instruments like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Indeed, astronomers have very recently detected for the first time GWs and light from a neutron star merger named GW170817. This joint detection marked the beginning a new era of investigation: the era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. New research programs, like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), are further increasing the distances probed in the Universe and rate of discoveries. The investigator?s project capitalizes on this guaranteed stream of data, adding the unique perspective of a truly multi-wavelength (X-ray to radio) characterization of mergers of NSs and BHs. The investigator will work with high school teachers to develop curricular material on compact-object mergers, and to guide their students in research projects. Finally, the investigator?s group will work with visually impaired scientists and collaborate with professional musicians to translate astronomical measurements into sound to make multi-messenger astrophysics accessible to everybody and engage the wider public with an all-senses experience.<br/> <br/>The field of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics is in its infancy. After the first joint electromagnetic (EM)-GW detection, the research priority is to map the post-merger properties as constrained by the EM transients.

In doing so, this investigation will lead to the study of a population of NS mergers detected via GWs and light.

The new electrical materials are formulated to be less hazardous to humans and the environmental while also being compatible with more efficient manufacturing processes. Benefits of the proposed technology include faster charging rates of electric vehicles and reduced sizes of on-board batteries, which lowers the cost and environmental impact of electric vehicle manufacturing. Reduced costs will allow a broader population access to electric vehicles.

The 10-11 December 2021 tornado outbreak provides a unique and valuable opportunity to fill knowledge gaps by conducting both aerial and ground evaluations in forested areas damaged by strong tornadoes that passed over complex terrain. The primary objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics. The project team will conduct a high-resolution assessment of forest damage and terrain based on aerial imagery and ground surveys, and then develop a quantitative comparison of damage levels and tornado characteristics across terrain features using GIS tools, machine learning, and analytical vortex models. Results will inform simple engineering models to assess risk to the built and natural environment and will enhance general awareness of the threat of tornadoes in areas where the public may not recognize the dangers. <br/><br/>Existing research into the influence of terrain on tornado characteristics has substantial limitations, including a limited number of case studies, idealized simulation parameters, and inconclusive or contradictory results. A novel research approach will test the hypotheses that 1) tornado intensity decreases (increases) as the vortex moves uphill (downhill), 2) higher (lower) surface roughness leads to stronger (weaker) near-surface winds, and 3) terrain features can deflect the path of a tornado in predictable ways. This approach employs the structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetric range imaging technique to provide an extremely high-resolution characterization of both terrain and treefall at centimeter scales through the development of 2-D orthomosaics and 3-D point clouds that include information on the size, location, and disposition of hundreds of thousands of trees. The data collected here and the subsequent analyses will help the meteorological and engineering communities to move toward scientific consensus regarding the influence of terrain on tornadic circulations and will allow for new and more detailed research studies. Although large eddy simulation (LES) tests are beyond the scope of the work, the data collected here will also enable next-generation LES studies with far greater realism than has previously been possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes are known as a ?precursor? and indicate processes occurring that may trigger the larger energetic events. This project investigates precursor events to determine which can lead to these impactful events. Powerful solar flares and CMEs create major space weather impacts that cause diverse effects for human technology, including damage to satellites and power grid systems. The broader impacts of the project include understanding these important natural phenomena, training undergraduate students, supporting an early career researcher, and creation of tutorials for the public on science topics. <br/><br/>The science goal of the project is to establish the uniqueness and causal relationship of precursor transient activity to solar flares and CMEs in order to better understand magnetic reconnection and the subsequent initiation of solar energetic events. The objectives to meet this goal are (1) quantify the differences in temporal, spatial, and physical characteristics of precursors against similar phenomena during activity-quiet epochs, thus solidifying a statistical association and identifying physical uniqueness, and (2) investigate the magnetic connection between precursors and a subsequent event?s energy release and eruption dynamics, thus solidifying a causal relationship. To achieve these objectives the researchers will analyze ~1000 events and matched event-quiet controls (both flare-quiet epochs and CME-less flare events) in coordination with a newly-funded NASA effort (HGI#80NSSC21K0738). The pre-event signatures? temporal behavior, photospheric magnetic context, coronal dynamics, temperature and density will be investigated using high-order moment analysis of their photospheric vector magnetic field and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission applying Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis. Established statistical classifier codes and Bayesian counting statistics will be used to evaluate the differences between flare/CME-related precursors and transients from activity-quiet controls.

Yet, AI-based systems often make mistakes when facing scenarios that they have never seen before. For instance, one of the most critical issues with autonomous, self-driving cars is the inability to handle edge cases, causing accidents both with and without humans behind the steering wheel. The goals of this research are to build AI-based systems that harness external sources of knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia) to make more informed and thus more accurate decisions. In addition, the AI systems have a transparent decision-making process that human users can leverage to make accurate decisions or debug AI systems. With these goals in mind, the project will address three research questions on making AI-based systems. First, the system should be designed for addressing robust to new, edge cases in the complex, evolving real world. Second, the AI system should maximize user accuracy when humans are the end decision-makers. Finally,  systems should be built so human users can debug and understand the systems? decision-making process. Education and outreach activities of the project include a new Explainable AI course in Auburn University, an AI club in K-6 school, and collaboration with industry.<br/><br/>The project addresses the challenges in image classification frameworks that harness explicit visual and textual knowledge from external knowledgebases to make decisions. Towards this, the researchers will utilize large text corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) and image datasets as an external source of information for image classifiers to leverage (for instance, by comparing the input image with support images) and make better decisions. The research goal is to shift the paradigm of image classifiers from the existing parametric approach that relies only on an input image for the deep neural networks (DNNs) into a hybrid, semi-parametric, system that uses DNNs to process the input image but also iteratively searches in an image-text database. This paradigm shift will help improve the accuracy of decision-making for both the AI-based systems and human-AI teams. The information-retrieval-based approach to computer vision will make the decision-making process of AI-based systems: (a) be more robust to ill-posed image classification cases e.g., under occlusions; (b) inherently more understandable to users as humans can naturally interpret the support images or text retrieved by the systems; (c) it could also lead to more robust DNNs for image classification tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These collections house 106,028 individual plants from 25,335 genetically unique accessions representing 12,096 taxa (species, subspecies, and varieties) from 276 plant families and over 1,800 genera. Most notably, ABG maintains the most diverse living collection of orchids in the United States with 2,328 taxa. Data related to these diverse plant collections are currently stored in an in-house database and are not accessible by the public or researchers. The focus of this project is to upgrade data storage to a modern commercial database with a public interface allowing visitors, researchers, conservationists, and educators to search ABG plant collections remotely or while at the Garden. This project will make plant collections at the Atlanta Botanical Garden publicly accessible for research, education, and conservation.<br/><br/>Botanic gardens play a critical role in basic plant research by providing freshly collected plant material to researchers from extensive living plant collections for very low cost. In addition, a highly skilled staff of horticulturists maintain and preserve collections full-time. The Plant Collections at the Atlanta Botanical Garden have been used in NSF funded projects and many other research projects, including graduate student research, and for conservation projects. To increase visibility and use of the collections for research, this project will migrate the existing Plant Records database to an updated platform which will be connected to external databases, making collection data publicly searchable. Priority plant collections will be digitized and permanently planted priority collections will be mapped. Research requests will be streamlined via creation of a Google Form. This will enable collection information to be shared with the greater research community via outreach to professional botanical societies and on the Garden?s social media pages. We expect utilization of the collection to significantly increase, allowing creative and impactful research to be undertaken with plants in the collections. During public events showcasing the collections the public database interface will be promoted to encourage visitors to explore collections digitally both before, during, and after their visit to the Garden. Finally, undergraduate and high school students will be integrated into the digitization project, learning plant morphology and GIS mapping, which are useful and transferable skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Boulder County adopted voluntary wildfire mitigation in 2011 and spent considerable funds on educating the public about the risks of wildfires. The fire impacted regions with a mixture of older homes (e.g., Original town Superior) and modern homes (built within the last 10-20 years). There is a critical gap in knowledge on how to design, build, and maintain more resilient communities, while balancing the demands of the present with the climate and infrastructure demands of the future. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) collaborative project is led by structural, geotechnical, construction, and lifeline engineers, many of whom are cross-trained in social science and policy, to investigate damage patterns to physical infrastructure (buildings, foundations, and retaining structures), and the influence of that damage on decision-making processes for planning and reconstruction. More immediately, the results of this research will inform policies on building regulations in wildland urban interface (WUI) communities.<br/><br/>This research will quantify the impact of building characteristics (year built, building and faade materials, foundation type and characteristics, proximity of other homes, presence/condition of fences or decks, proximity to vegetation) on housing survivability and re-occupancy in wildfires within grassland landscapes. Using the damage patterns and mechanistic behavior of the homes and their various structural components along with understanding of heat transfer and fire spread within a community, the PIs will develop a methodology to quantify exposure temperatures and duration. This data will be used to develop heat maps of the City of Louisville as a method to portray fire intensity throughout the town. These maps can be used by future research teams for benchmarking fire simulations and empirically-designed or validated predictive models. The research will also characterize the jurisdictional reconstruction decision-making processes and tradeoffs in the early post-disaster reconstruction phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will study these questions by focusing on the complex dynamics of a shallow layer of fluid that is heated from below. Dynamical systems theory will be used to provide a view into these dynamics by exploiting recent advances in algorithms and the availability of large supercomputing resources.  This project will improve our understanding of the basic building blocks that compose chaotic fluid dynamics.

The project focusses on the chaotic convection of a shallow layer of fluid that is heated from below in a gravitational field.  This project builds an understanding of the fluid dynamics as a trajectory through a high-dimensional state space using the ideas of exact coherent structures and covariant Lyapunov vectors. Exact coherent structures are unstable and invariant solutions that provide a rigid skeleton in state space upon which the trajectory must navigate. The covariant Lyapunov vectors describe the growth or decay of small perturbations to the dynamics and quantify the unstable and stable manifolds of the dynamics.  These quantities will be used to build an understanding of the geometry of state space and to identify the building blocks of the fluid motion.  An important outcome will be the development of a statistical description of the dynamics based upon the gained insights. This project will provide important guidance for the development of theoretical ideas to describe a wide range of fluid systems, as well as other important large dissipative systems that are of  societal interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CO2 hydrates are ice-like solids, consisting of CO2 and water. Stable CO2 hydrates form at ~0 ?C, and at moderate pressures (~450 psi) from a mixture of CO2 and water. CO2 hydrates can be safely sequestered long-term via multiple options (under seabed, under permafrost, depleted gas fields). This I-Corps project targets eventual commercialization of CO2 hydrates-based carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Many commercialization partners exist among process industries, oil-gas industry, and utilities. A likely post-project scenario involves establishing a startup company as the commercialization vehicle (which develops sector-specific CCS solutions). Successful commercialization may lead to significant employment opportunities, and contribute to positioning the US as a leader in this field. Most importantly, it will augment the portfolio of technological and geoengineering solutions to tackle climate change. This project also will stimulate other applications of gas hydrates including desalination, gas separation and hydrogen storage.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology to rapidly form CO2 hydrates from a mixture of CO2 and water. Key technological challenges underlying artificial synthesis of hydrates have been very slow growth rates, and low conversion rates of gas to hydrates. State of the art technology to speed up hydrate formation includes the use of chemical promoters, which are expensive and environmentally friendly. The team at UT Austin has made several scientific discoveries and developed multiple novel approaches to speed up growth of hydrates, which may cumulatively speed up hydrate formation by an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art. Specific novel advancements integrated in the proposed technology include recently discovered hydrate nucleation promoters, a technique to enhance gas-liquid interfacial area and convection, and the use of high thermal conductivity materials to speed up heat transfer. Cumulatively, these advancements may enable rapid, on-demand CO2 hydrate production without the use of chemical promoters. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the integration of multiple fundamental advancements to realize rapid hydrate formation in reactor configurations commonly used by the chemicals processing industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oceanic internal lee waves have horizontal wavelengths between O(1?10) km that bridge mesoscale currents and smallscale turbulence and play a central role in the ocean?s energy cascade. Their generation exerts wave drag on balanced flow and extracts mesoscale energy, and their propagation transports this energy through wave-fluxes. When they break, they convert energy downscale to turbulent dissipation and mixing, maintaining ocean?s stratification and in turn contributing to the largescale circulation. This project will examine why observed dissipation in the deep ocean downstream from flow-topography interactions is smaller than predicted by the common assumption of equating lee-wave generation with dissipation. This research will determine the role of lee waves in dissipating versus redistributing energy for better parameterizations of wave drag and mixing for oceanic general circulation models. This project will support an early-career lead PI, a graduate and two undergraduate students to be trained on wave dynamics and ocean modeling.<br/> <br/>Regional numerical modeling with Process Study Ocean Model (PSOM) will simulate the generation, propagation, interaction and dissipation of lee waves in mean shear. PSOM is a non-hydrostatic ocean model that has been widely used to study submesoscale processes. The PIs will extend prior idealized simulations to explore a range of topographic variations to examine mechanisms that may suppress turbulence in the lee of flow-topography interactions. These mechanisms are: (i) nonlinear generation due to topographic blocking and splitting, (ii) reabsorption of lee-wave energy back to the sheared mean flow, (iii) remote dissipation in the form of free waves that escape the localized generating current, and (iv) downstream advection of lee-wave energy from localized generating topography. Among these mechanisms, reabsorption will occur for trapped lee waves in bottom-intensified currents, while nonlinear generation and downstream advection have a strong dependence on specific, as opposed to random, topographies. The primary analysis tool will be energy conservation budgets for different components (mean jet, lee waves, and free waves) to quantify the dissipative and non-dissipative fates of lee waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

COVID-19 has revealed the key role of  epidemiological models and testing in the fight against disease spreading. For any new virus or variant of the existing ones, society will always need to be able to expeditiously deploy strategies that allow efficient testing of populations and empower targeted interventions.  Group testing is a method that has recently attracted attention for efficient testing, as it allows to identify the infected individuals in a population with many fewer tests than the ones needed to test everyone individually. A main new observation in this project is that viral diseases like SARS-CoV-2 are governed by community spread, and taking into account (even partial) knowledge of  the community structure in an epidemics model (e.g., the distribution of students in classes of a school) can make such testing much more efficient and effective.<br/>Preliminary results indicate that it is possible to estimate the infection spread and evaluate the impact of interventions using a much smaller number of tests than  traditional techniques.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the goal of the project is to leverage community structure and epidemic dynamics to enable real-time estimation of infection and intervention with the following attributes: (i) it is robust to model uncertainties; (ii) it offers provable theoretical performance guarantees and (iii) it achieves low complexity of operation. To do so, the proposal combines tools from coding theory and control, and proceeds in two steps. First, assuming complete and perfect knowledge of the true underlying dynamical model, it derives test designs and intervention strategies, as well as fundamental bounds on the number of tests and amount of intervention, for both a static and state-estimation problem formulation. Building on this first step, the proposal then considers approximations to the dynamic models either because the exact dynamics are not perfectly known, or for complexity-reduction reasons. In particular, the proposal develops approximations on the evolution of marginal probabilities for popular epidemic models, derives and analyzes discretized models, explores the effect of parameter uncertainty and investigate decomposable community models; in all cases, the goal is to understand how these approximations provably affect the associated fundamental bounds, test designs, and intervention strategies to contain the disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Realizing the exponential advantage using only a quantum computer will potentially take decades of research as it needs a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer with thousands of qubits and long coherence time. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), as hybrid quantum and classical algorithms, have shown an exponential advantage over classical algorithms for various problems. Enhancing the security and reliability of bulk power systems can save billions of economic losses. To ensure power system reliability and security, transient stability simulation and contingency analysis are essential tasks that are executed very frequently (even in real time, i.e., a solution needs to be produced in less than one minute) at utilities and independent system operators. Transient stability simulation and contingency analysis for a large power system with many generators, transformers, and transmission lines are extremely challenging problems due to the very-high dimensionality. Existing tools based on classical computers have great difficulty in performing such contingency analysis for a large power system, especially when considering the simultaneous failure of multiple components. The difficulty is further complicated by the significant increase in dimensionality caused by the interdependency between power, gas, and communication systems and by the fact that a significant number of renewable generators are being integrated into power systems. Transient stability simulation and contingency analysis are essentially modeled as differential algebraic equations (DAEs) which also can represent many other engineering problems. In general, classical algorithms have an intractable computational burden for solving very-high-dimensional DAEs. This project proposes new VQAs to solve DAEs as a new paradigm. Broader impact activities include (a) disseminating research results to inspire the power and energy community to accelerate research and development in quantum computing for challenging engineering problems,  (b) curriculum enhancement on quantum computing and power systems at Alfred University, (c) involving students from underrepresented groups and undergraduates in research, and (d) educating the public and K-12 through outreach activities.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed work is to develop new VQAs that can efficiently solve time-dependent nonlinear differential equations for very-high-dimensional simulation problems (e.g., transient stability and N-k contingency analysis) of large-scale power systems with renewables, which will be the first of its kind. The approach is to: 1) develop VQAs for general time-dependent nonlinear differential equations, where two core components (variational ansatz and optimization algorithm) of a VQA will be comprehensively investigated, 2) develop Hamiltonian and quantum nonlinear processing unit (QNPU) for power system transient stability simulation, where QNPU is the third core component of the VQA, 3) develop VQAs for N-k contingency analysis of power systems with high-penetration renewables. When noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers with a few hundred qubits are available in several years, the VQAs developed from this project are expected to realize exponential advantage over pure classical algorithms to solve transient stability simulation and N-k contingency analysis problems of remarkable significance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving environmental sustainability is a generational problem that represents one of the most critical technological challenge of our time. Electricity generation (31%) and transportation (27%) are the largest contributors to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Wheeled ground vehicles, in turn, generate most of the transportation emissions and have an increasing impact on emissions from electricity generation. Solutions must address vehicle sustainability without unduly disrupting an industry that is central to the nation?s economic health and its citizens? lifestyles. The EVSTS Center engages the automotive industry?s critical stakeholders - vehicle manufacturers, component and system suppliers, fleet operators, ground transportation infrastructure providers, and state / local governments - in yielding transformational improvements in the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of ground vehicles. Scope of the work encompasses passenger cars, trucks, and motorized non-road equipment, as well as vehicle-level technologies and transportation system infrastructure, reflecting the complexity and global nature of the automotive and ground transportation industries.<br/><br/>The EVSTS center leverages collaborations among corporate, government, and academic partners to conduct and disseminate industry-relevant research on technologies and tools that facilitate the design, manufacture, deployment, and operation of energy efficient, environmentally sustainable ground vehicles.

The lack of transparent information throughout the supply chain has eroded the trust and value of many perishable products and the brands they represent. The proposed project addresses the current issue of tracking and traceability of food products in a trusted manner. Through the development of a hybrid blockchain that is sensor aware, all the parties involved in the distribution of the goods will ensure that the food quality is maintained by entering transactions into a secure blockchain. The result is two-fold: consumers will be assured that they are getting the right goods and suppliers can trust that their products are being delivered with quality. While initially focused on the $2 billion food transaction market, the commercial potential will expand to a broader range of products that require secure traceability including consumer goods, home delivery and medical products.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the core technology for the hybrid blockchain and test the functionality in a live commercial setting. The technology represents the first-in-class solution that leverages blockchain and DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) with integrated sensor and hybrid datasets to address the perishable nature of food products. The blockchain model will assume that a transaction is an event of data transfer and that there can be many disjointed events even on a small-scale supply chain network. For traceability, novel algorithms will be designed, making it feasible to connect disjointed events using geometry and a pseudo-Boolean function on top of a system that assigns a unique code. This implementation uses multivariate time series and node features for the meaningful aggregation and disaggregation of datasets, such as data collected by sensors and participating members. Putting such multivariate time series on the graph where participants are nodes with their pairwise relations as edges, the technology will address the novel optimization problem for efficient real-time monitoring and assist in providing further assurance of transaction integrity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will create new methodologies through which human materials scientists and AI will collaborate to discover optimal microstructural designs of such complex materials for targeted properties and performance. There are enormous opportunities and needs for innovating next-generation materials through performance-driven design and optimization of microstructures. The AI-driven design framework in this Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) project will pioneer these opportunities through fundamental breakthroughs in AI for the design and machine learning of complex physical processes and will have a high impact on the materials research community. The success of this project will lead to an AI-driven material microstructure design framework, resulting in significant speedup in the discovery process of complex materials, as well as reducing the cost and labor required for material innovation by saving unnecessary ?cut-and-try? experiments. The AI-driven design framework will be easily scalable and applicable to a broad range of complex materials, which will benefit the design and manufacturing of functional materials, polymers, composites, biomaterials, etc. By providing an accelerated discovery cycle and reduced costs, the design framework will benefit the US industry and, thereby, contribute to the safety, national security, and technological advancement of society.

The pandemic has also severely impacted visiting nurses, home care, day care, and other in-person eldercare services, and as a result many seniors have been left isolated with little or no interaction with the broader community, which often leads to mental and psychological disorders.  Because current nursing practices and systems have proven to be so vulnerable, those in need of such services would be better served if in-person eldercare could be supplemented by other means.

In turn, the project will prepare these professionals for the challenging task of serving as STEM educators in under-resourced urban communities. Project team members will foster a synergistic collaboration among university faculty, secondary-school educators, and community partners. In particular, the participants will be prepared in the pedagogical and cultural knowledge needed for effective teaching in underserved communities.

As a result, the project will contribute directly to the development of a skilled STEM workforce in the United States.<br/><br/>Based at Kutztown University (KU) in Pennsylvania, the project includes partnerships between the KU College of Education and College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Reading and Allentown School Districts, and community partners. The project has several guiding goals. First is to recruit, provide scholarships to, support the academic training of, generate teacher-certification for, and place in high-need local education agencies (LEAs) twenty-five (25) STEM professionals through the five-year duration of the project. The training and certification of professionals with STEM degrees will be via a one-year Master's of Education degree program. A second goal is to increase the demographic diversity of STEM teachers through this program. The third goal is to prepare STEM teachers to be capable of implementing culturally relevant approaches to STEM education through a community-based co-curricular program. A culminating goal is to provide sustained induction mentorship and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) workshops for the new teachers by engaging both education and STEM faculty in the process. This induction program will continue through the first two years of post-degree teaching. Project evaluation and research will assess the impact and merit of underlying components of the program on both the Noyce scholars and faculty members. In particular, the investigators and external evaluator will employ mixed-methods approaches to explore the values of: (1) STEM-faculty mentoring related to both content and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK); (2) an annual workshop on implementation of PCK by Noyce scholars in the STEM classroom; (3) education-faculty mentoring and co-curricular experiences on implementation of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in the classroom; and (4) the effects that mentoring Noyce scholars on PCK and CRP have on the STEM and education faculty mentors themselves.

Many water governance agencies and private landowners are planning and implementing these hybrid systems in the Greater New Orleans (GNO) area in response to flooding vulnerabilities and environmental changes. These infrastructure programs that blend natural and built features are some of the most significant investments in the United States. At present, however, a lack of performance standards, coordinated monitoring, regionally applicable modeling tools, and strategies to tailor such tools to new localities present important limitations for climate change adaptation efforts. For example, should new investments in drainage pumping systems factor in newly constructed green stormwater catchments in infrastructure plans? If so, what performance metrics can be developed to integrate these combined natural and engineered approaches?  Major investments in sustainable and natural infrastructure lack clear system definitions and scientific coordination across jurisdictions and projects. Indeed, few investments in hybrid infrastructure occur at the regional scale, and difficulties in blending and optimizing natural/traditional approaches persist. This project brings together regional water infrastructure authorities, scientific experts, and community organizations to assemble a full Sustainable Regional Systems Research Network (SRS-RN)  proposal to tackle these conjoined challenges of water governance and water science of hybrid infrastructure systems. The results of this planning grant, if successful, could lead to better methods of infrastructure improvement across the US. <br/><br/>The overarching objective of this planning process is the development of a novel transdisciplinary program to integrate regional scientific and infrastructure management activities and create standards, metrics, and tools of environmental monitoring, evaluation, and modeling for regions instituting hybrid water infrastructure systems. Scientific efforts related to water infrastructure will be developed relative to current and projected local environmental, social, and built environment conditions. This planning process presents an opportunity to develop an approach to regional water science that incorporates key disciplines (e.g., geomorphology, hydro-ecology, urban and regional planning, urban development, civil engineering, urban ecology) and provides a road map for diverse civic collaboration to accelerate equitable transitions towards regional sustainability. The planning process is comprised of a sequence of activities designed to foster broad community outreach and engagement with diverse participants and stakeholders, and for knowledge co-production amongst team members to ground partners in a shared understanding of how water infrastructure impacts the region. The project is pursued through five phases: 1) Network outreach, diversification, and engagement 2) Data collation workshops, 3) Field and site visits 4) Formation of environmental competency groups, and 5) Full proposal preparation.

When seawater freezes, the ice expels the salt so that the layer of ice is composed mostly of freshwater. Therefore, when the sea ice melts in summer, it creates a thin layer of freshwater that floats on the saltier seawater beneath it. Traditional oceanographic measurements rarely measure this fresh layer because ships typically collect data from a depth of about 5 m. Yet, these freshwater lenses may play a key role influencing the atmosphere-ocean exchange of gases, including carbon dioxide, the principal gas responsible for global warming and the loss of nearly half of the summertime sea ice coverage of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic Ocean is thought to absorb about 10% of the human emissions of carbon dioxide. Still, this number is highly uncertain, owing partly to the scarcity of observations at the very surface. This project aims to address that source of uncertainty by sampling the freshwater layer in the Beaufort Sea, both aboard a Research Vessel and on an autonomous surface platform called Wave Glider. We will compare the chemistry of the fresh layer to the saltier water just beneath it and use these data to correct estimates of carbon dioxide uptake for this previously-unmeasured impact across the entire portion of the Arctic that experiences seasonal sea ice melt, an area up to 2.5 times the size of Texas. Better estimates of ocean carbon uptake help us better understand the global carbon budget and monitor efforts to slow climate change. Project scientists will train a Ph.D. student and work with science communication experts at URI?s Metcalf Institute to engage journalists and public audiences in Arctic Ocean science through a webinar series.<br/><br/>Part 2:<br/>The Arctic Ocean takes up about 10% of the carbon dioxide that humans emit, which helps diminish the effects of climate change. However, our knowledge about the Arctic Ocean carbon sink is uncertain due to the number of observations and how they are collected. The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, leading to dramatic changes in sea ice cover. The fresher meltwater layer left behind by the retreating sea ice typically lasts for 1 to 5 weeks. It has different carbon dioxide levels than the water just a few meters deeper, where ships generally have sampled due to the locations of their water intakes. Because the uptake of carbon by the ocean is determined by the carbon dioxide levels right at the surface, this difference between the meltwater and what is typically sampled by ships requires a correction to these ship-based measurements. This correction will affect the carbon sink over an area of the seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean covering 0.35 to 1.75 million km2 (an area up to 2.5 times larger than Texas).<br/><br/>Carbon Levels at the Arctic Salinity?Stratified Sea Ice Edge (CLASSSIE) is a project to measure key carbon system parameters in the marginal ice zone of the Beaufort Sea. The project will collaborate with scientists funded by the NASA Physical Oceanography program in a project called Salinity and Stratification at the Sea Ice Edge (SASSIE). SASSIE will include measurements from a ship and autonomous surface vehicles called Wave Gliders. CLASSSIE will make carbon measurements in and under the meltwater layer from the ship and do the same from one of the Wave Gliders. From these measurements, CLASSSIE will determine a relationship between salinity and carbon dioxide levels for an ocean with meltwater input. Using that empirical relationship between salinity and carbon dioxide levels, a correction in the meltwater layer will be proposed and combined with meltwater layer statistics from a computer model to produce a modified map of Arctic Ocean carbon dioxide levels. Finally, a revised estimate of the Arctic Ocean carbon sink will be created with the modified map. Refining estimates of the Arctic Ocean carbon sink will help constrain the global carbon budget, which is crucial to monitoring climate change mitigation. The project will train a Ph.D. student. CLASSSIE will also work with the Metcalf Institute at URI to develop a four-part webinar series to engage journalists, public audiences, and interested researchers in Arctic Ocean science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning and will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through networks and partnerships. The project will support a postdoctoral fellow and facilitate summer research projects for undergraduate students. Results from the project will be disseminated broadly as the PI, postdoctoral scholar, and undergraduate students will present their results at national and international scientific meetings (e.g. the NSF SHINE Workshop), in colloquia and seminars, and in peer-reviewed journals. <br/><br/>One of the key results from the last decade of in-situ observations of interplanetary magnetic flux ropes at 1 AU is that the size distribution of large-scale CME flux ropes and the ubiquitous small-scale flux ropes in the slow solar wind apparently show two distinct populations while remote sensing observations indicate tremendous variation of coronal conditions during their formation. This work is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary investigation into the multi-scale nature of solar eruptive structures. The main Science Objectives are to determine: (1.) How solar and heliospheric magnetic flux rope properties vary over their range of their spatial and energy scales and how the local and global topologies of coronal source regions influence the reconnection formation mechanism(s) of eruptive transients and their resulting magnetic structure; (2.) The fundamental similarities and differences between streamer blob flux ropes, flare reconnection plasmoids, flux rope and quasi-flux rope eruptions from pseudostreamers, and classic, large-scale CMEs from streamer blowouts and stronger-field active regions; (3.) How each of these populations of flux rope transients interact with their overlying/adjacent flux systems, the open-closed field boundaries, and the ambient solar wind outflow. Each of the Science Objectives will be addressed with a combination of state-of-the-art, high-performance numerical modeling along with detailed analysis of multi-spacecraft remote sensing and in-situ observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project analyzes how protection is conceptualized across organizations, policies, and practice.  Project findings will translate beyond the sporting realm to enhance our understanding of how science and society intersect to shape dominant ways of knowing. This project will yield crucial insights into how protective policies enact a range of measures to safeguard selected notions of bodies through regulation, discipline, and/or exclusion. It will be of interest to athletes, coaches, policy makers, and administrators.<br/><br/>Focusing on the International Olympic Committee?s (IOC) consensus statement on relative energy deficiency in sport, or RED-S, as a case study, this project uses policy, bibliometric, and interview data to answer two central research questions: (1) how do scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved with RED-S research and policy-creation identify bodies as (not) needing protection? And (2) what types of solutions to RED-S are proposed by scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved with RED-S research and policy-creation? Drawing on theoretical insights from governmentality studies, the project contributes to larger discussions about the significance of social and/or biological dimensions in defining eligible bodies. This project produces further theoretical insights for science and technology scholars into rationales and strategies of governance that impact individuals, communities, and nations. Project findings will encourage transdisciplinary dialogue about how athlete?s bodies are regulated and policed, inside, and outside of sport, and inform future efforts to create inclusive and empathetic protective policies for athletes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DR affects almost 4 million people in the US and is associated with direct annual costs of almost $500 M. If diagnosed early, clinical treatment and lifestyle changes can halt the progression of the disease, preventing blindness. However, retinal exams currently require expensive equipment and invasive eye dilation that restrict screenings to ophthalmology or optometry practices, leading to the under-diagnosis of the condition, particularly in underserved populations.

The project at Fort Hays State University in Hays, Kansas, will recruit high-quality biology, chemistry, and physics majors and prepare and place them to teach in rural settings, which often represent spaces of education inequity. The prospective teachers will complete a one-year post-baccalaureate preparation program to teach in high-need districts. During the first two years of their teaching careers, they will receive mentoring and additional professional development training to help them continue to develop as effective teachers who are culturally responsive, resilient, and skilled at teaching in high-need rural schools. An important impetus of the project will be the development and testing of strategies to address the challenge of staffing high-need rural school settings with effective science teachers. This will enable high-need schools in western and central Kansas and other rural areas nationwide to provide their students a better science education. This, in turn, will help prepare many of these same students for the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This project at Fort Hays State University includes Kansas partnerships with Southwest Plains Regional Service Center at Sublette, Deerfield High School and Deerfield School District ? USD 216, and Dighton School District ? USD 482. This project aims to address rural STEM teacher workforce challenges and retention through a focus on the unique contexts of rurality and teaching STEM in rural settings. The project has four underlying goals. First, the project will recruit, provide scholarships, and prepare, through a post-baccalaureate program, thirty (30) STEM majors over the five-year duration of the project to obtain licensure to teach. A second goal is to place the newly licensed teachers in rural schools and implement an online induction (mentorship) program designed to assist in teacher retention. Third, project team members will engage in an iterative and formative feedback process aimed at continuous program improvement. The fourth goal is to explore various models and develop and disseminate a model for high-quality rural science teacher preparation. The theoretical basis behind exploring models and developing a rural model has three fundamental components - context, curriculum, and conveyance (Azano, et.al [2019,2021] and Schulte [2018]). Context will hold an emphasis on rural settings. Curriculum will include place-based pedagogies. Conveyance will feature in-person and online access to teacher preparation programs. Evaluation of the activities and strategies will utilize a mixed-methods approach and be performed by the Docking Institute of Public Affairs using process and outcome elements to advance understanding of effective STEM teacher preparation and retention for rural schools. The project team will take a multi-tiered approach to dissemination of program outcomes, findings, and features of rural science teacher preparation. In particular, dissemination will include presentations at state and national conferences along with publications in rural and teacher education journals. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different species often feature distinct communication strategies for the production and perception of acoustic social signals, and a comparative approach to the study of the neural mechanisms underlying acoustic communication can lend insight into general mechanisms of neural function. A major challenge in the study of acoustic communication is the segregation of information between human and nonhuman research as well as the isolated communities that focus on individual model systems. The NMAC is a new scientific meeting created to bring together a highly interdisciplinary group of researchers to better understand how the brain encodes and produces acoustic signals. This meeting will bring together outstanding senior and junior scientists for discussions of the recent advances in the field. The NMAC conference will help to reveal new principles concerning acoustic communication. Topics of this inaugural program include vocal development and learning, vocal interactions, auditory specializations, genomics, predictive coding, and cortical mechanisms of vocal production. The comparative approach that is at the heart of neuroethology, will facilitate the identification of common principles of brain organization and function that underlie acoustic communication. The results presented at the meeting will have the potential to guide future developments in multiple areas, including neural inspired design of engineered systems that will have considerable societal benefits. <br/><br/>The value of this meeting derives from its small size, which promotes interactions between participants, and the assembly of many top scientists whose research spans neurobiology, animal behavior and human clinical disorders. It spans a wide variety of experimental systems and focuses on areas of exceptional activity or promise. This combination leads to fruitful comparative analyses, raises new questions about underlying mechanisms and often leads to new collaborations. By maximizing both formal discussion and informal interactions, the NMAC will highlight exciting new developments in study of the communication processes that are essential for animal behavior and also lie at the heart of disorders. With respect to broader impacts, this meeting will benefit the larger community in multiple ways. First, it will help train and inspire the next generation of scientists, by exposing students and postdoctoral fellows to exciting science and scientists. Second, mentoring sessions, both formal and informal, as well as professional development sessions for junior researchers, will be organized for the benefit of junior researchers to help them make informed choices about scientific careers in academia and beyond. Finally, a concerted effort will be made to recruit scientists from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vaccine against the coronavirus has dramatically reduced the number of infected people, saving the lives of millions. However, although the vaccine has been proved to be highly effective, and its safety profile is satisfactory, in most countries there is still a relatively large percentage of people who are opposed, who endanger the entire population in their country as well as worldwide. Since COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to humans, it is essential to understand what causes this resistance and to find ways to increase vaccination rates. This research relies on previous works on terror management theory, as well as on insights from recent work on people's willingness to donate organs after death, to suggest psychological mechanisms that may explain people?s resistance to the vaccine, and to offer effective interventions to increase vaccination rates.<br/><br/>Given the necessity of getting more people vaccinated, understanding the reasons behind peoples? negative attitudes towards Covid vaccines and their reluctance to be vaccinated is of great importance. This research analyzes the multiple factors that may influence people?s attitudes toward the coronavirus and their decisions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or not. The study entails 11 experiments reflecting two research directions: The first (Part I) examines the influence of different descriptions of COVID-19 on people?s attitudes and willingness to be vaccinated. Manipulations to increase thoughts of life saving (rather than death) may override defense mechanisms that might create negative attitudes toward the vaccine, thus increasing willingness to vaccinate. Additional studies manipulate the status quo (making the decision not to vaccinate a deviation from the default) and examine the effect on risk perceptions and on increasing willingness to vaccinate. Part II of the studies focus on individual differences in fears and beliefs that are hypothesized to play a major role in people?s decisions about vaccination, including the fear of death, religious beliefs, belief in a just world and belief in tempting fate.<br/><br/>This project is being supported by a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Bi-national Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bioabsorbable magnesium implants are used in skeletal repairs and tissue reinforcement, but large implants corrode too rapidly and, as a result, also generate harmful hydrogen gas pockets. This problem limits the magnesium implants to small structures such as bone screws and coronary stents. Because corrosion can not be controlled adequately by existing manufacturing processes, magnesium and its alloys can not presently be used for full-size weight-bearing implant applications. To overcome these challenges, this research will help to understand and control the microstructural evolution during the implant manufacturing process and improve corrosion resistance by creating finer microstructures. The new process, called Severe Ultrasonic Melt Shearing (SUMS), will enable manufacturing of magnesium composite implants with refined microstructure and ultra-low uniform corrosion. The research will aid the adoption of magnesium in large-scale and small-scale applications for orthopedic, craniomaxillofacial, cardiovascular, ureteral, and esophageal implants. It also will have a direct impact on the field of metallurgy, which can use the SUMS process for production of high-quality, ultrafine-grained composites. Research activities will be integrated into new educational initiatives that promote advanced education about biometals manufacturing among students at all levels, with special attention to Hispanic students.<br/><br/>The SUMS process creates potential nucleating particles by dispersing oxide films into the melt that can initiate the nucleation events, resulting in the grain refinement. Simultaneous induction of intensive shearing and acoustic streaming in the melt is meant to disintegrate and thoroughly disperse the clusters of reinforcing nanoparticles, resulting in microstructure homogeneity and reduced melt segregation. The rectified diffusion of the dissolved gas in melt into the cavitation bubbles can de-gas the melt, resulting in the elimination of casting-induced defects related to gas porosity. The research team will develop integrated computational and experimental approaches to understand the dynamics of the SUMS process and provide insight into how to achieve high shearing and acoustic cavitation in the magnesium composite melt. The award supports fundamental research to understand the mechanisms of microstructural refinement, elucidate how microstructure can alter corrosion, and unravel the guiding principles of magnesium composite production with ultra-low uniform corrosion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, climate models continue to project a substantial weakening of the AMOC over the next century that could feed back on the climate system through reduced northward heat transport as well as reduced CO2 uptake in the North Atlantic. The specific role of the AMOC in the climate system has been difficult to determine due to a lack of long term measurements of its variability. At the end of its current phase, the RAPID-MOCHA observing system along 26.5N will have provided continuous estimates of the AMOC for just under 19 years, the longest full-depth, basinwide measurements of oceanic transport currently available. These observations have provided a critical benchmark for the evaluation of forced, data-assimilative, and coupled climate models, and have formed a fundamental building block around which international programs are being developed to monitor the AMOC throughout the Atlantic basin. This project will continue the U. S. contribution to RAPID-MOCHA for an additional 42 months, from January 2023 to June 2026, extending the time series of oceanic mass, heat, and freshwater transports to 22.3 years. The results from this program will continue to provide oceanic observations crucial for the assessment and improvement of forced, data-assimilative, and coupled climate models. The proposed program continues a successful collaborative effort between the P.I.'s and investigators from the U.K. National Oceanography Centre, who are submitting a companion proposal to maintain their part of the observing system for the same time period through U.K. funding sources. The program also collaborates with NOAA AOML in their Western Boundary Time Series program, and provides training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers<br/><br/>The U.S. contribution to the in-situ observation system includes: (1) Florida Current monitoring using a submarine cable, calibrated by regular cruises with hydrographic and velocity measurements, and (2) continuous moored time series measurements within the Deep Western Boundary Current and Antilles Current region east of the Bahamas, including hydrographic and velocity sections at approximately 11-month intervals. The maintenance of the repeat hydrographic sections will be conducted in collaboration with NOAA which also supports independently the Florida Current monitoring. U.K. collaborators will provide support for the eastern basin moorings that complete the 26.5N trans-basin time series observing system. Limited new instrumentations on moorings will also be included to derive ocean bottom pressure gradient on the boundary east of the Bahamas. The RAPID-MOCHA observations will allow the team to document and understand the causes and impacts of the AMOC interannual to decadal variability, to investigate the control of western boundary pressure on transports, and to link changes observed at 26.5N to other AMOC indices and results from on-going AMOC measurement programs around the Atlantic basin. By quantifying the interannual to decadal variability of the meridional circulations of mass, heat, and freshwater in the North Atlantic Ocean at 26.5N, this project will further contribute to the understanding of the processes leading to changes of sea surface temperature, air-sea fluxes, and ocean heat and freshwater storage that are integral components of the North Atlantic regional climate and global climate. The time series so far have shown a longer-term decline with respect to the early years of the program, the origin of which---natural variability or response to anthropogenic climate change---is yet to be determined from longer observations. The AMOC constitutes a relative rapid conduit between the atmosphere and the deep ocean that is crucial to continuously observe on climate-relevant temporal scales to understand the ramifications of anthropogenically-forced climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural infrastructure consisting of barrier islands, dunes, wetlands, mangroves, and reefs has been promoted to mitigate coastal flooding and erosion. However, the collective effectiveness of natural elements and how they work together with hard infrastructure as a hybrid system to provide flood risk reduction remain unknown. This project harnesses the unique hydrodynamic, eco-geomorphic, and geotechnical data collected from rapid field campaigns of Hurricanes Laura and Delta (2020) on the Louisiana Chenier Plain to fill this key knowledge gap. The research integrates morphodynamic modeling of coastal wetlands with field-based hydrodynamic, eco-geomorphic, and geotechnical measurements to assess and predict the performance of natural and hybrid infrastructure subject to hurricane impacts. The project will leverage existing outreach programs and regional partnerships to disseminate research results. The research team will share the modeling tools and new understanding developed with the coastal and geotechnical research communities, as well as practicing engineers and resource managers. The project provides unique opportunities to cross-train undergraduate and graduate students in both coastal and geotechnical engineering areas at two institutions and develop both field observation and numerical modeling skills.<br/><br/>Effective coastal hazard mitigation requires integrative field observations and numerical modeling to characterize dynamic coastal processes at appropriate space and time scales. This project integrates overland flow and morphodynamic modeling of coastal wetlands with hydrodynamic, geomorphic, ecological, and geotechnical measurements to transform our understanding of the response and recovery of natural and hybrid infrastructure impacted by hurricanes. The project harnesses the unique data collected during hurricanes to (i) advance the understanding of the spatiotemporal variation in overland flow, storm surge, and wave attenuation (flood protection) provided by hybrid infrastructure; (ii) evaluate the efficacy of numerical models to predict coastal erosion and sediment transport across a natural landscape; and (iii) explore the role of geotechnical properties, stratigraphy, and vegetation biomechanical properties in controlling the magnitude of shoreline retreat and vegetation uprooting by hurricanes. The comprehensive field, laboratory, and remote-sensing data collection, complemented by numerical modeling, will identify and evaluate root and soil properties and their roles in uprooting and erosion processes. The novel field testing will enable successful collection of observations that were previously challenging or impossible to quantify. It is anticipated that the integrative approach and modeling tools will be applicable to other coastlines for evaluating natural and hybrid infrastructure performance for coastal resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research to investigate the use of electrostatic levitation to overcome the near-field net attraction between nanolayers and to manufacture three-dimensional cofacially aligned nanolayers (3D-CAN) in a scalable manner. 3D-CAN architectures can produce many unmatched properties with broad applications for thermal insulation, signal tuning, catalysis, energy saving, and sensing, etc., with an opportunity to benefit the society with efficient manufacturing solutions, detection systems for healthcare, environment protection, and space exploration, etc. The research and education activities will be integrated through various mechanisms, such as integrating research with new certificate-offering coursework, hosting STEM Days and workshops for community college students, offering a SWE-Teas Research Expo to female undergraduates in collaboration with the Society of Women Engineers, as well as providing the Fun with Electronics events for K-8 minority students, all aiming at fostering a more diverse, domestic engineering workforce in US.<br/><br/>The ultimate research goal of this CAREER award is to understand and program the near-field interaction between nanolayers for the manufacturing of scalable 3D-CAN architectures. The team will apply corona discharging to induce quasi-permanent charges into nanolayers to actively program the electrostatic interaction between each nanolayer and further analyze and employ electrostatic levitation to produce 3D-CAN architectures. First, the near-field interaction mechanisms between nanolayers before and after corona-induced charging will be investigated using a surface force apparatus and by atomic force microscopy to establish force-distance profiles. Then, fundamentals in fabricating 3D-CAN at a lab scale will be studied by designing the charge distribution in multi-layer architectures of both ceramic and polymer nanofilms. In addition, manufacturing 3D-CAN, in a production scale, will be explored using an enzyme-assisted roll-to-roll method with power-of-two stacking of nanofilms. Further, the mechanical robustness of electrostatic-levitation enabled 3D-CAN and its capability of extreme thermal insulation will be evaluated with an environmental atomic force microscope and a modified transient plane source, respectively. Research outcomes are expected to expand the understanding, and thus, the capability of controlling near-field interactions between nanomaterials, which will provide a novel solution for efficiently manufacturing of large-scale 3D-CAN and potentially to many other ordered nano-architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project examines the number of stages that second language learners go through as they attempt to master a second language. The most influential contemporary theory holds that second language skill acquisition is a three-stage process: (i) from initial slow application of knowledge, (ii) through initial changes in behavior, (iii) to eventual fluent and automatic behavior. At present, there is indirect evidence that supports the existence of these three stages, yet the number and the nature of the stages have not been examined closely through targeted research. By newly establishing what stages language learners go through, and how many, this research can inform modern language teaching and assessment and empower more second language learners to reach high language proficiency. <br/><br/>To investigate the stages of second language acquisition, participants will learn and practice comprehending and producing a miniature version of a language until they reach high speed and accuracy ('automaticity'). Half the participants will receive explicit instruction about the vocabulary and grammar of the language before they engage in practice, whereas the other half will not receive prior instruction but will be passively exposed to vocabulary items and sentences of the language. These conditions mirror two broad contexts for natural language learning in the U.S., namely, teacher-led classroom learning and naturalistic language learning, respectively. Participants' data from comprehension and production practice will be analyzed using hidden Markov modeling, a novel method of cognitive modeling that will be used to test whether the three-stage acquisition model accounts for the data better than other models (for example, a two-stage model) do. Once the number of skill acquisition stages has been determined computationally, a regression analysis will investigate which of three sets of cognitive abilities - declarative memory, procedural memory, and psychomotor ability - predicts learning at each skill acquisition stage. Results of this study will directly serve a wide variety of second language learners (a) by revealing whether and how instructed and naturalistic learners attain automaticity and (b) by identifying what cognitive characteristics make one a successful learner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oceanic internal lee waves have horizontal wavelengths between O(1?10) km that bridge mesoscale currents and smallscale turbulence and play a central role in the ocean?s energy cascade. Their generation exerts wave drag on balanced flow and extracts mesoscale energy, and their propagation transports this energy through wave-fluxes. When they break, they convert energy downscale to turbulent dissipation and mixing, maintaining ocean?s stratification and in turn contributing to the largescale circulation. This project will examine why observed dissipation in the deep ocean downstream from flow-topography interactions is smaller than predicted by the common assumption of equating lee-wave generation with dissipation. This research will determine the role of lee waves in dissipating versus redistributing energy for better parameterizations of wave drag and mixing for oceanic general circulation models.

These mechanisms are: (i) nonlinear generation due to topographic blocking and splitting, (ii) reabsorption of lee-wave energy back to the sheared mean flow, (iii) remote dissipation in the form of free waves that escape the localized generating current, and (iv) downstream advection of lee-wave energy from localized generating topography. Among these mechanisms, reabsorption will occur for trapped lee waves in bottom-intensified currents, while nonlinear generation and downstream advection have a strong dependence on specific, as opposed to random, topographies.

The human mind has the affective and cognitive components. So does trust in automation, but affect is the primary determinant of trusting behavior. However, studies of affect on trust in automation are scarce. Therefore, it is critical to examine the role of affect in trust in automated vehicles. The overall objective of the project is to explore the role of affect in trust-based interaction in automated driving. In order to attain the overall objective, three integrated aims will be pursued, i.e., 1) build real-time trust prediction models using psychophysiological measures, 2) investigate the relations between affect and trust in automated vehicles, and 3) calibrate trust in automated vehicles using affect heuristics.  Once relevant psychophysiological measures are identified, they can be used to build real-time trust prediction models and once the relationships between the latent structure of affect in trust-based interaction and trust in AVs are identified and the real-time trust prediction model is built, affect can help build and calibrate driver trust in AVs using affect heuristics. Hence, the results from this research will promote the progress of science and national health (e.g., preventing crashes) by advancing our understanding of bidirectional trust-based interaction in automated driving and beyond.<br/> <br/>First, this research will build real-time trust prediction models using psychophysiological measures, which can overcome the limitations of previous research that mainly measured trust once at the end of a session or twice as pre- and post- levels of trust, which did not reflect the dynamic nature of trust in automation. Second, this research will investigate the relations between affect and trust in automated vehicles by examining the latent structure of affective responses related to trust in automated driving and how affective responses are related to different aspects of trust. Third, this research will examine the role of affect by making use of affect heuristic in automated driving measured by both self-reported and psychophysiological data. Such research endeavors will help understand the role of affect in trust in automated driving.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in temperature, pressure, or composition of the environment surrounding the protein, among many other factors, can have significant effects on enzyme catalyzed reactions. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. G. Andres Cisneros from the University of North Texas and Dr. Pengyu Ren from the University of Texas at Austin to develop computational methods and software to accurately predict the effects that charges in the surrounding solvent have on enzymatic catalysis. Detailed understandings for how enzymes function in highly charged solvents (ionic liquids) potentially lead to the development of new bio-inspired catalysts for biotechnology and bioengineering applications. The state-of-the-art computational methods from this project are used to investigate the reaction mechanisms of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in different charged solutions. Peroxidases are important enzymes that help prevent oxidative damage in aerobic organisms. The newly developed methods and source codes for programs are made freely available, which impact the ability of the scientific community to predict the behavior of enzymes in a variety of environments. In addition, the project engages school students and teachers from underrepresented minority groups in the sciences through various outreach and mentoring programs at the two participating institutions.<br/><br/>The main premise of this project is that differences in temperatures at which homologous enzymes show maximum activity arise from differences in the balance between enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energies of activation, even when these free energies are similar. This difference in enthalpic-entropic balance is due to differences in flexibility of surface residues. Alternatively, effects on the flexibility of surface residues from interactions with the solvent may exert long range-electrostatic effects on the active sites. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to apply quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to investigate the effect of highly charged ionic liquid (IL) solutions on the enthalpic-entropic balance for enzymatic catalysis. This project continues the development of the AMOEBA-IL (atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications in ionic liquids) force field and implements enhanced sampling methods in the QM/MM code of the LICHEM (Layered Interacting Chemical Models) package and its interface to TINKER-OpenMM molecular mechanics/dynamics sortware package. These tools are used to computationally model the reaction mechanism of horseradish peroxidase in different IL solutions.

Bioelectronic medicines are implanted devices that read and modulate the electrical activity of the body?s nervous system to treat diseases and conditions that are resistant to conventional therapy. Medical care with next generation bioelectronic medicine of size smaller than a grain of rice will be able to continuously monitor a patient?s state and autonomously deliver on-demand therapy to significantly reduce clinician burden, improve patient compliance, and reduce adverse drug reactions and abuse. However, current bioelectronic medicine relies on large, bulky devices that are highly invasive and use electronics that cannot sense weak neural signals and deliver stimulation therapy at the same time. To overcome these barriers and move toward this vision for next generation bioelectronic medicine, this project seeks to make key technological advances in circuit design to miniaturize bioelectronic medicine and enable simultaneous sensing and stimulation for closed-loop therapy.<br/><br/>This project will develop miniaturized peripheral nerve interfaces that can wirelessly record and stimulate at the same time to enable closed-loop experimentation. To do so, the proposed work will develop a new cross-domain simulation framework to enable accurate co-simulation of key physical parameters, such as wireless power harvesting and electrode properties, with integrated circuit design to optimize the design of microscale neural interface systems. Next, small-area, low-power circuit design techniques for neural stimulation and recording will be developed. The stimulation circuitry will guarantee chronically safe operation without off-chip components by adaptively monitoring and controlling the electrode interface. The recording circuitry will employ precisely-timed memoryless sampling to be resilient to saturating interference from neural stimulation. Lastly, the prototype nerve interface will be validated in a rodent model and be used to dynamically control a peripheral nerve as a proof-of-concept demonstration of closed-loop bioelectronic medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humankind is now on the verge of a second quantum revolution fueled by quantum information science (QIS), which is envisioned to enable disruptive communication, sensing, and computing applications. Despite the tremendous prospects promised by QIS, building large-scale and robust quantum information processing systems remains an outstanding challenge due to the fragility of quantum information in the present noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. To unlock the power of NISQ devices and systems, hybrid quantum-classical protocols have become a focus of recent QIS studies, in which state-of-the-art classical data science tools are leveraged to steer NISQ hardware towards solving specific data-processing problems. This CAREER project will develop a new photonic quantum machine-learning architecture that combines mature, classical machine-learning tools and NISQ platforms to endow unprecedented communication, sensing, and data processing capabilities. Compared with other NISQ platforms, quantum photonics feature room-temperature operations, mass productivity, and compatibility with the existing telecommunication and sensing infrastructures. The project will advance basic knowledge for the NISQ era and the interdisciplinary areas of QIS, machine learning, and NSF?s 10 Big Ideas Harnessing the Data Revolution and the Quantum Leap. A critical ingredient for a sustainable QIS ecosystem is to develop the next-generation quantum workforce. To this end, this CAREER project will encompass activities for: 1) QIS teaching laboratories for undergraduate students; 2) a QIS training program for industry workforce development; and 3) outreach to engage K-12 STEM students early in QIS.<br/><br/>The research activities of this CAREER project will encompass both: 1) a photonic quantum machine-learning architecture based on a classical machine-learning framework and photonic quantum information-processing hardware, including reconfigurable entanglement sources and adaptive quantum receivers; and 2) photonic quantum machine-learning applications for long-haul optical communications, multi-domain sensing, and quantum-enhanced data processing. The new photonic quantum machine-learning architecture will effectively use cutting-edge classical machine-learning tools to configure variational photonic quantum circuits, as a powerful means to generate, process, and measure quantum information. Although photons interact only weakly with each other to hinder the use of large-scale photonic entanglement, the proposed photonic quantum machine-learning architecture will overcome this barrier by leveraging quantum photonics that offer deterministic generation, the processing of large-scale entanglement, and suitability for sensing and communication applications. By combining enhancements from machine learning and quantum coherence, the expected project outcomes will enhance various sensing- and communication-related tasks, including pattern recognition, deep-space signal detection, and efficient data compression. Ultimately, broadly sharing the new knowledge grown out of these research activities should spark collaborations between academia, National Laboratories, and the U.S. healthcare, aerospace, environmental protection, and chemical engineering industries. By working with industrial partners, the CAREER project will connect with new quantum technologies that transform U.S. industries. The project research facilities and workforce development activities will help to prepare the U.S. technology industry workforce for the future quantum edge and establish comfortable and personally relevant quantum foundations for students across university to high-school settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are found worldwide in shallow marine environments such as tidal inlets and tidal banks. They are also found in some estuaries, submarine canyons, and deep shelf environments. They can be important to navigation and the design and placement of submarine cables, pipelines, and wind power generation facilities. For instance, the unintended exposure of a buried pipeline or cable due to the growth or migration of sand waves can cause catastrophic failure resulting in high costs and destructive ecological impacts. The dynamic migration of sand wave crests into shipping channels can render navigational charts inaccurate and be hazardous to shipping and small boats. This project will use models to study sediment transport in the Golden Gate sand waves, one of the earth?s most striking field of sand waves. The project Broader Impacts include an improved understanding of sand wave dynamics that will help inform sediment management in the region. The project would also support a graduate student.<br/><br/>The shape and dynamics of sand waves will be investigated through the integration of multiple existing high resolution field surveys of the Golden Gate sand waves and a calibrated numerical model that incorporates physical processes such as fluid dynamics and sediment transport in coastal regions.  The hydrodynamic forcing in the region is due mainly to tides and exhibits a powerful tidal jet due to the flow in and out of San Francisco Bay.  In combination with ocean waves this results in a complex and energetic sediment transport patterns and bedform morphodynamics. The goals of this project are to evaluate hypotheses to explain several perplexing observations found in various fields of sand waves worldwide, such as: the asymmetric shapes of individual sand waves and their relation to sand wave migration; the dynamics linking the tidal forcing and the orientation of individual sand wave crests; and the occasional appearance and disappearance of a new sand wave crest within a field of sand waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How cells deform to circulate through the body; how cells resist physical forces?like stretching or squeezing, and mechanical cues?like the stiffness of the cellular environment, are important for human health, and critical in many diseases. This project strives to understand the cellular ?mechanome?, or the set of genes, proteins, and pathways that regulate how cells sense and respond to physical and mechanical cues. Findings would enable us to address fundamental questions including: How do cells integrate mechanical and soluble cues to regulate their behaviors? The vision of the research is to establish new foundational knowledge of cells as materials, and to translate this knowledge to develop innovative engineering methods to ?grow? animal protein for foods. The research also includes initiatives to promote diversity in engineering and science research using food as a tool to strengthen mentorship and community.<br/><br/>The specific goals of the research are to (1) build a systems-level knowledge of how cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli and regulate their mechanical properties; and (2) test the hypothesis that the mechanical crosstalk between cells and scaffolds is critical for the sensory and nutrient properties of cultured meat. To build a unified knowledge of the mechanome, we will (i) investigate predicted mechanical regulators that emerged from our high throughput deformability screen; (ii) engineer a genome-wide screen to identify novel regulators of mechanical memory; and (iii) compile a mechanome web resource. To translate findings for food production, we aim to achieve efficient muscle tissue growth by (i) defining the optimal stiffness of edible microcarrier scaffolds for the myogenesis of livestock animal cells; and (ii) identifying combinations of scaffold stiffness and media additives to enhance satellite muscle cell proliferation and myotube contractility in a bioreactor context. Findings will enable the PI to address fundamental questions in mechanobiology with translational applications for protein production and tissue engineering.

Water masses entering the Weddell Gyre are modified as they move in a great circular route around the gyre margin and change through processes involving air-sea-cryosphere interactions as well as through ocean eddies that mix properties across the gyre boundaries. Some of the denser water masses exit the gyre through pathways along the northern boundary, and ultimately ventilate the global deep ocean as Antarctic Bottom Water. While in-situ and satellite observations, as well as computer modeling efforts, provide estimates of the large-scale average flow within the gyre, details of the smaller-scale, or ""mesoscale"" eddy flow remain elusive. The proposed research will quantify mixing due to mesoscale eddies within the Weddell Gyre, as well as the transport of incoming deep water from the northeast, thought to be a result of transient eddies. Since the Weddell Gyre produces source water for about 40% of Antarctic Bottom Water formation, understanding the dynamics in this region helps to identify causes of documented changes in global bottom waters. This in turn, will give insight into how climate change is affecting global oceans, through modification of dense polar waters and Antarctic Bottom Water characteristics. <br/><br/>This project aims to track 153 RAFOS-enabled Argo floats in the ice-covered regions of the Weddell Gyre. The resultant tracks along with all available Argo and earlier float data will be used to calculate Eulerian and Lagrangian means and eddy statistics for the Weddell Gyre. The study will link RAFOS tracks with Argo profiles under ice, allowing one to characterize the importance of eddies in water column modification at critical ice-edge boundaries and leads. With RAFOS tracks near the northeastern limit of the gyre, the project will investigate the eddy-driven processes of incoming Circumpolar Deep Water, to understand better the mechanisms and volume fluxes involved. Previous work shows that a large fraction of the mean circulation in the southern and western limits of the gyre, where it contacts the Antarctic continent, occurs in a narrow boundary layer above the slope. The research here will integrate this flow structure into a complete interior and boundary layer mean circulation synthesis. The findings and products from the proposed work will improve the positioning of Argo profiles in the polar regions, which would allow for more accurate climatological maps and derived quantities. Estimates of meso-scale mixing may serve as a foundation for the development of new parameterization schemes employed in climate models, as well as local and global ocean circulation models in polar regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current options are limited by cost, lack of supporting infrastructure (ports), and shipper interest. The vessel is designed to de-risk the supply chain with particular focus on underserved locations. The key technical innovations address a vulnerability of multi-hull sailing vessels - catastrophic capsizing - by providing a controlled submerging capability and a method to right a flipped vessel with the goal to be able to re-surface and continue a voyage. The surface system will use a pivoting mast for passive, real-time corrections.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project addresses the logistical and economic limitations of current systems that deliver supplies to remote locations. Rather than attempting to optimize the elements of the current delivery systems, the technology seeks to address island inaccessibility to large vessels, lack of cargo flexibility, increasing weather risks, and capital and operating economics by addressing the capsizing vulnerabilities of a surface sailing vessel and managing ballast system. Capsizing occurs when the center of gravity (CG) is higher than the center of buoyancy (CB). In mono-hull vessels, the keel is the primary design element that maintains this ratio.  Multi-hull designs introduce different challenges. Vessel surface control will be managed by a passive wing sail control system that provides real time corrections. Submerged performance will be managed by pumps and ballast for corrective action.

For many athletes, recovery, and training management are continuous processes that takes place daily and encompasses multiple processes such as training, sleep, and nutrition. Lack of proper load management and recovery may cause increased levels of stress hormones in the body and affect the athlete?s ability to perform at a high level. To provide holistic insight into recovery and health, continuous aggregation of multimodal information paired with a powerful analytics backend is an essential aspect of wearable devices. Many competitors in the market focus on limited sensing modalities and application locations. Additionally, these devices do not provide users with continuous measurement capabilities and need to be recharged periodically, leaving gaps in data, and reducing the accuracy of insights provided by data analytics. The proposed system addresses these problems by bridging the gaps between high-fidelity and long-term sensing capabilities. The proposed device enables sensing modalities such as sub-millikelvin resolution temperature, muscular strain, bioimpedance, PPG, ECG, movement, and sweat rate in to provide holistic insight into health parameters relevant to sports performance and recovery.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new class of wearable devices called biosymbiotic devices that do not require recharging utilizing power casting technology and pre-existing commercial scalable fabrication techniques. The devices feature the first demonstration of a wireless and battery-free wearable device that may operate at long distances, is completely customized to the user, and is able to collect clinical-grade fidelity biosignals indefinitely. The devices utilize advances in electronics, materials, electromagnetics, and electromechanics to create an ultra-lightweight, conformal system that features multimodal sensors and wearability that is virtually imperceptible to the user, enabling long-term and continuous collection capabilities. Through this project, the goal is to establish product adoption criteria and validate commercialization plans through customer discovery. Specifically, the team will investigate a device configuration geared towards the target market of prosumer and professional sports athletes that want to optimize training and recovery through unique insight into their physiology. Additionally, the plan is to integrate sensing capabilities into the system while developing user-friendly performance analytics algorithms and interfaces to deliver these analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The high-volume manufacturing of ICs is one of the world?s most economically important industrial activities, enabling data communication, information technology, medical diagnostics, and transportation. The project will improve semiconductor lithography, the process of printing the circuit patterns onto silicon chips during production.  This is the most critical and capital-intensive step in high-volume manufacturing of advanced ICs. The printing of smaller features to allow for more transistors per chip depends strongly on better light sources.  Improvements in the efficiency and power of these light sources will improve the productivity and cost of lithography tools, reducing the fabrication cost of advanced ICs. <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to improve the efficiency in the machines used in EUV lithography, a new projection lithography technique that uses dramatically shorter wavelength light. EUV lithography entered high volume manufacturing in 2019 after 3 decades of development. In advanced lithography machines, EUV light is produced by laser heating of liquid tin micro-droplets from which highly charged tin ions emit the EUV radiation at wavelengths near 13.5 nm.  While the EUV light power presently achievable from laser-created plasmas is sufficient to initiate high volume manufacturing of a new generation of more powerful ICs, significantly higher EUV power is still required for high-throughput and cost-effective manufacturing. An increased understanding and control of the micro-droplet plasma evolution in EUV lithography sources can potentially increase their EUV conversion efficiency and average power. Taking advantage of previous work conducted at CSU, the plan is to demonstrate the technology and methodology to image the evolution of the tin targets plasmas using an EUV laser probe to benchmark models. The EUV probe can penetrate regions of the plasma inaccessible to visible laser probes and detect concentration of neutral atom invisible to visible light, gaining the understanding necessary to improve the printing of the most advanced semiconductor circuits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PFAS contamination is a significant global problem, and it is estimated that 97% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. The resultant human and animal health implications include immunological, reproductive, developmental, hepatic, hormonal, and carcinogenic diseases. Currently, the removal of PFAS in drinking water resources is a major focus of the federal government and among many state governments.

UV emitters have a wide range of applications in airborne and surface disinfection, bio-medical and analytical instrumentation, fluorescence sensing, curing, and phototherapy. The traditional sources of UV lamps contain either mercury, xenon, argon, deuterium, or an excimer. All are considered unsatisfactory as they are bulky, fragile, expensive, low efficiency, have a limited life span, toxic, and only capable of emitting at a few specific wavelengths. Another alternative is the UV LED, which combines compactness with a nontoxic material composition, a lower power consumption, a quick response time, a long lifetime, and tunable emission across the entire UV region. Additionally, the nanowire form factor is ideal for integrating the light-emitter within the filter fabric for enhancing antibacterial and particulate filtration in air/surface purification and disinfection systems. Broad benefits to society including the new technologies, socioeconomic and environmental impacts as well as commercial potential are expected for such nanowire emitters.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of high-performance narrow band UV LEDs for airborne and surface disinfection. The disinfection UV LED technology aims at inactivating the spreading of microorganisms living in indoor spaces otherwise people are at risk of infection. The current common disinfectants include chemical sprays and hand and body washing. These approaches fail to kill viruses, bacteria, fungi, and microbes in real time. The chemical substances usually contain contaminants and raise health concerns. Disinfection UVC LEDs, however, are a rapid tool for inactivation, and environmentally friendly. The narrow band UVC LEDs are produced using the following steps: 1) synthesizing nanowire UVC LED structures using molecular beam epitaxy; 2) integrating optical bandpass filters into the LEDs to attain narrow band LEDs; and 3) combining nanowire UVC LEDs with current white-light LEDs to form a smart disinfection lighting-system.

Natural sources of Pb are derived from the Earth?s crust and are delivered to the ocean by glacial erosion and aerosol inputs. Lead is produced by radioactive decay and has three stable isotopes that are derived from the decay of uranium and thorium. Thus, distinct lead isotope ratios are seen in deposits from source rocks of different ages. These isotope ratios make it possible to distinguish whether pollutant lead in the ocean is derived from American, Australian, European, and Chinese sources. Isotope measurements of Pb provide information about temporal changes in the global transport of pollutants by atmospheric aerosols and the distribution of contaminants and other elements by ocean circulation and particulate transport. In this project, water samples will be collected from the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean to help establish the origins of anthropogenic lead in this ocean region, distinguish it from natural lead from the Antarctic continent, and understand the dispersal of Pb by ocean circulation.

The most problematic source of noise for a wide variety of quantum devices is produced by so-called two-level tunneling states (TLSs). While not well understood, TLSs are ubiquitous?appearing in crystals, on surfaces, and within disordered materials?and the noise they produce is more acute at the low temperatures required for the operation of many quantum technologies. The proposed research aims to leverage the strong interaction between TLSs and sound waves to develop new techniques to control and reduce this vexing source of noise. Key objectives involve engineering devices: (1) to shape how sound impacts quantum device performance through device geometry, and (2) to show how noise in quantum devices can be controlled through the active transduction of mechanical waves. This project explores the ability to drastically reduce the noise produced by TLS and shed light on the?currently unknown?microscopic origin of TLSs, toward practical applications of quantum technology. Through paid undergraduate research opportunities, new curricula on light-matter interactions, and quantum science themed outreach, the proposed educational objectives aim to address the workforce needs of Arizona?s burgeoning technology sector.<br/><br/>This project aims to demonstrate control of noise produced by two-level tunneling states (TLSs) through the manipulation of phononic degrees of freedom and to show how this control can be used to improve the performance of quantum devices. To achieve these objectives, electronic, phononic and photonic devices will be created: (1) from highly confined membranes, waveguides and resonators that alter and control the phonon density of states, predicted to drastically alter and reshape the spectrum of TLS noise, and (2) where light can be harnessed to transduce large amplitude mechanical waves, expected to reduce noise by ?saturating? TLS losses. Pulse sequence measurements, microwave spectroscopy and a new form of pump-probe phonon spectroscopy will connect device performance with phonon manipulation. Whereas, detailed theory-experiment comparison will elucidate the impact of phonon confinement and transduction on various noise and dissipation mechanisms produced by TLS, e.g., in the form of the temperature dependence of the mechanical quality factor.  This project will show (1) how TLS noise can be altered in an array of highly confined structures, (2) how phonons can be used to control TLS noise in the microwave domain, and (3) how phonons can be leveraged to improve quantum device performance for the first time. Together, these results are expected to establish that phonon manipulation can extend lifetimes of electromagnetic quantum states within superconducting qubits and may pave the way for practical forms of quantum computing and ultra-sensitive detectors of forces, rotation, magnetic fields and displacement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The DLT tool developed here advances blockchain protocols, specifically for removing quadratic and speculative costs from orthodox protocol-based approaches to blockchains on conventional hardware and instituting linearizable and constant costs with other innovative programming methods (e.g., probabilistic pruning). New statistical, topological, and computational approaches will be researched and developed for these purposes, including for development of techniques applicable for machine learning, artificial intelligence, peta-scale and exa-scale computing, advanced scientific computing, and pedagogical academic development of future generations. The expected results include a new set of protocols and a unified tool for integrating data types and multiple networks into conventional data warehouses, especially for advancement of data warehouses struggling to keep pace with new blockchain data, metadata, and real-time analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this great potential, however, there are several practical and theoretical hurdles that must be overcome before this technology can see wide-scale adoption.  Towards overcoming these challenges, this project has four primary high-level goals: (1) to reduce the complexity of current quantum cryptographic systems (especially for the end-user, which can translate to potential cost effective implementations); (2) to increase the efficiency and noise tolerance of quantum communication protocols; (3) to broaden the range of cryptographic applications for which quantum resources may be used; and (4) to increase understanding of the foundations of quantum secure communication.  This project also has an extensive educational component, providing new opportunities for undergraduate students to become involved in quantum cryptographic research, while also developing new educational material to instruct early undergraduates, and the general public, in the theory and use of quantum communication and cryptography.  Such knowledge will be vital to the future workforce, and to future researchers.<br/><br/>This project's ultimate goal is to advance the understanding of the theoretical foundations of quantum cryptography, while also advancing capabilities within this field.  Through the use of a hybrid classical and quantum approach, the PI will develop a novel security analysis framework based on a new class of entropic uncertainty relation, relying on both classical and quantum methods.  Such a framework will be immediately applicable to various ""weakly-quantum"" protocols which have device restrictions placed on users; it will also be broadly applicable to general quantum cryptography and quantum information theory research.  The PI will also harness the power of classical and quantum communication to develop new adaptive countermeasures to improve the security and performance of current quantum cryptographic protocols.  Finally, new quantum cryptographic primitives beyond key distribution will be developed, broadening the range of applications that quantum resources may be applied towards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This power generation will utilize a process called Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) - a process that uses natural solar plasma produced by the Sun to provide electrical power. This technology will benefit society by allowing spacecraft and satellites to function more efficiently for longer periods of time. MHD generation also provides environmental benefits since it utilizes no hazardous materials and reduces the amount of fuel needed for launch, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. This project will also introduce a new type of ion funnel that is highly efficient and portable that can also be used in medical ion spectroscopy, resulting in reduced costs for this equipment and improved portability. The compact, high-density electromagnets developed can also be used to improve efficiency and power capability in many industrial and power system applications.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of providing electrical power generation for spacecraft that can meet the demands for producing large amounts of electrical power while reducing payload launch mass requirements.

Modeling solar wind plasma conditions based on data from various space probes indicates that conditions of ion flux and plasma conductivity are conducive to support MHD power generation.  This research will answer the question of whether high-energy solar wind plasma can be harvested by MHD generation and unlock energy that is available.

Natural infrastructure consisting of barrier islands, dunes, wetlands, mangroves, and reefs has been promoted to mitigate coastal flooding and erosion. However, the collective effectiveness of natural elements and how they work together with hard infrastructure as a hybrid system to provide flood risk reduction remain unknown. This project harnesses the unique hydrodynamic, eco-geomorphic, and geotechnical data collected from rapid field campaigns of Hurricanes Laura and Delta (2020) on the Louisiana Chenier Plain to fill this key knowledge gap. The research integrates morphodynamic modeling of coastal wetlands with field-based hydrodynamic, eco-geomorphic, and geotechnical measurements to assess and predict the performance of natural and hybrid infrastructure subject to hurricane impacts. The project will leverage existing outreach programs and regional partnerships to disseminate research results. The research team will share the modeling tools and new understanding developed with the coastal and geotechnical research communities, as well as practicing engineers and resource managers. The project provides unique opportunities to cross-train undergraduate and graduate students in both coastal and geotechnical engineering areas at two institutions and develop both field observation and numerical modeling skills.<br/><br/>Effective coastal hazard mitigation requires integrative field observations and numerical modeling to characterize dynamic coastal processes at appropriate space and time scales. This project integrates overland flow and morphodynamic modeling of coastal wetlands with hydrodynamic, geomorphic, ecological, and geotechnical measurements to transform our understanding of the response and recovery of natural and hybrid infrastructure impacted by hurricanes. The project harnesses the unique data collected during hurricanes to (i) advance the understanding of the spatiotemporal variation in overland flow, storm surge, and wave attenuation (flood protection) provided by hybrid infrastructure; (ii) evaluate the efficacy of numerical models to predict coastal erosion and sediment transport across a natural landscape; and (iii) explore the role of geotechnical properties, stratigraphy, and vegetation biomechanical properties in controlling the magnitude of shoreline retreat and vegetation uprooting by hurricanes. The comprehensive field, laboratory, and remote-sensing data collection, complemented by numerical modeling, will identify and evaluate root and soil properties and their roles in uprooting and erosion processes. The novel field testing will enable successful collection of observations that were previously challenging or impossible to quantify.

Catalysis has long served as a critical industrial and environmental technology for facilitating the efficient and targeted conversion of raw materials to fuels and chemical products, while also remediating waste products and pollutants.  In recent years, catalysis research has shifted strongly to opportunities for facilitating sustainable supplies of food, energy, and water, while also mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases.  To those ends, the Catalysis GRC will bring together prominent catalysis researchers to share the latest advances in catalysis research while also facilitating generational transfer of knowledge and collaborative opportunities between senior leaders and newer entrants to the field.<br/>  <br/>Specifically, the conference will focus on the dissemination of knowledge by a wide variety of scientists to explore how precise synthesis of materials, advanced characterization techniques, detailed kinetics, and advances in theory combine to create new understanding in catalysis as applied to global challenges in energy and the environment.  The meeting goals will be met through four key approaches: (1) a strong scientific program focused on the meeting theme, ""Advancing Sustainable Technologies through Catalysis""; (2) participation by a diverse group of speakers, including junior investigators and senior thought-leaders, representatives of industry, academia and national labs, as well as graduate students and postdoctoral researchers; (3) cross-disciplinary fertilization of ideas in catalysis and sustainability, by exploring common themes related to alternative energy sources and renewable or sustainable feedstocks; and (4) fostering a sense of community by promoting interactions between prominent senior investigators in the field and young scientists, underrepresented minority scientists, and junior faculty.  The Catalysis GRC has seen steady advances in recent years toward promoting diversity in all forms.  The 2022 GRC will continue and expand that trend with particular emphasis on promoting opportunities for women in catalysis.

The proposed platform will contribute to bridging the gap between the promised and actual impact of lab-on- a-chip technologies in fields like biology and chemistry. Devices fabricated using the new platform will be the centerpiece of laboratory kits that utilize microfluidics to apply scientific and engineering concepts at the high school and college levels.

Unpowered mechanical devices are already used for performance enhancement -- a person can travel much farther and faster on a bicycle than they can on foot. However, the exoskeletons considered in this project go beyond such familiar passive devices by integrating actively controlled energy storage, in the form of springs of controllable stiffness. The scientific contribution of this research is a theoretical framework for mechanically adaptive energetically passive robotics where the amount of energy stored in a spring of controllable stiffness can be decoupled from the deformation of the spring. This new capability could enable unprecedented human and robot mobility. As an example, a person jumping on a conventional spring trampoline can build up energy for a desired high leap by making a series of jumps of successively increasing height. In contrast, a controllable-spring robot limb could allow the necessary energy for the target leap to be accumulated over a series of fixed-depth squats, instead of jumps, which can be safer and more desirable. The project will have significant societal impacts by facilitating the creation of novel assistive devices for the elderly, performance-augmenting exoskeletons for emergency responders, and legged alternatives to bicycles for efficient unpowered transportation. The project will promote a new engineering curriculum emphasizing controlled energy storage and release in unpowered mechanical systems. Outreach activities will include public exhibits of prototypes and knowledge-based journalism about novel devices used for human augmentation and transportation.<br/><br/>The focus of this research is a new modeling and design framework for the analysis and creation of mechanically adaptive, energetically passive robots. A key component of these robots is the integration of mechanically adaptive compliant structures, referred to as programmable springs. Programmable springs are a new class of mechanical elements that combine the benefit of levers and springs, with the key feature that enables near-zero energy cost mechanical adaptation, irrespective of the energy stored in the spring. The specific project goals are to (i) formulate a comprehensive model of robot limbs using programmable springs; (ii) define a resonance-based control method robots and humans could use to leverage the benefits of programmable springs, for example, optimally accumulate energy through multiple squats and steps despite limited limb force and limited limb motion; and (iii) establish the physical limits of legged transportation by consolidating the trade-off between performance and user-comfort similar to wheeled transportation. The results will enable levels of human mobility enhancement unprecedented in unpowered devices.

Natural sources of Pb are derived from the Earth?s crust and are delivered to the ocean by glacial erosion and aerosol inputs. Lead is produced by radioactive decay and has three stable isotopes that are derived from the decay of uranium and thorium. Thus, distinct lead isotope ratios are seen in deposits from source rocks of different ages. These isotope ratios make it possible to distinguish whether pollutant lead in the ocean is derived from American, Australian, European, and Chinese sources. Isotope measurements of Pb provide information about temporal changes in the global transport of pollutants by atmospheric aerosols and the distribution of contaminants and other elements by ocean circulation and particulate transport. In this project, water samples will be collected from the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean to help establish the origins of anthropogenic lead in this ocean region, distinguish it from natural lead from the Antarctic continent, and understand the dispersal of Pb by ocean circulation. The project will support one graduate student and one early career postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>The proposed work will be carried out as part of the GEOTRACES trace element and isotope sampling expedition to the South Pacific and Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The measurement of Pb isotopes during these expeditions will provide the ability to trace the source, fate, and transport of other particle-reactive metals in the ocean. Water column, sediment core top and aerosol samples will be analyzed for the full suite of Pb isotopes (204, 206, 207, 208) to provide insights into the extent of anthropogenic Pb contamination in the water column, the relative contribution of different lead isotopes from the South American continent, significance of hydrothermal Pb input from Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and whether sediment Pb isotopes reflect variation in the atmospheric circulation pattern.

Mantle thermal convection is due to density differences arising from differences in chemical composition, mineral structure (phase), and temperature. The primary driving force for convection arises from gravitational sinking of cold, and therefore dense, tectonic plates within subduction zones. It has previously been proposed that within the sinking tectonic plate (called subducting slab), the cold temperature can delay the normal changes in mineral structure that occur with increasing pressure.  This causes the plate to be less dense than expected based on temperature alone. It has also been proposed that this less dense region - called a metastable olivine wedge - is necessary to trigger earthquakes that occur at depths of > 400 km.  These earthquakes are referred to as deep earthquakes. However, it is still unknown whether metastable olivine exists in all slabs where deep earthquakes are observed.  There are also other possible mechanisms that may trigger deep earthquakes. Here, the researchers use state-of-the-art numerical simulations to test how the presence of metastable olivine affects subducting-slab dynamics. They integrate in the modeling various experimental and observational parameters and test different scenarios. They compare the model outputs with observations in existing subducting slabs around the Globe.  Results of this study directly inform potential origins of the different slab dynamics and that of deep earthquakes.  The new improved computational codes are shared with a scientific community.  The project has strong implications for the understanding the dynamics of subduction zones, at the origin of the largest earthquakes threatening human societies. The project also provides support and training for several graduate and undergraduate students at University of California - Davis.<br/><br/>One of the biggest outstanding questions of mantle dynamics is why some slabs appear to stagnate in or below the transition zone, while others appear to sink directly into the lower mantle. The answer is related to phase transitions and trench motion, but it is unclear how these feedback with other material properties and larger-scale mantle flow to generate the apparent variability in slab behavior. This project tests the role of a metastable olivine wedge (MOW) in subduction dynamics and its potential to serve as a source for deep earthquakes. The team first overcome several simplifications of previous models through integration of HeFESTo for equilibrium phase transitions - including density and latent-heat effects, and a grain-size and water-dependent metastable olivine transformation (MOT) model- into a fully dynamic subduction simulations with a visco-plastic rheology including Peierls creep. The simulations run in the software Aspect. 2D models test how slabs with different ages and rates of subduction (controlled by the plate boundary shear zone; PBSZ) lead to different subduction dynamics. Observations of slab morphology together with plate and trench motion are compared to model output to constrain uncertainty in parameters including PBSZ viscosity, the gradient of viscosity into the lower mantle, and the water content of the slab. In addition, the researchers compare the distribution of the MOW and its overlap with strongly deforming regions of the slab; the aim is to predict the expected pattern of seismicity. This pattern is compared to observations and analyzed accounting for the thermal structure of the slab (e.g., is the pattern indicative of warm versus cold slabs). The team uses 3D models to quantify the impact of trench width together with along-strike variation in subducting plate age and PBSZ properties. While these are generic models, the initial conditions are chosen to represent three different subduction zones: Japan-Izu-Bonin, Tonga-Kermadec and South America. Using the observations of MOW extent in Japan, Izu-Bonin, and the Marianas, the team calibrates the MOT model, and use it to predict the MOW extent for the other two regions. The model results are compared with observations using along-strike variations in the slab morphology, plate motions, and seismicity as a further constraint on model parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Working in two different cities, the research team will execute an experiment in which crowd-sourced cleaning of storm drains and green infrastructure (GI) inlets is incentivized in advance of forecasted precipitation events, aided by development of a new mobile app. The premise is that inlet conditions largely determine the percentage of tributary area runoff that is captured by stormwater management infrastructure, and thus also the functional capacity of the stormwater system, a key determinant of flooding and indicator of urban resilience to extreme precipitation. The first hypothesis motivating the work is that existing storm drains and GI practices can be operated at higher efficiency if debris is removed immediately before precipitation occurs, and that this kind of just-in-time maintenance can be reliably crowd-sourced, increasing the value of existing storm drains and GI practices for attenuating runoff from both routine and extreme precipitation. Secondly, it is proposed that storm drains and inlets that are more efficient at capturing runoff will be viewed more favorably and accepted by the surrounding community than otherwise identically designed infrastructure that is partially or wholly obstructed with debris.<br/><br/>The research will a) characterize the ability of urban drainage infrastructure, including GI, to manage stormwater under a range of precipitation and catchment conditions, b) pilot a strategy for meaningful engagement of paid Civic Scientists in the operation of decentralized infrastructure systems, c) develop an app that fuses multiple data sets (e.g. climate data available through web services, crowd-sourced photographs and work orders, payments) coupling environmental and human subsystems in a unique and potentially important way, d) survey public perception of urban drainage systems under a variety of contexts, e) potentially improve smart city planning and implementation, f) strengthen social infrastructure through community engagement, and g) advance knowledge in the fields of urban stormwater, sustainable water management, Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, urban stewardship, environmental monitoring, and data fusion. By focusing on how to enhance the performance of existing urban drainage systems, the research targets building urban adaptive capacity and promoting sustainability and resilience in the face of climate change. The geographic focus of the work is the Cramer Hill section of Camden, NJ, an extremely flood prone neighborhood in which most of the residents are from underrepresented minority groups and 35% of the residents fall below the poverty line. The NYC research sites are geographically distributed throughout that city, with the majority located in neighborhoods with similar ethnic, racial, and economic characteristics to Camden. Broader impacts include a) helping stormwater utilities generate inlet and GI designs and maintenance protocols that function during extreme precipitation, b) evaluating upper bounds on the ability of GI and existing stormwater infrastructure to help in adapting to extreme precipitation, c) improving public perception of GI, and d) creating a new model for helping urban residents generate income through decentralized infrastructure maintenance. Study of the urban drainage systems under different weather and physical conditions, maintenance regimes, and social participation formats, will be of value to researchers in engineering, ecology, and urban planning. The incorporation of Civic Scientists in data collection will help to evaluate the potential role of community stewards in distributed infrastructure operation and maintenance, of great contemporary interest in environmental management and smart city development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, efforts to improve education at the undergraduate and graduate level, and to engage the local community in science outreach are underway.<br/><br/>This project focuses on sensing and imaging with chemical selectivity at the nanoscale, a significant goal for modern bioanalytical chemistry. This objective is accomplished by integrating ion channels at the probe tip in scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). An SICM with ion channels sequestered at the tip is developed as an imaging platform designed around a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) processor. This is a new tool to investigate local, temporal release of high-value, but difficult to study biological analytes. The developed instrumentation is used to probe local distribution and release of neurotransmitters in differentiated PC12 cells as well as the transient ion concentration in epithelial wound models.

That is, when combining the words 'blue' and 'hat' to form the more complex mental representation of 'a blue hat', the conceptual meaning of 'blue' (a color adjective, where the word it modifies is blue) seems to drive an increase in brain activity in regions associated with meaning and composition, but the word's linguistic status as a modifier is not the primary driver of this activity. This observation invites linguists to adapt existing theories about how people use language structure to include conceptual meaning. The project examines this by developing a series of studies that vary the structure of English sentences either while keeping the conceptual meaning relatively constant or while using those structural cues to vary which words can combine to form a new meaning. <br/><br/>The primary study funded by this NSF grant measures word composition by using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to compare, for example, the neural representation of the word 'hat' in across sentences like (a) ""The hat is a really pretty blue color"" and (b) ""The hat is near a really pretty blue lamp"", where the key difference is that in (a) but not (b), the words 'hat' and 'blue' must combine to form the representation of 'a blue hat'. Words are presented visually one-at-a-time on a screen while the researchers record participants' brain activity. They then use a machine learning based approach to study at which points in the sentence the brain is still actively representing the word 'hat' after it has been presented. The researchers hypothesize that if it is necessary that the brain activates the full representation of a word in order to combine with another concept, then they should be able to accurately identify the representation for a word like 'hat' immediately after the word 'blue' is presented in sentences like (a), but not in sentences like (b). This study would be the first to provide direct evidence that such word-level re-activation can be triggered by certain sentence structures and inform psycholinguistic models of sentence processing.

Scarce resource allocation problems in humanitarian food relief networks consist of human (volunteer resources) and material (e.g., food, money).

The vision is that this platform will function as a collection of intelligent agents supporting workers performing different functions as a team. In this context, intelligence implies the following four cognitive abilities: to remember and process large amounts of information, to visualize and understand complex concepts in the information, to communicate (e.g., provide instruction and guidance), and to learn from experience. The platform is designed to contain a robust operations and data modeling ontology to facilitate human/machine interaction of the intelligent agents with the team of workers and to facilitate the execution of the four cognitive abilities.

The molecularly engineered structures with unusual optical and mechanical properties in easily printed structures with arbitrary form factors could improve many application areas. These properties include structural color that can change in response to the surrounding environment and the ability to create artificial muscles that generate mechanical work from an ambient stimulus. Control of the molecular structure and composition in printable materials is the key enabler of these functionalities. Fundamental research advances can enable soft robots that integrate actuators and sensors within a 3D printed structure. The ability to self-sense actuation and optically report deformation state allows for the development of new control strategies in soft robots. This will be key to their potential applications in future medical devices for minimally invasive surgery and industrial applications that require manipulation of fragile objects. This research will also result in training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students who will be exposed to emerging concepts in manufacturing with active soft matter. Outreach initiatives targeted at the K-12 levels will prioritize inclusion of traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project will control the interplay between surface anchoring, magnetically-mediated alignment, and chiral self-assembly of liquid crystal monomers in a stereolithographic printing system. The effect of the monomer?s structure and composition on the chiral nematic order in 3D printed voxels will be understood as a function of the printing parameters. Process-structure relationships will be used to voxelate the blueprinted microstructure both in-plane and through-thickness in freeform geometries. Fundamental limits on the resolution at which the molecular patterning can be enforced will be explored. This will be used to inform the space of optical and mechanical properties, as well as their sensitivity to an applied stimulus.

Genetics is a core topic in high school biology curricula, and it is foundational for many other topics in biology. Genetic literacy is also essential for understanding biomedical, agricultural, and environmental science. Despite this central importance, understanding of genetics consistently lags behind other scientific concepts, which is made even worse by the growing role that genetics and genomics plays in modern biology. The Houston Genetics BIORETS program will address this problem by providing high school biology teachers with valuable knowledge and experiences that will improve genetics instruction in their classrooms. Teachers will be drawn from schools with large enrollments of at-risk students and students from groups historically excluded from the sciences.<br/><br/>The Houston Genetics BIORETS program aims to improve genetics instruction in high school biology classes by achieving three goals. First, teachers will improve their genetics and genomics content knowledge by participating in research projects, and they will attend seminars on topics in genetics and genomics. Second, expert teacher trainers will provide instruction in effective pedagogical practices, including inquiry-based teaching and culturally responsive pedagogy. Third, teachers will work with genetics faculty and teacher trainers to develop curricular materials to use in their classrooms, with specific objectives of improving student understanding of concepts and awareness of genetics careers. Lesson plans will be published and disseminated to other teachers.

The patterns will be extracted from standard utility data that record details of these outages. The project aims to explore and understand these statistical patterns to improve the grid resilience. For example, quantifying the typical patterns in component outages and recovery when severe weather hits the grid can inform making the grid more resilient. Quantifying the most likely patterns of how blackouts start and spread can detect the vulnerabilities to a cascading sequence of outages of grid components. The project complements the knowledge of individual blackouts and their mechanisms in the power engineering field with new approaches based on the statistical patterns occurring across all blackout-related outages in detailed utility data. Processing this real data is foundational to quantifying and preventing blackouts and grounding the field in observed data. New metrics calculated from observed data can transform detecting and help in fixing the most likely grid vulnerabilities. The intellectual merits of the project include deploying an interdisciplinary range of statistical and engineering approaches to analyze, confirm and explain patterns observed in detailed utility outage data. The broader impacts of the project include ways to improve the resilience of the nation?s transmission grid by quantifying and mitigating blackouts. The project will improve classroom education by developing interactive teaching methods.<br/><br/>The project will statistically test heavy-tailed probability distributions, design robust resilience metrics, model outage timing with Poisson processes, extract outage and restore processes from data, adapt ideas from motifs from network theory to contingency lists, and identify mechanisms of outages from data. The project will also pursue an entirely new explanation of how the Zipf distribution of event size can arise from the power system engineering that responds to cascades of outages by mitigating those cascades. The expected outcomes include practical resilience event definitions, useful resilience metrics, and expanded risk-based contingency lists for transmission systems that can be calculated from standard utility data and that can be used to help utilities and regulators quantify and mitigate blackout risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water security has been considered the top global risk, as a 40% shortfall is expected between forecasted demand and the available supply of water by 2030. Energy-intensive processing and insufficient clean water productivity of current technologies have become bottlenecks for cost-effective desalination water supply. The renewable energy-driven water utility market is growing, with key stakeholders in developed nations including agriculture and municipal water utility providers. The solar-driven water desalination system in this project is particularly suited for individual installations, underserved populations, and disaster scenarios, all of which are underserved by current desalination techniques. This project advances a process to convert seawater and other brackish water sources into freshwater via a versatile, environmentally friendly, and economically viable desalination system to alleviate water scarcity.<br/><br/>The proposed project identifies a reliable, robust, and cost-effective solution for a solar-driven water desalination and treatment system. The project will optimize the advanced thermal and mechanical properties of a scaled Cu/CuO foam-based all-in-one solar evaporator, investigate a cost-effective strategy for efficient water desalination, and integrate a solar energy system with water desalination system by supplying the preheated sea or brackish water through existing solar-related infrastructures. A novel design of a planar interconnected open-pore foam-based evaporator will be demonstrated. The spatial extension of a planar structure is featured with an addition of a third vertical dimension to improve the evaporation performance. When compared to a similar interfacial structure, no extra photothermal materials are required for this design, and the simple structure is favorable for large-scale applications. The goal of this project is to develop a highly-efficient (>4.5 kg/m2 h), cost-effective (< $40/m2) desalination system for freshwater supply driven by direct solar irradiation, enabled by novel functional materials and structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many digital platforms, consumer data is often used to intermediate the needs of various agents with conflicting interests?such as buyers and sellers, drivers and riders, or social-media users and advertisers. This makes determining the value of data especially complex. This research will tackle the complexity issue and provide a more complete account of the value of data?especially its dependence on privacy-protection policies. By doing so, it will advance our understanding of the demand for data in the digital economy and provide insights into how data markets work and may be affected by policy interventions. This research will also shed light on the debate about how to individually compensate consumers for their data, which many scholars and policymakers believe to be an essential aspect of a functioning data market.<br/><br/>More specifically, this research project will study what determines the value of an individual consumer?s data record for the intermediary that uses it as an input in its business. For instance, such a record can be the characteristics of a buyer that an e-commerce platform stores on its servers. When data is used by a third party (like a platform) to strategically direct interactions between multiple agents (like buyers and sellers), assessing its value is complicated and calls for a new approach. The project shows that this value is not just the payoff the intermediary derives directly from a record (like a platform?s transaction fee). It involves other components, which can significantly bias our assessments if ignored. They capture externalities between the records of, say, different buyers not because of a statistical correlation, but because of how the platform partitions its knowledge of the buyers so as to direct sellers? responses (e.g., by pooling buyers into market segments). Such externalities can render the record of a low-spending buyer more valuable than that of a high-spending buyer. The first part of the project will study contexts where the intermediary already owns the data and can use it without people?s consent. Its core contribution is to show how to properly assess the value of individual records and characterize all its components. The second part of the project will study how the value of data changes when each consumer can withhold their data from the platform. One key insight is that privacy rights may not only shift wealth from data-users to data-sources (i.e., from intermediaries to consumers), but also change the value of data records itself. For instance, it can increase the value of some people?s records at the expense of others. Thus, privacy can have redistributive effects across data-sources, which may contribute to social inequality and should be taken into account by privacy-protection policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goals of this project are to use an artificial cell-like system to define the minimal requirements for cell migration and ultimately to be able to control the movements of cells for applications in medicine and biotechnology. Based on the interdisciplinary nature of their research theme, the team will create unique opportunities to promote STEM research and education for undergraduate and graduate students.

Despite its physiological significance and intense research over last decades, there is still a lack of full understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cell migratory behaviors. The primary challenge is rooted in the profound complexity of two signaling modalities: the biochemical reactions that involve signal transduction and the biomechanical actuations that induce membrane deformations. By taking a bottom-up approach, the investigators recently generated an artificial cell made of giant unilamellar vesicles, which could undergo symmetry breaking upon addition of an external chemical stimulus. This behavior is characteristic of cell polarization, one of the key events observed during native chemotaxis.

Consisting of leaders with considerable expertise in diversity promotion at the University of New Mexico, Arizona State University and University of Oregon, this NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance team is expanding knowledge about the shared and specific challenges facing these doctoral students, post-doctoral research fellows and faculty in STEM fields and contributing to best practices to promote equitable and inclusive institutional transformation. This NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance is identifying challenges, engaging leaders, developing a strategic plan, and consolidating an effective working team between the three partner institutions. The partners are public institutions of higher education, have a Carnegie classification of Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity, are located in Western states, and share a commitment to advancing the success of people with backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in the science and technology enterprise. The project team focuses on four primary activities during the project period. First, the team is implementing institutional assessment studies at each partner institution through surveys and individual interviews. Second, the team is creating leader engagement committees of STEM administrators and faculty to analyze study results and review menus of national best practices. The committees are generating a sense of buy-in and ownership from participants. Third, the partners are developing a five-year equity strategic plan, which outlines change strategies suggested by the leader engagement committees. Finally, the team is refining a collaborative relationship between project leaders at the three partner universities through weekly meetings, while consulting with an external advisory board of distinguished STEM leaders.<br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America?s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace.  NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliances design and implement one or more organizational self-assessment(s) to collect and analyze data that will identify inequities affecting doctoral students, post-doctoral research fellows, and faculty who are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliances also pilot equity strategies and develop a five-year equity strategic plan. These grants fund similar institutions of higher education to generate the foundational work necessary for long-term institutional transformation. Ultimately, advancing institutional equity and inclusion in faculty hiring, retention and promotion policies and practices will increase the number of faculty who are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>This NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance is using an intersectional analysis to study the variation in the experiences of and challenges faced by members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM.

The mesh network of LIMA devices will adaptively multi-hop relay messages to maximize effective capacity and range. The teams seeks to augment the connectivity of LoRaWAN (a standard for Long Range Wide Area Networks) with a goal of increasing coverage range several-fold, reducing the battery drain of end-nodes, and enabling higher uplink bitrates. The core challenge for such LIMA is the development of a scalable multi-hop mesh routing protocol that, unlike existing protocols, accommodates the ultra-low bit rates that characterize LPWANs, and is generalizable across the diverse applications of LPWAN technology. The LIMA solution builds upon two synergistic innovations: (a) embedded-control routing, that uses a very small amount of bits in the data packet header in lieu of control packets, and thereby achieves scalability and energy-efficiency in ultra-low-capacity, energy-constrained networks and (b) relational deep reinforcement learning based routing that combines Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks (DeepRL) with the use of relational features to learn routing policies that adapt to a variety of link dynamics and traffic conditions.

Using the proposed software technology stronger parts will be designed, the analysis of composite additively manufactured (AM) parts will be automated, and the fabrication of various designs will be more efficient. The preliminary results of the proposed technology suggest that it has the potential to design advanced composite structural concepts that are an order of magnitude stiffer than the state-of-the-art laminate composites with the same weight. The integrated software will prompt the ubiquitous adoption of the 3D printing of fiber reinforced polymers in various sectors, such as the medical, aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors, which can benefit from the high-performance composites. The optimized composite AM may be utilized for a variety of applications, some of which are tooling, molding, primary and secondary load-bearing structures, and high-rate, large-volume manufacturing. By addressing the critical design and analysis issues, the integrated software technology will contribute to the growth of composite AM from the current level of 1.5 billion USD to the predicted 9 billion USD in 2028.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of multiscale design optimization by utilizing the effective properties of lattices obtained by numerical homogenization. Due to the use of spatial harmonics, the construction, homogenization-based optimization, and projection of various types of lattices with different degrees of anisotropy are possible. The published experimentally validated results of proposed framework demonstrated that the optimized additively manufactured (AM) composite designs are 100% stiffer and 50% stronger than current composite structures. This project includes the following new features: 1) combined continuous fiber paths and ply layout design optimization in 3D printed composite laminates; 2) constructing a coherent shape-preserving orientation to establish an interconnected microstructure; and 3) incorporating printed fiber and printing resolution constraints in the design process. Composites lattice structures with arbitrary fiber patterns can be difficult to model because the fiber angle varies from element to element. Thus, the proposed automated modeling framework is developed to create a 3D printed fiber polymer and interfaces with finite element analysis to perform and return the weight, displacements, stresses, and local failures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the rigid molecular structure of ICPs limits their processability into flexible fibers for textile fabrication. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant supports research into a new wet-spinning technology to manufacture flexible conductive fibers via side-by-side co-spinning of an ICP with a conventional polymer. The project will utilize both experimental and theoretical methods to investigate the side-by-side fiber formation process and evaluate its influence on fiber properties. The research outcomes should help to control the functional fiber manufacturing process, and allow the fibers to be used to construct sensors for smart wearables, which might find broad applications in healthcare, the military, and sports. Curriculum development and outreach activities will be integrated with research to involve K-12 and college students, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM, to cultivate their interest in textile science/engineering, and to strengthen the workforce pipeline for the textile industry, in order to improve American competitiveness in the field.  <br/>  <br/>The goal of the project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the process-structure-property relationships of ICP side-by-side wet spinning, especially the interactions at the interface of the ICP with the spinnable conventional polymer, including the complex fluid interaction kinetics under various spinning conditions.

These techniques are necessary for determining how large the polar ice sheets were in the geologic past, including during past periods of warm climate that likely resemble present and near-future conditions. Thus, they represent an important technical capability needed for estimating the response of polar ice sheets to climate warming. Because changes in the size of polar ice sheets are the largest potential contribution to future global sea-level change, this capability is also relevant to understanding likely sea-level impacts of future climate change. The research in this project comprises several observational and experimental approaches to improving the speed, efficiency, cost, and accuracy of these techniques, as well as a scientific outreach program aimed at making the resulting capabilities more broadly available to other researchers. The project supports a postdoctoral scholar and contributes to human resources development in polar and climate science.<br/><br/>The project focuses on several areas of cosmogenic-nuclide geochemistry, which is a geochemical dating method that relies on the production and decay of cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides in surface rocks. Measurements of these nuclides can be used to quantify the duration of surface exposure and ice cover at locations in Antarctica that are covered and uncovered by changes in the size of the Antarctic ice sheets, thus providing a means of reconstructing past ice-sheet change. The first proposed set of experiments are aimed at implementing a 'virtual mineral separation' approach to cosmogenic noble gas analysis that may allow measurement of nuclide concentrations in certain minerals without physically separating the minerals from the host rock. If feasible, this would realize significant speed and cost improvements for this type of analysis. A second set of experiments will focus on means of identifying and quantifying non-cosmogenic background inventories of some relevant nuclides, which is intended to improve the measurement sensitivity and precision for cosmic-ray-produced inventories of these nuclides. A third focus area aims to improve capabilities to measure multiple cosmic-ray-produced nuclides in the same sample, which has the potential to improve the accuracy of dating methods based on these nuclides and to expand the situations in which these methods can be applied. If successful, these experiments are likely to improve a number of applications of cosmogenic-nuclide geochemistry relevant to Antarctic research, including subglacial bedrock exposure dating, dating of multimillion-year-old glacial deposits, and surface-process studies useful in understanding landform evolution and ecosystem dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large and functionally important portion of these interactions is carried out by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins. Proteins with IDRs are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases and are considered as attractive and potent drug targets. IDRs lack a stable structure under physiological conditions and as such are particularly challenging to analyze and work with. This project addresses this challenge by developing a full suite of advanced computational tools and databases for predicting and modeling functions and structures IDR-protein and IDR-nucleic acids interactions. The knowledge of the interacting IDRs, their binding partners, and modeled 3D structures of interactions will guide building hypotheses for experiment design and interpretation of experimental data. The project will train Ph.D. students of different backgrounds through interdisciplinary coursework and mentoring at Purdue University and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). High school students will be recruited through outreach activities and programs that the PIs are involved in. Altogether, this project focuses on the interdisciplinary computational life science education and research efforts at Purdue and VCU.<br/><br/>Three interlocked computational methods will be developed for studying molecular interactions of IDRs at the 1 dimensional (1D), 2D, and 3D levels, significantly advancing over the conventional solutions that are limited to 1D/sequence predictions. The corresponding aims are: (1) high-accuracy prediction of protein and nucleotide binding regions within IDR sequences using cutting-edge multi-task deep learning models (1D level); (2) integrative identification of the partner molecules (proteins and nucleic acids) for these binding regions (2D level); and (3) structure modeling by innovative docking between IDRs and the partner proteins and nucleotides (3D level). The developed tools and results will be provided to the research community through a web-based database and open source repositories. Overall, this work significantly advances structural bioinformatics field by developing modern computational tools and a database for understanding, predicting, and modeling tertiary structures of interactions of IDRs with proteins and nucleotides.

This NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance is identifying challenges, engaging leaders, developing a strategic plan, and consolidating an effective working team between the three partner institutions. The partners are public institutions of higher education, have a Carnegie classification of Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity, are located in Western states, and share a commitment to advancing the success of people with backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in the science and technology enterprise. The project team focuses on four primary activities during the project period. First, the team is implementing institutional assessment studies at each partner institution through surveys and individual interviews. Second, the team is creating leader engagement committees of STEM administrators and faculty to analyze study results and review menus of national best practices. The committees are generating a sense of buy-in and ownership from participants. Third, the partners are developing a five-year equity strategic plan, which outlines change strategies suggested by the leader engagement committees. Finally, the team is refining a collaborative relationship between project leaders at the three partner universities through weekly meetings, while consulting with an external advisory board of distinguished STEM leaders.<br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America?s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace.

NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliances also pilot equity strategies and develop a five-year equity strategic plan. These grants fund similar institutions of higher education to generate the foundational work necessary for long-term institutional transformation. Ultimately, advancing institutional equity and inclusion in faculty hiring, retention and promotion policies and practices will increase the number of faculty who are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>This NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance is using an intersectional analysis to study the variation in the experiences of and challenges faced by members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM.

Oceanic internal lee waves have horizontal wavelengths between O(1?10) km that bridge mesoscale currents and smallscale turbulence and play a central role in the ocean?s energy cascade. Their generation exerts wave drag on balanced flow and extracts mesoscale energy, and their propagation transports this energy through wave-fluxes. When they break, they convert energy downscale to turbulent dissipation and mixing, maintaining ocean?s stratification and in turn contributing to the largescale circulation. This project will examine why observed dissipation in the deep ocean downstream from flow-topography interactions is smaller than predicted by the common assumption of equating lee-wave generation with dissipation. This research will determine the role of lee waves in dissipating versus redistributing energy for better parameterizations of wave drag and mixing for oceanic general circulation models. This project will support an early-career lead PI, a graduate and two undergraduate students to be trained on wave dynamics and ocean modeling.<br/> <br/>Regional numerical modeling with Process Study Ocean Model (PSOM) will simulate the generation, propagation, interaction and dissipation of lee waves in mean shear. PSOM is a non-hydrostatic ocean model that has been widely used to study submesoscale processes. The PIs will extend prior idealized simulations to explore a range of topographic variations to examine mechanisms that may suppress turbulence in the lee of flow-topography interactions. These mechanisms are: (i) nonlinear generation due to topographic blocking and splitting, (ii) reabsorption of lee-wave energy back to the sheared mean flow, (iii) remote dissipation in the form of free waves that escape the localized generating current, and (iv) downstream advection of lee-wave energy from localized generating topography. Among these mechanisms, reabsorption will occur for trapped lee waves in bottom-intensified currents, while nonlinear generation and downstream advection have a strong dependence on specific, as opposed to random, topographies. The primary analysis tool will be energy conservation budgets for different components (mean jet, lee waves, and free waves) to quantify the dissipative and non-dissipative fates of lee waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their research engagement will prepare them for further education and careers as leaders of the 21st-century clean-energy workforce.  <br/><br/>The project will produce clean, hydrogen-enriched syngas through the co-gasification of biochar with waste mixed plastics. The specific objectives are: 1) to modify a fixed-bed reactor to generate fundamental data on hydrogen-rich syngas production using catalytic steam co-gasification of biochar and mixed waste plastics; 2) to identify the optimal catalyst-to-feedstock and steam-to-feedstock ratios to improve hydrogen content in syngas; 3) to determine the effects of temperature and feed composition on syngas yield and composition, cold and hot gas efficiencies, tar content, and carbon-conversion efficiency; and 4) to develop numerical models to predict and optimize syngas composition from co-gasification of biochar and mixed waste plastics. A laboratory-scale, fixed-bed, batch-gasification system will be used to accomplish the objectives. Numerical models will be developed using commercially available finite-element analysis (FEA) software. Research outcomes have potential applications in carbon-neutral or carbon-negative polygeneration processes, such as power generation, and commercial products, such as jet fuels, methanol, olefins, and plastics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consisting of leaders with considerable expertise in diversity promotion at the University of New Mexico, Arizona State University and University of Oregon, this NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance team is expanding knowledge about the shared and specific challenges facing these doctoral students, post-doctoral research fellows and faculty in STEM fields and contributing to best practices to promote equitable and inclusive institutional transformation. This NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance is identifying challenges, engaging leaders, developing a strategic plan, and consolidating an effective working team between the three partner institutions. The partners are public institutions of higher education, have a Carnegie classification of Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity, are located in Western states, and share a commitment to advancing the success of people with backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in the science and technology enterprise. The project team focuses on four primary activities during the project period. First, the team is implementing institutional assessment studies at each partner institution through surveys and individual interviews. Second, the team is creating leader engagement committees of STEM administrators and faculty to analyze study results and review menus of national best practices. The committees are generating a sense of buy-in and ownership from participants. Third, the partners are developing a five-year equity strategic plan, which outlines change strategies suggested by the leader engagement committees. Finally, the team is refining a collaborative relationship between project leaders at the three partner universities through weekly meetings, while consulting with an external advisory board of distinguished STEM leaders.<br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America?s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace.  NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliances design and implement one or more organizational self-assessment(s) to collect and analyze data that will identify inequities affecting doctoral students, post-doctoral research fellows, and faculty who are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliances also pilot equity strategies and develop a five-year equity strategic plan. These grants fund similar institutions of higher education to generate the foundational work necessary for long-term institutional transformation. Ultimately, advancing institutional equity and inclusion in faculty hiring, retention and promotion policies and practices will increase the number of faculty who are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>This NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance is using an intersectional analysis to study the variation in the experiences of and challenges faced by members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. This analysis includes examining within and between group similarities and differences. The team is also adapting the Frank Dobbin?s and Alexandra Kalev?s managerial engagement approach, and Shelley Correll?s ?Small Wins? change model, to address the goal of improving diverse faculty representation in STEM. Together these methods will contribute to successful project implementation and outcomes. Internal evaluation of the project work will be conducted by Kristine Denman, the Director of the New Mexico Statistical Analysis Center. External assessment of this NSF AGEP Catalyst Alliance work will be led by Lynn Nordstrom from the Cornelius Management Group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving environmental sustainability is a generational problem that represents one of the most critical technological challenges of our time. Electricity generation (31%) and transportation (27%) are the largest contributors to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Wheeled ground vehicles, in turn, generate most of the transportation emissions and have an increasing impact on emissions from electricity generation. Solutions must address vehicle sustainability without unduly disrupting an industry that is central to the nation?s economic health and its citizens? lifestyles. The EVSTS Center engages the automotive industry?s critical stakeholders - vehicle manufacturers, component and system suppliers, fleet operators, ground transportation infrastructure providers, and state / local governments - in yielding transformational improvements in the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of ground vehicles. Scope of the work encompasses passenger cars, trucks, and motorized non-road equipment, as well as vehicle-level technologies and transportation system infrastructure, reflecting the complexity and global nature of the automotive and ground transportation industries.<br/><br/>The EVSTS center leverages collaborations among corporate, government, and academic partners to conduct and disseminate industry-relevant research on technologies and tools that facilitate the design, manufacture, deployment, and operation of energy efficient, environmentally sustainable vehicles. Research is conducted in five technical areas: 1) electrified vehicle powertrains, 2) conventional powertrains and alternative fuels, 3) non-powertrain vehicle systems optimization, 4) efficient / sustainable autonomous vehicles, and 5) transportation systems and infrastructure. Specifically, ASU?s expertise in power electronic converters and systems, energy efficient microelectronics circuits, and system integration helps companies design and move toward commercializing sustainable electrified vehicles. Recent significant investments in Arizona?s semiconductor and automotive industries strategically position ASU to collaborate with emerging EV manufacturers and charging station companies, to create education and training opportunities for a green manufacturing work force, and to engage semiconductor companies in research collaboration by bringing together organizations throughout the automotive supply chain early in the integration process. For example, with vehicle electrification, adoption of infotainment and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) /automated driving systems (ADS) will soon become as prolific as today?s smart phones and tablets. Designing system-level components and bringing together players to collaborate in the critical integration process is a focus of the ASU site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stroke remains a leading cause of death among Americans and is the largest source of long-term disability in the U.S. and around the world.  Every 30 seconds, an American suffers a major stroke, most commonly caused by a clot obstructing a large cerebral artery supplying a critical area of the brain.  This project?s clot-removal technology aims to enable rapid and efficient removal of clot from the cerebral vessels using minimally-invasive image-guided techniques, thereby improving the chances of full recovery and an independently functional outcome. The broader benefit for society is to reduce death or permanent disability from ischemic stroke with its resultant family, community, and economic burden.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will lead to the development of a medical device to enable efficient removal of blood clots from the brain arteries of a stroke victim.  The platform technology is constructed from microscopic tubes of superelastic metal alloy integrated with a proprietary pattern of laser-cut apertures.  The device can be delivered to the stroke clot through a microcatheter to create a shape-formed array of clot-capture elements within a patient?s artery.  Tandem capture devices optimize the clot capture system and can be positioned on either edge of a clotted segment within a brain artery. Optimal shape, thickness and materials of the clot capture elements and the delivery system will be characterized, developed, and verified.  The proposed work will utilize a previously validated model of stroke thrombectomy to characterize and quantify fundamental clot capture parameters (clot stabilization, retention, and retrieval) among multiple discrete capture node embodiments.  Radial force, coefficient of drag during withdrawal inside a cerebral blood vessel and device trackability will be measured for each design using robust three-dimensional human anatomic models of cerebral vessels.

When seawater freezes, the ice expels the salt so that the layer of ice is composed mostly of freshwater. Therefore, when the sea ice melts in summer, it creates a thin layer of freshwater that floats on the saltier seawater beneath it. Traditional oceanographic measurements rarely measure this fresh layer because ships typically collect data from a depth of about 5 m. Yet, these freshwater lenses may play a key role influencing the atmosphere-ocean exchange of gases, including carbon dioxide, the principal gas responsible for global warming and the loss of nearly half of the summertime sea ice coverage of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic Ocean is thought to absorb about 10% of the human emissions of carbon dioxide. Still, this number is highly uncertain, owing partly to the scarcity of observations at the very surface. This project aims to address that source of uncertainty by sampling the freshwater layer in the Beaufort Sea, both aboard a Research Vessel and on an autonomous surface platform called Wave Glider. We will compare the chemistry of the fresh layer to the saltier water just beneath it and use these data to correct estimates of carbon dioxide uptake for this previously-unmeasured impact across the entire portion of the Arctic that experiences seasonal sea ice melt, an area up to 2.5 times the size of Texas. Better estimates of ocean carbon uptake help us better understand the global carbon budget and monitor efforts to slow climate change. Project scientists will train a Ph.D. student and work with science communication experts at URI?s Metcalf Institute to engage journalists and public audiences in Arctic Ocean science through a webinar series.<br/><br/>Part 2:<br/>The Arctic Ocean takes up about 10% of the carbon dioxide that humans emit, which helps diminish the effects of climate change. However, our knowledge about the Arctic Ocean carbon sink is uncertain due to the number of observations and how they are collected. The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, leading to dramatic changes in sea ice cover. The fresher meltwater layer left behind by the retreating sea ice typically lasts for 1 to 5 weeks. It has different carbon dioxide levels than the water just a few meters deeper, where ships generally have sampled due to the locations of their water intakes. Because the uptake of carbon by the ocean is determined by the carbon dioxide levels right at the surface, this difference between the meltwater and what is typically sampled by ships requires a correction to these ship-based measurements. This correction will affect the carbon sink over an area of the seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean covering 0.35 to 1.75 million km2 (an area up to 2.5 times larger than Texas).<br/><br/>Carbon Levels at the Arctic Salinity?Stratified Sea Ice Edge (CLASSSIE) is a project to measure key carbon system parameters in the marginal ice zone of the Beaufort Sea. The project will collaborate with scientists funded by the NASA Physical Oceanography program in a project called Salinity and Stratification at the Sea Ice Edge (SASSIE). SASSIE will include measurements from a ship and autonomous surface vehicles called Wave Gliders. CLASSSIE will make carbon measurements in and under the meltwater layer from the ship and do the same from one of the Wave Gliders. From these measurements, CLASSSIE will determine a relationship between salinity and carbon dioxide levels for an ocean with meltwater input. Using that empirical relationship between salinity and carbon dioxide levels, a correction in the meltwater layer will be proposed and combined with meltwater layer statistics from a computer model to produce a modified map of Arctic Ocean carbon dioxide levels. Finally, a revised estimate of the Arctic Ocean carbon sink will be created with the modified map. Refining estimates of the Arctic Ocean carbon sink will help constrain the global carbon budget, which is crucial to monitoring climate change mitigation. The project will train a Ph.D. student. CLASSSIE will also work with the Metcalf Institute at URI to develop a four-part webinar series to engage journalists, public audiences, and interested researchers in Arctic Ocean science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many digital platforms, consumer data is often used to intermediate the needs of various agents with conflicting interests?such as buyers and sellers, drivers and riders, or social-media users and advertisers. This makes determining the value of data especially complex. This research will tackle the complexity issue and provide a more complete account of the value of data?especially its dependence on privacy-protection policies. By doing so, it will advance our understanding of the demand for data in the digital economy and provide insights into how data markets work and may be affected by policy interventions. This research will also shed light on the debate about how to individually compensate consumers for their data, which many scholars and policymakers believe to be an essential aspect of a functioning data market.<br/><br/>More specifically, this research project will study what determines the value of an individual consumer?s data record for the intermediary that uses it as an input in its business. For instance, such a record can be the characteristics of a buyer that an e-commerce platform stores on its servers. When data is used by a third party (like a platform) to strategically direct interactions between multiple agents (like buyers and sellers), assessing its value is complicated and calls for a new approach. The project shows that this value is not just the payoff the intermediary derives directly from a record (like a platform?s transaction fee). It involves other components, which can significantly bias our assessments if ignored. They capture externalities between the records of, say, different buyers not because of a statistical correlation, but because of how the platform partitions its knowledge of the buyers so as to direct sellers? responses (e.g., by pooling buyers into market segments). Such externalities can render the record of a low-spending buyer more valuable than that of a high-spending buyer. The first part of the project will study contexts where the intermediary already owns the data and can use it without people?s consent. Its core contribution is to show how to properly assess the value of individual records and characterize all its components. The second part of the project will study how the value of data changes when each consumer can withhold their data from the platform. One key insight is that privacy rights may not only shift wealth from data-users to data-sources (i.e., from intermediaries to consumers), but also change the value of data records itself. For instance, it can increase the value of some people?s records at the expense of others. Thus, privacy can have redistributive effects across data-sources, which may contribute to social inequality and should be taken into account by privacy-protection policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how groups of humans behaviorally adapted as they moved across the world is a core component to understanding how humans came to be the most populous large mammal on earth. One way people adapted to a diversity of environments and changing climates was by adjusting their mobility patterns, resource catchment areas, and trade networks. This project will utilize the stable isotopes in ostrich eggshell to create paleoclimatic reconstructions while employing strontium isotope analysis to discern mobility patterns and identify possible trade networks, assessing how movement responded to climatic change. Ostrich eggshell is an often-overlooked resource that is abundant in many archaeological deposits, signaling the importance of these eggs as a subsistence resource. Because ostrich eggshell is common in many archaeological sites, establishing standardized methods of collecting clean samples and of producing maps of bioavailable strontium on the landscapes of interest will allow researchers the benefit of generating data that can be easily compared and serve as a baseline for future projects. Complex human behavior is linked to ostrich eggshell through use in bead making, symbolic engravings, and containers that carry or cache water in environments where water is sparse. The archaeological record significantly informs investigations into modern human origins and hunter-gatherer and pastoralist lifeways before and after European colonization and provides a wide range of ecosystems from which to study early human behavior and to explore how past human groups made their living.  <br/><br/>To achieve the goals of this project adoctoral candidate at the University of California Davis will engineer the creation of a map illustrating regional biogenic strontium. This map will be a valuable tool as a baseline to this project as well as to other researchers in a variety of disciplines. McNeill will investigate mobility and resource catchment variables by comparing strontium values in archaeological ostrich eggshell to the map to assess the likely source of the eggshell, allowing one to discern how far groups were willing to travel or trade to obtain this valuable and versatile resource. The researchers will develop and refine methods for extracting uncontaminated calcite from the eggshell to be processed for strontium isotope analysis to facilitate the spatial assessment. This uncontaminated shell material along with collagen from the organic component of the shell will then be sampled for stable isotope analysis to facilitate the paleoclimatic reconstruction of the study region. Incorporating multiple lines of isotopic evidence enhances the interpretive power of these analyses for understanding human mobility and the food webs humans exploited, especially in the context of past environmental variability. The richness of data that can be gleaned from ostrich eggshells will provide researchers with another resource to employ in the mission to understand the human past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology consists of a simple and portable test usable outside a laboratory setting by users with little training. The proposed test will enable rapid, quantitative detection of small percentages of many types of meat in food. The assay uses changes in light reflection when relevant proteins bind to antibodies designed to recognize them.

End users benefit from reduced labor demands and real-time high-fidelity images of remote areas otherwise inaccessible. Industrial inspections, crop management, field surveying, and site security are most often conducted by deploying humans into the field - often creating labor bottlenecks and potentially dangerous situations. Adoption of UAVs for these applications can be limited by image processing that consumes too much power for UAV use, delayed image presentation affecting navigation capabilities, or image artifacts that obscure the details pertinent to market needs.  These limitations can all be overcome with the camera technologies developed here.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a lightweight, parallax-free, 360-degree panoramic camera system with an innovative optical design based on a polyhedron-shaped configuration of adjacent cameras. Each camera's field of view closely abuts but does not overlap with the next, enabling seamless and computationally simplistic capture of images from 360-degree views, while limiting blind regions and lost content between cameras. This approach eliminates the stitching errors and image distortion associated with wide angle lenses and multi-camera systems, and reduces the computational demand for 360-degree image capture. As a result, low energy edge-computing presents images in real time with minimal impact on flight time or energy use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications. Furthermore, this project advances system designs optimized for UAV weight and size, as well as improved concepts for kinematic space frames, in which the cameras can be integrated to form robust multi-camera systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to large increase in demand, novel  methods  for content delivery must be considered so as to not overburden the wireless networks, while at the same time keeping transmission delays low, to avoid the dreaded ?buffering? warning on the device of the user. One of the most promising methods for achieving this is caching at the wireless edge, i.e., storing popular content at or near the wireless base stations that users are connected to. Caching strategies usually require knowledge of the video popularity, as well as the historical preferences of the individual users. This information needs to be combined with information about the wireless network structure and network parameters, to determine what content should be cached where. Yet,  in  many  cases  it  is  undesirable  to  share  detailed  user  profiles  with  the  cache  and/or  wireless network operator.  The main motivation for avoiding such sharing is user privacy. The goal of the current project is thus to develop techniques based on machine learning that enable efficient video caching and delivery systems while preserving the privacy of the users. Such algorithms will advance the state of the art in machine learning, by incorporating  expert knowledge on video caching and developing new network structures derived from the specific problem. At the same time the results will benefit society by providing privacy ? which is of great importance to consumers and steadily becoming more so ? as well as spectral and energy efficiency of wireless networks and thus careful use of finite resources. The project will also serve to help students develop interdisciplinary thinking, and has a detailed plan for increasing the participation from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The project will explore caching techniques that preserve privacy while retaining the efficiency of caching. In particular it will use Federated Learning , a form of Machine Learning that allows localized training and exchange of machine learning models, such as parameterized neural networks, between distributed nodes without requiring the exchange of underlying data such as user preferences. The developed techniques will take into account both content popularity and the state of the wireless network. Rather than separating the problem into disparate parts, such as popularity prediction on one hand, and wireless caching optimization on the other, the project will pursue an integrated approach that accounts for the interaction between all the different aspects of the work.  Specific topics of investigation will include (i) techniques that do not require transmission of models to a central server, thus further strengthening privacy, (ii) algorithms for hybrid global-local models that take account of the fact that video popularity is a global descriptor while also showing some local (spatio-temporal) variations, (iii) direct  learning of  caching  strategies  without  taking  the  detour  via separate learning of video popularity and wireless network state, thus improving both efficiency and privacy. All these results will flow into an integrated, holistic system design for privacy-preserving video caching systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are the most commonly prescribed class of anti-anxiety medication, and currently prescribed to more than 5% of the US population.  Although effective, BZDs are highly addictive and commonly involved in polysubstance overdose fatalities. In fact, BZD prescription rates per state are directly linked to overdose fatality rates. Despite this risk, BZDs remain widely prescribed, even in those at high risk for polysubstance use.  When BZDs are taken with alcohol, opiates, or other CNS depressants, they can cause life threatening respiratory depression among other effects such as drowsiness and reduced motor function, which often lead to accidents and hospitalizations. The proposed research is committed to the development safer and effective alternatives to BZDs, specifically for those at risk of polysubstance overdose. In doing so, the goal to improve safety and efficacy of anxiety treatment and substance use disorders, improve long-term recovery success, and combat the rising pandemic of polysubstance overdose fatalities. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of partial and functionally subtype selective GABAA (Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid-A) receptor modulators for the treatment of anxiety, specifically for individuals at high risk of substance use disorders and polysubstance overdoses. Select natural and synthetic flavonoids have been shown to be potent GABAAR modulators with anxiolytic activity and reduced sedative and alcohol-enhancing effects. However, flavonoids are poorly absorbed and rapidly excreted due to a lack of druglike properties. This has led us to the design of novel derivatives with improved druglike properties with the aim of identifying a druglike anti-anxiety (GABAAR PAM) without alcohol and opiate enhancing properties. The foundation for this project is based upon work completed in 2021 targeting positive modulation and inhibition ethanol-induced potentiation of GABAARs as a novel mechanism for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. This work also led to the filing of a provisional patent, and a recent publication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large and functionally important portion of these interactions is carried out by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins. Proteins with IDRs are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases and are considered as attractive and potent drug targets. IDRs lack a stable structure under physiological conditions and as such are particularly challenging to analyze and work with. This project addresses this challenge by developing a full suite of advanced computational tools and databases for predicting and modeling functions and structures IDR-protein and IDR-nucleic acids interactions. The knowledge of the interacting IDRs, their binding partners, and modeled 3D structures of interactions will guide building hypotheses for experiment design and interpretation of experimental data. The project will train Ph.D. students of different backgrounds through interdisciplinary coursework and mentoring at Purdue University and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). High school students will be recruited through outreach activities and programs that the PIs are involved in. Altogether, this project focuses on the interdisciplinary computational life science education and research efforts at Purdue and VCU.<br/><br/>Three interlocked computational methods will be developed for studying molecular interactions of IDRs at the 1 dimensional (1D), 2D, and 3D levels, significantly advancing over the conventional solutions that are limited to 1D/sequence predictions. The corresponding aims are: (1) high-accuracy prediction of protein and nucleotide binding regions within IDR sequences using cutting-edge multi-task deep learning models (1D level); (2) integrative identification of the partner molecules (proteins and nucleic acids) for these binding regions (2D level); and (3) structure modeling by innovative docking between IDRs and the partner proteins and nucleotides (3D level). The developed tools and results will be provided to the research community through a web-based database and open source repositories. Overall, this work significantly advances structural bioinformatics field by developing modern computational tools and a database for understanding, predicting, and modeling tertiary structures of interactions of IDRs with proteins and nucleotides. The resulting new deep learning technologies will be transferrable to other bioinformatics areas that rely on the prediction and analysis from protein sequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predictive ML models can help clinicians identify patients at high risk of adverse outcomes, enabling them to make informed decisions about preventative measures. Causal ML models can help clinicians and patients understand the effects of interventions enabling them to make more informed decisions about the treatment options. Importantly, the reliability of predictive and causal ML methods depends on the quality of data used to develop them. Unfortunately, data quality often reflects systemic inequalities in both access to and quality of healthcare leading to data disparities. Examples of unequal quality of care include settings in which Black patients are less likely to receive referrals to specialists or in which women?s pain is less likely to be taken seriously, both leading to potential delays in diagnosis and treatment. This means that data collected from specific subgroups of the population are more prone to missingness. In terms of access, data reveal that Black and Hispanic groups are more likely to be uninsured and less likely to have a usual place to go to for medical care. This results in the underrepresentation of subgroups of the population in observational data such as electronic health records typically used to develop ML models. In this proposal, we will develop and theoretically analyze robust ML methods (both predictive and causal) that ameliorate the effects of data disparities. <br/> <br/>The proposed research has two main prongs. The first prong focuses on developing prediction tools for diagnosis that are robust to inaccuracies due to underrepresentation of minorities. We will develop model training methods that discourage the models from learning patterns that are reflective of data biases rather than true causal mechanisms. We will theoretically analyze the robustness and efficiency of our models. The second prong focuses on developing methods for estimation of causal effects of interventions that are robust to data missingness and measurement error. While most existing work attempts to estimate the causal effect of an intervention, this project will study the estimation of intervals or bounds on the causal estimates which reflect the uncertainty in the quality of the collected data.

The project will take a grow-your-own linear approach that spans from local high schools to area community colleges to a four-year institution. A recruiting focus will be on positively influencing high school students to join the mathematics teaching profession by educating them on the benefits and rewards of teaching. After high school, the education pathway for students will begin at a two-year college. After completing a community college degree, participants will transfer to a mathematics major and pre-service teacher program at a four-year college, where they will gain teacher licensure. Upon graduation with a baccalaureate degree, they will return to high-need schools as mathematics teachers. To prepare undergraduate students for the teaching profession, the project will incorporate a three-pronged immersion model. (1) Students will receive enhanced mathematics education coursework, mentoring, and dual advising from STEM and STEM education faculty. (2) They also will have special field experiences through a residency model beginning in community college. (3) The project will facilitate professional development opportunities to develop participants? professional identities as teachers prepared to succeed in high-need schools. Overall, the project aims to increase the number of STEM graduates prepared to teach mathematics in high-need schools and address the mathematics teacher shortage in central Pennsylvania and across the United States.<br/><br/>This project at Shippensburg University includes partnerships with Harrisburg Area Community College and Hagerstown Community College, along with five high-need local education agencies (LEAs) with high teacher turnover rates; namely, Carlisle, Chambersburg, Steelton-Highspire, Upper Dauphin, and Waynesboro. The project has two underlying goals. First is to recruit, provide scholarships, prepare, and graduate thirty (30) highly qualified mathematics teachers within the five-year duration of the project. A second goal is to place these new teachers in high-need schools, primarily in the central Pennsylvania area. The project will be informed by the theoretical basis of a grow-your-own teacher model in which young students who are interested in becoming teachers are fostered and supported. In concert with this, the project will build on residency models of teacher practicums, in which students who remain in one school for three years have been shown to improve teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools. Mixed-methods project evaluation will explore the effectiveness of programmatic components, ranging from recruiting high school students to graduation and placement in high-need school settings. Lines of investigation on the project's immersion model will generate new knowledge and fill gaps in the literature by testing methods to influence the effectiveness of: the grow-your-own theoretical framework and interorganizational pathway; the efficacy of preparing preservice teachers for high-need classrooms through community building, content mastery, service learning, and increased field experiences; and early and ongoing mentorship for novice teachers. Through publications and regional and national meetings, the project team will disseminate evidence collected to inform other higher education professionals seeking to improve teacher preparation and placement programs.

BRIMI's novel study of biases stands to greatly advance the understanding of the challenges that minority groups and individuals face when seeking health information. By including specific interventions for both patients and doctors and advancing the state-of-the-art in public health and fact checking organizations, BRIMI aims to inform public policy, increase the public's critical literacy, and improve the well-being of historically under-served patients. The award includes significant outreach efforts, which will engage minority communities directly in our scientific process; broad stakeholder engagement will ensure that the research approach to the groups studied is respectful, ethical, and patient-centered. The BRIMI team is composed of academics, non-profits, and industry partners, thus improving collaboration and partnerships across different sectors and multiple disciplines. The BRIMI project will lead to fundamental research advances in computer science, while integrating deep expertise in medical training, public health interventions, and fact checking. BRIMI is the first large scale computational study of biased health information of any kind. This award specifically focuses on bias reduction in the health domain; its foundational computer science advances and contributions may generalize to other domains, and it will likely pave the way for studying bias in other areas such as politics and finances. <br/><br/>BRIMI has the following objectives: (a) identifying and analyzing bias and language misuse online; (b) advancing the understanding of how misinformation spreads amongst different populations; and (c) triaging health topics with the biggest harms, and creating and disseminating triage guidelines to public health officials and practitioners. BRIMI will develop novel artificial intelligence approaches both to establish health information inequities empirically, and to reduce them. The methods used include large-scale online and social network data collection and a content analysis approach to annotating complex health data; supervised, semi-supervised and transfer learning to detect biased and false health information; controversy and misinformation analysis using community detection, stance detection and claim detection; and intervention design methods based on best practices in public health. The award?s research contributions will include: (a) novel metrics to computationally define biased health information and characterize its dissemination online and in social media, including specifically within divergent population groups; (b) utilizing transfer learning and semi-supervised approaches, in order to generalize solutions developed on and for medical language to lay language; (c) analyzing disagreement within and across populations on health information, which in turn requires improvement in stance detection and claim matching approaches; and (d) novel computational approaches to triage and prioritize misinformation for the purposes of mitigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such systems must be trained on large datasets of millions of images which have been painstakingly labeled by human annotators. Such large, labeled datasets are difficult to create for many application domains, such as microscopy, where annotators will need to be highly trained. Collecting large datasets may also run afoul of privacy concerns, and may need expensive curation to remove racial, gender or other kinds of bias. Finally, the steep cost of collecting large datasets makes computer vision technology inaccessible to many. This project develops technologies for recognition systems that can successfully identify difficult visual concepts without needing any large datasets. Recognition systems that can work with limited training data will unlock many downstream applications, especially in specialized domains, and will make advances in computer vision technology accessible to all. The project team will make these recognition systems broadly accessible to all, organize a workshop for high school students from underrepresented communities, and develop a new computer vision curriculum that focuses on broad applications of computer vision technology.<br/><br/>To build recognition systems from little data (as few as 1-2 labeled images and around 1000 unlabeled images), this project explores two strategies inspired from human vision. First, unlike current recognition systems that are trained in isolation for each problem domain, humans learn to perform new visual tasks (such as analyzing microscopy images) in the context of their vast prior visual experience. This project similarly designs visual learners that learn new recognition tasks from limited data by leveraging a memory of past visual tasks across multiple domains. Second, unlike current systems that learn only from labeled images, humans learn through rich interactions and back-and-forth with expert teachers. Inspired by this observation, this project builds systems that can learn by asking detailed questions of experts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pandemic has also severely impacted visiting nurses, home care, day care, and other in-person eldercare services, and as a result many seniors have been left isolated with little or no interaction with the broader community, which often leads to mental and psychological disorders.  Because current nursing practices and systems have proven to be so vulnerable, those in need of such services would be better served if in-person eldercare could be supplemented by other means.  This project explores an alternative remote-nursing approach based on tele-medicine and robotic technologies, which aims to deliver quality care services safely in individual homes and institutions through a network of people and equipment.<br/><br/>Mobility is a fundamental function that elderly people must retain to live independently, but mobility assistance requires physical interactions and is currently dependent on in-person care. This research will develop a multi-functional, reconfigurable, mobility-assistance robot that is operated and supervised remotely by caregivers and clinical staff who can communicate with the user through the robotic system, the work to include three thrusts: the ability of the robot to alter its footprint when necessary to enable it to fit through narrow doorways and work in cluttered residential environments while providing seamless support in daily activities such as transportation and sit-to-stand transition; the ability to protect a user with declining balance issues from falls that might result in taking a hard hit on a floor by changing to an untippable configuration; and providing remote caregivers with help in executing physical interactions with older adults in a safe and engaging manner, because most physical assistance procedures entail a cooperative attitude from the care recipient.  With a remote caregiver in the loop, the robot can monitor the behavior and mental state of the user and guide them through the assistive procedure so that they may be better engaged and become cooperative.  Human subject tests will be conducted at a rehabilitation hospital to demonstrate and verify the 	new technology in a realistic setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manually creating specialized knowledge bases or a one-fits-all model is expensive and infeasible. Existing research on intelligent assistance systems tackles three important sub-problems, user modeling, information extraction, and text generation, but considers these problems to be separate and so addresses them with separate methods. The underlying assumption is that there is no need for cross-utilization of the information needed to address or the knowledge learned by addressing each sub-problem. For instance, knowledge bases or knowledge graphs need no or little expansion by information extraction methods to obtain all the facts. Similarly, language models would have been well trained for generating an answer to the factual question and need no information from the other methods. This underlying assumption is too simplistic and does not hold for specialized intelligent assistance. This project addresses this limitation by discovering and utilizing synergies in user modeling, information extraction, and text generation. The PI designs, develops, and evaluates novel algorithms to assist individuals who are suffering from anxiety, depression, and other types of mental issues and who are seeking help on social media. Furthermore, this research supports the cross-disciplinary development of a diverse cohort of PhD and undergraduate students at Notre Dame.<br/><br/>The proposed algorithms mutually enhance one another by sharing knowledge. The technical aims of the project are divided into three thrusts. The first thrust develops novel information extraction methods to enhance the construction of mental health ontologies from social media data. These methods convert unstructured social media data into structured data for efficient retrieval and learning. The second thrust develops novel natural language generation techniques to create textual responses with user models and ontologies, enabling personalization and knowledge awareness. The third thrust enhances user models with novel contextualized representation learning algorithms that learn from user behavior data and structured knowledge. The proposed algorithms preserve the spatio-temporal behavioral patterns of users and their generated content to more precisely reflect their situations and needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before facing the exabyte scales of whole brains, it is necessary to develop methods to infer activity from anatomy in smaller, simpler, but still complete model systems. Neural cell cultures (in vitro) are highly simplified systems that show complex dynamical activity, can be monitored in terms of spatial activity, and can have parameters tuned by chemistry. Critically, cultures are small, complete networks where every physical connection can be mapped and activity monitored at the single cell level. Thus, interpretations on how the physical wiring and activity in neural networks are correlated will not be confounded by artifacts or limitations encountered by other experimental methods that utilize living animals or brain tissue (e.g. living brain slices have thousands of severed connections.). <br/><br/>As well as a substrate on which to develop methods later to be applied to whole brains, neural cell cultures are of interest as model systems in their own right. In a separate development far from neuroscience, research on 'active matter' - the interactions of autonomous agents - has suggested new principles about how quiescent states become active, and potentially synchronize. This project aims to bring together the novel theoretical perspective with simplified but biologically relevant experiments, using the latest tools of cell culture, neural recording, and connectomics. The goal of the project is to produce an explicit physical model where the three key elements of neuronal systems are joined up: functional recording from a 2D neural cell network; connectivity measurement through serial electron microscopy; explicit theoretical modelling of the dynamics of the neural system. The fundamental question is: Can one infer activity from anatomy?<br/> <br/>This research focuses on dynamical transitions between neural states, including synchrony. Epilepsy is a disease of synchrony and one of the co-investigators has his principal research activity in clinical investigations of pediatric epilepsy. There is little fundamental understanding about the (temporal) transition to seizure and we hope that understanding in a model system a (parameter driven) transition could be useful. Model systems are important in biology and physics. We hope that establishing a framework to analyze neural cell cultures will help normalize investigations which would otherwise be disconnected. The PIs will work with the electron microscopy program at Chicago State, a historically minority serving university. CSU students will be engaged in data analysis both as a component of their training in microscopy techniques and as full partners in the research.<br/><br/>The PIs specifically ask: What does it mean to have a balanced network that can spontaneously fire without complete synchrony? Can one control the transitions from one generic dynamical phase to another? Is there emergent spatial and temporal scaling at such a transition? Are there qualitative differences between networks with long- and short-range correlations? This work is intended to build a framework that can be applied in the future to the growing number of published connectomic datasets derived from different brain regions and other ex vivo experimental platforms such as living brain slices/organoids and inform the analysis of large scale connectomics in whole brains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy-harvesting devices operate on energy derived from ambient environmental sources or human activities. However, due to the limited energy density and irregular energy profile of different energy sources, such self-powered devices should be extremely energy-efficient and functional even under fluctuating supply voltages. Nowadays, most devices based on conventional synchronous (clocked) digital designs are extremely power-hungry, with the clock accounting for a significantly large portion of the consumed energy. Moreover, device miniaturization results in major design challenges, which makes clocked designs more susceptible to supply-voltage variations and unsuitable for devices operating on harvested energy. Asynchronous (clockless) designs can resolve the power inefficiencies associated with clocked designs, and have the potential to bring a whole class of applications into the domain serviceable by energy harvesting. With this vision, the primary objective of this project is to design error-resilient asynchronous circuits, which can create a venue to implement robust, unsupervised, maintenance-free, safe, sustainable, and low-power electronics for numerous energy harvesting-powered applications in different sectors, such as medical, space, defense, automobile, power industry, etc.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a robust, reliable, and error-tolerant Quasi Delay Insensitive (QDI) asynchronous architecture for ultra-low power applications, which can perform energy-efficient computation and provide protection against radiation-induced transient errors in unsupervised scenarios. While numerous error-detection and -mitigation techniques exist for synchronous designs, there are very few for QDI asynchronous circuits. Also, the existing methods have major limitations, such as failure to ensure complete resilience, failure to halt error propagation in QDI pipelines, failure to circumvent duplication resulting in latency, energy, and area overhead, etc. This project aims to address these limitations by conducting research in two phases. The first phase will focus on 1) systematically analyzing the error response of QDI asynchronous circuits, and 2) developing a scalable and efficient formal framework to identify vulnerable components in both the data path and control path. The second phase will leverage the framework developed in the first phase to 1) critically analyze the vulnerable components and critical paths, 2) investigate possible architectural modifications for complete error-resilience, 3) ensure proper actions to prevent fault propagation through the QDI pipeline, and 4) perform cost/performance trade-off analysis of the newly developed architecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These records will document the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate phenomenon during the last 3000 years. Today, ENSO drives changes in weather patterns around the globe every few years. It originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere and can have severe and far-reaching impacts that affect the natural environment and the lives of billions of people. A series of extreme El Nio events over the last several decades suggests that rising atmospheric greenhouse gases may be causing ENSO events to intensify. However, how ENSO may change in a warmer world is not well known. Advances in understanding ENSO are currently limited by the short duration of instrumental sea surface temperature records. Approaches that use paleoclimate proxy data provide a way to produce temperature estimates from before the instrumental era. However, those longer proxy temperature records rely on sparse networks of coral-based records. This project will reduce that data gap by producing ~40 new decades-long coral-based temperature records from the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. The project?s education and outreach activities include efforts to recruit and retain undergraduates in the earth sciences and to strengthen active learning in the Florida State University undergraduate curriculum. They also include development of cross-disciplinary graduate research opportunities and efforts to improve science literacy in northern Florida high schools. The project includes four years of graduate student support and support for undergraduate researchers each year.<br/><br/>The project will generate 40 new quantitative temperature records over the last 3,000 years from key regions of the equatorial Pacific Ocean spanning the eastern edge of the warm pool to the core of the cold tongue. An ensemble reconstruction approach will use smaller, more widely available coral archives than have traditionally been used in the past ? coral rubble ? and measurements will combine traditional Sr/Ca measurements with newer Sr-U techniques. Rigorous screening tools for diagenesis, including microscale analyses, will be employed to extract reliable climate information from the fossil records. The reconstructions will provide unprecedented quantitative constraints on the evolution of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures on seasonal to millennial time scales, including characterizing whether and how the statistics of extreme ENSO events have changed since the industrial era, relative to the prior 3,000 years of Earth history. The educational objectives of the project will increase the scope and impact of the research, while also addressing outstanding needs in geoscience education. These educational objectives focus on expanding professional development opportunities, skill building, and leadership training for graduate students and postdocs entering the scientific workforce.

Holding the workshop in conjunction with ALS gives students an opportunity to participate in a research workshop in addition to their courses. Participating American scholars and students will interact with African scholars and students, learning about African languages directly from speaker-linguists, spurring collaborative projects, and training the next generation of scientists to study this important aspect of language that has potential to inform not only linguistic theory but also language education, translation, and cross-cultural understanding.<br/><br/>Information structure can involve a word or phrase being emphasized or made prominent. This can be conveyed through word order, focus words, special pronouns, or prosodic changes (e.g., higher pitch, longer duration). African languages use all of these methods in complex and intricate ways, but they have been relatively underrepresented in the scientific literature on information structure, limiting our understanding. Information structure can be investigated through the lens of language processing, social language use, language contact, and in signed languages as well as spoken languages. The workshop will feature all of these methodologies and domains of study, along with many others, in order to broaden our scientific knowledge of information structure.

Previous studies of individual cave-adapted species from the same locations suggest that complex biological interactions within and among species have occurred over time. However, it is unclear how long it takes to form a cave ecosystem and how ecosystem functions are maintained through time. On Hawai?i Island, continuous volcanic activities over hundreds of thousands of years created subterranean habitats, known as lava tubes, that are of different geologic ages and represent distinct eco-evo ?islands.? Diverse yet understudied communities of cave-adapted arthropod species live in these Hawaiian lava tubes and are sustained by the roots of the native pioneer tree, ?hi'a. The project will result in several major advancements, including documenting and describing new species occurrences and distributions, as well as obtaining ecological and genetic data for the lava tubes and species, both of which will serve as significant breakthroughs for Hawai?i, where island biodiversity loss has reached unprecedented levels. The project places a strong emphasis on the local Native Hawaiian community, and will support educating the next generation of diverse scientists and the public about integrative biological research by including: (1) year-long cross-disciplinary research internships for undergraduate students in Hawai?i, (2) collaborative training for students and researchers in biodiversity, ecology, and molecular genetics, and (3) renovation of the Hawaiian Cave Arthropod Exhibit at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawai?i, which will include the development of public outreach programs and K-12 educational materials. <br/><br/>This project uses an integrative approach to understand how ecological interactions and evolutionary chance generate biodiversity and support the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of subterranean arthropod communities across different spatial and geological scales. With the potential to discover more subterranean arthropod diversity, this research involves systematic biological surveys of under- or unexplored lava tubes on Hawai?i Island to determine community-level diversity patterns that can be compared to estimated species richness and alpha (within community) and beta (among communities) diversity. Ecological niches and species interactions that define functional diversity will be evaluated using stable isotope ratio analysis of arthropods and diet resources.

Power distribution systems are responsible for connecting customers to the main grid and balancing the instantaneous generation-load mismatch at each customer. As power flows in the distribution systems become highly volatile and bidirectional, it is of crucial importance to gain situational awareness in real time such that grid operators can assess and enhance the renewable energy hosting capacity, and customers can reliably, resiliently, and efficiently buy/sell electricity to meet their needs. As a variety of data sources are being populated in distribution systems, the fundamental question remains how to extract and integrate the information to construct a complete picture of distribution system operation. Existing methods have not fully considered the complicated measurement environment pertaining to power distribution systems, and cannot produce accurate and reliable results when the measurements have diverse sampling rates, sampling times, accuracy classes, and with limited communication support. This project will develop transformative concepts and methodologies to comprehensively address the outstanding challenges in tracking the operating states of distribution systems. The outcomes of the project will fully bring out the potential of various sensor assets for distribution system situational awareness, which will serve as the foundation of intelligent decision making processes for accommodating the volatile but pervasive distributed renewable energy generation across the grid. The project will feature a Seeable Electrical Energy Distribution (SEED) program to integrate research with education. It will develop a simulation and visualization platform for a close-to-real synthetic distribution system ?operating? in real time 24/7, providing educational experience to the wide public that has not been possible without entering control rooms of a utility company. The platform will also serve as a public data portal for researchers around the nation, facilitating data availability and research reproducibility across the whole technical community.<br/><br/>State estimation is a key technology for enabling the situational awareness of distribution systems and massive integration of distributed renewable energy generation. The existing distribution system state estimation methods largely inherit mature concepts from state estimation of high-voltage transmission systems, and do not fully consider or address the unique complicated measurement environment in distribution systems, including the unknown continuous-time state transition model, asynchronous and multi-rate measurements, unknown and time-varying measurement error statistics, and limited sampling rates and communication bandwidth. This project will propose a revolutionary distribution system state estimation paradigm that will transform the situational awareness of distribution systems for accommodating massive and pervasive renewable energy integration and demand response. We will develop new concepts and methodologies that result in a holistic solution allowing 1) learning-based continuous-time system dynamics modeling, 2) seamless fusion of asynchronous and multi-rate measurements arriving at any continuous time instants, 3) adaptive near-optimal estimation under unknown and time-varying measurement error statistics, and 4) proactive scheduling of sensor sampling times to maximize observability and minimize communication congestion using clustering. With the continuous-time data fusion feature, the proposed paradigm will replace the conventional discrete-time step-by-step estimation paradigm and reshape the field of distribution system state estimation. In a unique Seeable Electrical Energy Distribution (SEED) program, generative adversarial network will be exploited to synthesize distributed renewable energy and load data, which cannot be distinguished from real-world data yet do not have proprietary issues and can be freely distributed and reused by the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An organism?s DNA can be separated into two categories: coding DNA, which has the directions for how to build proteins ? the molecular machines of the cell, and non-coding DNA, which has many functions including the instructions for when, where, and how much protein should be built. The majority of the human genome is non-coding DNA, and its proper functioning is essential for life. This project aims to decipher some of the rules that govern function of non-coding DNA in the innate immune response to infection and to compare these rules to non-coding DNA needed for other biological processes. Success will give scientists specific information about how non-coding DNA orchestrates the immune response and a deeper understanding about how a large part of the genome functions in general. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate and be trained in the work. This project also includes a broader impacts plan to improve quantitative literacy among biology undergraduate and graduate students, which will better equip them for modern jobs that increasingly require quantitative skills.<br/><br/>Virtually every biological process, from development to immunity, is controlled by a gene regulatory network (GRN), a network of signaling molecules and transcription factors that control gene expression. Years of work have uncovered how the sequence of regulatory DNA, e.g. promoters and enhancers, can specify a GRN?s function. This work largely has focused on developmental GRNs, which are uniquely constrained by evolution: selection favors GRNs that drive a stereotyped developmental program in spite of perturbations. To decipher which principles of developmental GRNs translate to lesser studied non-developmental GRNs, which have diverse functions and are subject to different evolutionary pressures, this project will study the Drosophila innate immunity GRN. In Aim 1, allele-specific RNA-seq will be used to characterize the natural variation in transcriptional response to infection between D. melanogaster lines. These data will allow the identification of genes whose expression variation is driven by changes in regulatory DNA. Comparisons of the pattern of expression variation using different infection conditions will be made. In Aim 2, in vivo and in vitro functional genomics assays will be used to identify immune-responsive enhancers and to generate sequence-to-function models of these enhancers. Additional experiments will validate and refine the models of enhancer function. The project also includes a plan to implement problem-based learning of numerical literacy components into a large, undergraduate class, which will improve the quantitive skills of biology students and be disseminated for use by others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current language learning methods focus on rote memorization and not nearly enough on using the language. Experiential learning opportunities in which students have free-flowing conversations driven by interests are often not introduced until the third or fourth semester of language study. The result is that American students graduate with little ability or motivation to actually use a foreign language and maintain any degree of language fluency. Using novel machine learning technologies and game design, this project will let students learn a language while texting with their friends and help teachers facilitate conversation-based learning in their classrooms. The project will offer opportunities for students in classes located in the US to interact with students in other countries around the globe, turning textbook abstractions into real people, culture, and language. Ultimately, these machine learning solutions enable a platform that the 1.2 billion individuals learning language worldwide can use to supplement textbook instruction with experiential learning for greater long-term fluency.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art machine learning solution to address critical challenges in the implementation of<br/>conversation-based language learning. Learning languages through conversation has been shown by previous research to be engaging and effective. However, beginners are often<br/>uncomfortable in the early days because they aren?t confident in expressing themselves. Educators can provide the needed support, but it is difficult for them to give every student<br/>personalized tutelage. This project will jumpstart these initial conversations with the help of in-chat translation, dictionaries, and grammar checking. To cement learning, the project will generate practice activities directly from chats and deliver the activities in the context of those authentic text conversations. This project will analyze the text chats and form hypotheses about student strengths and weaknesses. The system will then test these hypotheses with assessments automatically generated from the same text chats. The Phase I technical objectives are to 1) automatically identify examples of learning objectives in student text 2) align system-generated and human-authored assessment activities and 3) predict student scores on practice activities with increasing accuracy. Over time, the system will understand student needs to maximize learning and engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Arctic Ocean, while remote, is not immune; recent work has found microplastics in all components of the Arctic system, including within the floating sea ice cover. While marine microplastics are ubiquitous, the physical characteristics of the polar oceans, including sea ice, lead to effects unique to the polar regions. For example, microplastics may have an impact on climate by darkening the usually bright white sea ice and its overlying snow cover, which would result in an increase in the absorption of sunlight and thus in warming and melting. Furthermore, the presence of sea ice affects where microplastics are found within the Arctic, as sea ice and the underlying ocean transport microplastics differently. This project is addressing both of these processes. As microplastics are a global problem with potential impact on the health of the marine ecosystem, understanding the way sea ice and microplastics interact is crucial for informing strategies to deal with this pollution in the future. <br/><br/>In this interdisciplinary research project, laboratory studies and numerical models are being used together to make progress in understanding the interactions between Arctic sea ice and microplastics. The researchers are developing new laboratory techniques to understand the exchange of microplastics between sea ice and the ocean during uptake and release, including the effect of marine gels on this process. They are also measuring the effects of the optical properties of microplastics on the mass balance of sea ice. Based on those laboratory insights, they are developing and testing parameterizations for including microplastics in open-source, community sea ice, ocean, and climate models. Both one-dimensional (i.e., vertical column) and three-dimensional (i.e., full sea ice/ocean-coupled) models are being modified from existing code and run. Hindcast and future simulations are being performed to assess the impact of including microplastic ice-ocean exchange parameterizations on the large-scale distribution of microplastics in the Arctic Seas and their impact on climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PIs will image the activity of every neuron and muscle cell during re-aggregation of Hydra, and analyze it with novel imaging, statistical and mathematical tools, correlating the emergence of phase transitions in the neuronal and muscle activity with the appearance of specific behaviors. This work will provide a deep insight into algorithms and mechanisms of self-assembly, with important repercussions for control theory, neuroscience, soft-matter physics, robotics and network science. Due to Hydra's extreme regenerative ability, this work may enable synthetic biology of an organism with a nervous system; and the work will have future repercussions for the field of neuroregeneration. The techniques developed for tracking of neurons in a moving and distorting animal will be made widely available and will be of use in other systems. The study of Hydra with the proposed integrated imaging/computational approach will serve as an imaginatively appealing platform for a range of outreach opportunities introducing members of the general public to mathematical neuroscience, and training opportunities for students at all levels. In particular, the Hydra system can be deeply integrated into the full spectrum of courses at the Marine Biological Laboratory and provide cross-cutting projects for students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>One of the most fascinating aspects of biological organisms is their self-assembly: bodies put themselves together without external directions, to yield robust, resilient and adaptive living systems. This is particular dramatic in the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris. This small, transparent polyp has unique regenerative properties, demonstrated in the ability to completely regenerate itself after its body has been dissociated into individual cells. This remarkable self assembly, regenerating a normal animal, is complete within a few days, occurs robustly in culture dishes under a microscope and has surprisingly not yet been studied systematically.

In order for intelligent machines to be able to understand and assist humans in realistic settings, they must be able to understand these objects from vision, and especially in unconstrained realistic settings. This understanding must include understanding the interactions as they occur, as well as recognizing the opportunity for interaction (i.e., that a cabinet could be interacted with even when it is untouched). These abilities are beyond the capabilities of current AI systems since these largely deal with interactive objects in restricted settings such as simulation engines. This project aims to build AI systems that can learn these properties by combining knowledge from large-scale first-person-view video demonstrations of interactions by humans as well as from 3D simulators that do not include interaction. The project has the potential to enhance efforts in many other disciplines, for instance robotics or assistive technology for people, due to the ubiquity and importance of these interactive objects.

The first direction aims to build detailed 3D models of articulating objects in unconstrained first person-video. Building on this physical understanding of articulation, the second direction plans to enhance this physical understanding with information about how a human would achieve the interaction and what it might accomplish or reveal about the scene. The third effort aims to enable understanding of articulations before they occur by building associations in 3D across frames of a video, letting a system associate and learn from examples of ongoing interactions.

The REU provides research experiences in calculus on time scales, a branch of mathematics that unifies and extends the common calculus and related theories, and has applications in mathematical biology, engineering, finance, and statistics, among others. Students improve their research abilities as well as their technical, oral, and written communication skills and acquire an understanding of educational and career opportunities available beyond an undergraduate degree. Participants are required to present their work based on the program projects at an annual local undergraduate research symposium and encouraged and assisted in preparing peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>Each summer, ten undergraduate students, with roughly half from schools in the Appalachian region, are recruited to attend an eight-week long REU site. The first week of the program is dedicated to building the mathematical and programming prerequisites of participants, and to the formulation of research projects connecting calculus on time scales with control theory, special functions theory, and probability theory. Students provide reports of progress to advisors each week and present their work to all participants on Fridays. Professional development opportunities are offered on how to apply for graduate school, on strategies for effectively working in a group environment, on software systems for scientific document preparation, and on giving technical presentations. Participants are also exposed to other research areas in mathematics through a weekly Distinguished Speakers Series. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies of individual cave-adapted species from the same locations suggest that complex biological interactions within and among species have occurred over time. However, it is unclear how long it takes to form a cave ecosystem and how ecosystem functions are maintained through time. On Hawai?i Island, continuous volcanic activities over hundreds of thousands of years created subterranean habitats, known as lava tubes, that are of different geologic ages and represent distinct eco-evo ?islands.? Diverse yet understudied communities of cave-adapted arthropod species live in these Hawaiian lava tubes and are sustained by the roots of the native pioneer tree, ?hi'a. The project will result in several major advancements, including documenting and describing new species occurrences and distributions, as well as obtaining ecological and genetic data for the lava tubes and species, both of which will serve as significant breakthroughs for Hawai?i, where island biodiversity loss has reached unprecedented levels. The project places a strong emphasis on the local Native Hawaiian community, and will support educating the next generation of diverse scientists and the public about integrative biological research by including: (1) year-long cross-disciplinary research internships for undergraduate students in Hawai?i, (2) collaborative training for students and researchers in biodiversity, ecology, and molecular genetics, and (3) renovation of the Hawaiian Cave Arthropod Exhibit at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawai?i, which will include the development of public outreach programs and K-12 educational materials. <br/><br/>This project uses an integrative approach to understand how ecological interactions and evolutionary chance generate biodiversity and support the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of subterranean arthropod communities across different spatial and geological scales. With the potential to discover more subterranean arthropod diversity, this research involves systematic biological surveys of under- or unexplored lava tubes on Hawai?i Island to determine community-level diversity patterns that can be compared to estimated species richness and alpha (within community) and beta (among communities) diversity. Ecological niches and species interactions that define functional diversity will be evaluated using stable isotope ratio analysis of arthropods and diet resources. Phylogenetic diversities will determine the extent of parallel diversification across lineages, communities, and niches. The uncovered ecological and evolutionary relationships establish the importance of ecosystem-level feedbacks among different diversity-regulating processes (i.e., food web interactions, population dynamics, speciation) that govern subterranean ecosystem creation and maintenance through time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies have found that in many languages children?s learning of passives occurs late in the language acquisition process, but not all types of passives are acquired equally late. 'Long' passives ? those in which the agent is expressed ('the cat' above) ? are more difficult for young children to understand and less frequently produced than 'short' passives ? those in which the agent is left implicit (as in, ?The mouse was chased?). This dissertation investigates why passives, especially long passives, are difficult for children. Following theoretically-based predictions, we will test whether children's difficulty is reduced when the two nouns are more distinct (e.g., one is singular and the other plural). Our experimental results will provide a developmental timeline that speech-language professionals can use as a reference to determine whether a child is delayed in the acquisition of passives and/or whether s/he suffers from a language disorder. Understanding why passives are difficult can aid the development of better materials to treat children with language delays as well as people suffering from agrammatic aphasia, who also have difficulties with passives. This project also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to partake in experimental research and data analysis, thereby training the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This dissertation examines 3- to 6-year-old children's acquisition of passives via 3 behavioral experiments and statistical analysis of a large body (corpus) of previously collected data. The corpus study describes and compares children's production of passives with passives in their caretakers' speech, using data from CHILDES (MacWhinney 2000) to understand the role of language input in the process of passive acquisition. The behavioral experiments focus on children's comprehension of passives. Experiment 1 aims to compare children's understanding of active sentences, long passives, and short passives in a picture-selection task. Experiments 2 and 3 use the same technique to investigate the role of two properties of nouns that are potential factors in the acquisition of passives. This research provides a more comprehensive study of passive acquisition than is available in the existing literature, improving our understanding of how children learn language, and it helps to adjudicate between competing theories of grammar that make opposing predictions about the outcome of the passive comprehension experiments, yielding insight into how human language works.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Based on vast available experimental results and expertise in multiple domains, there is a significant potential to use cantilever-based systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses binding by responding to the added mass. This approach will enable real time monitoring and handling the COVID-19 pandemic and will enable the observation of the infection and the transmission of the host for first time. However, the exploitation of cantilever devices for pathogen detection faces multiple hurdles, in addition to technical challenges, as high selectivity to the targeted virus or biomarker is required. To become practical these instruments need a technology for functionalization of the cantilevers that will make them stable in air and liquids for hours. This will allow the sensors to work in real time, thus breaking the current pathogen diagnostics paradigm. <br/><br/>In this project the PIs will develop such functionalization of existing micro-cantilevers. They will develop a method for small pitch immobilization of antibodies selectively on the surface of the active cantilevers. The proposed project explores function-driven design of materials and technology to address the problem of real time detection of active viruses like SARS-CoV-2. The integrated approach developed in this project is versatile and transferable in developing proteins/antibody coatings for many other applications. Moreover, the proposed project, with its integration of material synthesis, UV exposure/patterning, characterization, and performance evaluation in the targeted applications, will serve as an excellent educational platform for participating graduate students to experience the full range of challenges in the cross-linking domains of microelectronics, biochemistry and health.<br/><br/>Specifically, these goals will be achieved through the combination of coating of fluorescent tagged antibody solutions in combination with maskless UV photoinduced patterning for immobilization that ensures selective binding of active viruses on cantilevers. The versatile approach of the PIs will include application of different benzophenone class of compound radicals generated by UV light and capable of reliably binding the targeted spike protein?s antibody at the molecular level. Specific goals of this project are the identification and testing of UV maskless technology for selective immobilization of spike protein antibodies on piezoresistive MEMS cantilevers as well as optimizing the parameters of the detection system in order to achieve short detection time and high sensitivity. To achieve noise-free operation, application-specific arrays of active and reference piezoresistive cantilevers will be used. To ensure detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in air/aerosol by affinity reactions, small pitch patterns will be selectively coated, exploiting maskless UV photoinduced protein immobilization of antibodies. Specifically, the PIs will focus on the selective functionalization of the optimized cantilevers in synergy with novel measuring methods for detecting the mass of ultra-small pathogens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These symposia were established in 2002 to bring together, for the purposes of scientific discussion and interactions, recent PhD graduates in physical oceanography who represent their employing institutions. Once selected to be a participant at these meetings, these individuals will be required to present their dissertation research in front of their professional peers and to forge professional relationships between the participants that will facilitate their future research and academic careers at their employing institutions. This program is modeled after the highly successful Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography (DISCO) meetings, which were first held in 1978, and is formatted in a similar manner. It is anticipated that the PODS symposia will be held in parallel with the DISCO symposia. Support for the DISCO meetings is covered under a separate grant, but interactions between the two groups are an integral part of the goals of the proposed PODS symposia. The PODS symposia will produce a cohort group of early career professionals in the field of physical oceanography from widely differing backgrounds and geographical origins, serving to create a peer mentoring group that will last throughout their careers. In addition, the cross-disciplinary contacts arising from the combination of the PODS and DISCO meetings will foster future inter-disciplinary understanding and collaborations, benefitting their employing institutions. Thus, the PODS participants will be uniquely situated to take advantage of networking between individuals and groups, which is of great importance to foster advances in scientific knowledge and preparedness to meet upcoming environmental challenges. These PODS attendees play a critical role in improving our understanding of ocean and earth science processes, which provide the scientific framework vital for developing rational climate-related policies. In addition, as a minority institution, the University of Hawaii fosters interactions between traditionally under-represented groups and minorities. Planned meeting activities include interactions between meeting participants and students, particularly undergraduates in the Department of Oceanography?s Global Environmental Sciences program.<br/><br/>A broad international announcement of the PODS symposia will be made to physical oceanographers working at academic institutions in both the US and other countries to develop an applicant pool. From this pool, agency personnel will select invitees. The meeting will consist of a series of sessions grouped by research subject area that are chaired by selected invitees and will also include participant-led discussion periods. In addition to an initial presentation by an invited senior scientist in the field, there will also be presentations by, and discussion with, agency personnel explaining funding mechanisms and strategies. Participants will form breakout groups to discuss current issues in research, as well as obstacles and opportunities to career paths in the field, then provide feedback to agency personnel through formal presentations. By bringing the two separate symposia invitees together in evening discussion sessions revolving around specific topics, the goal is to broaden the disciplinary expertise of the participants, promote future collaborations, and to make connections between their research and the education of future generations of scientists. The funds in this project will cover meeting venue rentals, audio-visual support costs, as well as participant support related costs of air travel, hotel accommodation, and M&IE that are not provided as part of the symposium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The explosivity of a volcanic eruption is controlled in part by how fast magma rises in the conduit. Directly measuring magma ascent is challenging because it takes place underground and in a dangerous environment. Small blebs of frozen magma trapped in crystals, called embayments, may preserve a record of ascent rate in the form of chemical diffusion gradients that scientists can apply as a kind of magma speedometer. This embayment technique has been increasingly used to understand the dynamics of ancient volcanic eruptions. As this speedometer technique grows in popularity, validating its accuracy is important. Here, a series of laboratory experiments conducted using real magma at magmatic temperatures and pressures will recreate magma ascent under controlled conditions to test how well embayments record this process. Careful comparison between the controlled lab conditions and the diffusion gradients in the experimental embayments will clarify ?if? and ?how?? embayments faithfully record magmatic ascent. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in research methods at CUNY and Baylor. In addition, public outreach will be performed at the National Museum of Natural History and the NY Virtual Volcano Observatory in the form of ?Scientist-is-In? sessions and short-format educational videos on magma ascent.         <br/><br/>Quantifying the rate of magma ascent in the volcanic conduit is critical to understanding the timing, magnitude, and behavior of eruptions. Quenched pockets of melt preserved within embayments are thought to preserve such rates as compositional gradients controlled by diffusive equilibration. Past studies using embayments to determine magma ascent rates have used a few, carefully selected samples and have made reasonable, but untested, assumptions involving diffusion and decompression pathway. The key assumptions underlying embayment geospeedometry must be experimentally validated before it can be confidently used to advance the understanding of volcanic eruption dynamics. Here, the theoretical basis for embayment geospeedometry will be systematically tested against focused suites of natural samples and a series of decompression experiments using natural and synthetic embayments. Important tests include (1) discovering how well a single embayment represents a batch of magma, and (2) whether observed diffusion profiles match those predicted from experimental conditions and key assumptions. If the experimental embayments are shown to be robust, then embayment geospeedometry will become a valuable tool for understanding the conditions in volcanic conduits during eruption. If experimental diffusion profiles are instead shown to not match those predicted by experimental conditions then the experiments will provide an empirical framework for exploring the complexities recorded by embayments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary goal of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to collect time-sensitive online social media and crowd-sourced data and analyze patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The major focus will be towards understanding how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating risk and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread. The notion of influence will be captured by quantifying the network effects on such communication behavior and characterizing how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease. Given that communities responded to COVID-19 with limited or no preparation and there is uncertainty in the length of recovery for the communities already affected while new communities being threatened, the data collection effort requires rapid response for better coverage and careful monitoring. The data will include large-scale ephemeral online interactions of people in the affected communities and public officials who are involved in COVID-19 response, recovery, and mitigation efforts, followed by a data-driven network analytics and infographics of COVID-19 risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted. The proposed research will not only expand the knowledge base of spatio-temporal dynamics of risk perception and dissemination strategies in the emergence and aftermath of a major disease outbreak, but will also result in data-driven inference techniques to improve our understanding of how people express diverse concerns and how to harness and embed such information for designing intervention measures. The methodologies and findings of this rapid response research will benefit emergency management and public health agencies to define targeted information dissemination policies for public with diverse needs based on how people reacted to COVID-19 and their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards.<br/><br/>Public engagement in risk communication can lead to more effective decision-making and enhanced public feedback to the regulatory process. The primary goal of this RAPID project is to mine and analyze large-scale time-sensitive perishable crowd-sourced and social media data (rich spatio-temporal data) and reveal patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The specific aims are threefold: (1) to document how public interact and communicate health risk information through their online social networks during a major disease outbreak; (2) to authenticate data from multiple sources and detect anomalies to avoid information overload and spread of misinformation; and (3) to examine how online social networks influence protective actions (e.g., social distancing, self-quarantine decisions) i.e. information cascades in health risk communication. To achieve the goal and aims, the project will utilize ephemeral time and geo-tagged social media interactions of users, agencies, news sources supplemented with crowd-sourced information on COVID-19. This study will have five theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature. It will: (1) advance our understanding of how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating health risks and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread; (2) inform the literature on how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease; (3) use novel machine-learning and network science models to quantify influence and network effects on such communication behavior; (4) capture the variability in network composition, risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted based on spatio-temporal correlations of risk and disease contagion; (5) ensure authenticity of the collected data from multiple sources and develop more accurate fully-distributed computational algorithms tailored to health risk anomaly detection in socio-technical systems. The findings from this research will be useful to public health and emergency management agencies for tailoring effective information dissemination policies for diverse user groups based on their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards. The methodologies, and implications of this research can be transferred in designing effective intervention policies to other natural and man-made disaster contexts in which public health risks become major concerns. The project will engage, mentor, and offer an innovative active learning environment for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students by giving priority to disadvantaged and underrepresented communities in USA.

The program, which is designed to address the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the polar geoscience workforce, will also train students in the process of co-production of knowledge with local communities in the Arctic. In addition to the inherent benefit of linking scientific progress to societal needs, undergraduate students' scientific motivations are increasingly focused on a desire to 'make a difference' that extends beyond collecting, synthesizing, and reporting data. The Polaris Project will develop an undergraduate student research and mentoring model that supports this need. The central element of the Polaris Project is the month-long summer experience, which includes a field expedition to the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta in Alaska, during which students will complete a research project of their own design. Expedition participants tackle an issue of great scientific and societal importance, the impacts of fire and permafrost thaw on the vulnerability of the Arctic landscape. As part of the expedition, students and faculty will also spend time interacting with and learning from local and indigenous residents of Alaska who are experiencing the effects of the changing environment first-hand. <br/><br/>Engaging with local and indigenous Arctic communities in the generation of scientific knowledge is critical to understanding the Arctic system and to applying this knowledge to effectively address societal needs at local to global scales. The project will develop a model for undergraduate education that includes conducting scientific research combined with invaluable expertise, training, and input from local and indigenous communities. Evaluation of the model will improve our understanding of how to design projects that engage undergraduates in research that encompasses co-production of knowledge with local communities, and particularly in arctic-related science in Alaska.

Such large-scale flooding has the potential to transport chemical agents and microbial pathogens and contaminate groundwater. Water wells in the region affected by flooding will be sampled, to assess groundwater quality. The goal of this study is to advance knowledge of the impact of extreme flooding on groundwater quality in coastal Louisiana following hurricane Ida. <br/><br/>The sampling campaign includes collecting 150 samples from groundwater wells, at 1, 3 and 6 months after Hurricane Ida.

Such failures are very complex, with human errors often arising as a result of unexpected interactions between system automation and human behavior.  Thus, researchers have investigated how formal methods tools and techniques, which have been developed to mathematically prove properties about complex computer systems, can be adapted to human-automation interaction (HAI) problems. These techniques are powerful and capable of discovering unexpected, critical human errors and system failures. However, existing techniques do not provide a means for fixing discovered human errors. Further, interface changes both introduce new unforeseen errors and risk negative transfer effects, where changes that conflict with previously learned behaviors can also cause problems.  This project will investigate a novel approach to HAI evaluation and repair that will help designers and analysts efficiently eliminate many kinds of potential interaction errors  while minimizing the risk of introducing additional human errors. The developed methods will be validated in design cases of real safety-critical systems including an industrial furnace, nuclear power plant procedures, a radiation therapy machine, and pharmacy medication dispensing processes. The knowledge and tools produced in this research will be made available to researchers and designers and have potential applications to a wide range of many safety-critical systems. This, in turn, will help avoid system disasters, prevent injuries, save lives, and protect critical resources across society.<br/><br/>The project is divided into three main thrusts.  First, the team will develop a theoretically grounded method for scoring the likelihood that humans will behave erroneously for a given HAI design through a novel synthesis of formal methods, erroneous human behavior models, negative transfer theory, and human reliability analyses. Second, it will introduce a new theory of formal model repair in interactive systems that will underlie the development of methods for removing problematic HAI errors by adapting both human-machine interfaces and the workflow of the associated tasks.  Third, the scoring and model repair methods will be combined to allow automated model repair to find design interventions that will reduce the likelihood of changes causing problematic human errors, using a database of common error patterns and solutions to be developed through the project. Across all three of these thrusts, the team will use human subject experiments, testing, and formal proofs to validate that the advances achieve their hypothesized capabilities.  The work will lead to improved methods for evaluating human reliability aspects of interfaces, widen the application of formal methods to new contexts, and provide resources for researchers, designers, and engineers to improve the reliability of cyber-human systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is becoming increasingly important for government agencies, policy makers, and emergency management officials to be capable of addressing major crisis scenarios under acute time and resource constraints. Using social media platforms more efficiently would be a critical step towards this vision.  For example, such communications platforms could to be leveraged to better communicate the COVID-19 risk.

Previous scholarship on such communities has studied the cultural resilience of already-established ethnic groups, focusing on historical accounts of how enslaved or colonized peoples endured their social predicament by maintaining traditions, developing common cultural symbols, or participating in public political actions. Archaeology, with its unique ability to trace the materials and spaces people used across time, is well positioned to offer important new insights into the formation and persistence of ethnically diverse communities. It can reveal the more inconspicuous practices and hidden interactions whereby people living under social duress sought to work across ethnic boundaries, form social ties, and bolster their autonomy in the face of authoritarian rule. Many of these practices were meant to be covert, and therefore they are not contained in the written histories or administrative documents of dominant regimes. In terms of broader scientific impacts, the project trains U.S. students in advanced scientific methods, and creates a permanent laboratory and museum space for social science, environmental, and cultural heritage research in South America.<br/><br/>Dr. Kosiba and the research team will combine archaeological and historical methods to study labor conditions in an authoritarian state, with emphasis on whether and how subject laborers founded communities by orchestrating a hidden economy. The project focuses on Rumiqolqa, a massive labor colony in Cuzco, Peru where forcibly relocated workers from various Andean ethnicities quarried stone for successive Inca and then Spanish imperial regimes (AD 1450-1650). Preliminary archaeological research indicates that Inca and Spanish authorities segregated and confined laborers at Rumiqolqa, but archival studies demonstrate that these laborers banded together and founded a new community that persisted for centuries. The research tests the hypothesis that, despite persistent imperial attempts to restrict interaction and cultural expression within the colony, these laborers coordinated domestic tasks and other production routines in inconspicuous ways to empower a community that was beyond the view of authorities. Detailed archaeological mapping and excavations will record the architecture of the colony, revealing how Inca and Spanish regimes constrained interactions among laborers. Excavations of neighborhoods and work areas will uncover the practices through which the laborers integrated communities by pooling labor, establishing clandestine trade networks, or sharing resources. Archival studies and analyses of human burials will provide unprecedented information on the ethnic claims, physical trauma, health, nutrition, and individual status of indigenous Andean people who labored for Inca and Spanish empires. To link together and analyze these types of evidence, the project assembles a digital database that will benefit archaeological science by developing a method for the systematic documentation and analysis of artifacts and materials across space and time."

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world?s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease. Ultimately, this project will generate conditions, in parameter space, for the effective control or elimination of malaria using existing insecticides-based resources, thereby contributing to the global malaria eradication efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This warming has increased disturbances such as wildfire as well as thawing of permafrost in ecosystems of Northern Alaska.  As a result of this warming and increased disturbance, animal and plant communities on land and in streams and lakes are changing.  Underlying these community changes are changes in the availability and cycling of nutrients, in the amount of carbon stored in soils and vegetation, and in the exchange of carbon dioxide and nutrients between arctic landscapes and the atmosphere and downstream rivers and oceans. Collectively, these changes may have profound effects, not just on the arctic ecosystems, but globally, with implications for humans. A better understanding of these changes can lead to better predictions of the future, and those predictions could provide the basis for better planning. To understand these changes, scientists with the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (ARC-LTER) Project monitor long-term changes in terrestrial, stream, and lake ecosystems in the vicinity of Toolik Lake, Alaska.  They make observations of the recovery of these ecosystems from natural and experimentally imposed disturbances, and initiate and maintain long-term experiments designed to understand interactions among arctic species, nutrient cycles, and the connections among terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the arctic landscape.  Scientists working at the ARC-LTER site will engage students from Barrow, Alaska, run a program for journalists, and participate in short courses for Alaskan Natives in three communities, all designed to increase the public understanding of Arctic Ecology.  Briefings to national and state land managers and resource managers will help provide scientific knowledge that can inform policy.<br/><br/>The research is organized around the concepts of ecosystem openness and landscape connectivity. Biogeochemical openness is the degree to which ecosystems depend on external sources of nutrients and organic carbon versus nutrients recycled within the ecosystem and organic carbon produced locally by photosynthesis.  Community openness is the degree to which the movement of organisms in and out of the ecosystem determines community and food-web structure.  Finally, landscape connectivity describes the nature and strength of interactions among ecosystems on the landscape and the resultant propagation of responses to disturbances across the landscape.  Components of the arctic landscape differ widely in biogeochemical and community openness.  Research at the ARC-LTER will compare key ecosystems of the Arctic to determine how their degree of openness governs their responses to climate variation and to acute disturbance such as fire and surface slumping associated with permafrost thaw.  The proposed research will also determine how the responses to climate and disturbance are mediated by landscape connectivity and the movement of nutrients, carbon, and organisms across arctic landscapes. To accomplish these goals, ARC-LTER research will include continued long-term fertilizer and warming experiments; monitoring of chemical budgets, community changes, and species movements; monitoring recovery of tundra, rivers, and lakes that were previously fertilized; establishing new larger greenhouses in different aged landscapes; blocking fish movement into a lake connected to migratory streams and adding fish to a lake currently isolated from a stream network; and searching for correlations between terrestrial production and aquatic metabolism and nutrient concentrations. This research will support two undergraduate student researchers per year and provide opportunities for students working on other projects to work on Arctic LTER sites and experiments."

It is estimated corporations are spending over $300 billion per year globally, paying down ?technical debt? on addressing issues related to maintaining legacy systems or dealing with bad software. By adopting the proposed technology, software development teams will avoid critical bugs that, in turn, will avoid financial loss. The proposed technology will help chief technology officers (CTOs) and chief information officers (CIOs)  - not only developers - carry out several critical activities including: gaining actionable insight into the state of their code; accurately estimating the scope and cost of code cleanup; and assessing code quality trends and how to repair these code quality issues. By carrying out these activities, the proposed technology will decrease the time, cost, and risk of code cleanup while improving team performance.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an intelligent refactoring bot that may be easily integrated into any project repository. The bot may be customized to monitor the quality in the repository after a number of pull-requests. The bot analyzes the changed files to identify refactoring opportunities using a set of quality attributes.  It will then find the best sequence of refactorings to fix the quality issues, if any. The developer is able to review the recommendations in the generated pull-request. The initial proof-of-concept of the proposed interactive refactoring software was tested on 12 large-scale, open-source, and industrial systems with a total of 37 developers from industry. The technology reduced the amount of time that developers spent to understand existing large-scale source code by an average of 47%. Existing refactoring products, when tested on the same systems, were able to reduce that time by less than 24% on average. In addition, the technology was able to detect and fix an average of 92% of existing design defects in these systems. In contrast, existing refactoring products were able to only detect an average of less than 76% of these defects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to develop analytical and experimental tools to evaluate the dynamics of organisms capable of extreme accelerations and applying these principles towards designing a jumping micro-scale robot, using click beetles as a case study organism. Click beetles belong to a group of organisms that use latches and springs to amplify their muscle power output and circumvent the same actuation limitations that currently cripple micro-robots. The current state of the art in modeling such organisms lack the proper dynamic considerations that would allow engineers to implement the appropriate principles to engineered systems. The techniques developed in this project are beneficial to both biology and engineering. The modeling approach creates a framework to analyze a diverse group of organisms that use springs and latches to move extremely fast. These bioinspired principles enable a design framework for micro-robots to direct power towards the robot?s components for locomotion and dissipate energy elsewhere to prevent mechanical failure. The bioinspired nature of this research makes it an excellent candidate for outreach. Outreach activities include workshops and summer camps for first-generation undergraduates and low income and unrepresented high and middle school students to encourage them to pursue higher education, especially in STEM-related fields. <br/><br/>This work will advance the fundamental knowledge of the dynamics of ultra-fast locomotion in biology and bio-inspired systems. Most of the literature studying these locomotion strategies in biological systems focus on observing the kinematics only or use overly simplified models for the dynamics. The modeling approach, namely mobility power flow provides insights into how an organism uses and augments muscle power output and how it transmits and dissipates this power for agile locomotion while mitigating damage. In the planned modeling approach, click beetles or micro-robots are represented as a global structure composed of substructures on elastic and rigid substrates to model various environments. Expressions for power transmission and dissipation through each substructure and at the junctions will be studied through mechanical mobility functions, which can be derived analytically or measured directly in experiments. The models and experimentation techniques will create a new pathway to study and design ultra-fast and small dynamic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spattering, the uncontrolled eruption of metal droplets, is a critical problem in LPBF systems and is a major cause of poor quality in components printed using the process. In spite of this, the fundamental reasons for spatter formation are not well understood and effective approaches for reducing spatter in LPBF are not available. This award supports fundamental research to understand spatter formation. The research team will perform experiments and computer simulations to observe the dynamic process of spatter formation and model the behavior of the molten metal pool to reveal the spatter formation mechanisms. The outcomes of the research will provide important guidance for optimizing the LPBF process to produce defect-free 3D printed metal parts. This will significantly expedite the applications of 3D printing in aerospace, biomedical, automotive, and other industries and will strengthen the manufacturing capability and competitiveness of U.S. industry. <br/><br/>Spatter formation in LPBF is a highly transient process with complex coupling of multi-physics. Due to a limited ability to observe and measure the controlling parameters with adequate spatial and temporal resolution, there is a lack of understanding of the fundamental physics of spatter formation in LPBF. The objectives of this research are to: (i) test the hypothesis that the spatter formation is caused by melt pool oscillation, (ii) test the hypothesis that melt pool oscillation is caused by three physics mechanisms (i.e., non-uniform laser absorption, random powder blocking, and random powder merging), and (iii) evaluate the significance of the three hypothetical mechanisms to melt pool oscillation and spatter formation. A synergistic experimental and numerical investigation will be performed to achieve the research objectives. On the experimental side, a novel two-view high-speed imaging system, including synchrotron-based, side-view, X-ray imaging and a visible-light camera at 45 degrees to the horizontal direction will be used to provide 3-dimensional information on the dynamic behavior of the powder particles, melt pool, depression zone, and spatters.

It is very common for students to begin study in these fields only to abruptly leave after a few courses, and this attrition disproportionately affects already underrepresented students such as women and students of color. One possible explanation is that undergraduate biology education largely relies on high-stakes quizzes and exams that students find demotivating, creating an intimidating ?weed out? culture. This is dismaying but at the same time, these students must master a high degree of content to successfully transition from community colleges to four-year programs and then to post-baccalaureate science programs or careers. This Research Coordination Network will advance undergraduate biology education by creating a network of scholars not only from biology but also from the field of the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) to identify and facilitate educator use of more effective, nontraditional approaches to assessment, grading, and feedback that nonetheless respect the constraints presented by a comprehensive biology education. The goal of this project is to improve assessment and feedback in undergraduate biology education such that we expand and diversify students studying in these fields while not sacrificing standards of excellence. <br/><br/>A diverse network representing institutions ranging from community colleges to primarily undergraduate liberal arts colleges to HBCUs to large research-focused universities will pursue the following aims: establish the research network; use quantitative and qualitative designs within these diverse range of institutions to identify sources of problematic assessments and feedback, use of novel approaches, and barriers to implementation of innovations; present at several leading biology and teaching conferences the insights on current barriers and challenges to undergraduate biology assessment and feedback; and use data gathered to formulate a full proposal that will implement and test effectiveness of novel approaches. The purpose of the current incubator is to clarify the current state in undergraduate biology education?the traditional methods still being used, new methods being attempted and their relative successes and failures, and the constraints and barriers particular to the study of biology that should be kept in mind in the development of any new tools. The results will form the basis for a larger study which will develop and test the effectiveness of new tools for assessment and feedback that encourage rather than discourage wide participation in the study of biology, thereby improving student learning and performance and producing a better prepared and more diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This project is being funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure as part of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is arguably the only mainstream 3D printing technique that works for both metals and ceramics. It has found growing applications in energy, aerospace, chemical, and other industries. In the binder jetting process, the 3D parts are printed layer by layer. On each layer, the powder bed is spread and microscopic droplets are deposited on selected locations on the powder bed.  These droplets penetrate into the bed and bind the particles together. Since the impacting speed of the droplet is rather high, it can significantly disturb the powder bed and cause pores in the 3D-printed parts. These pores can drastically reduce the strength and other mechanical properties of the products. This award supports fundamental research to understand the binder-powder interaction in binder jetting and identify technical solutions to eliminate the formation of large pores in the binder jetting products. This will significantly improve performance of parts fabricated with the binder jetting process and expand its applications in various industries. This will strengthen the manufacturing capability and competitiveness of U.S. industry by allowing for rapid fabrication of low-cost custom components for many different industries.<br/><br/>This research will investigate the binder-powder interaction in the binder jetting process. The research objective is to test the hypothesis that partially saturating (pre-wetting) the powder will suppress powder spattering and reduce pore formation by (i) accelerating binder absorption and (ii) increasing the cohesion of the powder bed. A synergistic experimental and numerical investigation will be performed to achieve the research objectives. On the experimental side, a customized binder jetting system will be established to enable controlled pre-wetting of the powder bed as well as the flexible adjustment of binder jetting parameters (e.g., droplet size, impact velocity, etc.). Parametric studies will be performed to identify the effects of binder jetting parameters and binder/powder material properties on the spatter/pore formation. In-situ high-speed X-ray imaging and ex-situ characterization will be used to observe the dynamic binder-powder interaction. On the modeling side, a multi-physics model that integrates the computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method will be used to simulate the binder-powder and powder-powder interactions during the binder jetting process. The combination of experimental and numerical results will be used to test the research hypothesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LPWANs enable low-power devices to transmit over long distances for various Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Today, LPWANs have a number of major limitations making their adoption challenging. First, they rely on wired infrastructure for integrating multiple networks to cover very large areas (e.g., smart city). Lack of proper infrastructure hinders their applicability to rural/remote wide-area applications such as agricultural (e.g., smart farming) and industrial IoT (e.g., oil-field monitoring). Second, rapid growth of LPWANs in the limited spectrum raises the challenge of coexistence. Third, current (non-cellular) LPWANs are not designed to effectively support mobile nodes, e.g., tractors and drones in smart farming. Finally, LPWANs are not yet designed to support real-time communication hindering their adoption for many applications (e.g., process control). This project will address these challenges by developing theoretical foundations and systems for SNOW (Sensor Network Over White Spaces), an LPWAN that exploits unused TV spectrum, called white spaces. The results are extendable to many other LPWANs. Due to abundant white spaces, this project will enable connectivity for many rural applications. It will integrate education through course development, student research, and outreach to minority/underrepresented and K-12 students. <br/><br/>This project will design and implement an LPWAN architecture and complete protocol stack based on SNOW to support scalable integration, coexistence, mobility, and real-time communication as follows. (1) It proposes a scalable seamless integration of multiple SNOWs by minimizing latency in the integrated network. Considering tradeoffs between quality and execution time, the solution approach includes both global optimization and fast heuristics. (2) It proposes a novel approach based on Reinforcement Learning to handle coexistence with many independent networks. This is done by developing an efficient Q-learning framework that is practical at low-power nodes. This will be the first Q-learning approach for LPWAN and for handling coexistence in a low-power network. (3) It proposes lightweight cross-layer approaches to enable mobility of SNOW nodes by handling Doppler effect as well as the effects of geospatial variation of white spaces. (4) It proposes a real-time communication framework for SNOW which will be the first result on real-time scheduling for LPWAN. (5) It will implement the proposed protocols on TI CC1310 and also on universal software radio peripheral devices. The protocols will be evaluated through experiments in two different radio environments -- an urban test-bed and an agricultural field piloting smart farming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly speaking, mathematical logic is the formal study of mathematical language and its meaning.  For example, the assertion ""between every two numbers, there is a third"" changes meaning depending on which ambient universe of ""numbers"" (integers, fractions, etc.) one is referring to.  Categorical logic provides tools for constructing a ""universal abstract universe"" in which the interpretation of mathematical statements captures their meanings in all possible ""real"" universes at once.  Descriptive set theory provides tools for classifying all such possible ""real"" universes, or in certain cases, proving that no such classification exists.  Recent work has pointed toward a deep connection between these two historically disparate subfields of logic, and this project aims to further develop this connection.<br/><br/>In this project the PI studies categorical logic and descriptive set theory as dual ""syntactic"" and ""semantic"" representations of infinitary propositional and first-order logic.  In the propositional setting, a long line of work points to locale theory (""point-free topology"") as an uncountable generalization of classical descriptive set theory in Polish and standard Borel spaces, and this project aims to extend this analogy by developing localic counterparts of more advanced classical techniques, such as projective sets, effective descriptive set theory, and forcing.  In the first-order setting, recent work by the PI has shown that the Joyal-Tierney representation theorem for toposes yields a duality between theories in infinitary first-order logic and their standard Borel groupoids of countable models.  This project aims to extend this duality to continuous logic for metric structures, which will involve first developing the foundations for a metric analog of topos theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interpretation of specific functional roles that each protein molecule plays in cell is thus critical for us to understand the fundamental principles of the biological processes and to design new drug treatments to regulate the processes for improving human health. The task is however highly non-trivial in modern molecular biology studies. The most accurate method to interpret protein biological functions is through structural biology and biochemistry experiments. But the cost of the experimental studies is high, and the process is too slow for large-scale application due to the involvement of manual skill and data processing. As a result, the majority of proteins in human and other important species remain unknown despite decades of efforts. The lack of genome-wide protein function information has significantly impeded the progress of system biology studies aiming at a comprehensive understanding of the life process. In this project, the investigators plan to develop advanced computational methods for automatic and yet reliable protein function annotations. The developed methods and databases will be freely released to the scientific community, which can be used for large-scale and genome-wide protein function annotation studies. The project will also provide opportunities to promote participations of underrepresented groups, including women and African Americans, in computational biology education and method developments.<br/><br/>Built on the assumption that similar sequences have similar function, a routine approach to computational protein function annotations is comparative modeling, which deduces functions of target proteins from known homologous proteins. However, the accuracy and coverage of the approach are limited due to the diversity of gene evolution. Significant progress has been recently achieved in protein 3D structure prediction and the state-of-the-art algorithms can generate high-quality structures for distant-homology proteins with an unprecedented capacity. This project seeks to explore various new ideas to enhance the accuracy of distant-homology protein function annotations by using 3D models from the cutting-edge protein structure predictions, with a focus on ligand-protein binding interactions, gene ontology and post-translational modifications. Meanwhile, thermal motion and intrinsic disordering of protein structures are integrated in the pipelines for better function annotations. While the proposed approaches do not expect to address all the fundamental issues, like the first-principle methods, as of how and why proteins fold and function, the success of the studies should help establish a practical knowledge-based relation of structure and function that can be used for genome-scale applications with models useful for guiding new experimental design, and thus significantly enhance the impact of protein structure modeling on biological studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computational methods trained to emulate this capability rely on observing millions of examples of visual input paired with human annotations. These computational methods have made great progress and are being increasingly adopted in many user-facing applications such as image search, automated image tagging, semi-autonomous navigation systems, smart virtual assistants, etc. However, the underlying visual recognition models in these systems often produce errors by associating sensitive variables of societal significance with their predictions. The goal of this project is to measure and mitigate such errors in a systematic fashion. For example, if a method is able to recognize images of scenes such as 'classroom', the goal of this project is to ensure that such predictions are obtained based on cues such as the presence of a whiteboard, chairs, desks, and other elements typically needed for a space to function as a classroom and not based on incidental elements such as the characteristics or attributes of people present in the classroom. To this end, this project aims to make it easier to determine to what extent methods for computational visual recognition rely on spurious associations with incidental elements.<br/><br/>This project will provide a study of societal biases present in current methods and models for computational visual recognition that are widely used as a source of generic visual representations. The developed methods will be based on solid foundations drawn from both the machine learning, computer vision, and software testing communities. The project introduces association tests to probe models trained under a variety of conditions to systematically disentangle the biases introduced during generic visual representation learning. The project will be 1) developing a general assessment methodology to measure various types of biases in generic visual representation learning, 2) proposing methods to diminish the impact of these biases in existing generic visual representation extraction models, and 3) measuring the impact of these biases on some key downstream tasks. These three research aims will be complemented by a comprehensive evaluation plan and broadening participation activities. This research effort will bring novel insights into the sources of biases in the predictions of computer vision models and methodologies to make informed decisions about the risks in the deployment of such models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of this persistent underrepresentation, Latinx K-12 students lack role models with careers in these fields -- especially in engineering. In addition, sometimes engineering in K-12 education is not presented in a way that excites the interests of students from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Having full representation from all groups that make up the rich and diverse talent in the U.S. is crucial to reach our full potential for advancement in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is important to understand how all students can be encouraged to pursue STEM degrees, particularly Latinx students in middle school. The purpose of this project is to explore how teachers, as immediate role models, can serve as mediators and agents of positive change for Latinx middle school students. Teachers can become agents of positive change when they learn how to integrate the knowledge, skills and experiences (also known as ""funds of knowledge"") that students bring into the classroom to engineering content. It is important for teachers to understand how engineering connects with the realities of Latinx students' lived experiences at home and at their communities to provide students with better opportunities to engage in engineering. This study seeks to build teacher capacity to help students link these in-school and out-of-school experiences. Doing so provides a foundation for students to get excited and feel empowered to become future engineers. By building a more inclusive learning environment for engineering education, teachers of K-12 students, including their Latinx students, can contribute to diversifying and increasing the numbers of students prepared to pursue careers in engineering.<br/><br/>Currently, there is little research around how to develop teachers' capacity to integrate funds of knowledge with engineering, or the impact of such integration on students. The goal of this project, therefore, is (1) to explore how and to what extent the integration of funds of knowledge with engineering design can facilitate Latinx students' interest in engineering, and (2) how to develop teachers' capacities for activating and acknowledging students' funds of knowledge. The project focuses on middle school students and teachers in a predominantly Latinx area in the U.S.-Mexico border with a high ELL population. It (1) offers teachers the opportunities, structure, and support to recognize, value, and activate Latinx students' funds of knowledge in relation to engineering; and (2) creates a structure and culture that helps Latinx students cultivate their own awareness of their funds of knowledge, as well as their interest in and knowledge of engineering. The sample includes eight middle school mathematics and science teachers, and one engineering teacher. Each teacher is expected to contribute to the development and implementation of curricula that integrate funds of knowledge in engineering contexts with at least one class of 25 students, totaling 225 students per year of implementation. This mixed methods study uses data from observations, interviews, digital logs, focus groups, artifacts and surveys, as well as both quantitative and qualitative analyses methods, to study how the integration of funds of knowledge and engineering occurs. The study addresses the need to promote a more equitable formation of engineers where diverse voices are acknowledged. Thus, the knowledge generated in this study is essential for creating future engineers and culturally responsive teachers. Most importantly, this study explores what teachers and schools can do to support engineering learning, excite students, and motivate them to become outstanding, creative, and productive engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heterogeneity is already in use widely, with public clouds offering instances that are heterogeneous in both compute capabilities and storage. This project identifies the following forces that will make systems heterogeneous beyond just compute and storage, complicating programming and compilation beyond the challenges that we face today. This project develops Arion, a system for compiling programs onto heterogeneous platforms based on several unifying ideas. The Arion system will be evaluated on practically relevant workloads ranging from computer vision and virtual reality, to graph computations, machine learning and stream processing. The investigators will work with partners in industry to transfer research results to products, and the tools and software developed by this project will be released as open source.<br/><br/>The research in this project relies on four unifying ideas. The first thrust explores schedules and type systems separate a program's specification from its implementation strategy, enabling performance portability because one can select, without changing the program, its parallelism, locality, and hardware mapping. The second thrust uses domain-specific languages to describe not only programs but also artifacts used during compilation, such as schedules, resource-, and memory consistency models. This allows automatic synthesis of these artifacts. The third thrust uses resource models to bring scheduling and synthesis to large programs because the target program need not be scheduled or synthesized all at once. Instead, the compiler makes high-level decisions by estimating performance using a model before committing to low-level decisions. Finally, the investigators will use formal methods to lift programs into, and verify and synthesize programs in our DSLs, providing a high degree of automation. The verifiers and synthesizers are automatically generated from descriptions of DSLs."

The transformation groups such as diffeomorphism groups and homeomorphism groups of a manifold describe all symmetries of the manifold. A manifold is a space that is locally a Euclidean space. The surface of the earth, the surface of a donut and our three or four dimensional universe are all examples of manifolds. The mapping class group is a reduced form of the homeomorphism group of a manifold, in which two transformations are identified if they can be connected by a path of transformations.  These objects have connections with many areas of mathematics, including geometric topology, geometric group theory, dynamics, number theory, quantum field theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. This project studies a number of questions about the structure of symmetries of manifolds.  Broader impacts of these efforts include reading groups for graduate students. <br/><br/>Previously, in a joint work with Kathryn Mann, the principal investigator has proved Ghys' dimension conjecture that given two manifolds M and N, if the homeomorphism group of M has a nontrivial homomorphism to the homeomorphism group of N, then the dimension of M must be less than or equal to the dimension of N. To prove this, an ""Orbit Classification Theorem"" is developed, which says that every orbit of such a homomorphism is homeomorphic to a cover of some configuration space of M. This finding has a potential to give more results about classifying homomorphisms between transformation groups. Since we have figured out all orbits, now the challenge is to understand how to glue those orbits inside the manifold N.  Another line of work studies the projection map from the transformation group to the mapping class group. In particular, we ask which subgroups of the mapping class group have sections under the projection, where the existence of sections implies that the surface bundle that the subgroup determines will admit a flat structure. In previous work on this subgroup question the principal investigator has proved several results using techniques of ""hidden torsion"" and rotation number. More tools will be developed specifically to attack this question. Another direction to explore concerns diffeomorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds, specifically, whether there is an example of an infinite torsion group that acts faithfully on some manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to population increases, growing food demand, changing diets, and climate change, recent years have seen a surge in the use of information communication technologies in agriculture. Experimental farms carry forward many of the same underlying sociotechnical structures that helped to define the maker movement, but as yet they are not yet understood or supported. These structures include increasingly powerful end-user technologies, networks of knowledgeable and passionate practitioners, inquiry objectives relevant to computer science, and high benefit for their communities.<br/><br/>A major phase of the project will conduct ethnographic fieldwork that relies on a combination of participant observation, analysis of cultural and technological artifacts, and semi-structured interviews conducted within each of two research sites. One will examine alternative, IT-enabled farming practices in Taiwan to reveal how farmers experimentally innovate on a day-to-day basis.  The other will focus on agricultural experiments in Indiana to understand and document how farmers, policymakers, and technologists use technology to address critical challenges in food production and sustainability and how agriculture-technology-oriented initiatives cultivate high-tech, high-skilled farmers of the future.  Another phase of the research will combine documentary, discourse, and oral history analysis of policy materials from governments of both field sites to identify alignments and misalignments that either facilitate or undercut efforts intended to support agricultural innovation.  The ethnographic work, oral histories and discourse analyses will be inputs into co-design workshops that will be informed by principles of participatory design.  They will test promising agriculture technology breakthroughs, challenges, and tactics identified in the ethnographic engagements, and will take the form of ""design sprints,"" a highly structured process widely used in the US tech industry for answering crucial questions with stakeholders, characterized by mapping the problem terrain, identifying risks and opportunities, concept generation, prototyping, evaluation and testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this proposal is to create and establish a RET Engineering site at North Dakota State University (NDSU) for secondary educators to deepen their knowledge on how civil engineering can be used to mitigate natural disasters in the region and globally. The target audience for this program is 6th to 12th grade educators teaching in the STEM fields from schools that serve large populations of underserved and underrepresented groups including females, Hispanic, African American and Native American students. Teachers will be engaged in hands-on authentic research experiences revolving around the theme of ?mitigating natural disasters? in the labs of NDSU Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) to help address issues impacting the region and globally from natural disasters including extreme weather, flooding, extreme temperatures, landslides, earthquakes, drought, wildfires, and volcanic activities. These activities will allow them to bridge research experiences to improve content knowledge which will translate to improved secondary STEM education in their classrooms. Teachers will work with faculty and graduate students on these continuing projects during the six-week summer experience towards two outcomes: (1) gain proficiency in the technical content through their research and (2) develop a curricular module related to that research focus. An additional focus of this RET program is to foster mentorship between current teachers and pre-service teachers primarily interested in STEM education. The program will provide pre-service teachers with a unique opportunity to create their own lessons based on research and teach the curriculum in the classrooms of the current STEM teachers. This will result in more hands- on classroom teaching experiences to better prepare pre-service teachers for their future careers.<br/><br/>The anticipated broader impacts of this RET program are to inspire young minds to continue to solve real-world problems related to natural disasters. As this program focuses on teachers that serve in under- represented and under-served populations relative to the engineering discipline, the curricular modules will directly contribute to an increased exposure and interest to STEM opportunities that these students would otherwise not receive. Another impact of this program is to foster better relationships and networking between secondary educators, university faculty, and the civil engineering industry that will extend beyond the duration of the RET program. Ultimately, the program will improve curriculum and student preparedness for research and leadership within STEM disciplines. The theme of the RET program is to ?mitigate natural disasters.? Publications and presentations from the authentic summer research experiences will disseminate solutions to issues faced during natural disasters including rapid assessment of at-risk infrastructure, real-time analyses of efficient evacuation routes, better simulations and models for flood protection, and evaluate potential secondary threats to the infrastructure.

Adoption of biofiltration is hindered by concerns that undesirable microorganisms will be released into the drinking water. Overcoming this concern would help pave the way for wide-scale adoption of this technology. The goal of this project is to develop a novel framework to control the biofilter microbial community. Such control will allow management of biofilter performance. To achieve this goal, the research team will perform laboratory and pilot-scale experiments using state-of-the-art genomic techniques to enrich beneficial microorganisms. The project team includes experts in drinking water treatment, biofiltration, and microbial ecology. The academic and industrial collaboration will help speed the transition of research to full-scale industrial implementation. <br/><br/>Biofilter operation is guided by chemical and microbiological endpoints, yet current biofilter control approaches lack the nuance necessary for managing microbial communities. Considering this lack of control, it is no surprise that there is little to no knowledge of how biofilter microbes contribute to biofilter performance. This knowledge gap coupled with concerns about the seeding of the water distribution system with biofilter microbes has been a major stumbling block for the wide-scale industrial adoption of this technology. To overcome this barrier, this project will develop the novel Eco-Genomic Framework (EGF) for controlling the biofilter microbial community. This project focusses on using the EGF to tailor the biofilter microbial community to enhance post-filtration disinfection efficacy while maintaining biofilter performance. Preliminary EGF research results suggest that microbial disinfection resistance is associated with nitrogen species availability and resultant genetic stress response in biofilter microorganisms. This project will experimentally test EGF predictions 1) to establish a relationship between nitrogen species availability and nitrogen stress response exerted by biofilter microbes, 2) quantitatively link nitrogen stress response and disinfection resistance, and 3) optimize nitrogen species availability in the biofilter to maximize disinfection efficacy while minimizing potential deleterious impacts. These objectives will be accomplished through laboratory- and pilot-scale experiments coupled with state-of-the-art molecular, bioinformatics, and statistical approaches. The outcomes of this project will serve as proof of concept for the utility of the novel EGF for biofilter operation led by academic and industrial researchers with a track record of productive collaboration, thus increasing the likelihood of successful EGF development and industrial deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research goals of this project are (1) to establish a long-term observatory to monitor high-resolution drinking water microbiome dynamics in Boston?s water distribution system, (2) to develop a novel framework to apply econometric and ecological models to these dynamics, and (3) to systematically integrate the two modeling approaches for comprehensive spatial-temporal forecasting of the abundance and composition of the drinking water microbiome. The research plan combines state-of-the-art integrated analyses and novel modeling approaches to develop a quantitative predictive framework for the drinking water microbiome.

AMLS are hierarchical materials whose effective properties depend upon both the topology of the lattice structure and the base metallic material microstructure. Therefore, understanding the interplay between topology and microstructure is necessary to maximize the potential application of AMLS. In general, one of the major factors that limits a complex engineering system?s performance is that conventional structural metallic materials serve a singular purpose of providing structural support. However, flexibility in the design of AMLS enables an array of multifunctional applications, such as controlled heat transfer, vibration, energy management, and light-weighting. In this research, the potential of AMLS will be enhanced with an in-depth experimental-computational investigation of the combined role of microstructure and topology in the mechanical deformation mechanisms that control the mechanical behavior over a wide range of loading conditions. The educational part of this grant will provide: (1) an opportunity to senior design teams to build educational tools and techniques to teach mechanical engineering concepts to people with visual impairment; and (2) a hands-on research opportunity to low-income students.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are understanding the specific contribution and interplay between the microstructurally driven mechanisms (e.g., those due to grain structures, orientation, and porosity) and geometrically driven events (e.g., unit-cell buckling, node fracturing, and macroscopic shear) on the deformation of AMLS, and determining which mechanisms dominate under different loading conditions. In order to elucidate the specific contribution of local microstructural features relative to topological attributes, experimental data obtained from microstructural and mechanical behavior characterization will be coupled with the local state of stress computed from finite element (FE) simulations. The FE analysis will use a yield criterion that will be customized for AMLS to capture the anisotropic behavior of the struts originating from the repeated solid-phase changes during layer deposition.

The project aims to identify those signatures and formulate molecular descriptors that accelerate ice nucleation. The goal of the proposed education plan is to use an integrated approach to improve the understanding of the multidisciplinary field of computational materials science by graduate and undergraduate students.

The plan is to analyze the extensive dataset of nucleation events, free energy landscapes, and interfacial water properties to identify the key signatures that indicate the ice-nucleating propensity of a surface. Based on knowledge of the key signatures, high-throughput screening of the surface nucleating propensity will be performed using membrane-based surfaces.

This project addresses this need by transforming Symbiota, one of the most widely used software platforms for mobilizing specimens in US research collections. Symbiota is an online biodiversity data management software platform that integrates data and images from networks of data providers. It has helped mobilize over 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections and is one of the most successful platforms for creating large collaborative data communities for sharing and displaying biodiversity data. Symbiota is used by 74% of the projects funded by the NSF Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and is thus a key platform to help digitize the estimated 430 million specimens in US collections that have yet to be digitized. Symbiota's success is largely due to its low learning curve and powerful set of tools for documenting species occurrences and integrating them with images and detailed taxonomic descriptions. But its widespread use has yielded significant feedback on how it could be made more effective. To accomplish this and aid its future development, Symbiota needs a fundamental restructuring. This project will transform Symbiota into a new version, Symbiota2, to catalyze contributions, expand research use, enrich education-outreach activities, and increase sustainability. Symbiota2 will enhance our ability to address a broad spectrum of biodiversity-related research questions by facilitating data visualization, linking multiple data sources (e.g., publications), creating better tools for data quality assessment, and monitoring data usage.<br/><br/>The transformation of Symbiota into Symbiota2 will completely refactor its code structure to emphasize modularity and improve usability and accessibility. This transformation will achieve the following goals, derived through direct management of Symbiota data portals and concerted and dedicated interactions with the Symbiota user community: 1) Provide RESTful web services so that data can be easily incorporated into a scientific workflow, 2) Build a plugin architecture to ease the development of new features, 3) Create a database abstraction layer to include a wide variety of backend database management systems, 4) Increase data utility by supporting analytical and visualization tools, 5) Separate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) from other processing so that new GUIs can be used, and 6) Enhance the data collection by making it easier to add new kinds of data and work offline. With these goals met, Symbiota2 will be a powerful biodiversity data management system fulfilling the needs of developers, data providers, researchers, and education professionals, as well as being interoperable with other biodiversity initiatives.

The focus of this system is automation of the detection of natural hazard events using machine learning, as the events are occurring.  A four-organization collaboration (UNAVCO, University of Colorado, University of Oregon, and Rutgers University) develops a data framework for generalized real-time streaming analytics and machine learning for geoscience and hazards research.  This work will support rapid analysis and understanding of data associated with hazardous events (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis).  <br/><br/>This project uses a collaboration between computer scientists and geoscientists to develop a data framework for generalized real-time streaming analytics and machine learning for geoscience and hazards research.  It focuses on the aggregation and integration of a large number of data streams into a coherent system that supports analysis of the data streams in real-time. The framework will offer machine-learning-based tools designed to detect signals of events, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, that might only be detectable when looking at a broad selection of observational inputs.  The architecture sets up a fast data pipeline by combining a group of open source components that make big data applications viable and easier to develop. Data sources for the project draw primarily upon the 1500+ sensors from the EarthScope networks currently managed by UNAVCO and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), as well as the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) cabled array data managed by Rutgers University.  Machine learning (ML) algorithms will be researched and applied to the tsunami and earthquake use cases.  Initially, the project plans to employ an advanced convolutional neural network method in a multi-data environment.  The method has only been applied to seismic waveforms, so the project will explore extending the method to a multi-data environment.  The approach is expected to be extensible beyond detection and characterization of earthquakes to include the onset of other geophysical signals such as slow-slip events or magmatic intrusion, expanding the potential for new scientific discoveries.  The framework is applied to use cases in the Cascadia subduction zone and Yellowstone: these locations combine the expertise of the science team with locations where EarthScope and OOI have the greatest concentration of instruments.  The architecture will be transportable and scalable, running in a Docker environment on laptops, local clusters and the cloud.  Integral to the project will be development, documentation and training using collaborative online resources such as GitLab and Jupyter Notebooks, and utilizing NSF XSEDE resources to make larger datasets and computational resources more widely available.<br/><br/>This award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Cross-Cutting Program and Division of Earth Sciences within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences, the Big Data Science and Engineering Program within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the EarthCube Program jointly sponsored by the NSF Directorate for Geosciences and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ability allows waves to carry information, be it through speech or electronic transmission of data. Waves can also be used to probe the interior of the earth, the human body or engineered structures like buildings or bridges. This probing can be turned into images of the interior by the means of solving inverse problems, and in the extension, mitigate seismic hazards by accurate predictions of ground motion caused by earthquakes. In this project the principal investigator will develop computational simulation tools that increases our ability to exploit the properties of wave propagation for the common good. The tools developed in the project can also be used to design modern materials with exotic properties that cannot be found in nature. Such metamaterials can enable better sensing technologies and faster acoustic and electromagnetic circuit components such as miniaturized speakers, 5G components and other millimeter wave technologies. <br/><br/>The research will use a new idea that enables the use of time domain methods for wave equations to design frequency domain Helmholtz type solvers. The approach is remarkable in that the underlying linear operator corresponds to a symmetric positive definite matrix allowing the  solution of a coercive problem rather than an indefinite Helmholtz problem. As the proposed Helmholtz solvers rely solely on evolving the wave equation they will be massively parallel, scalable and high order accurate. A goal of the research is to solve the Helmholtz equation in three dimensions at higher frequencies, and on a larger number of cores than is currently possible. The research will also seek to improve the time-step constraints of time domain discontinuous Galerkin methods by exploiting approximation spaces built on discrete periodic extensions from equidistant node data. Such improvements will result in faster simulation times and more accurate predictions. Applications of the methods to modeling of micropolar materials and to simulation of seismic waves will be carried out in collaboration with researchers from academic institutions and national laboratories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
