In the absence of unique identifiers, merging corresponding fragments of data can be demanding and error-prone. This challenge is encountered in various settings covering applications in engineering such as sensor networks as well as in the work of government data analytics. In this project, it is explored to what extent functional relationships between different data sets can be leveraged to resolve potential ambiguities in the process of data integration. This question is also relevant to data confidentiality in situations in which an adversary tries to disclose sensitive information from anonymized data by using auxiliary data sources.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is the development and statistical analysis of computationally feasible methods to safeguard downstream statistical analysis against errors in data linkage and to restore missing or faulty correspondences. In this context, linear regression in the presence of an unknown permutation is of central interest. One specific direction of research is the use of prior knowledge about the underlying permutation as commonly available in applications with the goal to sidestep computational barriers and to reduce the occurrent of ill-posed problems in statistical estimation. Emphasis will be placed on the characterization of the fundamental limits of recovery. Making advances in this regard will entail the use of tools from various areas including the theory of assignment problems, nonlinear optimization, high-dimensional and robust statistical inference, and random matrix theory. Results of the conducted research can potentially impact related problems such as regression under unknown linear transform, including blind deconvolution, and inference for permutations, as found in ranking, seriation, or graph matching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmful algae blooms impair access to drinking water, wildfires present a persistent threat to safety in the western United States, and traffic and industry-related air pollutants pose a risk to growing urban populations. To combat these issues, researchers are turning increasingly to mobile sampling devices to provide safe, persistent estimation of environmental phenomena. However, given the vast spatial regions these devices are tasked with covering, a key open problem is that of designing sampling strategies to provide the highest quality of information given the available resources. This project aims to enable mobile sampling devices to perform efficient, autonomous monitoring of such phenomena, thereby permitting scientists and other concerned actors to make informed, data-driven decisions. The project also facilitates undergraduate involvement through the deployment of the developed algorithms on an unmanned aerial system, as well as workshops to engage underrepresented community college students in the project goals.<br/><br/>A key task in environmental sensing is that of determining where a phenomenon lies above a certain threshold (for example, regions where the pollution level is above a safe limit), a problem known as level-set estimation (LSE). Existing LSE algorithms fall short by either (1) failing to incorporate sampling costs associated with mobile sensors, (2) lacking theoretical guarantees, or (3) relying on strong modeling assumptions. The technical aim of this project is the development of practical adaptive sampling algorithms for LSE with well-understood theoretical properties. The first thrust of the project will consider the problem of estimating the change point of a step function in one dimension, drawing on connections between active learning and robotic path planning to develop and analyze algorithms capable of incorporating previously-ignored costs and handling noisy measurements. The second thrust will consider the two-dimensional LSE problem directly via a graph-based approach. By combining recent techniques from graph-based active learning with Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning, realistic sampling costs based on the distance traveled, the number of measurements taken, and the need to return to a base station for battery recharging will be incorporated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In spite of intensive study, however, the general understanding of many fundamental scheduling problems is still far from satisfactory.  This research will enhance understanding of the mathematical relaxation techniques to solve scheduling problems that appear in many contexts.  Successful completion of the project will yield improved approximation algorithms for fundamental scheduling problems. This project will provide research and educational opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students, and foster cross-field collaborations between different institutions.<br/> <br/>The major goal of the project is to leverage cutting-edge techniques in mathematical programming to close the gaps in the understanding of scheduling problems. The specific techniques the investigator intends to explore include: (1) leveraging the LP (linear programming) hierarchy in approximating precedence-constrained scheduling problems on identical machines, (2) exploring time-indexed LP relaxations to solve scheduling problems with weighted-sum objectives, and (3) the use of knapsack covering inequalities in capturing resource constraints arising naturally in scheduling problems.  The project is centered around three mathematical-programming techniques. (1) The recent breakthrough result of Levey and Rothvoss gave a (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the makespan minimization problem for scheduling precedence-constrained unit-size jobs on constant number of machines, based on the Sherali-Adams hierarchy lift of the natural time-indexed LP relaxation for the problem. The investigator will continue this line of research, by improving these results from various angles and extending them to many other settings. What if jobs have different sizes? How can the problem with the weighted completion-time objective be handled? Can the results be extended to more general machine models? (2) Time-indexed LP relaxations are natural ones for scheduling problems, given the important role the notion of time plays in the problems. However, for many problems, their power in deriving improved algorithms has not been fully exploited. This investigation will advance the understanding of the technique by studying the scheduling problem on unrelated machines to minimize weighted completion time, directed-acyclic job scheduling and coflow scheduling problems. (3) The knapsack covering inequalities have been introduced to strengthen the basic LP relaxation for the many problems with knapsack covering constraints, and have been used to derive LP-based algorithms for many scheduling and other types of problems. The investigator aims to further advance the understanding of the technique in tackling relevant scheduling problems including weighted flow time minimization for open-shop scheduling, the single-machine scheduling problem with general cost functions, and the capacitated lot-sizing problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, in medicine, accurate visualization of tissue is needed to diagnose and treat tumors. A key step in imaging technologies requires one to solve an inverse problem in order to transform measured data into detailed image reconstructions of the quantities of interest. However, image reconstruction is inherently uncertain, in part, due to noisy measurements from sensors. Ignoring the uncertainty in the imaging process can lead to undesirable outcomes, such as misjudging the location and spread of a suspected tumor. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in imaging is in its infancy and hence, the potential for impact in research contributions is high. UQ for imaging is computationally challenging since thousands of inversions are needed beyond the initial inversion to generate accurate statistics of the uncertainty. Current approaches for UQ are inadequate because they either fail to deliver solutions in a reasonable computational time or they lack the applicability across a broad range of imaging technologies.<br/><br/><br/>The project is on the development of fast algorithms for UQ in large-scale inverse problems that are applicable to a broad range of imaging technologies. These algorithms are expected to bring down the computational cost by at least an order of magnitude while maintaining the accuracy of the solutions. More specifically, the project will (1) Advance image reconstruction and UQ techniques for incorporating prior information based on fractional partial differential equation (PDE) and Bayesian level set approaches; and (2) Develop new algorithms and analysis for data-driven dimensionality techniques for UQ in Bayesian inverse problems, using randomized and Krylov subspace methods. The algorithms developed here will be rigorously analyzed and validated on several model problems and applications, including diffuse optical and photoacoustic tomography (in biomedicine) and hydraulic tomography and satellite data fusion (in geoscience). The algorithms developed here are also applicable to other imaging-based inverse problems in biomedicine, geophysics, materials science, etc. Outside of imaging applications, these mathematical advances will be of interest to scientists working in many areas of computational science, for example, fractional partial differential equations (PDEs), model reduction, tensor decompositions, and principal component analysis. Lastly, the PI's education and outreach activities will make UQ and imaging technologies more modular, accessible, and easier to understand for pre-service and early career K-12 educators, undergraduate students, and graduate students. Specifically, the educational program of this project will: (1) Strengthen STEM education through teacher training workshops and practical research experiences for pre-service and early career K-12 teachers, which will result in reproducible teaching modules for use in K-12 education; and (2) Enhance undergraduate and graduate curriculum at North Carolina State University by creating accessible seminar talks and new course content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An additional fourteen students will participate in all project activities and serve as alternates for scholarships should space become available.  This project will establish an evidence-based approach to support lower income students inside and outside of the classroom.  This support is expected to increase the students' sense of belonging, as well as their retention and graduation, whether they live on or commute to campus.

To achieve these objectives, the project will support students through: (1) curricular engagement via linked courses that use evidence-based pedagogies; (2) community building through collaboration in common spaces and social activities; and (3) meaningful mentorship experiences. The project will systematically assess potential barriers to student success to determine what barriers exist for individual students with unique intersecting identities.  It will measure the impact of these barriers on students' sense of belonging and academic success, as measured by retention and graduation rates. The project will use a mixed-methods approach including both qualitative and quantitative approaches to measure the project's impact on academic achievement and affective domains such as student motivation, self-confidence, and sense of belonging, as well as the effectiveness of mentoring and pedagogical practices.

With the advent of these computational abilities has come an increased demand to include more complex physical interactions in the models, and thus an increased strain on computational resources. Modern engineering design utilizes such models, and these design problems typically involve (1) numerous tunable parameters that affect reliability, cost, and failure, (2) uncertainty about external influences manifesting as randomness in the model, and (3) epistemic ignorance involving model form uncertainty. In realistic applications, the collection of these effects leads to predictions that depend on a cumulatively high-dimensional parameter. This project focuses on development and deployment of novel, near-optimal experimental design and sampling algorithms for the accurate and efficient simulation of physical models parameterized by high-dimensional inputs. The work of this project involves the application of recently developed approximation theory results in the computational arena, targeted advances that extend theoretical mathematics for computational purposes, and the development and implementation of algorithms for large-scale computations.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this project are designed to provide feasible computational algorithms and concrete mathematical guarantees for tasks in high-dimensional approximation. The three major core components for the completion of this task involve the design, implementation, and analysis of algorithms that leverage optimality characteristics of (1) random and deterministic experimental and sampling design, (2) computational algorithms for identifying efficient sampling schemes, and (3) strategies and techniques for emerging approximation paradigms such as sparse approximation and dimension reduction. A crosscutting theme is application of these methods to problems of modern interest in scientific computing. This project involves fundamental contributions to the fields of applied approximation theory and computational approximation methods through the development of applications-oriented sampling designs with provable near-optimality. Theoretical investigations of this project connect classical techniques in approximation and linear algebra with emerging algorithms in data reduction and reduced order modeling. The implementation of these algorithms will significantly enhance theoretical understanding and computational feasibility for goal-oriented design, parameter study and reduction, sparse and compressive representations, model verification and calibration, and data-driven simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, in superconducting quantum materials many electrons behave collectively to create a state where electric current can flow without energy loss. In many cases, these quantum materials may feature enhanced properties that defy our conventional knowledge, and could be key to the future of clean energy transmission and other everyday technologies. However, as one tries to enhance superconductivity, other phenomena, including ordered states, appear as well. The fundamental roadblock is to understand how these additional intertwined orders are detrimental or helpful to the superconductivity. This project uses complementary scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, a tool that visualizes the electrons in the sub-nanoscale, and resonant x-ray scattering to investigate the role of intertwined orders in superconducting quantum materials, while manipulating the materials using a variety of conditions like external field or temperature. This project also uses online tools for the broader dissemination of knowledge. Several online video modules, featuring undergraduate and graduate students, demonstrate and explain the advanced laboratory techniques related to this project. This project also targets the inclusion of underrepresented minorities through the development of teaching modules for the Mentorships for Undergraduate Research Participants in the Physical and Mathematical Sciences program at UC Davis.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Understanding how quantum materials develop collective electronic phenomena is one of the biggest challenges facing condensed matter physicists today. The key to unlocking quantum materials comes from understanding how multiple phases are intrinsically intertwined and cannot exist alone. In quantum materials, superconductivity may intertwine with phases where electrons self-organize into unusual patterns (density waves) or into states where the x and y directions become nonequivalent for electrons in an otherwise square crystal (nematic order). This project investigates the role of intertwined orders in unconventional superconductors, focusing on two important cases : (i) studies of  the relationship between density-wave order, magnetism and superconductivity in the Ce-based 115 family of heavy-fermion superconductors using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) and resonant x-ray scattering techniques; and (ii) studies of superconducting and nematic orders in Fe-based superconductors by integrating STM/S and uniaxial strain to control the nematic order. Through these activities, this research ultimately targets the direct visualization of a pair-density-wave state in a heavy fermion superconductor and the switchable control of superconductivity by crystal deformation of Fe-based superconductors. Finally, the development of a new methodology to study nematic order via the integration of uniaxial strain to STM/S will have significant impact on the study of other quantum materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is also a steady trend towards building future data centers and high-performance computers with a software-defined architecture. However, challenges remain in adopting virtualization in many critical domains.  First, there still exists a large performance gap between virtualized and physical systems, especially for high-speed devices, scientific workloads and latency-sensitive applications. Second, performance isolation and resource elasticity are often contradictory goals under the current models, which leaves much of the economic benefit of virtualization unexploited. Third, the additional system complexity in virtualiation undermines stability and predictability. This research addresses these issues and seeks to improve the performance, cost-effectiveness, and predictability of virtualized systems. The research will be tightly integrated into teaching and further broaden its impacts through mentoring and recruiting minority students, and outreach activities in K12 schools.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will identify gaps in the existing abstractions that cause performance degradation, inefficiencies and unpredictability, as well as pinpointing the essence of current abstractions that has enabled isolation, modularity and portability. The project entails three research thrusts: First, it will design and implement augmented abstractions for various types of virtualized systems, including virtual machines, containers and virtualized networks, to bridge the semantic gaps. Second, it will leverage the augmented abstractions to design efficient, effective and elastic resource management schemes while retaining much of the benefit of the existing abstractions.

They relate to a transport of some substance, for example a pollutant or particulate material, by a flow, be it a fluid or gas flow or an intra-cellular flow.  Mathematically, a certain scalar or vector field (e.g. density, vorticity, temperature) is carried by some velocity field.  These phenomena can be described by partial differential equations (PDE), which often involve both nonlocal (dependence on the history of the flow or on the not necessarily close-by events) and nonlinear terms. Examples include the 2D Boussinesq equation that models large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows, and the diffusion-aggregation equation that models collective animal behavior. Due to the nonlocal and nonlinear nature of these equations, it is often unknown whether solutions exist globally in time or develop a finite-time singularity. Even in the cases where solutions are known to be global, their long-time behavior remains unclear for many equations. This project aims to develop novel analytical tools for a range of transport equations arising in fluid dynamics and biology, focusing on singularity, asymptotic, and mixing properties of the solutions. An integral part of the project is the educational component including developing advanced courses, supervising undergraduate research, and conducting a young researchers' workshop on nonlinear PDE. The workshop features mini-courses by established researchers and short talks by junior participants, aiming to introduce young researchers to the forefront of PDE research and facilitate collaborations. This project will advance the mathematical understanding of nonlocal PDE and their applications in fluids and biology.  The project will also provide opportunities for education and training of junior researchers in this vibrant field.<br/><br/>This project contains three different but related directions. The first direction is to obtain finite-time singularity formation for some fluid equations. The plan is to start with some one-dimensional model equations and prove finite-time singularity by establishing some kind of global control up to the blow-up time. The study of these model equations may shed new light on the full dynamics of fluid equations in higher dimensions. A second direction is the development of new tools for understanding the long-time dynamics of aggregation-diffusion equations, where the gradient flow structure plays an important role. A third direction is mixing by incompressible flows, and the goal is to study how fast the density can get mixed given some quantitative constraint of the velocity field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to its multiscale nature, this project intends to advance the understanding and computation of kinetic theory in new, emerging aspects that involve uncertainties, non-localities, and variational formulations. A parallel educational objective is to prepare and train students at all levels for multi-disciplinary research through advanced courses, topic seminars, and summer programs.<br/><br/>The specific aims of the project include: (1) utilize the variational formulation of macroscopic and kinetic equations to develop scalable, structure preserving, mathematically justifiable methods via advanced optimization techniques; (2) design multiscale computational methods for nonlocal interacting kinetic systems, with emphases on nonlocal collision and connection to fractional diffusion; (3) develop robust algorithms for hyperbolic equations with uncertainty, especially in treating discontinuous solutions; (4) study the inverse problem for nonlinear kinetic systems, including stability analysis with varying scales, numerical regularization and algorithms. The proposed activity is on an interdisciplinary topic and of general interest to both computational mathematicians and scientists from other areas. The variational methods provide a new perspective in overcoming difficulties that are shared among most partial differential equation (PDE) models nowadays: multiple scales, high dimensionality and necessity in preserving physical quantities. The research outcome will have an impact on other disciplines including computational optimal transport, optimal control theory, mean field games, and machine learning. The fractional diffusion solvers will be equally applicable to photon transport through cosmic dust or atmosphere, electron beam dose calculation, and other nonlocal PDEs arising in material science, finance, and plasma physics. Uncertainties that are omnipresent in kinetic equations have a profound influence on the solution behavior and must be carefully quantified.

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a particular suite of computational tools for summarizing and visualizing shape in high-dimensional data sets. These tools have been used in recent years to guide new discoveries in cancer research, neuroscience, materials science, image analysis, and many areas where shape, broadly construed, is of importance. However, by summarizing data in a succinct way certain important differences between data sets can often go undetected. This project provides a new mathematical framework for precisely measuring how lossy the most popular methods in TDA are. By developing new ways for quantifying how large-scale differences go undetected, the project offers enrichments of current topological methods to obtain novel data science tools with greater distinguishing power. The awarded funds will go primarily to fund a graduate student to aid the PI in basic research and development of these enriched topological summaries. Computational experiments on data sets of public interest, e.g. time-varying socio-economic indicators and weather data, will be carried out to test performance of these tools against current state of the art methods. Additionally, the PI will incorporate these novel methods into the data science curriculum at the PI's host institution and recruit students from historically under-represented groups to be trained as the nation's next generation of data scientists.<br/><br/>This project is an ambitious extension of earlier work undertaken by the PI and provides a targeted attack on the inverse problem for the main objects of study in topological data analysis: the merge tree, which tracks how connected components of the sub-level set of a function evolves; Reeb graphs, which tracks connected components of the fiber of a function; and the barcode/persistence diagram, which is a collection of intervals/points in the plane that represent an algorithmic pairing of critical points of a function on a space. The PI showed in earlier work how merge trees determine the associated barcode and provided a precise enumeration of how many distinct merge trees have the same barcode. By identifying functions on the real line that are related by an orientation preserving coordinate transformation, the PI showed how a novel enrichment of the merge tree---the chiral merge tree---faithfully captures these equivalence classes of functions and offers exponential distinguishing power over the barcode for time-series analysis. This project aims to carry out similar analysis for functions on surfaces, with an eye toward improving the classification performance of persistent homology in image analysis, and for Reeb graphs, to better integrate with level-set persistent homology. By carrying out a careful study of inverse problems in each of these settings, novel enrichments analogous to the chiral merge tree will be developed. Additionally, to make these enriched topological summaries useful for data classification tasks, novel metrics will be defined for comparing each of these summaries and algorithms will be developed for the efficient computation of these metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has led to many celebrated results in computer science over the last 50 years, in areas as diverse as machine learning, quantum computing, and circuit lower bounds. As one example, quantum computers have the potential to be vastly more efficient (for some problems) than today's classical computers, and the polynomial method has proven to be one of the most promising tools available for understanding their power. This is because any function that can be efficiently evaluated by a quantum computer must be well-approximated in a precise sense by low-degree polynomials. This project seeks to improve our understanding of known formulations of the polynomial method, and to develop new formulations to solve major open problems in the aforementioned application domains.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are separated into two classes. The first class focuses on a basic formulation of the polynomial method called approximate degree, which has many applications. The project will develop a relatively new technique for proving approximate degree lower bounds, called the method of dual polynomials, that is poised to resolve the approximate degrees of many basic functions. Via established connections, this will impact the fields of quantum algorithms (where it is likely to imply the optimality of a variety of quantum algorithms), circuit complexity (where it will resolve the complexity of shallow circuits under basic complexity measures), and learning theory (where it will characterize the power of important objects including halfspace learners, noise-tolerant learners, and deep nets). The project will also investigate new polynomial-based notions of structure with the potential to solve additional major open problems in these areas.<br/><br/>The second class of objectives focuses on a different application of the polynomial method, to verifiable computing (VC). VC refers to cryptographic protocols enabling an untrusted prover to guarantee to a verifier that the prover performed a computation correctly. Efficient VC systems would enable a wide variety of applications. For example, entities that offload data processing to the cloud could obtain guarantees that the cloud is operating correctly. Seminal theoretical results used the polynomial method to show that VC protocols can be dramatically more efficient than static proofs, and the last decade has seen major progress in building VC systems verging on practicality, and even commercial deployment of such systems. Still, many existing VC systems have high costs or lack several key properties, limiting their applicability. The project will explore new formulations of the polynomial method to overcome these limitations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As modern cloud services grow in popularity, their design shifts from supporting complex monolithic applications, to supporting collections of specialized, loosely-coupled microservices. Such microservices impact resource requirements by requiring fast network processing and low-latency memory accesses to achieve their quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Dependencies among microservices also complicate compute cluster management, and can cause cascading QoS violations, hurting availability and service reliability. Guaranteeing the responsiveness expected from cloud services while using datacenters efficiently requires instead a joint hardware-software approach. This project takes a holistic view towards designing a system stack for interactive cloud microservices running on large-scale datacenters that is QoS-aware, and resource-efficient. By pursuing automated, learning-based techniques, this project highlights the value of leveraging practical machine learning techniques to better navigate the increasing complexity of the cloud, as more datacenter services switch to this new application model.<br/><br/>At the hardware level, this project first quantifies the implications microservices have on server design, and second, explores their potential for hardware acceleration. At the software level, this work is developing a new cluster manager that accounts for the dependencies among microservices in an automated and transparent-to-the-user way, and guarantees end-to-end performance. Finally, to eliminate the cascading effects of QoS violations between microservices, this project includes a data-driven, online performance forecasting system. This system leverages the massive amount of monitoring data collected by cloud systems to anticipate upcoming QoS violations, and act on them before they degrade performance. By innovating in both hardware and software, this work will achieve performance and efficiency gains that neither hardware- nor software-only approaches can provide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will dramatically change the healthcare paradigm in this country and significantly reduce costs and illnesses, more so than a solely reactive focus on disease diagnosis and treatment. Public health is the study of these daily life factors and prevention efforts. New person-generated data (PGD) from Internet and mobile data sources, such as mHealth, social media, wearables, and data from smartphone apps, offer unprecedented opportunity to provide sub-daily, as well as local, neighborhood-level measures of lifestyle, environmental and social factors from daily life. However, the impact of this data has yet to be fully realized for public health efforts. In part, this is because existing research efforts on PGD often focus on processing the content of data in isolation, and do not consider human data sharing patterns, that is, who contributes the data, when it is contributed and from where it is contributed. By accounting for these attributes, this project aims to improve the validity and reliability of measures extracted from PGD and enable improved understanding of high-granularity health risks and outcomes. The project will also provide a highly-integrated research and educational program for public health practitioners, students, and community members in the context of PGD and public health by: (1) preparing students to use computer science in today's job landscape via a problem-based learning class; (2) increasing high-school students' exposure to computer science in the real-world with a focus on applications of computer science; and (3) disseminating scientific understanding of computer science in the public health and general community. In conjunction, this work will improve both computer science and public health practice and research through method development and exposure of diverse community members and community-oriented professionals to the utility of data mining and machine learning. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop new machine learning approaches motivated by the need to improve data management and analysis in the public health domain.

Examples include recommending preferred items to new consumers, computing least congested routes in a road network with changing traffic, distributing power radially over electricity grids with changing demand, and so on. All these problems have an inherent ""combinatorial"" structure that constrains the possible decisions one can take. This combinatorial structure becomes even more complex when these decisions are required to incorporate fairness and reduce disparate impact, such as a balanced representation of female/male scientists when a search query for ""scientists"" is made. These combinatorial problems are computationally challenging, necessitating rigorous yet fast algorithms to run these efficiently in real-world scenarios where decisions must be made in real-time. A large class of optimization methods prevalent in learning applications, the so-called first-order optimization methods, work by repeatedly solving perturbations of similar combinatorial subproblems.  This research project will explore whether the knowledge of ""how"" the solution was computed to previous subproblems within first-order optimization methods can be used to speed up computations in subsequent iterations. This project has the potential of speeding up a wide range of applications whenever a constrained decision with combinatorial structure must be made in real-time as mentioned above. The interdisciplinary nature of this work, spanning first-order optimization methods and combinatorial algorithms, will benefit students helping prepare a stronger and a holistic STEM workforce with impact in a large number of applications - at both undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>This project serves as a cornerstone for proper integration of first-order optimization methods (like Frank-Wolfe (FW), mirror descent (MD) and their variants) and the theory of combinatorial optimization with wide-ranging applications. It brings together the theory of data structures, approximation algorithms, parametric analysis in combinatorial optimization and the computational requirements of iterative first-order optimization methods to achieve amortized speeds ups in overall runtime. MD and FW variants rely only on the function value and gradient information at a single data point in each iteration and this property has rendered these methods to be used in numerous real-time machine learning applications. When making constrained combinatorial decisions as described above, these methods repeatedly compute two main subproblems: (i) linear optimization in each iteration of the FW variants, and (ii) projections or convex minimization in each iteration of the MD variants. With this award, the investigator will explore (a) identification of combinatorial primitives suitable for amortized analysis within first-order methods, (b) use of previously discovered tight cuts for iterative projections within mirror descent variants, (c) decomposition of convex problems, (d) construction of smarter warm start solutions for first-order optimization, (e) weaker but relevant approximate models and algorithms for repeated perturbed subproblems. With recent results closing the gap of possible convergence rates for first-order optimization in various settings, these questions have become of paramount importance to enable the next scale up in runtime of constrained decision-making to real-time user-centric applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A quantum computer, which makes use of quantum physics to store information and execute calculations is expected to be vastly more efficient and hence more powerful than a traditional computer. An attractive scheme towards quantum computation involves a newly-discovered class of materials, called topological insulators, where the interior is insulating but the surface is electrically conducting. Magnetic elements can be incorporated into such a topological insulator sample to achieve a curious phenomenon called quantum anomalous Hall effect. In this state the surface electrons are confined to the edges of the sample and flow without resistance. It has been predicted that quantum computation can be achieved in a device where this resistance-free edge current of the quantum anomalous Hall insulator is utilized. This project aims to test this prediction. Active education and outreach programs for graduate and undergraduate students, K-12 students and teachers, and the general public are integral part of planned work.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The coupling of the spin-polarized dissipation-free edge state of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator and a conventional superconductor has been predicted to harbor a topological superconductivity phase that supports gapless Majorana fermion excitation at surfaces or edges of the sample. Topological superconductivity can reveal transformative new physics, such as non-Abelian statistics, and enable new architectures for topological quantum computation. In this project, the principal investigator pursues the quantum coherent oscillations as a function of vortices number in a micrometer-sized quantum anomalous Hall/superconductor Mach-Zehnder interferometer to ascertain the existence of the Majorana fermion and the non-Abelian braiding of such Majorana fermions in a quantum anomalous Hall/superconductor device with Corbino geometry. This project also explores the transport signatures of external electrical field induced topological superconductivity phase in quantum anomalous Hall/superconductor hybrid structures under homogenous magnetization and multiple chiral Majorana fermions in high-Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall/superconductor heterostructures. The success of the project will lead to significant new understanding of the microscopic mechanisms of topological superconductivity phase and carries far-reaching technological implications especially for the development of the topological quantum computer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding these waves and how they are amplified is important to national security and commercial interests. Military and commercial communications utilize the same very low frequency radio wavelengths and are therefore disrupted by whistler waves. The resulting scientific results will lead to improvement of predictive space weather models. This fits directly into the goals of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, released in 2015. The project supports a female faculty member and will train and educate graduate and undergraduate students in both research and outreach activities. The proposed outreach program will target K-12 students through development of interactive in-class presentations, hands-on activities, and tours of the BU observatory and planetarium. The outreach will engage undergraduate and graduate students in both research and communicating space science to the public.<br/><br/>Whistler mode waves in plasmaspheric plumes exhibit unexpectedly large amplitudes that suggest that waves in this region are very effective in driving energetic electron precipitation. Currently, radiation belt models do not incorporate this effect. In order to understand the role whistler waves in plasmaspheric plumes play on radiation belt dynamics, this award will combine theory, modeling, and data analysis. Quasilinear diffusion theory will be used to evaluate electron scattering due to wave-particle interactions. This will be combined with modeling from a Full Diffusion code to calculate electron diffusion coefficients and a 3D diffusion code to simulate radiation belt electron dynamics. Analysis of observations from multiple spacecraft, including the Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, POES/MetOp, and GPS, will establish density, wave, and particle properties associated with the generation of whistler waves in plasmaspheric plumes. The data will be compared to the developed model to answer the science questions. The study is unique in that it focuses on whistler waves generated in plumes, a region not previously investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most single-cell genomic measurements require dissociating cells from their native environment, thereby destroying information about cellular context. The spatial and chemical context of a cell are critical parameters in both developmental and disease states as chemical and physical interactions with neighboring cells can influence signaling pathways that determine cell fate. This research aims to transition from cataloging cellular identity in tissues and organs to mapping cellular distributions by developing a platform to profile the chemical composition and transcriptional state of intact tissue specimens with single-cell resolution. The project involves combining advanced microscopy to image the position of cells in a tissue, and automated fluid handling to collect genomic material from single cells for analysis. This technology compliments international efforts to create a comprehensive human cell atlas by aiding in the production of cell-level maps of developing and diseased tissue for both fundamental and translational biological research. <br/><br/>This research will leverage recent advances in microfluidics, non-linear optical microscopy, and high-throughput DNA sequencing to develop a novel approach for spatial-transcriptomic analysis of unfixed tissue. Specifically, stimulated Raman scattering microscopy will be used to perform label-free histological imaging of tissue slices. A microfluidic platform will then be implemented to precisely and systematically capture individual cells from dissected tissue and molecularly encode RNA from each cell with its position of origin. High-throughput sequencing will then reveal both the transcriptional state and original location of each cell. High-resolution transcriptional maps of interrogated tissue samples will be accessible through a public database, providing a resource for developmental biologists and biomedical researchers. In addition to these research goals, the principal investigator of this project will also direct an undergraduate research program, focused on enhancing recruitment of historically underrepresented minority students and first-generation college students to the UC Berkeley Bioengineering department. This program will provide academic mentorship and fund early undergraduate research to strengthen the pipeline for a more diverse biological research community.

This partnership will define local teacher workforce needs and develop new recruiting strategies to interest STEM majors in teaching.  It will build stronger pathways to teaching careers for community college students and identify supports that can help STEM majors become successful STEM teachers. Information produced by the project can inform efforts to increase the number and quality of STEM teachers who can meet the needs of rural schools. <br/><br/>The activities of this project include surveys of local area school personnel, as well as focus groups with current STEM and education majors and alumni.  The resulting data will provide insights into factors that support or hinder careers in STEM teaching at rural schools. The data will also document specific areas of STEM teacher shortage and inform the development of targeted recruiting strategies. Articulation agreements between Upper Iowa University and Northeast Iowa Community College will be strengthened by developing degree plans that enable STEM majors to graduate in four years with teacher certification and the skills to meet the needs of rural school districts.  A review of existing academic support strategies for STEM majors will be conducted, and each strategy will be evaluated for potential success in the local context.  Conference participation will enable project personnel to disseminate findings from the project and will inform the project of viable models in use elsewhere. A strong internal dissemination plan will ensure that information is shared with stakeholders directly engaged in the project and those whom the project intends to serve.

As the deployment of new communication, computation, and control technologies in modern power systems increases, more sophisticated tools will be required to analyze and prevent failure and attack propagations between and within system layers. The objective of this project is to harden CPESs against failures and attacks and to educate future engineers about the new types of threats to future power systems and required tools to strengthen them. The proposed research encompasses the following key areas: classification of system layers and characterization of their interactions; establishment of new reliability and resilience indices; and development of advanced comprehensive models and methods for reliability and resilience assessment and enhancement of CPESs. The impacts of the proposed project extend well beyond these specific research areas. First, the problem of reliability and resilience assurance in power grids is timely since cyber-attacks and network reconnaissance missions have been increasing in recent years. Second, given that power grids are critical to the nation's economy and security and that the consequences of blackouts and damaged grid equipment are severe, it is becoming imperative to harden them against attacks and failure propagation. In addition to these large-scale contributions, the proposed research promises a direct and substantial educational impact, most notably by developing new curriculum, incorporating several project aspects into power reliability and resilient control courses, enhancing graduate and undergraduate research programs, and creating new student mentorship and career opportunities. The proposed research will contribute to the establishment of science and engineering principles for the design, reconstruction, and digitization of CPESs to ensure a secure, reliable, and resilient power supply, and will equip future generations of engineers with the necessary tools to operate and enhance them.<br/><br/>While the objective of this proposal is to harden CPESs against failures and potential cyber- and physical-attacks, the proposed integrative approach addresses the reliability and resilience of future power grids and provides solutions to problems related to various research domains. The anticipated outcomes will advance the following topic areas: (1) characterizing inter- and intra-actions between and within system layers and sub-layers; (2) establishing a set of reliability and resilience indices to contribute to the power and energy industry's goal of developing standardized and universally accepted resilience indices and metrics for CPESs; (3) developing efficient hybrid evaluation methods based on the snowflake development theory for reliability and resilience assessment that is amenable to CPESs; and (4) developing a game theoretic approach to determine proactive defense solutions against unknown and unpredicted emerging threats. The research proposed here will contribute to the development of a transformative mathematical framework and methodology that will enable - both through direct consequences and through promotion of further research solutions to hurdles that presently impede the hardening of CPESs against catastrophic failures and attacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These projects are about combining theory and practice. For example, several are on machine learning which uses probability and statistics to train machines to find correlations in data, identify images, or play games. Other projects are in cryptography, where Mathematics is used to build secure systems. There will be a special effort to recruit students in the program from non-research schools and underrepresented groups. This program will give many of the students a chance to do research, which they otherwise would not have.<br/>This program will give students an idea of what graduate school is like in two ways: (1) their research projects are scaled down versions of PhD theses, and (2) there will be interaction with the students and current grad students.<br/><br/>The students will be offered a variety of projects. We list some sample projects below:<br/>(1) Cryptography: Some next generation cryptosystems are based on the hardness of solving certain problems on lattices (rather than factoring). This project will explore implementations of known algorithms for solving these lattice problems as a way to test the security of the new systems.<br/>(2) Security: Side channel attacks are a way to attack a system by observing how much time or power (or other visible signs) the system uses. In the past such attacks have been used to find keys. In this project we develop and implement attacks that find out information about users' data, as well as develop and implement ways to prevent these attacks.<br/>(3) Allocation: How should a firm allocate its limited interviewing resources to select the optimal cohort of new employees from a large set of job applicants? Solving this problem seems to require interesting algorithms and machine learning techniques. In this project the students will implement programs for the problem and run them on real data.<br/>(4) Machine Learning/Image Recognition: A common problem in Machine Learning is to train a system to recognize an image, say of a dog. How to test such systems? Another problem in machine learning is to generate hard cases for an image-recognizer.

Return migrants are members of the diaspora who migrate back to their homeland. There they are not always easily assimilated, even though they share a language and cultural history with local residents. Thus, return migrants challenge common sense ideas of borders, nation, and citizenship. Given the increased global mobility of the world's populations today, it is important to understand why and how return migrants remain apart from the society they have returned to  and whether or not this situation can be remedied.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted by University of Texas at Austin anthropology doctoral student Hannah Foster, with guidance from Dr. Anthony Webster. The researcher has chosen to study the situation of return Kazakh migrants in Qaraghandy, Kazakhstan, a city that has received large waves of return migrants in recent years. Because the returnees may come from countries with which the Kazakhstan government has uneasy relationships, these return Kazakhs have been the object of governmental attention and special programs. This makes this a productive research site for studying return immigrant integration. The researcher will focus her data collection on a special integration center where the migrants learn Russian and get access to services. Prior research has demonstrated that these interactions may be mediated by the use of multiple languages and shaped by connections back to the diasporic community they left, creating complex communication networks. The researcher will collect data with a combination of linguistic and ethnographic methods including participant observation, recording naturally occurring discourse, matched-guise experiments, feedback interviews, and narrative analysis. Findings from this research will produce new understandings of the return migration processes in relation to maintaining the stability of the nation state. The findings will also be shared with policy makers concerned to improve the lives of the immigrants as well as their social, political, and cultural integration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, improving the speed of stochastic gradient descent is a timely and important research problem. Due to the massive scale of neural network models and training data sets used today, it has become advantageous to parallelize SGD across multiple computing nodes. Although parallelizing SGD boosts the amount of data processed per iteration, it exposes the algorithm to unpredictable node slowdown and communication delays stemming from variability in the computing infrastructure. The goal of this project is to design provably fast SGD algorithms that easily lend themselves to distributed implementations, and are robust to fluctuations in computation and network delays as well as unpredictable node failures. This project can assist in making machine learning universally accessible, without requiring access to expensive high-performance computing infrastructure. An open-source implementation of the resulting adaptive distributed SGD algorithms will be released. The research outcomes will also be incorporated into two new machine learning classes at Carnegie Mellon University, and into curriculum development and research sampler workshops for K-12 teachers and students.<br/><br/>The speed of single-node SGD is typically measured in terms of the convergence of training error with respect to the number of iterations. In distributed SGD, the runtime per iteration depends on system-level factors such as the computation delays at worker nodes and the gradient aggregation mechanism. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the error convergence with respect to the wall-clock time rather than the number of iterations. This project will improve the true convergence of distributed SGD with respect to wall-clock time by jointly optimizing the runtime-per-iteration and error-versus-iterations. It will consider two popular distributed SGD frameworks, the parameter server model and the communication-efficient SGD model. The research is expected to provide novel runtime and error analyses of distributed SGD in these frameworks and design the first adaptive distributed SGD algorithms that strike the best error-runtime trade-off.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will enable faculty from Assumption College, Holyoke Community College, and Middlesex Community College to develop successful transfer pathways into an existing dual degree track for Math and Education majors.  This project will also strengthen partnerships between STEM and Education faculty at Assumption College by supporting collaboration to develop and deliver a new, two-course sequence for STEM majors. The courses will be designed to deepen interest of STEM majors in teaching as a career and will prepare them for a teaching experience at a math-focused summer camp for local high school students. By investigating factors that affect undergraduate STEM majors' interest in teaching as a career, the project will contribute new knowledge about pathways to teaching for STEM undergraduates.  <br/><br/>The project activities aim to increase awareness among first-year, second-year, and transfer students about the existing dual degree program, enable more students to declare the dual major in Mathematics and Education in their third year, and increase the number of students who matriculate as certified teachers. Intensive advising and updated informational materials will increase student and faculty awareness of the new courses and the new articulation agreements developed among the partner colleges.  An informational campaign will target parents and teachers of students in local high schools to recruit high school students for the summer camp in mathematics. The project's assessment strategies will provide information that will be used to: 1) support the STEM majors' successful delivery of effective mathematics instruction at the summer camp; and 2) determine what aspects of the cohort experiences increase interest in teaching. The overall project will benefit from the oversight of an advisory group composed of mathematics and education faculty and undergraduate students enrolled in the dual degree program.  Dissemination efforts will focus on sharing knowledge and curricular materials with local communities as well as with a national audience through conference presentations and publications.

Scientists and economists use randomness extensively in simulations of physical and biological systems and other complex environments. However, a major problem in practice is that physical sources of randomness are defective and only produce correlated bits that contain some entropy.  This leads to the following  fundamental question: To what extent is the use of randomness inherent in applications? Can we reduce the amount or quality of randomness required to perform these tasks? Most applications of randomness in cryptography are inherent. Indeed, we require the secret keys for various cryptographic applications, such as credit card transactions, to be uniformly random.  On the other hand, it is not known if the use of randomness is fundamental in designing efficient algorithms.  This project intends to study these fundamental questions, and in particular, provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of randomness used in cryptography and security, and reduce the amount of randomness used in design of efficient algorithms. <br/><br/>The area of Pseudorandomness provides a unified approach to the above problems and a major goal in this area is to efficiently construct deterministic objects that are random-like. The idea is to replace a random object used in an application, with an explicit construction of a random-like object, thus removing the need for random bits.  Important notions in this area are randomness extractors and pseudorandom generators. A randomness extractor is an algorithm that produces purely random bits from defective sources of randomness. Such extractors can be used in purifying defective sources before carrying out important cryptographic protocols. A pseudorandom generator is a deterministic algorithm that takes a short uniformly random string and stretches it into a much longer string that still ""looks random"" to the appropriate application (e.g., algorithms that use limited memory). This project intends to study several concrete directions to extend the state-of-art on efficient constructions of randomness extractors and pseudorandom generators that will lead to resolving important open problems in computational complexity theory and derandomization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems also have sparse and weak connections and a range of dynamics that cannot be fully probed. There is an urgent need to determine the impact of unmodeled dynamics on the controllability of these networks and develop robust controls accordingly, otherwise controllers will remain underperforming, fragile, and hard to calibrate. This is the case for deep brain stimulation (DBS), which follows a conservative ""one-size-fits-all"" paradigm and remains underutilized despite having the potential to treat millions of people worldwide. The objective of this CAREER program is to develop identification methods that estimate the impact of unmodeled dynamics on neuronal circuits and a robust control framework for these circuits. Brain circuits targeted by Parkinson's disease and DBS will be considered to maximize the impact of the research. The work will be paired with educational plans that address current limitations in the training of neural engineers and broaden the presence of first-generation college students in STEM.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: This research will fill critical gaps in the knowledge base that provides  linkage between global dynamics of a neural network and dynamics of individual neurons under control. It will also contribute a robust control framework for neural populations and brain circuits. Educational activities will fill critical gaps in the training of neural engineers by integrating modeling and control in the design process of neural prostheses. Applied to DBS, this research will help personalize DBS to PD populations who are currently excluded from this treatment, thus enabling new options for chronically ill patients.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research will benefit the well-being of Parkinson's disease patients, including patients who are now excluded from DBS. The training of neural engineers will also be improved, thus helping the formation of a better-trained and more globally-competitive workforce.

As a result, water can control whether an ecosystem releases carbon (a carbon source) or stores carbon (a carbon sink). Consequently, the movement of water plays a key role in global carbon cycling, but DOC is also an important control on water quality across the globe. Understanding how water affects the production and movement of DOC can improve society's ability to provide water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic uses. How and when DOC moves through different types of rivers and ecosystems, especially during floods, is a major knowledge gap in carbon cycling and water quality research. This project will conduct analyses of river DOC dynamics from geographically diverse areas. The project will examine movement of DOC into and out of watersheds and evaluate if DOC dynamics can be estimated from local to continental regions using river flow and watershed properties. This DOC research is combined with an innovative education plan that will improve the translation of hydrological sciences to public audiences via undergraduate curriculum development and student-led scientific outreach. These advances will focus on training students to be effective science communicators and outreach practitioners.<br/><br/>Given the global importance of riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and uncertainty in the light of climate and land use change, the main objectives of this proposal are to test assumptions of watershed DOC flux behavior and to develop new ways to quantify and forecast DOC flux across understudied flow regimes and ecoregions. These objectives will be addressed through multiple approaches, including data synthesis, modeling, and new sensor technologies that will identify the key watershed and climate conditions controlling DOC flux across diverse landscapes. The project integrates these research objectives and general hydrologic science issues with a long-term education plan to establish innovative curriculum development and methods for creating effective outreach materials for multiple public stakeholder groups, including K-12, life-learners, and policy makers. The new curriculum employs novel human-centered design theory and partnerships with five expert outreach institutions to create meaningful experiential learning opportunities that are underrepresented in most science curricula.

As battery costs have decreased, more small-scale distributed batteries have been connected to the network to provide local services. These resources could be aggregated and used to provide grid services when not needed for their local service. Similarly, flexible loads can be aggregated and coordinated to behave like storage and provide multiple services simultaneously. Stacking services improves storage utilization and economics in addition to the ability of the grid to accommodate more renewables, improving its environmental and health impacts along with energy security. The research objective of this proposal is to develop a suite of computationally-tractable optimization and control algorithms that will enable aggregators to optimally coordinate thousands of highly-heterogeneous and distributed small-scale storage resources and loads to provide stacked services. The findings will impact energy policy, specifically the regulations surrounding stacked services.  The PI's overall educational objectives are to inspire students to tackle the grand challenges of climate change and energy security, develop curricula that simultaneously teaches electric power systems and builds students' fundamental STEM skills, and increase public awareness and understanding of modern challenges and opportunities in power systems. To this end, the education plan includes four activities: i) international education and outreach in Liberia; ii) public education and outreach via the development of an online energy storage game highlighting the opportunities and challenges associated with distributed energy storage; iii) graduate and undergraduate education; and iv) outreach to practitioners, researchers, and policymakers via short courses, webinars, and talks. The educational activities will promote workforce development through curricular innovation at University of Michigan and the University of Liberia, and outreach to Liberian K-12 and undergraduate women. <br/><br/>The research objective is challenging because the power system is uncertain, nonlinear, and high dimensional; sensing and communication systems required for storage coordination are imperfect; and coordination must not negatively impact the distribution network. The research will develop i) stochastic optimization approaches to schedule aggregations of distributed storage to provide stacked services, while managing storage nonconvexities; ii) robust predictive nonlinear control approaches to coordinate aggregations of distributed storage to provide stacked services, leveraging novel aggregate storage models capturing degradation dynamics; iii) aggregate load models (identified with experimental data) representing load flexibility as storage, including the efficiency and degradation associated with load coordination actions and the model error resulting from the use of approximate storage-type models; and iv) optimization/control approaches to coordinate highly-heterogeneous storage and load aggregations. The results will be validated in high-fidelity simulation environments and the most promising approaches will be implemented in a realistic physical test bed. Methodologically, the research will develop i) novel stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) methods for nonconvex models, leveraging emerging extensions of SDDP to integer programming problems, and ii) novel robust predictive control methods that integrate sliding mode control and model predictive control. While past work has proposed methods of combining sliding and model predictive control, they require online optimization whereas we seek a control policy for fast online computation.

The high temperature strength of these superalloys has recently been observed to be controlled by intricate atomistic-level processes that are not well understood due to the nature of the superalloy chemistry. The basic research enabled by this CAREER award will uncover the fundamental, atomistic-level processes governing high temperature strength in model metallic materials. Computational methods and theory will be developed to provide predictive capability of these atomistic processes, and advanced characterization methods will verify those predictions. This research will enable higher strength superalloys, which could increase turbine engine efficiencies and power while decreasing pollution emissions. The fundamental insights garnered from this program will be applicable to a wide range of ceramic, metallic, and semiconductor materials used across numerous industries and could enable new technologies. Outreach efforts as part of this program will include mentoring of local High School students and materials engineering-related learning module development and dissemination.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Despite knowledge of solute segregation to stacking faults in crystalline materials, this phenomenon has yet to be utilized as a strengthening mechanism in most structural alloy materials. Recent works in the literature and by the PI have suggested that complex dislocation interactions and minute composition differences in Ni-based superalloys control the solute segregation behavior at stacking faults, and that this segregation behavior can be utilized to increase the high temperature creep strength in Ni-based superalloys. However, due to the complex compositions in advanced superalloys the driving forces governing solute segregation are not well understood. The basic research supported by this CAREER award seeks to uncover the fundamental thermodynamic driving forces for solute segregation to stacking faults in simple alloy compositions. The objective of this work is then to predict and quantify solute segregation at stacking faults during high temperature deformation in Ni-based superalloy compositions in order to utilize Suzuki segregation to further strengthen this important class of structural materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research component of the program uses electron microscopy to understand how complex nanostructures form. Many properties of nanoscale materials are determined by structural imperfections that appear during the growth process and go on to affect the material's final structure. For example, adding a metallic coating to straight silver-gold alloy nanowires can cause the wires to transition to a double helix morphology. Before nanostructures such as these can be widely used in technological applications, there is a need to understand how the helical structure originates. Using advanced electron microscopy, this program will combine extremely detailed and high resolution studies in three-dimensions with high-throughput imaging to obtain a complete picture as to how the helical nanowires grow and twist. This research will advance the fundamental understanding of the processes that determine how complicated nanostructures can be chemically synthesized for future technological applications. The educational component of this program aims to provide access to academic extra-curriculars for high school students in severely underserved areas. Students in many areas in Oakland and Richmond face poverty, hunger, violence and racial discrimination. Social and economic hurdles often prohibit these students' participation in traditional summer extracurricular activities, which can increase the academic achievement gap in this population. Working with local high school teachers, this program will develop and implement a flexible and adaptable summer research experience for these and other students affected by inequitable systems. This program will use imaging and visualization as tools to convey scientific knowledge and excite the students about careers in science. It also aims to develop mentorship networks to help students attain their goals in the college and job market.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>The research portion of this program will use electron microscopy to determine the structural origin of chirality in core-shell nanowires. Nanoscale three-dimensional characterization will be used to study the morphology of the nanowires as they transition from straight to twisted structures during addition of the shell. By varying the shell thickness and atomic species, the role that lattice mismatch plays in the structural transformation from straight to helical in these wires will be determined. Atomic resolution electron tomography will be used to measure the position of defects and the strain distribution in these materials to determine how these structural features are related to the helical structure that these materials adopt. A high-throughput electron microscopy workflow using a machine learning approach will be developed to measure structural heterogeneity in many populations of the straight and twisted nanowires. The comprehensive understanding of the development of the helical morphology demonstrated by the core-shell nanowires under study will relate the presence of microstructural features (defect, strain, grain boundaries) to the overall morphology of the nanowires. This in turn will enable the rational design of functional materials based on this system, application in optoelectronic, nanomechanical, biomimetic or catalytic applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New chemistries are transformed into powerful synthetic methods for the facile and atom-economic synthesis of versatile building blocks starting from simple and readily available chemicals.  The syntheses are also conducted under mild reaction conditions.  These ""one-pot"" cascade methods, used to make complex molecular architectures, address critical challenges in modern organic synthesis. The methods include the improvement of synthetic efficiency, the use of sustainable and inexpensive chemicals, the avoidance of toxic agents, and the reduction of waste and hazardous byproducts.  As a consequence of operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions and environmental friendliness, this research is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Wang's group is well positioned to provide education and training for students from groups that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>This project continues efforts aimed at expanding the scope of aminocatalysis beyond the well-established activation modes of enamine and iminium catalysis.  Professor Wang and his team challenge mechanistic dogma by showing that amine moieties in adducts which result from nucleophilic additions to iminum ions can serve as leaving groups in ensuing nucleophilic substitution reactions. In situ release of the intermediate amine addition products creates a new scenario for aminocatalytic direct functionalization of aldehydes.  This research demonstrates that through careful manipulation of the electronic and steric properties of catalysts and reactants, judicious design and selection of amine catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions, new and powerful catalytic cascade reactions are developed. Given the ready accessibility, reactivity and broad structural diversity of aldehydes, a wide array of new synthetic building blocks and biologically-important complex molecular architectures are constructed in efficient one-pot reactions.  The educational plan continues a tradition to recruit undergraduate students especially from underrepresented minority groups over the summer to conduct research in Dr. Wang's laboratory.  Dr. Wang also integrates the research results and experiments from in his academic laboratory into his undergraduate students' experiences."

Interest in online learning remains high, as it presents an opportunity to broaden the reach of institutions and companies, but success rates in broadly available learning experiences are low. Built upon foundational research in computational social science, the project will use specialized video and text chat tools to collect data from groups engaged in synchronous online learning, analyze and categorize patterns of communication, and give feedback to students to help them have better, more successful experiences online. In keeping with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, the project applies emerging innovations in artificial intelligence to the problem of delivering high-quality learning at scale. While most applications focus on individual learners and creating new personalized educational pathways, this project highlights the importance of collective learning and the power of peer engagement to help all members of a learning community reach their goals together.<br/><br/><br/>This project introduces several innovations in data capture and analytics, as well as feedback to learners while they are collaborating online.

Using deep learning and data modeling, real-time feedback about conversational dominance is generated and shown to learners while they are speaking. The project further explores the effect of machine-generated insights about what happened during the collaboration, and makes recommendations about behavior modifications, based on predictive models. For more nuanced insights, these data are paired with facial-gestural data, such as nodding or raising one?s eyebrows.

The proposed multivariate shrinkage sensor promises a leap forward from the current use of in-mold pressure/temperature sensors for indirect estimation of molded part dimensions and quality. Direct measurement of the shrinkage along with pressure and temperature in situ from the proposed sensor will enable improved process and quality control methods for injection molding which will eliminate the burden of frequent post-molding inspections and allow fully automated manufacturing. As a result, over 30 % of manufacturing cost and time will be saved while achieving 100% quality assurance even for the parts with tighter specifications. The proposed sensor will help heavily regulated industries such as medical devices and automobile manufacturing in achieving significant time reduction for process set-up and stabilization, and improvement in parts quality while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. Each percentage point improvement in productivity due to cycle time reductions, yield improvements, and related automation corresponds to cost savings of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and recycling of defective plastic parts.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a creative and original concept: a multivariate design for measuring shrinkage along with pressure and temperatures via a conventionally packaged device. Furthermore, knowledge and understanding are expected to be advanced in the development and validation of improved on-line models for estimating molded part shrinkage in real-time. Previous research did not have access to in-mold shrinkage data and so propagated faulty initial conditions throughout the shrinkage analysis. Due to the lack of direct observability and controllability of the molded part dimensions, most molders rely on the use of cavity pressure traces or part weight measurements as estimators of the part dimensions.

The primary barrier to installation is the cost of trenching cable, which can be $7,000-$30,000 per service location. Similar challenges exist in emerging markets and remote industrial Internet of Things. Networks cannot easily be replaced with today?s wireless technologies due to the losses that occur when forwarding information wirelessly, which can eliminate up to half of the throughput capability at each forwarding location. Low-loss mesh networking, such as that proposed, would enable fully-wireless solutions to last-mile connectivity problems globally by eliminating reliance on cable. The impact of distributed and scalable algorithms extends beyond mesh networking into the decentralization of other technologies to be more secure and robust, but cannot due to performance issues.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on low-loss mesh networking that could feasibly cover hundreds or thousands of acres with broadband internet access without laying cable. The primary intellectual merits include scalable aggregation of data, reducing communication interference with a predetermined network structure, and other challenges that arise in very large wireless networks. The objective of this research is a wireless mesh network topology and hardware that can maintain less than 17% throughput loss-per-hop in a network larger than 100 nodes.

There is considerable proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and, antimicrobials that do not develop resistance is of significant societal interest. Silver-based antimicrobials are filling this need, and are being used in a variety of medical, consumer and food-related applications. Silver is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, effective against gram positive, gram negative bacteria (including methicillin-and vancomycin resistant bacteria) as well as fungi, viruses, and biofilms. This has led health care, consumer and food industries to use silver antimicrobial products.  The global market for silver-based powder antimicrobial coatings is currently valued at $910 million and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% until 2020. Concerns however, are increasing about the release of silver and the resulting influence on the environment. Development of high potency silver products using the minimum amount of silver can significantly broaden its use. The benefits of this versatile antimicrobial platform include: 1000-fold increased potency, decreased cost, invisibility and compatibility with formulations.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a highly potent silver-based antimicrobial product. Higher potency is due to control of size of ligand-free AgNP (1-3 nm) anchored to the surface of ~30 nm nanozeolite (NZ), and fast release of Ag+ within the zeolite.  The bactericidal activity of AgNP-NZ has been examined with E. coli (gram negative) and antibiotic resistant MRSA (gram positive), with significant improvement. The potency is further enhanced by modifying the NZ support to introduce multiple features: increased antimicrobial activity via NZ ion-exchanged Zn2+, and surface modification of NZ to enhance interactions with bacteria, including penetration within the bacteria. At the conclusion of this SBIR Phase I project, the product will be ready for further commercialization and marketing by (1) demonstrating the scalability of the synthesis procedure so that there is enough supply of product in the product development process; (2) optimizing synthesis procedure of antimicrobial material according to antimicrobial property, including Ag+ and Zn2+ loading and surface modifications; (3) obtaining third party test reports on optimized samples as objective evidence for marketing and (4) studying the toxicity of the product toward mammalian cells to address toxicity concerns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By some estimates, these meadows contribute an average of $20,000 per hectare per year in goods and services. These include nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, carbon burial, and provision of nursery habitat for juvenile fishes, crabs, and shrimps. Alarmingly, seagrasses are threatened by several environmental and human-driven stressors, and loss of seagrass habitat remains a key concern for conservation and sustainable development programs. Anticipated increases in storminess (frequency and intensity) and rainfall under many climate change modeling scenarios make understanding hurricane impacts on valuable coastal habitats such as seagrass meadows important on local, national, and global scales. Indeed, seagrass meadows potentially serve as a 'canary in the coal mine' regarding the effects of increased hurricane activity as they are found at shallow depths and are affected by turbidity and salinity; seagrasses are also vulnerable to burial or erosion due to large storms. Seagrasses (1) include a suite of species with distinct growth and reproductive strategies; (2) live in a range of meadow sizes and degrees of 'patchiness;' and (3) present divergent seasonal cycles. This represents a tremendous opportunity to explore the conditions and attributes that result in seagrass resilience or vulnerability to hurricanes as a model for coastal ecosystem responses more broadly.  <br/><br/>Hurricane Florence made landfall along the NC coast on September 14, 2018. Florence stalled approaching shore, and storm-related winds/rains persisted for >4 days (13th-16th) in southeastern NC. Subsequently, record high sea-level stands (surge + tide) were observed across the NC coastline. Furthermore, Florence became the second wettest US storm, behind only Harvey in 2017, dumping 65 trillion L of rain over land that depressed estuarine salinities for over a month. NC seagrasses are dominated by three species: eelgrass, shoalgrass, and widgeon grass. Meadows exist as polycultures or monocultures, and exhibit a diverse range of spatial configurations. Meadows are also defined by strong seasonality: eelgrass shoots senesce in summer due to heat stress, with sites transformed either into shoalgrass-dominated meadows or mudflats. Subsequent to dieback, eelgrass depends upon a combination of seedbank and surviving apical meristems for regeneration each winter.  Using key seagrass datasets collected by the research team dating back decades across ~40 Florence-impacted meadows, several fundamental ecological questions are being addressed: (1) how sexual (eelgrass: seedbank) v. asexual (shoalgrass: vegetative growth and fragment colonization) life histories promote susceptibility or resilience of seagrass to disturbance; (2) how meadow landscape configuration and plant diversity modulate the effect of storms on seedbank retention; (3) how meadow disturbance (intense physical v. more chronic physiochemical drivers) affected community dynamics, with special focus on plant productivity and the critical 'nursery role' of seagrass habitat; and (4) how seasonality and species traits amplify or attenuate the effects of intense disturbance on seagrasses. This research expands upon previous post-hurricane studies by considering the interactive effects of hurricanes, landscape configuration, and biodiversity on ecosystem responses. It also leverages ongoing, NSF-supported work along the TX coast to compare-and-contrast the responses of different seagrass phenology/growth strategies to storm disturbance (e.g., turtlegrass in TX is a ""leaf-on"" species throughout the year while eelgrass and shoalgrass in NC both exhibit strong seasonality in biomass). Collectively, this work will result in more generalizable models of coastal ecological resilience to storminess.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, graphite's low capacity (theoretically, 372 mAh/g) prohibits the development of higher energy density batteries. The problem is that graphite's internal structure limits lithium diffusion within interlayer spaces. We propose to replace graphite as the anode material. Our material is a newly-discovered high-quality graphene network, consisting of incommensurately-stacked multilayer graphene (IMLG) assembled in three-dimensional (3D) form. It exhibits unique structural and electrical properties that enable the reversible intercalation of large amounts of lithium within interlayer spaces of multilayer graphene. IMLG anode exhibits an extremely high reversible capacity of up to 1500 mAh/g tested as an anode material in LIB cells.

Existing fluorescent materials are formulated with pigments that have thinly dispersed colorants, which dilutes their color and makes them susceptible to degradation. This is done by necessity, because fluorescent dyes have a tendency to aggregate, causing unwanted color changes and loss of the fluorescence effect. This solution utilizes a bottom-up ""self-assembly"" strategy to eliminate aggregation and create stable fluorescent solids that maximize the longevity and boldness of the color. This research will study this novel class of fluorescent pigment to gauge its resistance to fading, improved chromaticity, and material performance in realistic conditions. This will be done by measuring changes to fluorescence intensity and color appearance under natural and laboratory-accelerated weathering conditions, and creating test ""products"" in the form of paints and polymers. These test materials are expected to have stronger color for longer periods of time while still being amenable to commercial processing techniques.

Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining therapy for patients suffering from kidney failure; it requires that blood be withdrawn and cycled through a dialysis machine that performs the function of the failed kidneys. This process must be performed at regular intervals and requires access to the blood with large bore needles. Graft failure complications, many directly attributable to  needle injury, cost the healthcare system billions of dollars per year and lead to significant morbidity and even mortality for patients.

While small wounds heal naturally, larger chronic wounds demonstrate delayed wound healing with infections, and affect over 6.5 million patients costing over US $25 billion annually in treatments. In addition, annually, 2 million Americans suffer from serious infections due to drug resistant bacteria resulting in severe morbidity, serious complications, huge economic losses with an estimated 23,000 deaths. As conventional antibiotics are failing, our ability to fight drug resistant pathogens is diminishing and the pipeline of new potential antibiotic drugs is very skim. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a product that can fight multiple pathogens through a mechanism against which bacteria are less likely to develop further resistance. Hence, the current project evaluates the feasibility of developing a novel, easily handleable dry film with potential to eliminate a variety of infectious pathogens while improving wound healing in a single application. This product is pliable, easily rehydratable, has intrinsic tissue scaffolding properties and is inherently antimicrobial against a broad range of pathogens without the use of any additional agents.  <br/> <br/>This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a shape retaining, pliable, easily handleable antimicrobial cell-scaffolding gel matrix into a product that is simultaneously toxic to antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, while remaining conducive to tissue regeneration. This current product has a nano-porous gel matrix that promotes cellular infiltration and attachment along with utilizing a charge-based mechanism to lyse bacterial membranes upon contact. Although there is on-going research on such self-assembled hydrogels, the formation of films using these nanofibers has never been assessed before and stands to be the key technological advancement. Thus, this current proposal explores two methods for making films such as i) solvent casting methods relying on non-covalent crosslinking - where the hydrogel is applied to a surface and then allowed to dry into a film overnight, and ii) Covalent crosslinking by - incorporating cysteines by oxidizing using H2O2 or crosslinking using Schiff base formation followed by reductive deamination.

More importantly, the lessons learned during this project could, if successful, bring about the emergence of breakthrough energy-autonomous real-time tracking technologies that would significantly increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of worldwide container shipping as well as provide a direct value that could bring about the adoption of the smart container. The container shipping industry stands as one of the unsung heroes of the modern world which, from its birth in the 1960s, cut the cost of shipping goods across the globe by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling global trade on a massive scale and catalyzing the world?s economic development. Nevertheless, this industry has remained largely unmoved by the advent of big data and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This innovation could empower the general introduction and leveraging of such tools, further lower the costs and increase the accessibility of worldwide shipping, and significantly benefit the world and the United States? economies.<br/><br/>The proposed project will require, on the road towards commercialization, the exploration of the properties of backscatter mm-wave localization approaches and channels in complex highly cluttered environments such as that of metallic-parts-crowded repair facilities and terminals covered with container stacks. While significant research efforts are currently invested in the characterization and mapping of mm-wave transmission channels necessary to the planning and rolling out of upcoming cellular 5G networks, no such work has yet been reported for their backscatter counterparts, nor for localization purposes. In addition, although the influence of channels for standard Radio Frequency IDentification-based localization systems has benefited from decades of investigation, that of its higher-frequency correspondent is virtually unexplored and should display different properties and present novel challenges and opportunities, due to major differences in clutter diffraction and absorption. The work will start with the finalization of tag and reader hardware in view of the gathering of detection data in the aforementioned environments, followed by the formulation of the high-performance signal processing schemes used to retrieve tag positions and identities, developed hand in hand with optimized communications modulation schemes for the tags.

Thin films have a significant impact on quality of life as they are used widely in semiconductor devices, displays, solar panels, tribological coatings, cell phones, optical filters, and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The annual market of these industry segments exceeds $600 billion and has been steadily increasing. Common methods to produce thin films include physical and chemical vapor depositions, which today have tradeoffs between film quality and manufacturability. A high deposition rate results in loosely packed atoms and subsequently unstable materials properties. Producing high-quality dense films today requires slow deposition at elevated temperatures leading to high manufacturing cost and other limitations, such as inability to use flexible substrates. Ion sources are plasma generation devices that enable ion beams to interact with materials at the atomic level and efficiently produce dense films. The single beam ion sources bring in multiple benefits for thin film fabrication, including superior stability, improved adhesion, low electrical resistivity, high optical transmittance, and smooth surfaces.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the technical and commercial feasibilities of the single beam ion sources particularly suitable for fabricating high-quality thin films and devices. In ion beam assisted thin-film deposition, ions simultaneously interact with the atoms as they are deposited from another source. The ions transfer kinetic energies to the surface atoms so that they can move around to form densely packed films. The single beam ion sources proposed in this project can produce a highly focused beam of ions with tunable energy for optimal processing of the growing films. These unique features are enabled by an innovative design of the electromagnetic fields, which efficiently generate plasmas and extract the ions in a narrow beam. Unlike the conventional racetrack type ion sources, the single beam ion sources can accurately control the ion incident angle, which has strong effects on the surface morphology of the deposited film.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three highly interdependent CIs are the focus of this research: electric power systems, information and communication technologies (ICT), and electricity- based vehicles/transportation (e-transportation). Network modeling of failure modes and propagation is needed by managers to devise strategies that mitigate the impact of failures across interdependent CIs. Although much progress has been made in network modeling of CIs to date, these efforts fail to capture the complexity of CIs, are based on inadequate or inaccurate assumptions, neglect interdependencies, and are mostly empirical and statistically driven rather than based on principles of physics. The objective of this research is to improve failure and resilience modeling of interdependent CIs. This work will then be expanded using reinforcement learning to aid in decision-making. The outcome will be a framework to account for CI interdependencies that are critical for failure and disaster planning and recovery.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The influence graph-based model and reinforcement learning-based interdependency mitigation framework eloquently address a key problem that has long challenged city/infrastructure planners and operators: how to model, forecast, and prevent cascaded failures that propagate through multiple critical infrastructures.

The resulting tree mortality produces ecosystem responses that affect water quantity and quality, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling, with implications for future forest production and health.  Understanding how these two stresses affect forests is critical to the management and availability of water in the western US.  This award will significantly contribute to ecosystem models that predict where and how fast carbon, nitrogen and water move in these forests. Results from this study will be shared with regional water and forest managers using the Wyoming Water Forum. Underrepresented and first-generation pre-college students will be involved in the project through the University of Wyoming ""Summer Research Apprentice Program"".<br/><br/><br/>This award will quantify carbon and water fluxes in relation to post-beetle fire intensity, partitioning these fluxes into contributions from the understory plants, overstory plants, and soil. The researchers will further assess the interactive effects between post-beetle fire and vegetation regrowth, specifically in regard to soil water and available soil N. The researchers will take advantage of a recent fire that burned through a beetle-affected lodgepole pine forest in Chimney Park Wyoming. The heterogeneous distribution of burn severity and existing pre-burn data provide a unique opportunity to understand the physical and biological processes that control the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles within a forest ecosystem following sequential and interacting disturbances. The researchers will measure ecosystem pools and fluxes of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen in forest patches of different post-beetle burn intensities (bark beetles only, bark beetles plus understory fire, bark beetles and stand replacing fire) using eddy covariance, sap flow, electrical resistivity tomography, vegetation surveys, and biogeochemical techniques. This study will leverage existing equipment and benefits from an extensive pre-disturbance data set. This award will develop predictions and attribution to biological (e.g. transpiration controlled by plant conductance) and/or physical (e.g. soil evaporation and interception from bare branches) drivers in these forests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenge to bring therapies to the clinics for diseases that currently have no cure, which is coupled with an expanding market.  Orphan drug sales are expected to reach $262 billion in 2024.  Over the last few years, organoids made from human embryonic stem cells have raised the possibility of understanding the mechanisms leading to a genetic disorder by reconstituting, in vitro, a similar arrangement of the specific cell populations that are implicated in a certain disease. By comparing organoids made from healthy cells to those carrying the associated genetic mutation, drug testing may be performed in vitro to discover new therapeutics. However, this potential has not been harnessed due to technical limitations. In this proposal, as a necessary step towards this goal, the plan is to develop the analytical tools based on machine learning algorithms that will allow the analysis of drug therapeutic potential and toxicity when applied to organoid cultures.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this STTR Phase I project is to develop and validate an unbiased analytical scheme to quantify the results of high-throughput phenotypic screens performed on micropattern organoids. Organoids have the potential to revolutionize the pre-clinical part of the drug discovery pipeline as they provide unbiased endpoints, they are disease relevant, and sensitive to toxicity. However, the use of multi-cellular organization in a high-throughput platform requires analysis of large amounts of information-rich microscopy images. The tools developed in this proposal will allow turning the biological complexity of tissue scale phenotypes into information predictive of the clinical potential of a compound. In the first aim, the goal is to demonstrate that the proposed method allows quantifying compound toxicity. The plan is to calibrate the toolbox against known methods quantifying cell viability, applying known toxic agents and withdrawn drugs.

Even with the significant resources spent on wastewater treatment, 3 to 10 billion gallons of untreated sewage are still released from US wastewater treatment plants each year. Development of technologies leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to better manage complex biological and chemical processes will not only have a major impact on the $91 billion wastewater treatment system control market, but on other biochemical-dependent industries as well. In addition to reducing the societal financial burden associated with wastewater treatment, this technology will improve the sustainability of the infrastructure and will limit the environmental impact of human activities. Wastewater operators will be able to utilize this technology's real-time decision-making software to significantly reduce their municipal facility operating costs and decrease environmental pollution caused by non-compliance and overflows.<br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop real-time software for assisting wastewater treatment operators with decision-making for improved efficiency and effectiveness.

This project improves upon current approaches by linking biological components of the wastewater treatment plant with historical data using machine learning techniques. Phase I research will focus on development of: 1) an influent flow/composition model allowing accurate model inputs; 2) a full-scale hybrid model combining physical process and machine-learning bioprocess modules able to accurately predict plant effluent flow and quality, and; 3) a software platform to manage the model processes. The technical approach will focus on balancing the complexity of incorporating large-scale genomic data as part of a non-linear treatment process while ensuring high accuracy and maintaining model stability.

Every drug delivered to a human engages the network of blood vessels for delivery to the target tissue or as part of the removal. An essential feature of the blood vessel network is an extensive network of small vessels surrounded by smooth muscle which can contract and dilate to control blood flow, and thus drug delivery. There are no in vitro human platforms that can mimic this biological function, despite the fact that cardiovascular toxicity is the leading cause of failure in clinical trials. As such, a pre-clinical tool to assess vascular toxicity would significantly impact the drug development process. Developing a successful drug averages 10-12 years and nearly $2.6 billion. Despite the fact that ~60% of the total development costs are spent on human clinical trials, fewer than 1 in 10 entering clinical trials will succeed. There is a significant opportunity to improve the accuracy of preclinical drug screening which, in turn, will generate dramatic cost savings and shorten time-to-market. The company's proposed vasoactive human vascular network represents a leap forward in technology to simulate the human response to new and existing drugs. Furthermore, the platform technology has broad future applications including the incorporation of tissue specific function (e.g, human tumor cells) and patient specificity which will further advance drug development and precision medicine.<br/><br/>There are currently no in vitro platforms that can mimic vasoconstriction or vasorelaxation, processes which require vasoresponsive smooth muscle cells. Competing technologies line prefabricated tubes or membranes with endothelial cells to mimic the vasculature which will never be able to simulate vasoactivity. Since the company's platform is comprised of living dynamic microvessels, the company is uniquely positioned to create a platform with this functionality. The primary objective is to develop a 3D perfused human vascular network with smooth muscle providing the capacity to characterize vasoactive substances. The company will achieve the primary objective by completing two specific aims: 1) Incorporate human smooth muscle cells into a 3D in vitro vascular network; and 2) Quantify the dose-response of the 3D perfused vessel network to a panel of vasoactive drugs. Achieving vasoactive functionality in an in vitro vascular network will be the first demonstration of this critical biological phenomenon, and will meet an important commercial need in the pharmaceutical industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By commercializing the proposed effectively transparent contact (ETC) technology the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of solar energy systems could be dramatically reduced, resulting in accelerated adoption of solar energy to address greenhouse gas emission and to become independent of fossil fuels. Improving power output of solar cells is one of the most effective means to drive down LCOE, and the ETC technology is broadly applicable to improve the power output of nearly all types of solar cells. Lower-cost solar cells can also be expected to benefit the developing world as well as disadvantaged communities that lack access to the power grid. In the near term, the proposed ETC technology will unlock higher power output and new applications for III-V photovoltaics, which are used predominantly in aerospace, defense, high performance consumer electronics and automotive. These rapidly growing markets require higher power output solar cells to add functionality (RADAR, LIDAR and surveillance) by increasing the payload capacity that is currently limited by the available space to mount the solar cells. <br/><br/>The proposed project will demonstrate the commercial viability of the ETC technology by demonstrating a new world record solar cell and scalable fabrication on commercial III-V solar cells. Metal contacts are required for charge extraction from solar cells, typically covering 5-6% of the front surface and blocking sunlight from reaching the photovoltaic material below. These losses due to blocking of incoming sunlight by the metal contacts are the largest single contribution to the performance loss in most solar cells. The proposed ETC technology eliminates these losses and thereby boost the solar cell power output by 5-6%. The ETC technology has been demonstrated at lab scale and is world's highest performing front contact technology. During the research project, ETCs will be integrated with commercial III-V solar cells supplied by prospective initial customers and world-leading research partners. The technical viability of ETCs will be established by achieving dramatic improvements in cell efficiency for each cell type, whereas the commercial viability will be established by successfully integrating the ETCs using techniques, materials, and tools suitable for commercial scale-up.

More than 100,000 implanted orthopedic fixation devices (pins, plates, and screws) acquire bacterial infections each year in the US, accounting for approximately $1.5 trillion in associated medical and surgical treatment costs. Furthermore, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics to treat these infections has led to a dramatic rise in antibiotic resistance, which poses a severe risk to human health. This project aims to develop and optimize a commercially viable process to impart orthopedic fixation devices with a unique surface nanotexture designed to inhibit bacterial attachment and disrupt the biofilm cycle while simultaneously stimulating robust implant integration with adjacent bone. Importantly, this treatment acts via topography alone and does not incorporate antimicrobial agents or pharmaceuticals. Due to the ubiquity and gravity of the infection epidemic, this first-of-its-kind antibacterial surface technology is expected to rapidly infiltrate the orthopedic device market and drive a dramatic market shift towards the development of products with enhanced biological activity. Ultimately, this project has the potential to alleviate significant clinical and economic burdens while stimulating technological advances in a competitive market. <br/><br/>The proposed work aims to create an antibacterial surface nanotexture by utilizing a proprietary modified atomic deposition technique. The fabrication parameters used during this deposition process are closely linked to the resulting surface characteristics (and thus its antimicrobial efficacy). However, the link between fabrication parameters and antimicrobial efficacy is inadequately understood currently. Therefore, the proposed work employs a systematic strategy to elucidate the relationships involved and establish control over the fabrication process and resulting surface properties. The project is separated into four stages, each designed to explore the effect of a specific fabrication parameter on performance outcomes, including bacterial colonization, bone cell functions, and trends in certain surface properties that often correlate with cell-substrate interactions (e.g. surface energy, roughness, skewness, etc.). The relationships revealed through testing will be used to build a set of equations that describe how the properties of the nanotextured surface vary as a function of the fabrication parameters. This set of equations will then be used to optimize the system, enabling consistent and controllable operation of the deposition process as manufacturing specifications evolve. In addition to advancing the development of a market-changing product, the proposed research will contribute to the growing understanding of cell and bacteria responses on nanostructured surfaces in an ongoing effort to mitigate infection associated with orthopedic implants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laparoscopic injuries most often occur during primary port entry, before visualization into the abdominal cavity is possible. Injuries are primarily to the bowel or vasculature and are very serious, with mortality rates up to 5% for bowel injuries and up to 15% for vascular injuries. To minimize this risk, surgeons lift the abdominal wall away from the vital organs that could be inadvertently punctured during primary port entry. Two lifting techniques are commonly utilized, but one is unreliable and the other invasive. The product in development utilizes suction instead of mechanical force to grasp the abdominal wall and is more reliable and less invasive than the current techniques. Projected benefits include better surgical outcomes, increased surgeon and patient satisfaction, and decreased patient post-op pain. Successful development of this product is forecasted to create 40 new jobs by 2023 with an annual payroll exceeding $2.5M. As a direct result of this Phase I grant, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2019 and become the gold standard for abdominal wall lifting devices in the next five years.<br/><br/>The technical innovation in this proposed project is a novel abdominal lifting device for use in laparoscopic surgery that is more reliable and less invasive than current lifting techniques.

This suction allows for the non-invasive attachment of the lifting device to the abdominal wall.  Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using perforating towel clips. Manual grasp does not always provide a secure grip and perforating towel clips invasively perforate abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate.

If successful, this project will demonstrate to farmers that low-cost measurement and forecasting of plant water stress is possible, and that Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendations for irrigation scheduling reduce water and energy usage, eliminate plant water stress, and increase crop yields.

These ML models will perform sensor fusion on the data from the low-cost sensor arrays and output a plant water stress measurement.  These ML models can then forecast future plant water stress, which will be compared to actual field measurements for accuracy assessment and refinement.

Lasers have become the true facilitator of the data-based society.  It is tool of choice for future smart factories and on-demand manufacturing.  It serves as the fundamental building block of optical sensing systems used to collect large volumes of critical data to be used for decision making in every facet of society.  The myriad of new applications for laser systems echoes the same demand ? higher power.  The bottleneck in the power generation is often the capability of optical components of the laser to withstand the power without degradation.  So the greater potential of lasers can be unleashed if there would be a way to break through the power handling capability of laser components starting with the nonlinear optical crystals indispensable in creating these powerful energy sources.  This research project is precisely designed to address this need and the successful completion of this project would enable the next generation of miniaturized electronic devices, expand our horizon of biological imagery and precision surgery, and explore our universe with instruments that are currently confined to our laboratories.<br/><br/>The proposed project targets the most common material used to generate high power visible and UV light ? Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal.  Able to handle power density up to 45GW/cm2, LBO is currently the material of choice for high energy industrial lasers.  However, optical surfaces where the light enter and exit LBO often get damaged well before the actual bulk material.  Traditional dielectric anti-reflective (AR)  coatings on these surfaces are typically made using a limited selection of materials of lower damage threshold in a process highly susceptible to contamination, resulting in significantly lower damage threshold than the bulk LBO crystal.  In this proposal, state-of-the-art surface-texturing processes on LBO will be developed to eliminate the use of these dielectric films while still providing the necessary AR functionality.  A variety of processes and materials on LBO surfaces will be attempted and studied with resulting surfaces tested for absorption and damage threshold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For color displays (TV, cell phone, computer, virtual reality, watches, etc.) OLED is superior to all existing technologies in terms of energy usage, display color space, viewing angle, etc.  For lighting, OLED fixtures use very low energy, the light is soft, casts no shadow, and is architecturally flexible.  OLED is the display and lighting technology of the future.  However cost and short device lifetime has retarded commercial advancement.  The introduction of an entirely new class of materials for OLED manufacturing will enable this advancement. <br/><br/>The proposed project will reduce OLED cost and improve performance by utilizing a new class of photoelectric materials for the nanometer thick layers that comprise an OLED.  OLED layers utilize single-component small molecules for the charge transporting and light-emitting layers.  These molecules tend to crystallize and are poor solvents for the emitting molecules leading to decreased light emission efficiency and shortened device lifetime.  The innovation is using isomeric mixtures of designed molecules that are amorphous and non-crystallizable in all three layers.  These molecules are chemically designed to meet all the required photophysical and electrical characteristics necessary for superior OLED performance.  Preliminary device fabrication and testing has confirmed that these new materials dramatically improve both emission efficiency and device lifetime with the standard emitter molecules.  Due to the physics of charge recombination in the emitter layer there is only one technology which has the potential to harvest 100% of the injected charge as emitted light:  thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).  OLEDs using TADF technology have demonstrated high efficiency but with very short device lifetime.

This is especially pertinent to English language learners (Els), international students, and Special Education students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive impairments that impede their reading abilities. Existing tools offer one-size-fits-all solutions offering no control over the simplification process. The proposed Personalized Text Simplifier (PeTeS) will adapt texts to the reading levels of individual students, thereby filling a much-needed gap in the marketplace. With over 60% of U.S. K-12 students reading below grade level, the broader impact of the proposed technology will be in improving the literacy of a diverse population. The expected outcomes of using PeTeS will be improved vocabulary acquisition and improved reading and comprehension of texts by ELs and international students. Using PeTeS for reading may lead to better grades and higher graduation rates. PeTeS will also save teachers time on not having to explain texts or translate for students. PeTeS, will complement the instructor and provide additional support to ELs and international students, especially, in content areas, where these students have very little support.<br/><br/>The proposed PeTeS is envisioned to be an adaptive reading assistant for personalizing instruction. The key innovation of PeTeS is in the application of natural language processing algorithms to perform automatic text simplification to dynamically meet specific reading levels - simplification being defined as an adaptation of any given text in a way that maximizes the likelihood that the student will understand its content. The key idea here is to replace a word that is presumed to be not known by the student with a word that is presumed to be known, i.e., the replacement criteria is the student?s knowledge and not the word complexity. Towards that, the proposed PeTeS technology will maintain a student knowledge model representing the reading level of the student.

Improved computer chip performance is critical to countless applications as computers,mobile phones, tablets, and Internet of Thing have become ubiquitous in everyday life.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the challenges which the semiconductor industry faces trying to move beyond 14 nm technologies by using Chemical Mechanical Planarization. Polishing pads are used to planarize wafer surface for multilayer stack integration. Conventional polishing pad technology has randomly distributed micro pores that lead to non-uniform polishing and scratched due to stress concentration on asperities with less than 1% real contact area. Additionally, conventional pads require a pad conditioning process to re-generate pad surface. This project proposes engineering micro features on the pad surface using micro fabrication technologies. In addition, the real contact area between the pad and wafer will be controllable increasing to 5-10 percent of the total pad-wafer contact. This will make the polishing performance more precise and consistent. The micro features are designed to retain polishing slurry longer so to increase the number of active slurry abrasives for polishing. The contact area and feature design will be tunable to specific polishing performance requirements per customer applications. The independent multi-body structure of a hard top-pad with a soft sub-pad will increase the conformity of the pad and distribute the pressure from polishing evenly across the pad surface.

In this industry, there is currently an urgent need to continuously monitor the air quality in shipping containers where large volumes of perishable food items (fresh fruits and vegetables) are stored. Poor environmental conditions in these containers such as unregulated or high temperatures and low humidity can trigger early ripening of fruits and vegetables, leading to the efflux of specific volatile organic compounds; predominantly ethylene. Due to large volume of produce stored in these containers, if gone unchecked, the environment inside can quickly accumulate high levels of ethylene leading to accelerated ageing and subsequently spoilage. As one can imagine, an appropriate gas sensing technology to continuously monitor ethylene levels would allow adaptive climate control inside the containers, thereby ensuring produce freshness on arrival and preventing billions of dollars in loss and reducing food waste.<br/><br/>This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop a low-cost ethylene sensing technology using bulk silicon transistor technology (also called CS-FET or chemical sensitive field effect transistor), for mass-deployment in refrigerated containers transporting fresh produce to different parts of the world.

To develop the ethylene sensing layers, this effort will pursue the screening of various nanomaterial systems such as ultra-thin layers of noble and transition metals, their composites, sub-oxides, as well as polymeric films using the silicon CS-FET as the backbone technology platform.

Currently, less than half of the N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields is used by the crops to which it is applied.  The remaining N is either leached from the soil or lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide - potent greenhouse gas. This inefficient use of N fertilizer by crops is an economic burden for farmers, cause serious water and air quality problems, and contribute about 2.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these N losses represent a tremendous energy inefficiency, because the production of synthetic N fertilizer is the largest energy input in production agriculture. The key to improving N use efficiency in crop production is applying the right amount of N fertilizer in the right place at the right time. The proposed sensor technology would be disruptive to existing agricultural technology and practices, wherein N fertilizer is applied at a uniform rate across agricultural fields, and improve profitability for farmers.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a robust field-mobile soil nitrate (NO3-) sensor utilizing mid-infrared technology to facilitate precision N fertilizer applications.

Thermoplastic composites have the potential to reduce cycle time, reduce labor requirements, and improve recyclability; however, traditional thermoplastic processes are energy intensive. This Phase 1 SBIR is seeking new, more efficient process heating methods that can be integrated into a continuous composite manufacturing process to improve production speed and reduce operating costs, enabling the growth of composite materials in weight sensitive industries that require high-volume, low-cost structural components, including automotive, unmanned aircraft, wind turbines, and cargo transportation.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the technical feasibility of ultrasonic heating and induction heating as an alternative to infrared heating in a continuous composite forming process. Process heating constitutes a significant portion of the direct energy consumed by in manufacturing. This is particularly true in the production of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites, where the polymer matrix must be melted as part of the consolidation process. As part of this Phase 1 project, heater modules for induction heating, ultrasonic heating, and infrared heating will be developed and integrated into a bench-scale, continuous composite forming prototype. Composite material will be produced using each heating method and energy consumption will be monitored during the forming process. The composite material produced during testing will be weighed and embodied energy will be calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the mass of the material. The objective of this work is to identify a heating method that can reduce embodied energy by at least 40%, relative to the infrared heating system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cloud computing has proven to be a disruptive technology in the Information Technology (IT) sector, and the application container market is a rapidly growing segment of this sector. Although containers provide a simpler and more efficient apparatus to host applications in the cloud, there are important problems to address, such as weak security isolation, low kernel compatibility, and poor kernel customization. Security is the most common concern because one infected kernel can affect a multitude of containers. So far, each organization that has adopted container applications has been required to independently ensure their own security. One study found that a majority (54% of participants) ran containers on top of virtual machines (VMs) for security isolation, which sacrifices performance and cost efficiency. Thus, there is a significant need to provide a container architecture that supports greater security without sacrificing performance and cost efficiency. This project addresses this urgent need, and the resulting technology can be applied broadly to domains such as cloud computing, Information Technology (IT) infrastructures, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), etc.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further improve usability, security, and efficiency of a novel software application container architecture, so that it can be easily deployed and evaluated by customers. While the current platform can run Docker containers without modifications, it is incompatible with the Docker and Kubernetes orchestration platforms, which is a probable obstacle to adoption for many container users and developers. The novel containers can run unmodified iterations of existing applications and automatically optimize performance of many applications by patching the binary during runtime. However, it is challenging to handle complicated scenarios in the application binary, and a more sophisticated technique is required to further improve the coverage of the automatic binary optimization module. Due to the licensing requirements of some of the software the novel container platform is based on, the research prototype is run open-source. The goal of this project is to address these limitations and challenges through five major objectives: support Docker and Kubernetes ecosystem compatibility; improve automatic binary optimization coverage; re-design the platform to avoid open-source license violations; further improve security; develop an automatic installation tool and a product demonstration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 55,000 patients with spinal deformity seek improvement in their reduced quality of life through surgery each year in the US. The goal of these surgeries is to mechanically adjust and fix the spine into a biomechanically balanced position.  It is common for surgeons to plan these intensive surgeries before the operation.  However, the operating room environment introduces many challenges that make it difficult for the surgeon to measure the contour of the patient's spine as it changes during surgery.  Current commercial offerings rely on radiation-based imaging which involves significant operative delays, ionizing radiation exposure, and narrow 2-dimensional fields of view.  These suboptimal solutions contribute to the high rates of continued postoperative deformity along with the need for repeated surgeries. This project focuses on the development of imaging technology that will enable real-time, 3D, whole-spine assessments of a patient's spinal alignment with significant reduction in both time per alignment assessment and radiation exposure compared to current standards. By providing real-time, quantitative feedback to surgeons during these cases, the technology stands to greatly improve surgical outcomes and reduce the need for repeat operations. <br/><br/>This project repurposes the functionality of an off-the-shelf optical tracking system by coupling it with novel hardware and software registration algorithms.  When coupled with these enhancements, the camera system will enable rapidly-generated, quantitative measurements of a patient's spine while in the operating room.  By leveraging technology that is already present in the majority of surgical centers, the path to commercialization for this innovation is greatly accelerated. This removes the need for most centers to purchase additional capital equipment, while also integrating seamlessly into a system that is familiar to many surgeons. The expansion of this high-precision technology will also enable more data-driven and patient-specific decisions to be made for a variety of surgeries The project is led by a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and world-class neurosurgeons with experience in translating medical devices into impactful commercial products.

A ubiquitous cost effective multipoint touch sensing technology would make a broader impact beyond consumer electronics by improving motor skills and potentially eliminating phantom pain for amputees fitted with neuro prosthetics limbs. As the digital world becomes more connected and continues to permeate our physical world in the form of the mobile Internet of Things, autonomous cars, and other wireless connected smart technologies, it is important to reduce the cost barrier for adoption and ease of interaction between the device and the human.

The focus is to optimize product design and algorithm to enable gold standard accuracy across thousands of mass manufactured devices and millions of patients.  The device will be a cost effective means to achieving improved ear infection diagnosis in primary care where it is most needed.

Collectively, ear infection results in at least $5B direct healthcare costs annually in the US and billions more in lost parent productivity.  Improving ear infection diagnosis has the potential to eliminate millions of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions - a crucial step in mitigating development of resistant microorganisms.  Addressing this challenge requires a product that is cost-effective and consistently accurate.<br/><br/>This project will enable the first commercially available optical spectroscopy product for middle ear effusion and the only known method capable of accurately assessing ear health in very waxy ears.

Mosquito-borne illnesses affect 700M people worldwide and cause several million deaths each year.  Chikungunya, West Nile, Malaria, Zika, Dengue, are just some of the debilitating vectors spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito-derived diseases cost >$6.8B/year and the market for mosquito repellents is >$3.2B and growing. Many solutions are aimed at killing and disabling mosquitoes, but mosquitoes are a crucial part of the ecological food chain. Further, many repellents are extremely toxic, and mosquitoes are developing resistance. The proposed technology will be used to identify compounds that will drive the endogenous skin microbiome to a more mosquito repellent phenotype. Using these methods, it is possible to harness the biochemistry contained in the native skin microbiome to create an endogenous repellency that is a safe, natural, environmentally friendly, and effective barrier to mosquitoes. It is expected that this repellency approach may be used safely even with children and pregnant women. In addition, it may be possible to use this approach to develop repellents for multiple insects, repellent products for companion animals, and additional over-the-counter skin products.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a new class of topical insect repellents by influencing repellency in the skin microbiome.

The goal is to create a topical mosquito repellent product. For this project, the plan is to complete metagenome sequencing on skin samples collected from individuals that are either naturally repellent or attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes (the mosquito that carries Malaria). The next step is to predict metabolite compound turnover and use metabolomics to validate the results. In vitro assays and in silico models will be used to provide proof-of-concept for the use of those predicted compounds to induce the microbiota to produce mosquito repellent metabolites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed product can have significant impact across multiple industries and disciplines, including food processing and safety, environmental monitoring, homeland security, and biomedical diagnostics. It will provide the following important benefits to diverse customers: speed for near-real time gas analysis with high performance, portability and robustness for in-field and on-site uses, low cost to purchase and maintain, ease to use, and versatility for different applications.

A small, high energy density TPV power source has the potential to transform multiple markets that currently rely on battery power by reducing the battery weight by 75%. For example, remote scientific instrumentation stations in polar regions rely on 1000-2000 pounds of batteries to operate through the six-month polar night, resulting in high installation costs. Dismounted warfighters carry 10-20 pounds of batteries and would have greater capability if they could carry ammunition and water instead. Small unmanned aerial vehicles would be more effective if they could fly themselves to remote and inaccessible locations, perform their mission for longer, and then return.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a new approach to photonic crystal fabrication to greatly improve the efficiency of TPV energy generation - the conversion of fuel into electricity with heat and light as intermediaries. A TPV generator works by burning fuel to heat a selective emitter to incandescence, leading to infrared radiation which drives specialized photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. A photonic crystal selective emitter greatly improves the efficiency of the generator by almost perfectly matching its emission spectrum to the photovoltaic cell. Our photonic crystal is a square array of cylindrical micro-cavities etched into a refractory metal substrate. The research objectives of this project address the technical hurdles that limit the use of photonic crystals in TPV: scalable substrate preparation from commercial foils using a novel high-throughput process; nanofabrication over large flexible substrates using traditional semiconductor manufacturing tools; and integration with the generator by brazing. The anticipated technical results of this project are to develop a process capable of a breakthrough fifty-fold increase in photonic crystal emitter area, to enable photonic crystal fabrication on flexible substrates, and to reduce photonic crystal cost - all leading to a practical TPV generator that meets market demands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins used as therapeutics frequently have insufficient half-lives in human blood plasma, so that patients with chronic disease need to receive frequent dosings, often by painful injections. These burdensome dosing schedules result in high rates of patient noncompliance, with attendant poor responses and negative health outcomes. Therapeutic proteins with improved half-lives in blood plasma would permit relaxed dosing schedules, lowering costs of administration and improving outcomes by reducing noncompliance. This proposed technology focuses on improving the plasma half-life of a therapeutic for a chronic disease primarily affecting children that currently comprises a $4B global market. Similarly, industrial enzymes are frequently deployed in harsh environments that impair enzyme stability and activity. Endowing enzymes with improved resistance to destabilizing chemicals would enable their deployment in high-value environments that are currently prohibitive. The proposed technology will be used to stabilize an enzyme for application in a $730M segment of the personalized medicine market. If successful, this work would provide a platform for developing next-generation enzymes deployable in currently prohibitive environments. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to utilize a synthetic biology platform to create proteins with new amino acid building blocks that dramatically improve half-life and stability. Many proteins used as therapeutics or used as industrial enzymes are stabilized by disulfide bonds. These bonds break in the presence of chemicals called reducing agents that are found both in human blood plasma (destabilizing to therapeutics) and in solvents and buffers (destabilizing to industrial enzymes). Using a strain of engineered E. coli that can incorporate amino acids beyond the 20 standard amino acids into proteins, the goal is to replace disulfide-forming cysteine amino acids with selenocysteine amino acids that form bonds called diselenides. Diselenide-stabilized proteins maintain stability and activity in environments with reducing agents incompatible with disulfide-stabilized proteins. This project will produce a diselenide-stabilized protein therapeutic for a major disease class. Improvements to disulfide-stabilized therapeutics will be demonstrated by ELISA assays showing improved binding activity, and by cell-based assays showing improved therapeutic activity, after prolonged exposure to blood plasma. This project also will produce a diselenide-stabilized industrial enzyme to catalyze a critical reaction for personalized medicine. Performance improvements over disulfide-stabilized enzymes will be demonstrated by in vitro stability and activity assays in reducing conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

International development groups refer to these as ""child marriages"" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why ""child marriage"" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. <br/><br/>Research will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood.

For many of these environments, legged robots, as opposed to wheel-based robots, appear to be the most viable option for achieving the desired level of locomotion autonomy. Prior work has produced ATRIAS, a two-legged robot, which was designed to replicate the dynamic properties of human and animal legs, and Cassie, which retains this dynamics-first approach but improves upon ATRIAS by adding steering capability and ankles, along with engineering improvements. Compared to conventional robot-leg designs, the designs of ATRIAS and Cassie carefully incorporate ""passive dynamics"" into the mechanism, essentially bringing the dynamic behavior of the hardware into partnership with the software control system. This approach has the potential to exhibit locomotion capabilities much closer to humans. However, the flexibility and ""springiness"" of these human-like legs creates new challenges for locomotion control. While ATRIAS and Cassie are currently able to walk and run outdoors over moderate terrain using basic balance control methods, the methods are still not able to support more complex locomotion activities, such as navigating stairs or rocky terrain. The proposed research will develop new control methods for dynamic legged locomotion, which will enable robots such as ATRIAS and Cassie to effectively move around in our homes, workplaces, and other complex natural environments with much more flexibility, while using much less energy. This will significantly expand on the application domains for which autonomous robot locomotion can be applied. <br/><br/>The primary technical contribution of the project will be twofold: First, the research will study machine learning techniques to dramatically improve the existing hand-crafted controllers for dynamic locomotion, and create a rich action space composed of behavior policies that produce robust walking, standing, running, and leaping behaviors with various speeds, step/jump heights, and other characteristics. This action space provides an expressive and compact means of controlling the motion of a legged robot, greatly surpassing direct torque control in expressiveness while also dramatically reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Second, the research will design a fast and efficient sampling-based planning architecture, which also uses machine learning to speed up the planning process to allow for real-time fulfillment of movement goals while avoiding collisions and falls. This work adds new knowledge in research on legged locomotion planning by considering obstacle planning and robot dynamics as an integrated problem. Most prior work attempts to decouple the two pieces, for example by using a planner to find footholds in kinematic space and handing them to a dynamics controller that tries to maintain balance as the robot follows the kinematic goals. For human-like performance in two-legged locomotion, the project considers foothold choice to be intrinsically linked to robot dynamics, and considers foot placement in an integrated way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soybean is the most widely grown crop in the United States with nearly 90 million acres under cultivation. Soybean is a key part of the food system and generates $22 billion in export revenue each year. One of the greatest threats to soybean production is the fungal pathogen known as Asian Soybean Rust. Current commercial soybean varieties have no resistance to this pathogen and over $2 billion is spent annually on fungicides to control this disease. While soybean is highly susceptible to this disease, many wild plant species have natural resistance to this pathogen. This project seeks to identify the naturally occurring mechanisms of disease resistance in wild plant species that can be used to develop disease-resistant soybean varieties. Adoption of these varieties is expected to bring more than $4 billion in value to the soybean industry while improving productivity and reducing fungicide use.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer disease resistance to Asian Soybean Rust, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. A key determinant of whether or not a plant is resistant to a particular pathogen is whether the plant has an appropriate immune receptor protein capable of recognizing the presence of the invading pathogen. Once activated, plant immune receptors trigger plant defense responses that typically result in immunity. This project will use reverse genetic and biochemical approaches to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer resistance to Asian Soybean Rust. Preliminary work identified several molecules from Phakopsora that elicit an immune response in non-host plant species. The goal is to identify the cognate immune receptors and test them for sufficiency to enable immune activation in response to Asian Soybean Rust elicitor molecules.

The IoT has been growing rapidly since 2012 with about 9 billion devices, including around 20 billion devices in 2018 and reaching more than 30 billion devices connected to the IoT by 2020. An IoT device can be installed in a static location such as a building or a traffic intersection to collect data about air pollution, water quality, or traffic in a city. A device, such as a smart watch, can also be attached to a moving object (human) to monitor a person's movement pattern, heart rate, or calories burned. In both cases, data generated by an IoT device possess spatial and temporal attributes that represent the geospatial location and time of the sensed observation. Furthermore, various devices measure different observations (e.g., temperature, sound, speed, etc.). The aim of this project is to build innovative scalable technologies that seamlessly connect data collected from various geographically distributed IoT devices that can effectively manage and analyze the ever growing IoT data at various spatial and temporal scales. The results of the project will provide a tool for policy makers, scientists, businesses, and citizens to better utilize and extract value from IoT data in a variety of applications, such as transportation, environmental economics, public safety and health. To integrate research and education and achieve societal impact, the project team will also kick off the ""Data Science for Cities Initiative"" with a pilot chapter in the city of Tempe, Arizona. The initiative aims to engage local communities and local students in working on solutions to many urban problems by analyzing data collected from IoT devices.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to is to develop graph database systems technology that can efficiently store, manage, and execute real-time spatial / spatio-temporal graph queries on linked IoT data and support scalable processing of large-scale IoT data. To achieve that, the research effort in this project includes the design and development of novel spatial data storage, indexing, processing and management techniques that scale to the ever-increasing volume and fast rate of data collected from IoT devices. As opposed to existing big spatial data systems and numerical frameworks, a novel IoT data abstraction method will extend recently developed big spatial data systems to provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for development of IoT applications. The newly developed method takes into account not only the spatial distribution of the data, but also the physical and mathematical characteristics of signals generated by each sensor. Furthermore, the new IoT abstraction method includes novel query operators as well as query optimization strategies, which can efficiently evaluate a hybrid workload that involves classic spatial and spatio-temporal data processing and digital signal processing operations on IoT data. The new method also bridges the gap between IoT devices and the spatial data system by designing a middleware that integrates the IoT devices streaming data to the central system with the requirements of applications accessing such IoT data. Another outcome of the project is a graph query processor that can optimize and evaluate general-purpose spatial predicates such as spatial range, join and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as well as temporal predicates in a graph query issued on linked IoT data in real time even with new things and observations being regularly added to the IoT graph.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a significant advancement because conventional thermometry is usually invasive, allows only single point temperature measurements, and may interfere with the therapeutic and imaging instrument. The proposed technology is designed to be biocompatible and minimally invasive, leading to fast 3D temperature mapping deep in the human body. The proposed materials and techniques can be used with MRI-guided thermal procedures which can replace scalpel-based surgery for a variety of cancers, improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical time. The method can also be used to improve treatments for essential tremor, uterine fibrosis and arteriovenous malformation. In these treatments, the temperature in the entire affected region must be constantly monitored. Due to the limitations of the currently used temperature measurement methods, these minimally invasive MRI-guided procedures are not frequently used or take considerably longer time than desired because surgeons often must work around failed temperature measurements. The work in this proposal could transform current methods of MRI-guided thermometry, significantly reducing surgery time and cost as well as improving patient outcomes.  <br/><br/>This proposal develops a novel, minimally-invasive method of creating temperature maps superimposed on anatomical MRI images. The technology uses a new type of temperature-sensitive sensor, in the form of magnetic nanoparticles, and could ultimately be used within human or other tissues.  The key idea is that magnetic particles embedded in tissue will create a local dipole magnetic field that will modulate (statically or dynamically) the homogeneity of the main static magnetic field of the MRI scanner.  This changes the nuclear relaxation times of the tissue and broadens the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) linewidth, ultimately leading to local changes in the brightness of the MRI image.  The magnetization of the particles is engineered to change with temperature, and therefore the results are temperature dependent. Different shades of gray in the weighted gradient echo MR images, can then be calibrated to obtain a spatial map of temperature. This has immediate application in providing real-time temperature information to the surgeon during MRI-guided thermal interventional procedures to treat cancer, for example.

Noncommutative algebra and representation theory are two closely intertwined areas of research in Algebra that have strong ties to many other fields in mathematics and quantum physics such as conformal field theory, operator algebras, string theory, topological field theory, and the various guises of noncommutative geometry. Noncommutative algebra creates an algebraic framework for generalizing the study of polynomials to other rings that fail to be commutative, and representation theory is a powerful tool for investigating the action of an algebraic object on a space as linear operators and matrices. As in many areas of mathematics, women have been underrepresented in these areas of research. The goal of this workshop to bring together some of the best experts and junior participants working on these topics, particularly researchers from underrepresented groups, to collaborate on research projects. This workshop will be the second of its kind for these fields. Like the first WINART workshop (held at BIRS in March 2016), WINART2 will have a great impact on the research careers of those in attendance, and as a result, it will positively impact the research area as a whole. Funding will be prioritized for US-based junior participants.<br/><br/>There will be eight research groups present at the workshop led by a pair of research leaders in Noncommutative Algebra and Representation Theory. Topics include: cluster categories; tensor invariants under Hopf algebra actions; algebraic, geometric, and categorical aspects of diagram algebras; Brauer and partition algebras; geometric models and representation theory; Burnside rings and Mackey functors for profinite groups; quantum symmetries- fusion categories and Hopf algebras; and Hochschild (co)homology, quivers and Gerstenhaber bracket.

HLB and canker have cost growers billions of dollars in destroyed trees and are decimating the Florida citrus industry. In Florida, annual citrus production has fallen from 242 million boxes in the 2003-2004 growing season to 45 million boxes in 2017-2018.  Further, citrus canker may be found in 98% of the citrus production regions in Florida. Working with the University of Florida, the goal of this project is to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to advance natural selection to make citrus trees resistant to both HLB and citrus canker. If successful, this approach could be used to protect the 93 million tons of citrus production worldwide. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to develop HLB and canker-resistant citrus varieties by using gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9. Florida citrus growers need a solution to these diseases, and producing a genetically-resistant citrus variety is a promising strategy. The approach is to modify plant genes that are the targets of proteins secreted by the disease-causing bacteria. The first objective is to conduct the gene editing in commercially viable citrus varieties. This will be accomplished non-transgenically by transforming a non-integrated plasmid or purified Cas9 protein and in vitro transcribed sgRNA in citrus protoplasts. To identify gene edits, protoplasts will be grown into callus, which will be screened by PCR and DNA heteroduplex digestion as well as Sanger and/or high-throughput sequencing. The second objective will be to take plants with confirmed edits, clonally propagate them, and conduct preliminary testing for HLB or canker resistance. Plants will be inoculated with the disease-causing bacteria and then monitored for disease progression by observation of physical characteristics and measurement of bacterial titers by PCR. The best performing mutations from Phase I will be combined and used for more extensive greenhouse and field testing during SBIR Phase II.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deep vein thrombosis occurs when blood clots form in the veins and is a common complication in hospital patients that is also a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. This project will develop a device that modifies blood flow patterns in the legs in a new manner designed to specifically activate genetic changes inside the vein that protect against blood clot formation. The goal of this project is to generate a new device that it is capable of creating the desired blood flow patterns in patients while maintaining a high level of device comfort, reliability, and ease of use for clinical staff and patients. In addition to preventing death and disability in the hospitalized population of the US, this project will move a new device towards commercial production, thereby supporting economic growth, job formation, and tax revenue. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project will leverage novel molecular and cellular discoveries regarding the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to create a more effective device to prevent DVT in immobilized individuals who are at high risk for the disease. DVTs form in the sinus behind venous valves, where blood flow is reduced during immobility, promoting blood clot formation. This site is typically protected against clot formation by a powerful genetic program in the endothelial cells that is unique to the valve sinus microenvironment. Loss of this genetic expression program results in a prothrombotic environment that supports clot formation and DVT. Research has further revealed that the valve sinus anti-thrombotic genetic program is activated by a specific pattern of venous blood flow at that site that is driven by muscular activity. During prolonged periods of immobility, common during hospitalization, loss of this flow profile extinguishes the protective endothelial phenotype and supports DVT formation. Ultrasound analysis reveals that current mechanical therapy devices marketed to prevent DVT do not generate the hemodynamics at the valve that are produced by muscular activity due to their methods of action. This project will develop a device that generates a protective hemodynamic pattern in the valve sinus of immobile patients by actuating blood flow that accurately reproduce muscular activity. To accomplish this goal the device design alters the primary physical manipulation strategy of other existing devices away from calf and thigh compression and instead induces rapid calf expansion to replicate the effect of muscular activity on venous blood flow. Vascular ultrasound studies demonstrate that this actuation method successfully recapitulates the venous hemodynamics of the active limb required to support expression of the protective genetic pathway in the valve sinus. This SBIR Phase I project will optimize the device design to create this actuation while also improving patient comfort, mitigating common risks, and facilitating ease of use by clinical staff. This project will address key risks in advancing a medical device into clinical testing and use, thereby enabling the device to bridge to a phase of commercial manufacturing and use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As Room Air Conditioning (RAC) demand increases by an estimated 5x over the next 30 years, it is crucial that newly established scientific and technological approaches be developed which lessen the requirement of 'peaker' power plants to supply electricity for their operation. Nativus is engineering an energy-efficient 12,000 BTU Room Air Conditioner (RAC) for residential and light-commercial consumers, capable of cooling 500 ft2. Through a complete architectural redesign, our proprietary technology offers customers a solution to their air conditioning needs which is cheaper to operate, quieter, filters the air, and is easier to install than currently available commercial offerings.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, rotating air conditioning design which combines the main components of an air conditioner into a single, packaged device to drastically increase air conditioner performance.  The roughly one billion air conditioners in operation globally operate at 5-10% of their theoretical ultimate Carnot efficiency, as industry focuses on ""first-cost"" and has not demonstrated meaningful, radical improvements since the inception of the air conditioner. The current state-of-the-art technology in the HVAC industry is based upon the 'fan plus finned-tube' (FPFT) Heat Exchanger in which a fan blows air across either hot or cold heat exchanger fins. This architecture results in the formation of an insulative 'boundary layer', severely degrading heat exchanger performance. Through the use of one high-efficiency motor, instead of two or three motors commonly found on state-of-the-art technology, our proprietary design rotationally-shears the boundary layer from the surface of the heat exchanger, thereby increasing efficiency while decreasing power consumption. Our research objectives include air conditioner component and system-level validation, supported by three milestones which include Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) performance validation, system reliability through prototype testing, and economic analysis.

Atmospherically-induced error affects data utility because the atmospheric aerosol content, i.e., humidity, dust, pollen, smoke particles, etc., fluctuates greatly, impacting applications for global monitoring, defense and agriculture.

The method of study is extraction and statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data, the standard reference for calibration and validation of data from all other EOS platforms. This problem is approached through a series of heuristic investigations to (1) reconstruct relationships of blue, green and red bands to near infrared (NIR) originally fitted using Landsat 5 and 7 data (longer wavelengths may not be addressed because they are resistant to atmospheric affects), (2) use these relationships to reverse the error, (3) develop methods to select, proof and apply dark targets that calibrate the correction, and (4) measure residual error by comparing post-algorithm reflectance to at-ground reflectance measured by portable spectrometry. The residual error is likely due to uncertainty associated with dark targets.

Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease affects more than 8 million people in the United States alone. The annual healthcare expenditure spent on treating peripheral arterial disease is $4.37B. Since 2008, US Center for Medicare and Medicaid has been stressing for greater efficiency and lowering costs for Peripheral Vascular Intervention. Commonly performed Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures in the CathLab, to treat PAD, encounter loss of guidewire access. This complication is amplified in the case of difficult to cross stenotic lesions and, in many cases, is frustrating for the physician as they have to spend several hours/procedures trying to regain guidewire access. Guidewire access is the key for a successful procedural outcome. The Project intends to reduce Peripheral Vascular Intervention cost by improving procedural efficiency by eliminating guidewire/catheter exchanges in current practice thereby reducing Cath Lab overhead costs and by reducing procedure time and effort required to acquire a good quality angiographic image. An important ancillary benefit of the innovation is that the radiation exposure to the healthcare providers and the patient can potentially be minimized due to the decreased fluoroscopic activity. The project aims to continue beyond SBIR Phase I to become a commercial product and be the standard of care for Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project is for the design and development of a .014-inch guidewire compatible low profile PTA balloon catheter with a proprietary contrast injection mechanism. This product is ideal for performing PTA interventions in difficult anatomical spaces e.g. below-the-knee peripheral vasculature. The proprietary inflation and injection system allows for treatment visualization without needing catheter exchanges or loss of guidewire access. The output of the Project intends to provide focused and sharper visualization along the entire treatment length and allows for judicious usage of radiopaque contrast in contrast sensitive patients. A feasibility prototype of the concept was tested in an animal model with promising results.

Yet, to be most effective, prescribed fires require putting people in the proximity of fire and are often limited by the unavailability (due to cost or demand) of fast delivery mechanisms such as those provided by helicopters. This effort will result in technology that directly addresses both pain points by improving the intelligence of drone-based fire monitoring and ignition systems.

Reducing these model biases is one of the more pertinent and challenging aspects of modern climate science as a means to provide strategies to meet the future needs in food, water, energy, and biological diversity.<br/><br/>Currently, there is a lack a consistent understanding of precisely how sensitive local rainfall variability in central China is to regional perturbations in the Asian monsoon because knowledge of the monsoon in central East Asia principally relies upon oxygen-isotope records which, according to new research, may not necessarily reflect local hydroclimate.  Therefore, this project aims to build a more complete picture of local rainfall variability in central-eastern China by addressing the following questions: (1) Can speleothem proxies, such as trace elements (Magnesium, Strontium, Barium) be used to deconvolve regional atmospheric circulation from local hydrology in East Asia. If so, (2) what do these alterative proxies inform us about local hydroclimate in central-eastern China and what are the mechanisms to explain the proxy-inferred changes.

A later onset of mei-yu to midsummer during NA cooling would have resulted in a shorter midsummer stage, leaving south-central China wet at the expense of dry conditions to the north; (3) Vegetation demise and subsequent higher dust emissions from the Sahara/Sahel regions during Heinrich events, affected the position of the ITCZ and thus amplified the response outlined in hypothesis (2); (4) Comparison of speleothem pseudoproxy time series (generated from PSMs) with measured records from East Asia will help to identify the dominant controls on speleothem delta 18-Oxygen.

The resulting patterns resemble a labyrinth of streets in a metropolitan area, although they are approximately one-hundred million times smaller and in three dimensions, called crystals.  The structures of the as solidified crystals arranged in the pattern closely relate to the properties of the material, even after subsequent processing steps.  To our advantage, the shapes and sizes of these crystals can be tailored to meet technological demands by manipulating the chemical composition of the parent liquid phase.  For instance, trace metal impurities dissolved in the liquid are known to transform solid silicon (Si) from coarse, blocky particles into fine, web-like fibers.  This results in a dramatic enhancement of the strength and ductility of the Si-based alloy and expands its potential for new applications, including space-frames and electric vehicles. The objective of this CAREER award is to understand how and why such transformations occur in the presence of trace metal impurities, by harnessing one of the brightest sources of hard X rays in the world at Argonne National Laboratory.  The incident X-radiation can penetrate through an otherwise opaque metal, allowing one to capture the details of solidification in real time.  Following the experiments, the PI and his team will extract information from the time lapse videos of solidification using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.  It is anticipated that their new vision will advance the field of alloy solidification from metallurgical alchemy to predictive science.  Ultimately, understanding the evolution of solid patterns during synthesis is the key to controlling the manufacture of advanced materials from the bottom-up.  The new discoveries generated by this program will be integrated into problem-based learning units for underrepresented middle school students, in partnership with the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP).  The PI will assess the impact of these activities using annual and multi-year surveys distributed through the DAPCEP organization.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>In the past 50 years, there has been increasing interest - both fundamental and applied - in the process of solidification in multicomponent metal alloys.  One longstanding problem concerns microstructure formation in eutectic alloy systems.  While binary eutectics with non faceted interfaces are relatively well understood, comparatively little is known about the solidification behavior of eutectics with faceted interfaces and/or more than two components.  Such is the case for Al-Si eutectics that are solidified in the presence of trace metal species (so called chemical modifiers).  The higher degrees of freedom in the univariate reaction (i.e., three components and two solid phases) brings about morphological transitions not seen in nonvariant eutectics.  For instance, the chemical modifiers transform the morphology of the Si phase from coarse flakes to fine fibers, thereby improving the mechanical properties of the cast alloy.  Despite our technical experience with chemical modification, the underlying mechanisms by which the trace metal species influences the solidification pathway have not yet been satisfactorily explained.  To this end, the PI and his team will develop a combined experimental computational research program that will focus on eutectic nucleation in chemically-modified alloys.  Building on his track record in real-time imaging, he will harness the new capabilities in ""fast"" X-ray tomography to watch the solidification of Al-Si eutectics doped with various modifier species and concentrations.  Given the volume of data to be collected in such experiments (tens of TB), it is impossible to process the data manually.  Instead, the PI and his team will implement state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (convolutional neural networks) to extract information from the large datasets, including details on the nucleation density, rate, and undercooling.  The richness of these quantitative findings provides an unparalleled opportunity to verify kinetic theories with great precision.  Lastly, the PI's team will conduct further correlative microscopy - covering over six orders-of-magnitude in length scale - to advance a comprehensive model of chemical modification in eutectic alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project could potentially provide observational evidences to improve weather forecast models for better heavy rainfall forecasts after hurricane landfalls. Improvement of weather forecast models for hurricane landfalls will benefit hurricane preparation especially for the states along the coast lines, leading to reduced damages. <br/><br/>A team of researchers at Colorado State University and University of Texas at Arlington will work together with a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow to collect and compile near-surface wind data from in situ, radar, and satellite observations present along the North Carolina coast, and in particular the areas surrounding Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound, which encompasses the downstream estuaries of Chowan River, Pamlico River, and Neuse River, and was impacted by both Florence and Michael. In addition, they will use satellite observations in combination of the surface hydrological observations to estimate surface roughness changes. By comparing spatial variations of surface roughness changes and wind, they will investigate flood-rainfall-wind interactions.

To feed a projected world population of over 9 billion people in 2050, innovation will be required at all stages of crop production and distribution. Annual application of more than 600 different chemical pesticides (500 million Kg) costs $10 billion, and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests (insects 13%, pathogens 12%, weeds 12%). By providing an alternative, effective method for managing transmissible diseases in major crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals such as copper, synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance development.

In order to bring the innovation to market in the form of a commercial seed treatment, the following must be demonstrated: a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy, without adverse effect on seed germination or natural microbe/insect populations. The focus of the proposed Phase I project will be to optimize synthesis of the compound of interest and develop a stable, commercially viable formulation that is effective across a breadth of crops.

By significantly improving the accuracy and timeliness of insect surveillance, we will allow more effective pest management, allowing the applications of insect interventions to be targeted in space and time. For example, rather than a blanket spraying of harsh pesticides across the entire field, our system could suggest spraying of a milder (and cheaper) pesticide in just a few ""hot spots"", at the optimal time of day. Reducing the volume of pesticides has further positive benefits to society at large, it will reduce pollution, and the use of pesticides has been implicated as a contributor to climate change and to colony collapse disorder. The hardware/algorithms/representations/data-models created in this project have an obvious application to mosquito surveillance, which has implications for control of insect vectored diseases of both humans and livestock. The commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is obvious. Insects damage or destroy about 150 billion dollars' worth of crops each year. If we prevent reduce this by just one percent, we have a billion-dollar market.<br/><br/>The proposed project will investigate techniques to improve the state-of-the-art in flying insect classification, with the goal of producing a platform that allows insect surveillance for precision agriculture. In particular, we will take the current algorithms and representations (many of which were invented by the current PIs) and make them invariant to the wide range of conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity) encountered in the field. The company's research has shown that without creating such invariances, the variability induced by changing environment conditions will swamp the regularities in the features that are currently exploited by classification algorithms, and reduce the accuracy to random guessing. It is well understood how temperature, pressure, humidity effect air density, and how air density effects insect flight. However, the current models treat the insects as idealized objects using aerospace equations for density vs. lift and completely ignore the effects of the environment on insect physiology.

Currently, obstetricians struggle with a 50-year old monitoring technology, which reports fetal heart rate and maternal contractions, and that is associated with an 89% false positive rate for detecting babies in distress. This is a major contributor to high cesarean section rates worldwide and up to 40% in some US hospitals. Because of the costs, risks for mothers and negative implications for babies' health, C-section rates are coming under scrutiny from insurers and accreditors, however, clinicians lack the means to accurately identify oxygenation starvation and, to date, no non-invasive means of directly measuring fetal oxygenation has been developed. Raydiant's system builds off traditional pulse oximetry and will employ safe levels of light, through the mother's abdomen, to monitor fetal pulse and report oxygen saturation, the crucial, but missing diagnostic. This technology will be applicable to over 2.9 million births per year in the US as an enhancement to traditional monitoring whenever a heart rate signal of concern is observed. Both the absolute oxygenation value and its trend over time will enable more informed decision making throughout the birth process.<br/><br/>This project pushes the fundamental boundaries of pulse oximetry and bio-photonics. Unlike traditional finger pulse oximetry, sensing non-invasively through the maternal abdomen presents a body in a body problem, where the fetal pulse signal is orders of magnitude weaker than and intertwined with the maternal. Photons are scattered and absorbed by multiple tissue layers and there are tradeoffs between signal strength, noise and the ratio of fetal to maternal signal. Non-homogeneities from subject to subject makes calibration difficult. Addressing these challenges will require innovation in photonics hardware and signal processing and this proposal has a three specific aims: the development of a specific sensor hardware architecture that will facilitate detection of the fetal signal; development of Raydiant's algorithm to separate fetal from maternal signal, reject noise and report saturation; and validation of the combined system in a pregnant animal model, where fetal oxygenation levels are actively controlled and compared to the device reading. This proposal encompasses developing a second generation prototype system and represents critical technology de-risking aiming towards a commercial system for integration with current monitoring technology and clinical practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Estuaries (places where salt water from the ocean mixes with fresh water from the land) and their adjacent marshes provide food and refuge for fish, shellfish and birds; protect the shoreline from storms; help to keep the water clean; and store carbon. The GCE LTER researchers study marshes and estuaries to understand how these ecosystems function, to track how they change over time, and to predict how they might be affected by future changes in climate and human activities. They accomplish this by tracking the major factors that can cause long-term change in coastal areas (e.g. sea level, rainfall, upstream development), and measuring the effects of these factors on the study site. They also conduct focused studies to assess how key marsh habitats will respond to major changes expected in the future, including large-scale experiments to evaluate the effects of a) increases in the salinity of the water that floods freshwater marshes (mimicking drought and/or sea level rise), b) changes in water runoff from land into the upland marsh border (mimicking drought or upland development), and c) exclusion of larger organisms in the salt marsh (mimicking long-term declines in predators). During this award they will initiate additional studies to systematically evaluate how coastal wetlands respond to disturbances. Disturbances, or disruptions in the environment, are particularly important to understand in the context of long-term background changes such as increasing sea level, and GCE researchers are working to assess the cumulative effects of multiple disturbances on the landscape. The GCE education and outreach program works to share an understanding of coastal ecosystems with teachers and students, coastal managers, citizen scientist and the general public.<br/><br/>The GCE-LTER project has four goals. 1) Track environmental and human drivers that can cause perturbations in our focal ecosystems. This will be accomplished this through continuing long-term measurements of climate, water chemistry, oceanic exchange, and human activities on the landscape. 2) Describe temporal and spatial variability in physical, chemical, geological and biological characteristics of the study system (coastal wetland complexes) and how they respond to external drivers. This will be accomplished through field monitoring in combination with remote sensing and modeling. 3) Characterize the ecological responses of intertidal marshes to disturbance. This will be accomplished by ongoing monitoring and experimental work to evaluate system responses to major perturbations in three key marsh habitats (changes in inundation and predator exclusion in Spartina-dominated salt marshes; increases in salinity in fresh marshes; changes in runoff in high marshes), by implementing standardized experimental disturbances along salinity and elevation gradients, and by tracking responses to natural disturbances. 4) Evaluate ecosystem properties at the landscape level (habitat distribution, net and gross primary production, C budgets) and assess the cumulative effects of disturbance on these properties. The project will also develop relationships between drivers and response variables, which can be used to predict the effects of future changes. This will be accomplished through a combination of data synthesis, remote sensing and modeling. The GCE ""Schoolyard"" program provides K-12 teachers with research experience that they use to develop classroom activities. The GCE will distribute a popular children's book (now in its second edition) with accompanying lesson plans, and will produce a comic book with associated educational content. They will promote two citizen science web applications focused on the salt marsh. The GCE will provide research opportunities through internships for a diverse group of undergraduates, and will run web-based courses that provide interdisciplinary training for graduate students. The GCE will partner with the Georgia Coastal Research Council to exchange information with managers and promote science-based management of coastal resources.

While the application of this equation to isolated electrons is fully understood, the corresponding many-body version of this equation that governs the collective quantum behavior of electrons inside matter is far too complex to be solved in detail. The astronomical scale of this complexity may be grasped by noting that the number of electrons in a pound of iron is larger than the number of stars in the known universe.<br/><br/>One of the strange manifestations of quantum mechanics is a phenomenon known as entanglement, whereby remote electrons in a material intimately correlate their motion. The unexpected collective behavior of electrons that results from this entanglement has the capacity to endow quantum matter with emergent properties, such as magnetism, superconductivity, or superfluidity, and many more that are presumably not yet discovered. The quest to understand and manipulate these emergent properties, and to relate them to the underlying quantum mechanics is a key goal of modern condensed matter physics.<br/><br/>The award supports research in the area of f-electron materials, a unique class of metals that can be fine-tuned to the brink of magnetism where they develop a special quantum state called a ""Quantum Critical Point"".

This work will be extended to antiferromagnets and will be used to compute the generalized phase diagram of heavy fermions. The research team will develop a theory for the co-existence of magnetism and the Kondo effect. By extending early work of Larkin and Pikin, the research will develop a theory for the quantum annealing of finite-temperature first-order phase transitions into quantum critical points at absolute zero. <br/><br/>2) Analytic-computational approach to entanglement & novel order in rare-earth materials: Working with theorists at the Flatiron Institute, New York, the research team will apply Matrix Product State approaches to simple one- and two-dimensional Kondo lattices, focusing on the low-entanglement case of the Kondo insulator, using these methods to establish and explore the composite nature of heavy fermions.<br/><br/>3) A new approach to Raman and Photoemission phenomenology: Generalizing the theory of optical lattices to crystal fields, the research will develop a theory of the Raman interaction of light with crystal-field levels in f-electron materials. A new criterion for measuring the degree of localization of f-electrons using angle-resolved and core-level x-ray photoemission will be developed.<br/><br/>Graduate students and postdocs will be involved in an essential way in the research, and will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques.

Change in equipment vibration serves as an early warning of a decline in operating condition and signals the need for preventative maintenance to avoid more serious equipment faults and failure.

CO2-capture is the foundation of greenhouse gas mitigation.  The high cost of current processes for CO2-capture have prevented their widespread deployment.  High-pressure, Density-driven Separator (HDS) technology efficiently and continuously captures CO2 from gas streams, including both flue gas and fuel gas.  An HDS module produces nearly Pure High-pressure CO2 (PH-CO2).  HDS technology has transformational operating expense enabled by innovative strategies for compression, expansion, energy recovery, and subsequent use of the dense and light fractions.  An HDS module has no moving parts, membranes, pressure swings or temperature swings.  Therefore, HDS technology has the potential for very low capital expense.  These low costs allow access to financial markets.  Other revenue sources are also facilitated by low capture cost.  For instance, PH-CO2 is food grade, valued in excess of $100/ton.  PH-CO2 is suitable for enhanced oil recovery.  HDS technology separates CO2 from fuel gas, producing a valuable high-pressure vapor, in addition to PH-CO2.  HDS technology dramatically reduces the CO2-capture cost and provides a purity that enables a profitable B2B model. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop HDS technology.  Quantitative metrics will be refined and employed to develop detailed capital expense and operating cost models.  Two technical hurdles must be overcome to reduce these costs.  These hurdles are also opportunities for innovation.  The first opportunity is to achieve sufficient volumetric efficiency in the pressure vessel for commercial deployment.  The equilibrium state inside the HDS module is perfect separation.  Increasing the rate of approach to that equilibrium state reduces the size and cost of the HDS module. This will be accomplished by exploiting the synergy between fluid state, surface state, fluid motion, and gravity.  This synergy coalesces CO2, allowing its rapid separation from the remaining components of flue gas and fuel gas.  The second opportunity is to achieve sufficient overall process efficiency for commercial deployment.  The power required for compression determines operating expense.  Our strategy involves operating the near-isothermal cold compression train and near-isothermal hot expansion train as a heat engine (an approximation of the Ericsson cycle).  In this manner, innovative gerotor compressors and expanders work together with heat exchangers using waste heat to reduce or eliminate operating costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The immobilization platform described in this proposal will provide a technology that is compatible with continuous processing strategies to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing biotherapeutics.  In addition, this platform has the potential to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of biomanufacturing processes across several other industries including food, leather, and textiles. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop pH responsive immobilized enzymes for the production of biopharmaceuticals. There are three key technical challenges associated with this project: The immobilized-enzyme must demonstrate pH responsive behavior compatible with biologics manufacture (pH 6-7); mass transfer of protein substrates must be comparable to the native enzyme; and extended shelf-life of the immobilized-enzyme is required for long-term storage. To mitigate these challenges, this project aims to covalently bind an enzyme to a pH responsive polymer that is formulated to have reversible solubility near neutral pH. The solubility of the immobilized-biocatalyst can be tightly controlled within a specified pH range allowing for continuous processing and facile purification of the biotherapeutic product. Poor mass transfer often results from immobilizing biocatalysts on solid supports. These challenges are further exaggerated in bioconjugation reactions because the coupling partner, a protein, is generally more affected by sterics than small molecules. Therefore, fabrication of the solid support will be explored to produce resins of varied size, morphologies, and dissolution properties that are compatible with macromolecule functionalization. Additionally, the immobilized enzyme generated in this project can be utilized under soluble conditions, which combines the positive attributes of both immobilization and soluble enzyme catalysis. The final challenge of developing a commercially viable shelf-life of the catalyst will be addressed through development of novel drying protocols. Shelf-stable immobilized enzymes will be developed so that inventory can be maintained without requiring long lead times for catalyst production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Patient enrollment is a significant weak link in the development pipeline and a significant pain point for organizations that sponsor clinical trials. More than two-thirds of trial sites fail to meet enrollment goals for a given trial, and up to 45% of study delays are caused by enrollment difficulties. This can result in lost revenues up to $1 million/day. Clinical trials are a critical link between scientific discovery and changes in clinical practice that advance prevention, treatments, and cures for diseases and disability. Increasing awareness of trials among physicians is key in increasing clinical trial enrollment, which in turn is essential in advancing health care practice as well as patient health and quality of life. While the area of cancer is an initial target for improved enrollment, ultimately the proposed solution can be applied to other medical specialties and be scaled globally using the same platform. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to drive clinical trial accrual by changing how physicians learn about clinical trials. The major innovation is combining a credible online social platform with powerful natural language processing technology and machine learning techniques to deliver customized clinical trial information to physicians in their decision-making process. For this Phase I project, the key objectives are: 1) To build out a prototype to match clinical trial information to relevant physician questions. Natural language processing (NLP) technology will be created to match clinical questions to related clinical trials so that physicians learn about clinical trials at the time they are seeking information on how to best treat their patients. 2) To conduct a pilot assessment of clinical trial knowledge pre- and post-use. A small subset of users of the social network platform will engage in a comparative assessment, pre- and post-exposure to the clinical trial component, to determine the technology?s impact on clinical trial knowledge.  Successful completion of Phase I will result in a user-friendly platform that matches clinical questions to oncologists and relevant, open clinical trials, and will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed concept.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By some estimates, these meadows contribute an average of $20,000 per hectare per year in goods and services. These include nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, carbon burial, and provision of nursery habitat for juvenile fishes, crabs, and shrimps. Alarmingly, seagrasses are threatened by several environmental and human-driven stressors, and loss of seagrass habitat remains a key concern for conservation and sustainable development programs. Anticipated increases in storminess (frequency and intensity) and rainfall under many climate change modeling scenarios make understanding hurricane impacts on valuable coastal habitats such as seagrass meadows important on local, national, and global scales. Indeed, seagrass meadows potentially serve as a 'canary in the coal mine' regarding the effects of increased hurricane activity as they are found at shallow depths and are affected by turbidity and salinity; seagrasses are also vulnerable to burial or erosion due to large storms. Seagrasses (1) include a suite of species with distinct growth and reproductive strategies; (2) live in a range of meadow sizes and degrees of 'patchiness;' and (3) present divergent seasonal cycles. This represents a tremendous opportunity to explore the conditions and attributes that result in seagrass resilience or vulnerability to hurricanes as a model for coastal ecosystem responses more broadly.  <br/><br/>Hurricane Florence made landfall along the NC coast on September 14, 2018. Florence stalled approaching shore, and storm-related winds/rains persisted for >4 days (13th-16th) in southeastern NC. Subsequently, record high sea-level stands (surge + tide) were observed across the NC coastline. Furthermore, Florence became the second wettest US storm, behind only Harvey in 2017, dumping 65 trillion L of rain over land that depressed estuarine salinities for over a month. NC seagrasses are dominated by three species: eelgrass, shoalgrass, and widgeon grass. Meadows exist as polycultures or monocultures, and exhibit a diverse range of spatial configurations. Meadows are also defined by strong seasonality: eelgrass shoots senesce in summer due to heat stress, with sites transformed either into shoalgrass-dominated meadows or mudflats. Subsequent to dieback, eelgrass depends upon a combination of seedbank and surviving apical meristems for regeneration each winter.  Using key seagrass datasets collected by the research team dating back decades across ~40 Florence-impacted meadows, several fundamental ecological questions are being addressed: (1) how sexual (eelgrass: seedbank) v. asexual (shoalgrass: vegetative growth and fragment colonization) life histories promote susceptibility or resilience of seagrass to disturbance; (2) how meadow landscape configuration and plant diversity modulate the effect of storms on seedbank retention; (3) how meadow disturbance (intense physical v. more chronic physiochemical drivers) affected community dynamics, with special focus on plant productivity and the critical 'nursery role' of seagrass habitat; and (4) how seasonality and species traits amplify or attenuate the effects of intense disturbance on seagrasses. This research expands upon previous post-hurricane studies by considering the interactive effects of hurricanes, landscape configuration, and biodiversity on ecosystem responses. It also leverages ongoing, NSF-supported work along the TX coast to compare-and-contrast the responses of different seagrass phenology/growth strategies to storm disturbance (e.g., turtlegrass in TX is a ""leaf-on"" species throughout the year while eelgrass and shoalgrass in NC both exhibit strong seasonality in biomass). Collectively, this work will result in more generalizable models of coastal ecological resilience to storminess.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ceramics, such as sapphire, zirconia, calcium fluoride, etc., have many superior mechanical, chemical, biomedical and optical properties, but fabricating ceramic components is very difficult due to their high hardness and brittleness. However, at a microscopic scale, ceramics can be machined like metals, although the mechanism explaining this phenomenon is not yet known. General machining creates cracks on ceramic surfaces because the crystal structure of the material is prone to fracture. Each crystal structure has multiple fracture systems; each fracture system can be initiated under some conditions, especially high pressure. This study will explore how the force generated by cutting action initiates fracture and will use this understanding so that cutting can be done without generating cracks. The research will allow the use of ceramics in various industries, including consumer electronics, biomedical and defense applications, and optical elements. Thus, the research directly and favorably affects economic welfare and national security. The knowledge generated from this project will be distributed through the advanced CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine training program, online expert system, and public media in addition to journal publication and integration into undergraduate and graduate courses.  <br/><br/>The project goal is to understand how the microscopic crystal structure of ceramics influences material behavior during machining. The research will identify the activation mechanisms of ductile shear and brittle fracture of ceramics. This knowledge will lead to the development of machining strategies to suppress brittle fracture and to enable ductile mode machining on ceramics for a wide range of applications. The research will initially test the role of three potential parameters (resolved shear stress, fracture energy, and stress intensity factor) in activating plastic deformation or crack initiation. Specific contributions will include: (1) data generation on critical depth of cut where ductile to brittle transition occurs for all orientations for each distinctive crystal plane of sapphire and zirconia; (2) identification of triggering parameter(s) on activation of slip system or fracture system; and (3) modeling of ceramic machining.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The standard of care involves manual palpation of the back to estimate a vertebral gap for needle insertion. This technique is highly inaccurate, often requiring multiple attempts, which lead to pain and complications, unpredictable procedure times, poor throughput, and high rates of referrals to radiology for fluoroscopic guidance. By offering an accurate means of localizing bony landmarks, this project will enable successful insertion in fewer attempts, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing costs across the $3.2 million market, including emergency medicine, neurology, anesthesiology, and pain medicine. The device can also be introduced for training and to reduce errors in clinical testing of intrathecal drugs; and can increase procedure access by offering an alternative, bedside solution for challenging cases. To date, tactile imaging has only been applied clinically to soft-tissue evaluations. This project will pave the way for expanded use of this low-cost, non-radiative modality; to possibly replace palpation for other procedures, such as joint injections and thoracenteses.<br/><br/>The innovation is the first standalone, clinical tactile imager. Its imaging subsystem comprises a sensitive, high-resolution pressure-sensing array, which detects vertebral landmarks when pressed against the back, and communicates them as a 2D pressure map to an integrated display. The device also includes a novel needle guide, which allows for flexible and reliable insertion. Positive gap localization has been verified in early development. This project will first confirm accurate insertion relative to imaging output by characterizing the relationship between guide and visualized-landmark locations, and by developing a mechanism to stabilize the device over unpredictable lumbar curvatures. Next, 2D pressure information will be evolved into an optimally robust and intuitive image. Advanced algorithms will be developed to detect, track, and highlight features of interest; and to understand and predict device use across cases. At each stage, the device will be tested on phantoms and through IRB testing on anesthesiology patients. Performance will be evaluated across anatomical variations, and compared with the standard of care. The resulting device will have demonstrated feasibility as a comprehensive spinal-puncture localization and insertion solution, rendering it suitable for further development and testing toward a regulatory submission, and providing compelling evidence for continued optimization in Phase II.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is important because the SAM influences not only Southern Hemisphere climate but also carbon and heat uptake and Antarctic ice melt.<br/><br/>The SAM is the leading mode of climate variability in the middle to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, where it affects the strength and position of the westerly winds and, therefore, precipitation and temperature anomalies across oceans and continents. The SAM controls the strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, and therefore links large-scale climate anomalies across multiple continents and oceans. These subpolar winds also modulate the uptake of heat and carbon by the Southern Ocean and affect the cryosphere.<br/><br/>While investigations of Northern Hemisphere climate dynamics have benefitted from a robust network of annually resolved climate proxies, the Southern Hemisphere has far more limited paleoclimate data during the Common Era, particularly in the Indian Ocean sector, the most climate data-sparse region globally.  The recently discovered sub-fossil wood from King Billy pine trees provides a new opportunity for generating multi-millennial reconstructions of regional temperature and sea level pressure - key indicators of the SAM at mid-latitudes. This network of tree sites builds on and complements another emerging network of high-resolution climate records from east Antarctic ice. <br/><br/>A new environmental reconstruction, centered on the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Hemisphere, will help address significant uncertainties in existing SAM reconstructions from the Pacific sector and allow an assessment of the role of internal dynamics and natural forcing of Southern Hemisphere climate prior to human modifications of the atmosphere.  Further, new data and reconstructions help make possible identification and quantification of uncertainty related to proxy type, location, and seasonality, and the influence of these on inferences about the timing and emergence of trends in the SAM.   New environmental and climatological reconstructions also help explore what drives variability in this dynamical feature. These new reconstructions may extend existing reconstructions of SAM from the Antarctic Peninsula by at least 1,000 years.  Greater understanding of the long-term variability of SAM and its links to Indian Ocean and ENSO dynamics, as well as to external forcing mechanisms (e.g ozone depletion, greenhouse gases) using data-model comparison techniques is possible. <br/><br/>This project strengthens international collaborations between American and Australian scientists as well as across paleoclimate disciplines (tree rings and ice cores).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LIBs are not only a major component of the current consumer electronics industry - they are also becoming a key linchpin in the development of clean energy applications such as electric vehicles and grid storage. Their limited cost-competitiveness relative to fossil fuels, finite energy density, and limited lifetime are all still road blocks against mainstream adoption of these emerging applications. These issues all point toward a need for significant technical advancements that cannot be satisfied by simple economies of scale alone. Coreshell?s innovation is to introduce a cheap and scalable electrode coating technology that protects batteries against cycling degradation. The technology has the potential to yield a marked improvement in battery cost and performance, as well as a reduction in manufacturing rates by replacing a slow electrochemical step that can take days with a fast coating step that can be completed within minutes. If fully actualized, Coreshell?s coatings have the potential to revolutionize the LIB industry and enable widespread commercialization of clean energy technologies. <br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Coreshell?s unique electrode coating technology. The state-of-the-art electrode surface protection in LIBs is formed electrochemically and is termed ?SEI? (Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase). SEI is slow and expensive to make, inherently unstable, and consumes lithium thereby reducing capacity. This proposal is based on a novel proprietary coating in place of SEI, using a roll-to-roll process that can be seamlessly integrated into existing LIB manufacturing lines. By depositing well-formed coatings on the surface of battery electrodes, Coreshell?s technology can protect against many of the degrading reactions that occur during LIB cycling. The proposed technology has the promise to deliver greater initial capacity, greater depth-of-charge over equivalent cycle-life, reduced manufacturing costs and, ultimately, the potential to reduce LIB cost per kWh by up to 25%. In Phase I, Coreshell will demonstrate part of this value through two main objectives. The first is to increase initial battery capacity by >5% and retain the total capacity to >90% of original after 200 cycles. The second is to show that batteries incorporating Coreshell?s coated electrodes can eschew SEI formation, which would demonstrate the feasibility of ~7% reduction in manufacturing costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.<br/><br/><br/>The core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers.

Current use of carbon nanotube materials is limited to a few industries capable of absorbing the high cost of research-scale quantities of carbon nanotubes (defense applications, aerospace manufacturers, and research institutions). Achieving scalable, lower-cost carbon nanotube manufacturing processes will enable widespread applications such as: advanced batteries with lower cost, weight, and improved longevity, tires with longer lifetimes and increased fuel efficiency, and coatings enabling enhanced functionality such as in the case of de-icing for aircrafts, spacecraft vehicles, and drones.  The societal impact of this advancement includes better performing and more energy efficient devices for consumers without added cost.  The commercial impact of this technology will enable the significant effort carried out in many market sectors to evaluate and understand the benefit of carbon nanotubes to products, to be economically realized.    <br/><br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel electrochemical liquid-phase growth method for carbon nanotube production, which significantly lowers the cost of production for carbon nanotubes and enables widespread commercial use of the materials.

These limitations have led to high prices for the materials that prohibit their use in cost-sensitive markets, which rely on low-cost additives such as carbon black.  The research objectives of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility of using a scalable catalyst preparation and deposition technique for the production of carbon nanotubes through low-cost, environmentally-beneficial electrochemical routes.  To achieve this, we will utilize ambient processing for catalyst preparation and a scalable electrochemical reaction chamber that harnesses the precision of electrochemistry, sources the carbon feedstock directly from air, and operates at extremely high energy efficiencies (>90%).

Prohibitively high costs are currently the biggest barrier to widespread adoption of distributed wind turbines, and power electronics can be as much as 50% of these costs. Significant cost reduction has the potential to increase worldwide distributed wind power adoption.

Unlike previous scRNA-seq technologies, the technology also enables high sample multiplexing (up to 96 samples/experiment), is compatible with stored samples, and fixes cells before dissociation, reducing the risk of perturbations to gene expression during cell handling. Most importantly, the method requires no complex instruments, which contributes to making the technology an order of magnitude less expensive than existing technologies. The objectives of this project are to dramatically improve the number of molecules detected per cell and to simplify the workflow for users. Modifications to assay chemistry will be tested to increase molecular detection, and time-consuming steps in the workflow will be altered to shorten the overall experimental time and reduce the probability of user error.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In DHF, the chambers of the heart become stiff and cannot relax completely, reducing the amount with which they fill with blood and thus reducing the amount of blood pumped by the heart during each cardiac cycle. The only evidence-based therapy to treat DHF is to manage blood pressure pharmacologically, and treat associated complications. DHF is a major cause of hospital admissions and has poor patient outcomes, without any discernable improvement over the last two decades. Thus, there is a strong need for an effective device solution that can alleviate the symptoms associated with DHF while improving patient outcomes, as well as further fundamental understanding of the key factors and mechanisms that lead to DHF. <br/><br/>This project is focused on the development of a non-blood contacting biventricular diastolic recoil device for the treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), also referred to as diastolic heart failure (DHF). The proposed device will provide a patented minimally invasive, non-blood contacting approach to mitigate the symptoms associated with HFpEF, addressing a large unmet need in a market which currently lacks any approved device therapies. Primary goals of this Phase I project include investigating variations in device design, functionality, and mechanical properties in pilot animal studies in order to optimize augmentation of cardiac function and hemodynamics, as well as the development of an accelerated fatigue test apparatus to test the durability of the device components. The commercialization effort in bringing this novel device to market will address the largely unmet need for the millions of Americans who suffer from DHF by alleviating symptoms, significantly increasing quality of life, and reducing morbidity and mortality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To counter these invaders, plants deploy a robust and effective immune system capable of detecting, appropriately responding to and restricting the proliferation of most microbes. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the detection of microbes and the signaling mechanisms associated with the induction of immunity are understood in ever increasing detail, the molecular mechanism(s) by which microbial proliferation is restricted by immune functions have been elusive. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the bacterial mechanisms targeted by plant immune action. Immune-activated plants appear to limit available sulfur, an essential element for life, thus blocking bacterial proliferation. Plant immunity also interferes with conserved bacterial responses to stress, resulting in the increased sensitization of bacteria to immune outputs. Characterizing these potential modes of immune action will have broad implications for our understanding of plant immunity and provide new targets and practical strategies to manage plant diseases. The project's broad educational goals include increasing pre-graduate competency in plant pathology, teaching plant and plant disease science to students from all backgrounds, including non-science majors, and enhancing scientific understanding through inquiry-based learning. The project's broader impacts expand public knowledge of plant diseases and may suggest new crop protection solutions. <br/><br/><br/>Driven by host recognition of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns, Pattern Triggered Immunity (PTI) is the first line of induced immune defenses used by plants against invading pathogens.  PTI plays a key role in restricting the unchecked growth of microbes. However, the mechanisms by which PTI restricts the growth of broad classes of microbes are unclear. The transcriptional response of bacterial pathogens to PTI is the basis for this project's focus on mechanisms of PTI action that restrict pathogen growth.  Deploying plant genetics, forward and reverse bacterial genetics, chemical and protein analysis, and bacterial transcriptomics, this CAREER project will test the following hypotheses: 1) Apoplastic sulfate sequestration restricts bacterial proliferation during PTI; 2) PTI outputs interfere with activation of the AlgU bacterial stress response cascade, resulting in increased bacterial sensitization to immune-associated stressors; and 3) although PTI outputs are multifaceted and semi-redundant, bacterial responses to PTI can be used to delineate and link specific outputs to sectors of the plant defense network. This project incorporates educational activities aimed at raising public knowledge about plant diseases and immunity and will focus on the education of non-specialist students. These goals will be achieved by the development of two undergraduate inquiry-based learning courses incorporating plant disease agricultural biotechnology concepts and targeted towards non-science majors, and by piloting peer-mentored, inquiry-based learning lesson plans about plant-microbe interactions for teachers in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, middle schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cost effectively storing energy is imperative to a sustainable future. Storage can provide reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, increase the resiliency of the grid to weather events or terrorist attacks, and increase the utilization efficiency of existing assets, deferring costly upgrades. Today, ice thermal storage systems help building owners shift cooling loads from costly peak hours to when electricity is less expensive. Unfortunately the upfront cost of these systems, driven by the large cost of the cooling coil used to generate ice, prevents adoption from many users and has unduly restricted the number of addressable markets for ice thermal storage. Elimination of ice buildup on the cooling coil would reduce the size of the coil, and more importantly significantly lower the cost of these systems. Low-cost ice thermal energy storage could greatly improve the economics for long-duration energy storage technologies such as pumped thermal energy storage.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to translate the discovery of surfaces with zero ice adhesion into a cooling coil that can be integrated into a functioning ice thermal energy storage system. In order to repel ice, these surfaces require complete submersion in an immiscible oil phase, making coil geometry and overall system development challenging. At the beginning of this project, various plate and tube based cooling coil geometries will be systematically prototyped and refined, measuring the freezing and melting heat transfer efficiencies. Different formulations of the surface coating will be tested as well. The most promising candidate geometries will be charged and discharged over multiple cycles as part of an ice thermal energy storage system. The results from cycling will be compared to conventional ice-on-coil technology using metrics such as energy density and heat transfer efficiency. An ice shedding cooling coil, at less than a third of the size of an ice-on-coil system, is expected to deliver improved cooling performance. Demonstration of an ice shedding cooling coil in a functioning ice thermal energy storage system will prove the technology?s readiness to scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important capability of membranes is to relieve stress through the introduction of interfacial slip or out-of-plane crumpling. Two-dimensional interfaces also display emergent nanoscale properties like superlubricity where the friction decreases by a factor of 100. Yet, it is not well understood how slip and superlubricity at interfaces affects the mechanics of nanoscale membranes made from heterostructures of multiple materials. The success of this study will lead to the design of electronic materials which actively utilize slip and deformation to become 10-100 times more pliable than state of the art stretchable technologies like silicon microelectromechanical systems or organic electronics. Slippable devices made from 2D materials have applications as low-footprint, low power sensors, tunable signal processors, or energy harvesting systems in wearable electronics. As part of the project, the PI will also create a project-based educational outreach activity in which students will design a laser light show and deliver them to schools with primarily minority populations and summer STEM camps for underrepresented groups. The PI will continue creating research mentoring opportunities for undergraduates including underrepresented minorities and introduce a new project-based nanoscale engineering course.<br/><br/>The lack of covalent bonds and the incommensurate structure at van der Waals interfaces in 2D materials heterostructures leads to superlubricity and easy slip between layers.

Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success.

Existing solution for the DNN hardware typically requires off-chip access to retrieve neural network parameters from external memories, incurring additional communication latency and power consumption. Additionally, when critical neural network parameters are transmitted off-chip, security or privacy concern may arise, which is unacceptable especially for the applications such as personalized AI devices. Alternative approach integrating the DNN engine in a special NVM process requires as much as 10 additional masks beyond the conventional logic CMOS process which is not cost-effective for medium density DNN engine in cost-sensitive edge devices.

Multi-bit cell operation however presents significant challenges due to inherent reduction in signal-to-noise ratio. Key technical hurdles include solving disturbances of unselected cells, improving sensing margin, and overcoming reliability issues associated with high voltage operation in readout circuits as well as developing robust neural network cell arrays. To address these challenges, several new ideas related to multi-bit cell, high-voltage circuits, and cell programming methods have been proposed.

Heparin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant (blood thinner), critical for surgical operations and for patients that otherwise have risks of blood clotting. Over 300,000 doses are administered per year in the US alone. Currently, heparin is prepared from animal tissues, primarily pig intestines in China, which has regulatory agencies in the US and other countries concerned. For one reason, heparin manufacturing is difficult to regulate in China as evidenced by the heparin adulteration crisis in 2008 that led to allergic reactions and over 250 deaths worldwide. In addition, there is concern that the Chinese pig population will not be able to keep up with the increasing demand. The FDA is considering reintroducing heparin produced from beef cattle as an alternative source, however, bovine heparin is still subject to complications involving animal tissues and it has different anticoagulant properties, which complicates dosing. The current proposal develops cell-based production in which the entire supply chain can be under GMP control and scalable as needed with no dependence on the number and health of an animal population.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to genetically engineer cells to produce a heparin product that can be manufactured for pharmaceutical use. Cellular production can be entirely under GMP control, and cell engineering provides opportunities to produce heparin with improved properties. A survey of clinicians that use heparin overwhelmingly identified heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) as a serious detrimental side effect. HIT can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart attack and loss of life and limb. Treatment is complicated and expensive. HIT is an allergic reaction caused when heparin binds to a specific protein in the blood called platelet factor 4 (PF4). PF4 binding depends on elements of heparin structure that are not involved in heparin's anticoagulant activities. Through cell engineering, heparin molecules with an altered structure will be produced that have reduced affinities for PF4, while maintaining potent anticoagulant properties. In addition, heparin has demonstrated efficacy in other areas such as inflammation and cancer that are not involved in blood clotting. Through cell engineering, heparin structures also could be tailored for these additional applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Presbyopia, the age dependent loss in the ability of the eye to adjust focus, is expected to affect 1.37 billion people worldwide by 2020. Cataract, the irreversible clouding of the lens that results in blurred vision, is expected to affect 30.1 million Americans by 2020. Despite these ever-increasing numbers, there currently is no single product available that restores both visual acuity and a complete range of spectacle-free vision following cataract refractive surgery. Such a solution would provide a greatly improved quality of life for patients and would inform future scientific developments in human accommodation and cataract formation. Alongside improved quality of life, vision correction has the added benefit of increased productivity in the workforce. The cataract surgical and intraocular lens exchange markets are significant, with 25.5 million IOL implants and $3.3 billion in sales in 2016 worldwide. With the growing and aging population, these numbers are expected to increase at a rapid rate. This device will fill a significant unmet need and has the potential of restoring a range of vision unlike any device currently in the market. <br/><br/>The proposed intraocular lens utilizes a highly sensitive refractive system leveraging large differences in refractive indices and has a mechanism of action unlike any currently in the market. It has the potential of levels of accommodation that are on par with accommodative abilities in a healthy, natural human lens. Forces in the eye are minimal, so this level of sensitivity is critical to any effective accommodating intraocular lens solution. Current devices and those in development do not exhibit the required level of sensitivity and subsequent accommodative amplitude to warrant significant adoption in the industry. Additionally, the proposed device shape mimics the natural lens, which allows for maximum utilization of the minute forces in the eye and prevents posterior capsular opacification. The first goal of this research will be the design and optimization of the lens utilizing a combination of mechanical and optical modeling. Lens prototypes will then be molded in a biocompatible, medical grade silicone. These prototypes will then be assessed for accommodative ability - first in an established opto-mechanical model eye experiment, then in an established human cadaver eye experiment. Finally, the prototypes will be assessed for injectability, to assure smooth integration with standard cataract surgical procedures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By some estimates, these meadows contribute an average of $20,000 per hectare per year in goods and services. These include nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, carbon burial, and provision of nursery habitat for juvenile fishes, crabs, and shrimps. Alarmingly, seagrasses are threatened by several environmental and human-driven stressors, and loss of seagrass habitat remains a key concern for conservation and sustainable development programs. Anticipated increases in storminess (frequency and intensity) and rainfall under many climate change modeling scenarios make understanding hurricane impacts on valuable coastal habitats such as seagrass meadows important on local, national, and global scales. Indeed, seagrass meadows potentially serve as a 'canary in the coal mine' regarding the effects of increased hurricane activity as they are found at shallow depths and are affected by turbidity and salinity; seagrasses are also vulnerable to burial or erosion due to large storms. Seagrasses (1) include a suite of species with distinct growth and reproductive strategies; (2) live in a range of meadow sizes and degrees of 'patchiness;' and (3) present divergent seasonal cycles. This represents a tremendous opportunity to explore the conditions and attributes that result in seagrass resilience or vulnerability to hurricanes as a model for coastal ecosystem responses more broadly.  <br/><br/>Hurricane Florence made landfall along the NC coast on September 14, 2018. Florence stalled approaching shore, and storm-related winds/rains persisted for >4 days (13th-16th) in southeastern NC. Subsequently, record high sea-level stands (surge + tide) were observed across the NC coastline. Furthermore, Florence became the second wettest US storm, behind only Harvey in 2017, dumping 65 trillion L of rain over land that depressed estuarine salinities for over a month. NC seagrasses are dominated by three species: eelgrass, shoalgrass, and widgeon grass. Meadows exist as polycultures or monocultures, and exhibit a diverse range of spatial configurations. Meadows are also defined by strong seasonality: eelgrass shoots senesce in summer due to heat stress, with sites transformed either into shoalgrass-dominated meadows or mudflats. Subsequent to dieback, eelgrass depends upon a combination of seedbank and surviving apical meristems for regeneration each winter.  Using key seagrass datasets collected by the research team dating back decades across ~40 Florence-impacted meadows, several fundamental ecological questions are being addressed: (1) how sexual (eelgrass: seedbank) v. asexual (shoalgrass: vegetative growth and fragment colonization) life histories promote susceptibility or resilience of seagrass to disturbance; (2) how meadow landscape configuration and plant diversity modulate the effect of storms on seedbank retention; (3) how meadow disturbance (intense physical v. more chronic physiochemical drivers) affected community dynamics, with special focus on plant productivity and the critical 'nursery role' of seagrass habitat; and (4) how seasonality and species traits amplify or attenuate the effects of intense disturbance on seagrasses. This research expands upon previous post-hurricane studies by considering the interactive effects of hurricanes, landscape configuration, and biodiversity on ecosystem responses. It also leverages ongoing, NSF-supported work along the TX coast to compare-and-contrast the responses of different seagrass phenology/growth strategies to storm disturbance (e.g., turtlegrass in TX is a ""leaf-on"" species throughout the year while eelgrass and shoalgrass in NC both exhibit strong seasonality in biomass). Collectively, this work will result in more generalizable models of coastal ecological resilience to storminess.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They deliver the oxygen and the food that humans and animals need to survive and provide many materials for the everyday life including medicine, furniture, building supplies and clothing. Crop plants as well as trees produce most of these resources, but the future increase in human population, reduction of usable land and environmental stresses impose a major challenge to agriculture and forestry. For example, prolonged drought periods reduce crop yield and increase the risk of forest mortality and wildfires. Plants have a vascular system that serves as the main path for transport of water, mineral nutrients, and many other compounds throughout the plant body. The vasculature is also essential for the communication between shoot and root, and its structure and function directly influences plant growth and productivity. The Plant Vascular Biology Conference will address how plants respond to water deficient and drought, how nutrients are taken up and transported from the soil to aerial portions of the plant, how cell walls that are the bulk of biomass for bioenergy applications and forestry are produced, and how plants survive environmental stresses such as nutrient limitations and pathogen attacks. The meeting will facilitate an open forum for sharing exciting innovations and foster new collaborative research. Participants will learn about novel conceptual advances, latest techniques and technologies, and major breakthroughs essential to produce food and other biological materials. <br/><br/>The 5th International Conference on Plant Vascular Biology will be held June 17-20 of 2019 at the Asilomar Conference Center near Monterey, California.

This is important because the SAM influences not only Southern Hemisphere climate but also carbon and heat uptake and Antarctic ice melt.<br/><br/>The SAM is the leading mode of climate variability in the middle to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, where it affects the strength and position of the westerly winds and, therefore, precipitation and temperature anomalies across oceans and continents. The SAM controls the strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, and therefore links large-scale climate anomalies across multiple continents and oceans. These subpolar winds also modulate the uptake of heat and carbon by the Southern Ocean and affect the cryosphere.<br/><br/>While investigations of Northern Hemisphere climate dynamics have benefitted from a robust network of annually resolved climate proxies, the Southern Hemisphere has far more limited paleoclimate data during the Common Era, particularly in the Indian Ocean sector, the most climate data-sparse region globally.  The recently discovered sub-fossil wood from King Billy pine trees provides a new opportunity for generating multi-millennial reconstructions of regional temperature and sea level pressure - key indicators of the SAM at mid-latitudes. This network of tree sites builds on and complements another emerging network of high-resolution climate records from east Antarctic ice. <br/><br/>A new environmental reconstruction, centered on the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Hemisphere, will help address significant uncertainties in existing SAM reconstructions from the Pacific sector and allow an assessment of the role of internal dynamics and natural forcing of Southern Hemisphere climate prior to human modifications of the atmosphere.  Further, new data and reconstructions help make possible identification and quantification of uncertainty related to proxy type, location, and seasonality, and the influence of these on inferences about the timing and emergence of trends in the SAM.   New environmental and climatological reconstructions also help explore what drives variability in this dynamical feature. These new reconstructions may extend existing reconstructions of SAM from the Antarctic Peninsula by at least 1,000 years.  Greater understanding of the long-term variability of SAM and its links to Indian Ocean and ENSO dynamics, as well as to external forcing mechanisms (e.g ozone depletion, greenhouse gases) using data-model comparison techniques is possible. <br/><br/>This project strengthens international collaborations between American and Australian scientists as well as across paleoclimate disciplines (tree rings and ice cores).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While biomanufacturing may be one of the most technologically complex and profitable industries, the underlying production process, batch fermentation, has not changed in decades. In theory, continuous fermentation would decrease operational cost and increase production capacity.  However, owing to the high risk of contamination, continuous fermentation is considered unreliable and is rarely used. The proposed technology solves this issue and enables contamination-free, continuous fermentation. Successful implementation of continuous fermentation facilitates automated production and paves the way for future technological development in continuous product purification and recovery. The reduced operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-based commodity chemicals such as bioplastics, as their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. The proposed technology also eliminates the use of antibiotics in fermentation, which in turn alleviates antibiotic misuse and promotes a positive environmental and health impact. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to explore the feasibility of using a biocide/biocide-resistant system to prevent and treat microbial contamination during continuous biomanufacturing. Microbial contamination in biomanufacturing processes is a major concern, as it results in loss of productivity, time, and money.  In addition, it restricts the production mode to slow batch fermentation, and prohibits the implementation of continuous fermentation. The proposed technology solves the contamination problem, as a biocide will inhibit the invading microbial and viral contaminants and a biocide-resistant enzyme will protect the processing hosts. The proposed Phase I research will address the technical challenges by using classical molecular biology and synthetic biology techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate that the proposed technology will provide biocide resistance to bioplastics-producing organisms while inhibiting the outgrowth of contaminants. The second objective is to show that the proposed technology can be used to prevent and treat contamination in continuous fermenters.

Inhibitors of disease-related proteins are central to modern therapeutics across the spectrum of diseases, from cancer to autoimmune diseases, to viral infections, and even to certain hereditary disorders.  Many of these drivers of disease are transcription factors or signal-transduction molecules, yet these proteins are commonly thought of as ""undruggable,"" due to a lack of small pockets for drug binding or due to large protein-protein interaction interfaces. This proposal is aimed at developing an easily screenable library, consisting of DNA-encoded peptidomimetics, whose members have the necessary properties to inhibit these ""yet-to-be-drugged"" proteins.  Of highest commercial importance, these compounds could address many of the currently ""undruggable"" molecular drivers of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to create a DNA-encoded library of constrained peptidomimetic compounds. Current DNA-encoded libraries are primarily limited to small molecules (DNA-encoded chemical libraries; DECLs) or to natural amino acids in the context of translated-protein display (e.g., phage display or mRNA display). In contrast, member molecules of this library will have a much larger binding surface than current small molecules from DECLs, and will be both protease resistant and have a wide range of chemical side chains, unlike the natural peptides from phage display. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to synthesize compounds with conformational rigidity along with parallel DNA encoding.  A library of these compounds could be screened to discover new therapeutic candidates (human and veterinary), life sciences research tools, and heat-resistant diagnostic reagents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At a time when the United States has an increasing demand for technology workers, the country needs contributions from all segments of society, and not simply those segments which have been privileged in the past, to meet this demand and maintain U.S. competitive advantage in the global innovation economy. Engaging people from the full spectrum of the United States population will enable innovative companies to leverage more diverse sources of creativity, build better solutions to today's problems, and create more jobs.

As such, understanding what data structures can, and cannot, compute efficiently is a fundamental question in both theory and practice. Motivated by this question and the growing amounts of data to be processed in modern databases, this project is focused on two primary themes: (1) developing new mathematical tools for proving unconditional lower bounds on the operational time and memory consumption of static and dynamic data structures, thereby reducing the (huge) existing gaps from known upper bounds; (2) exploring the interplay between information theory and data structures in large-scale storage applications. In particular, the second part of the project will focus on designing novel data structures for information retrieval (mainly compression and search) over correlated datasets. The project reflects a scientific agenda for conducting interdisciplinary research in the intersection of theoretical computer science and information theory, bridging and impacting research and education in both communities.<br/><br/>In recent years, information theory and communication complexity have emerged as powerful mathematical tools for proving unconditional lower bounds on the operational time of data structures and for analyzing the power of pre-processing information. Proving time-space lower bounds in the ""cell-probe"" model has long been recognized as one of the major challenges of complexity theory, with many implications on theory and practice. The first part of this project will develop new information-theoretic tools for proving such trade-offs, and will explore connections between data-structure lower bounds and other areas in computational complexity and mathematics, such as locally-decodable codes, circuit complexity, streaming, functional analysis, rigidity and algebraic geometry. Apart from its role as an analytic tool for computation, the interplay between information theory and data structures is particularly vital in large-scale storage applications. The increasing size and complexity of data sets being uploaded and processed on remote data centers, pose a real problem of scalability for traditional data compression and database architectures. The second part of this project establishes a new research program for storage and information-retrieval problems that arise over massive correlated data sets, focusing on the (unexplored) problem of locally decodable source coding for correlated files in static and dynamic scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The race for the perfect battery is intensifying due to growing global demand for both the electric vehicle (EV) and stationary storage industries. The search is on for new ways to improve energy and power density, reduce charging time, and extend battery life. The project will create a diagnostic tool that provides an unprecedented glimpse inside the battery and has the potential to accelerate scientific understanding of how batteries age. A more accurate assessment of battery degradation in real time can inform on-board algorithms, can improve overall battery pack efficiency, and has major cost saving impacts for automakers and stationary storage users. This predictability enables more cost-effective warranty management, improved charging and safety algorithms, and ever more efficient battery pack designs.  Having a sense of remaining useful life also enables the battery to be re-used in a secondary application - creating new business opportunities while a new revenue stream making batteries more sustainable.  Ultimately, this reduces costs for both consumers and manufacturers, and contributes to greener use of resources for society. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project unlocks key insights for large-format lithium batteries. Today?s battery management systems (BMS) do not track a battery?s actual degradation metrics so it cannot forecast remaining useful life. This makes it hard to predict the ?cliff?, a sudden and steep drop in capacity near a battery?s end of life.  This forces battery makers to overdesign battery systems to reduce chances of premature failure before the warranty expiration. The proposed research employs electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) onboard a BMS.  EIS is a diagnostic tool that measures battery impedance - something only possible in a lab setting today. Tracking impedance unlocks a lifetime of degradation data and helps battery engineers better understand the long-term degradation behavior of high voltage battery packs. The project will focus on 1) minimizing the required hardware to measure impedance of each cell in a series-connected battery pack, and 2) reducing the down-time associated with the impedance measurement. The proposed innovation blends a unique hardware architecture with wide-bandgap semiconductors and adaptive charge-control algorithms to minimize hardware size. These help to reduce overall system cost and unlocks orders of magnitude improvement in hardware scalability over existing EIS methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two critical features of this amplifier that will benefit the community directly: 1) the ability to have more qubits per amplifier - essential for large scale quantum computers, and 2) the ability to use a commercial manufacturing process. As quantum hardware continues to scale, so does the number of qubits, making multichannel amplifiers essential. European and Asian investment in quantum technology is growing at an alarming rate.

This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit field use data analysis, which will help remove dangerous drugs from the streets. This innovation will also enhance the understanding of the chemical and photoluminescent properties of narcotic drugs reacting with various drug-indicator materials such as copper(I) iodide and validate the use of such information to identify suspected drugs.

Like screws and keys, many molecules possess a certain handedness that can be important when interacting with living systems.  This issue is vital to pharmaceutical research, where one handed form of a drug may result in benefits while the opposite form may cause harmful side effects.  Consequently, measuring the handedness of molecular mixtures is of paramount importance in modern pharmaceutical research.  However, conventional approaches to making these measurements are often too slow for modern pharmaceutical discovery and development research where high-throughput experiments on hundreds or even thousands of samples per day are performed.  This project aims to remove this bottleneck by leveraging a recently introduced new instrument and commercializing reagent kits that have been shown in academic laboratories to achieve a much faster and simpler method for measuring the handedness of molecular mixtures.  Making this improved technology widely available to the greater research and development community has the potential to streamline drug development efforts at reduced cost and minimized waste production, which is expected to increase profit margins and create new jobs in research, development and manufacturing, resulting in substantial benefit to the health and economy of the United States.  <br/><br/>The innovation of this project comprises a series of optical sensors, developed during a decade of fundamental research in the participating laboratories, which will allow rapid eescreening of a variety of asymmetric reactions. The focus of this unprecedented enterprise is to validate selected sensors against pharmaceutically relevant compounds, determine the error of the optical assays by comparison with traditional techniques such as chiral HPLC, to evaluate the robustness in the presence of potential interferants, and to apply a sensor in the analysis of an asymmetric reaction using multi-well plate technology. The development of a user-friendly kit will include the testing of different methods for the creation of pre-dispensed dried sensors that can be reconstituted without leaving behind residues that might increase the error margin beyond a few percent which is generally acceptable for high-throughput screening applications.

High value assets that are essential parts of the US energy infrastructure, such as offshore oil and gas platforms, marine ships and wind turbines, are exposed to one of the most corrosive environments with direct exposure to salt water via immersion and seawater spray. Corrosion of these metal structures is estimated to cost the world economy around $2.3 trillion in maintenance and replacement capital every year. This project's superhydrophobic coating has the potential to significantly reduce both cost and waste by improving structural safety, reducing maintenance frequency and lengthening the operating lifetime of such vital assets. It will also reduce the environmental impact of corrosion protection systems by using less harmful materials, negating coating repainting needs and extending metal lifetime.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to make a durable, superhydrophobic, high-performance anticorrosive coating through creation of dual-function coating additives. Coatings and corrosion inhibitors are generally the first line of defense in this fight against corrosion. Highly-water repellent superhydrophobic coatings are leading contenders for delivering a step change in corrosion protection performance. However, current solutions suffer from two notable issues: high cost and low durability in highly corrosive marine environments. Existing superhydrophobic coatings require complex and expensive equipment and materials. In addition, these coatings are easily damaged during use, resulting in the loss of their water repellency and corrosion protection ability. The key innovation of this project is a novel dual-function additive that can impart coatings with both superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) and on-demand corrosion inhibitors release (active corrosion protection). This additive based approach results in a durable coating that retains its protective abilities even through significant use and abrasion and enables adaptation to many other coating applications, even ones outside of corrosion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there is universal excitement for the potential of storybooks in ISE, there is an acknowledgment of a critical need for more cross-project sharing, more research, and more efforts to synthesize and share findings. This award will catalyze new research studies and partnerships to advance efforts in ISE contexts, including the role of books in the overall learning experience or program, how books are selected or designed, and how the reading is facilitated by teachers and families. Participants will be educators and researchers working with or studying family learning for preschool-age children (three to five years) using early childhood fiction books as a tool for engaging families in STEM topics and skills.<br/><br/>Storybook STEM will be implemented in four phases: (1) pre-convening activities to plan, synthesize existing resources, engage a broader group of educators and researchers beyond convening attendees, and prepare convening participants to maximize the value of the in-person discussions; (2) in-person convening to catalyze cross-project discussions, outline promising practices, and identify questions and ideas for the future; (3) evaluation of the impact and value of the convening, from the perspective of participants and a project steering committee; and (4) dissemination of findings and recommendations to educators and researchers within and beyond the ISE field. Outcomes include: (1) documenting current and past work in ISE and other fields; (2) summarizing key recommendations and resources from the reading, literacy, and early childhood development fields; and (3) outlining promising directions for future work. <br/><br/>This award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences. The findings from this project will provide a critical resource to help these efforts be more effective and inclusive for audiences across the country. Research studies motivated by the convening will address the lack of empirical work on storybooks as a tool for ISE programs and advance the ISE field's knowledge of how to integrate these books effectively. Because storybooks are a highly accessible and almost universally used family learning resource, the topic of the convening will be relevant to a wide range of audiences and will help educators broaden access to ISE for traditionally underserved and under-resourced communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout its five years, this project will fund cohorts of six students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology, chemistry, or engineering. This project will provide STEM students with supporting activities that have been shown to increase retention and graduation of academically strong, lower-income students. These activities include presentations by distinguished professionals in STEM fields, visits to STEM graduate programs, internships, and research experiences. Analysis of the impact of these activities will increase knowledge about how to recruit, maintain, and graduate lower-income students in STEM fields. Its relatively large population of lower-income students makes the University of the District of Columbia a good choice for this project. In addition, because of its large percentage of students who are under-represented in STEM fields, this project is likely to broaden participation in STEM.<br/><br/>This S-STEM project aims to increase the number of STEM professionals. It concentrates on preparing lower-income, highly qualified STEM students to enter graduate school or the workforce in their STEM disciplines.  The project will provide students with activities to develop academic and research skills in STEM.  It plans to promote persistence by providing scholars with holistic mentoring, concentrated learning activities, and intensive research experiences. The first objective of the project is to create and maintain a strong academic pipeline of students who enroll, remain in, and graduate from the University with a STEM degree. To do so, it will use an expanded recruitment strategy that incorporates faculty, staff, and an advisory committee in the recruitment and selection process. Secondly, the project will offer enrichment activities to improve students' critical thinking, communication skills, and research capabilities. Thirdly, the project will introduce a holistic mentoring system for the students. This holistic mentoring will include dedicated efforts to provide professional expertise and career skills, advice, and insight, which has been shown to increase the successful completion of STEM degree programs. The mentoring system also will provide a smooth transition to a competitive doctoral degree program or discipline-related job. The project will apply published data that show the benefit of concentrated learning activities such as seminar and workshop attendance, weekly meetings, year-round research experiences, and internships. In addition, this project will offer adaptive programs that change with the individual student's need.  It is expected that the project will increase the success of participating students in completing their STEM degree and entering into graduate school or the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In today's world, everything, including medical devices (e.g., wireless implants and sensors), has an app; using apps requires batteries. This project will produce ""Safer Energy for the Wireless World""; the resulting improved batteries will incorporate novel, lighter, and safer (no overheating) anode materials that will charge faster and store more energy than current versions. The new anode materials are estimated upon success to yield sales of $1B during the first 10 years from selling the materials to battery manufacturers to incorporate, initially, as composites in lithium ion battery anodes, and, later, as the entire active anode. Broader societal impacts include greater safety because the batteries do not overheat; lighter, more portable devices with longer battery life and faster recharging time; reduced need for backup batteries; and diverse STEM workforce development though applied research and entrepreneurship training.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop safer, more powerful ways to charge electronic devices by translating fundamental research from university to industry. The opportunity arises from an NSF-supported discovery of the first solid form of carbon monoxide known, a two-dimensional crystal structure: graphene monoxide (GmO). GmO and its first proposed application for anodes in lithium ion batteries are patented. Knowledge gaps to be addressed include identifying tailored materials for optimizing batteries for electronics, using theoretical and experimental approaches to identify the maximum energy storage capacity for lithium batteries, and determining the energy and power densities and safety properties under normal and extreme operating conditions. The technology must be demonstrated in 200-mAh pouch batteries, the first milestone needed for battery manufacturers to consider adopting the innovation through licensing or sales. The second milestone is to scale up materials to produce large quantities. The overall goal is to commercialize the GmO material into an active anode or additive material for extreme batteries. In sum, the project will yield prototype batteries made from the new materials, optimize properties for specific partner applications, simulate interactions between GmO and Li, and identify pathways for scaleup of materials production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, such minerals can be used to reconstruct environmental conditions in the environments of formation. Dolomite is a ubiquitous mineral in the geological record and an important petroleum reservoir rock. Accordingly, dolomites can be incredible archives for reconstructing and understanding environmental changes throughout Earth's history and specifically shed light on the evolution of organisms on Earth and in other planets.  However, dolomites occur in many different sedimentary and/or diagenetic settings and it is hard to precisely determine formation mechanisms using currently available mineralogical or geochemical tools. This limits and complicates the utility of this mineral for geobiology, petroleum research, and low temperature geochemical studies. Being able to unequivocally identify dolomites that form in association with living organisms (microbial-dolomites) in the geological record would eliminate some of these complexities and allow for more straightforward interpretation of deposition environments. In this study the investigator hypothesizes that the involvement of microorganisms in the formation of dolomites induces unique signatures that could be used as ""bio-markers"" and enable identification of microbial-dolomites in the geological record. The investigator will test this hypothesis using microbial-dolomite samples that were precipitated under controlled laboratory experiments at different temperatures and growth conditions and microbial-dolomite samples forming at present in a marine-lagoon and a lake setting. <br/><br/>The major goal of this proposed research is to investigate the utility of Ca, Mg and Sr stable isotopes in dolomite to shed light on the mechanisms of dolomite formation. To address this goal the research will first analyze a suite of dolomite samples (and the solutions from which they precipitated experimentally) to identify unique signatures. This will be complimented by the analysis of dolomite that formed recently (or is currently forming) in modern lagoon and lake environments along with other associated minerals, exopolymeric substances and precipitation fluids. Ancient dolomites across the two major time intervals when oxygen levels increased at the Earth surface will also be analyzed. Together with petrographic and stratigraphic information the geochemical fingerprinting will enable identification of microbial-dolomite. Dissolved samples and chromatographically separated solutions will be analyzed for major-and trace element compositions using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Stable isotope compositions will be determined by multi collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS).

WinCompTop 2 is designed to grow the network of women active in this field by providing both research opportunity and a unique environment for mentoring, collaboration, and cohort building. This type of event is critical, since despite numerous initiatives and undeniable progress over the past few decades, gender imbalance in mathematics and computer science remains significant. In particular, mathematics and computer science are two of three disciplines with the lowest percentage of women attaining PhDs, according to recent data collected by the National Science Foundation. There is considerable evidence that conferences and workshops such as WinCompTop2, geared toward women can and do make a significant impact, and participants report that they see strong benefits from these workshops, which support collaborations, broaden contacts, and raise visibility in the greater mathematical community.<br/><br/>The WinCompTop2 workshop fits under the broad umbrella of Research Collaboration Conferences for Women, which the Association for Women in Mathematics encourages and supports. The majority of the time at the workshop will be spent tackling open problems in small working groups headed by established leaders in the field. The schedule consists of long blocks of time for the working groups to do research. At two or more points during the week, all participants will convene and one member from each group will provide a brief summary of their team's progress. In addition, there will be a poster session for graduate students and early-career participants as well as other crucial networking and mentoring opportunities between women at different points in their career as well as between peer colleagues.

Although microalgae and cyanobacteria have high volumetric productivities, the cultures cannot be too deep, due to restrictions of light penetration.  This proposed technology removes the light penetration limit inherent in current technologies. The results of this project will allow the production of medical and food grade biomass in controlled conditions, as the light source will not be connected to the exterior of the culture reactors. This approach will provide the advantages of a fermentation production using phototrophic species, without the need to supply organic carbon. The photosynthetic biomass production makes use of carbon dioxide and light for growth. This project will result in a microalgal/cyanobacterial biomass production in areas where it is not currently feasible and with higher productivity. The increase of the depth of the cultures two, five or more times of what is currently possible, practically reduces the area required for biomass production. A reduction of cost will improve the economic outlook for microalgal-based commodity products, including feed, food, fuels, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals and lower the environmental impact.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses one of the most significant problems found in achieving the promise of microalgae and cyanobacteria as source of food, fuels and other products is the limitation of light penetration. Most outdoor cultures are limited to less than 60 cm depth. In reactors with artificial light, besides the light penetration high electrical costs limit their use to high value products.  This project will result in a light system that takes advantage of the water movement in cultures to generate electricity for LED lights in untethered units that move with the culture. The proposed generator uses methods more efficient and lighter that traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric generators. The developed energy harvester can be used in other applications such as power for water quality monitoring and other sensing equipment. In this phase, a unit with a miniaturized energy harvester coupled with passive switching, charging, discharging and rectifying modules in the same substrate, in a waterproof casing will be developed. Data proof of the suitability of these units to support photosynthetic microorganisms? biomass production will be obtained. The results will inform further development of the units in a future phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The SCU produces no emissions in its heat generation, requires no fuel costs, and can be used in remote locations to deliver precision control to high temperature thermal processes. Many new applications become available to market participants through the proposed innovation with the most notable commercial outcome being a multi-material additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) system capable of producing custom metal and glass parts.

Owing in large part to the lack of a practical way to connect users globally, QKD has not yet been widely deployed. This project aims to demonstrate the viability of high-speed, satellite-to-ground QKD using the low-cost CubeSat platform. If successful, this design will dramatically reduce the initial costs to launch a QKD constellation offering worldwide QKD connectivity, thereby greatly expanding the utility of QKD and driving market growth. Early customers will be the US Government and large businesses who are willing to pay a premium for the ultimate in data security. Government use offers clear societal benefit, as several agencies rely on secure global communications to ensure societal well-being. As technology advances, the network may be used to secure the communications of private citizens. The proposed plan will furthermore develop enabling technologies for future space-based quantum science experiments.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce designs for a high-speed QKD payload hosted on a CubeSat.

Since CubeSats are heavily constrained in size, weight, and power, the major technical challenge will be to miniaturize the payload and reduce its power consumption while simultaneously improving data rates. To address this challenge, the small business will investigate a novel QKD payload concept that pushes the limits of emerging technologies in photonics and microelectromechanical systems.

Information about brain activity is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. The most powerful non-invasive technique for measuring brain activity, magnetoencephalography (MEG), uses magnetometers that require liquid helium cooling and magnetic shielding to operate. Due to these requirements, current MEG systems are large and expensive, limiting their adoption and accessibility. ADFMR sensors could allow for the measurement of biomagnetic fields without the need for cryogenics and magnetic shielding, dramatically reducing the size, cost, and power consumption of such systems. The portability of this improved technology would allow for functional neuroimaging outside of the carefully controlled imaging suites where it is possible today. This could allow for diagnosis of previously unreachable patients (ie. in the ICU, operating room, or ambulance) as well as the development of new uses for this technology (ie. long-term monitoring, scanning during movement). This improved, portable MEG could also enable the first practical, portable brain-computer interface ? applicable across a wide variety of applications in both defense and consumer sectors.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project investigates the ability for ADFMR sensors to measure extremely small magnetic fields, such as those generated by the human brain. The ADFMR phenomenon has been shown to be a much more power and size efficient alternative to traditional methods of exciting ferromagnetic resonance, allowing for its use as a sensing mechanism for chip-scale magnetometers. In the proposed program, a number of methods to improve the performance of current ADFMR devices will be investigated. First, a compact model will be developed to allow for fast modeling of ADFMR devices and their associated detection circuitry. Using the results of this model, devices will be fabricated in order to experimentally validate various mechanisms for the reduction of 1/f noise in the detector circuitry and for the optimization of the ADFMR absorption profile for maximum sensitivity to applied magnetic fields. These sensor elements will initially be tested using standard benchtop characterization equipment. Following a benchtop demonstration, challenges in miniaturizing the full sensor system will be addressed by developing fully integrated magnetometer prototypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This shortage has had a particularly pronounced effect on the fruit and vegetable industry, where even a brief loss of labor can result in a total loss of harvestable products.  More recently, U.S. produce suppliers have been forced to rely heavily on imported produce sourced from greater distances and of lower quality.  Advancements in agricultural technology have already dramatically improved the efficiency of produce farms in terms of land utilization and water consumption by enabling produce to be grown indoors using highly sophisticated commercial greenhouses, automated nutrient delivery, and light control.  However, to date, these commercial greenhouses still lack a comprehensive solution for automating routine harvesting, pruning, and crop care labor tasks.  Thus, newly developed agricultural technologies which can automate these tasks have the potential for substantial commercial impact by making domestic farming operations more profitable and efficient.  Commercial adoption of automated harvesting technology will also benefit consumers by enabling higher quality produce grown closer to market and position the U.S. agricultural sector as a new area of growth for highly skilled technical jobs.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of new deep learning techniques used to identify harvestable fruits (initially tomatoes) using computer vision cameras and to accurately estimate their orientation and connectivity (bunches of fruits that are connected by the same stem or vine).  Successful development of a method capable of running in real-time would resolve substantial technical risks which inhibit the ability to commercialize robotic automated harvesting solutions.  Such advancements would also contribute newfound insights to the broader computer vision and robotic manipulation communities into the unique challenges that sparse and deformable ?vine? like structures present to traditional methods of object pose estimation and grasping.  In the later portion of this Phase I project, Root AI will incorporate these new methods of sensing tomato fruit orientation into an improved motion and task planning system which uses the additional information to intelligently plan a complex movement path to harvest individual fruits in congested and heavily occluded natural growing environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One advantage of the proposed sensor is its similar feel to cloth fabric, a benefit in comfort and convenience to the user.  This is in contrast to current hydration monitors made of thick plastic materials requiring the use of an additional wristband or adhesive patch.  This value proposition was developed and tested based on the findings of 374 customer interviews during a spring 2017 NSF I-Corps workshop.  That study determined the commercial and product potential of a fabric sensor to monitor hydration.  In 2015 alone more than 17.1 million people finished endurance events.  According to interview data, 50% of respondents are interested in a hydration solution due to past dehydration and cramping issues. Additionally, 40% of respondents indicated interest in a technology-based solution. This group equates a target market of $342 million for a hydration monitor priced at $100 per unit, a good estimation of the total available market based on I-Corps interviews. In general, the data collected from the developed sensor could lead to better understanding of health and disease processes, including the analysis of common diabetic neurological complications, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF), and sweat monitoring for advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden patients, or athlete performance tracking leading to better treatments and health outcomes for all patients.  <br/><br/>A monitor that analyzes the sodium concentration of a person's sweat would be able to notify them before they begin suffering from exercise-induced illnesses such as hypernatremia or hyponatermia. This early notification system would allow people to be on top of their hydration, and be able to replenish their electrolytes as needed, without overhydrating. The team has developed flexible, lightweight fabric materials that can selectively determine physiological information from sweat forming on the surface of the skin.  The technology is the first lightweight fabric sensor to provide real-time information regarding hydration levels during exercise or training. These dehydration patterns are unique and vary based on diet, weather conditions, and human physiological cycles. The ability to monitor an individual's hydration parameters is unique to the proposed sensor and gives it a competitive advantage over sweat monitors that monitor water lost or water timers that remind the athlete to drink water every 20 minutes.  Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the large-scale development of a hydration monitor, validation of the monitor during material testing and on the body in an exercise physiology laboratory, and leveraging partnerships with potential strategic partners. As athletes strive for peak performance, improper hydration can undermine their progress in both training and competitive settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge arises in part due to the central role that clouds and precipitation processes play in the tropical circulation. While there is much that remains to be learned about the processes that drive tropical rainfall, numerous advancements have been made in recent decades. For example, research has found that the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere plays a central role in the regulation of tropical rainfall. In spite of this breakthrough, our understanding of how water vapor, precipitation and large-scale atmospheric motions in the tropics occur remains limited. This study seeks to understand such interactions on perturbations in the atmospheric flow that are known as tropical disturbances. These include disturbances whose horizontal flow is largely rotational such as easterly waves, equatorial Rossby waves and monsoon low-pressure systems. These systems play an important role in the hydrologic cycle of multiple regions in the tropics, such as the Caribbean, and often develop into tropical cyclones, and have far-reaching impacts in the extratropics. <br/><br/>The research will provide important insights on the organization of precipitation in the tropics, which will lead to improvements in the representation of these processes in models.  Furthermore, because these disturbances sometimes develop into tropical cyclones, insights provided by this study may be of interest to the forecasting of tropical cyclogenesis. Results from the project have great potential to form a new general theoretical framework for tropical motions, which may be included in a course in tropical meteorology. A graduate student and a postdoc will be supported through this award. The knowledge gained from the research project will also be used for public outreach and general education.  <br/><br/>Novel statistical techniques will be used to analyze the interactions among water vapor, precipitation and circulation. The team will examine observational data and simulations from numerical models to obtain a lucid, clear picture of how circulations in these ""rotational tropical disturbances"" modulate the distribution of water vapor and precipitation processes. The study will elucidate the ways in which water vapor modifies precipitation, and how this change in rainfall affects circulations of these disturbances. The role that thermodynamic processes such as radiation and condensation play in this interplay will also be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, killing over 50,000 each year in the US, and with a five-year survival rate below 7%.  However, currently there are no reliable diagnostic tests for pancreatic cancer, and the great majority of cases are detected at a late stage, with bleak mortality rates as a result.  As cancer is driven fundamentally by a dysregulation of key protein networks, directly measuring the activity of key proteins provides a robust bio-signature for cancer detection. The project will develop a scientifically novel diagnostic technology based on broad protein profiling for the accurate and low cost detection of pancreatic cancer, and thereby shift the therapeutic field of battle to an earlier stage of the disease, where the current treatments can be more effectively harnessed to improve patient outcomes and save lives, avoid unnecessary and ineffective procedures, and generate health system cost savings across the US and elsewhere. Commercialization of this diagnostic platform is expected to drive creation of a substantial enterprise, and related employment and tax-revenues.<br/><br/>The major innovation of this project is the breakthrough technology for monitoring the state of dozens of cancer-related proteins in biological samples and its application for diagnosing pancreatic cancer from a minute sample of a patient?s blood. The innovative platform has superior levels of sensitivity and accuracy compared to existing technologies, and also offers substantially lower costs, which are critical advantages for the diagnostic application. A further innovation in this project is the development of the analytic engine and the bio-signature knowledge base, that will be used for analysis of the patient?s protein profile.  In this project, the Company will focus on several key technical challenges to develop and validate a 1.0 version of its diagnostic platform for pancreatic cancer detection:  i. identifying a robust, differentiated multi-target, bio-signature for pancreatic cancer; and ii. doing so with an accuracy and at a sufficiently early stage in the cancer emergence and progression to be medically useful. This project will extensively profile biobank samples from various stages of pancreatic cancer and normal patients to generate the differentiated bio-signatures, develop a diagnosis prediction engine to match the bio-signatures and inform diagnoses, and validate those results using additional samples.

This new instrument does not require the use of liquid coupling, and can work on rough, coated, or contaminated surfaces that cannot be inspected with conventional liquid-coupled techniques unless the part is subjected to costly and time consuming part preparation. By not using liquids, this instrument can also be used on components that are very hot, very cold, radioactive, or in a vacuum. A high-resolution ultrasonic instrument that does not use couplant and has comparable performance to a piezoelectric instrument will save inspection time, reduce inspection costs, and permit inspections while in-service, which will result in millions of dollars in savings for plant operators. Society as a whole will also benefit from improvements in safety and performance of the plants, and by reducing the amount of waste and contaminants released into the environment as direct sub-product of the inspection, or from failures in facilities and equipment.<br/><br/>The proposed project consists of the development of a portable, high-resolution, ultrasonic phased array instrumentation, software, and transducers based on non-contact Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) technology to substitute or complement the tens of thousands of conventional piezoelectric instruments in the market. For the instrumentation, the research will revolve around the development of a high-power and compact 16-channel pulser/receiver with a very small dead zone that permit inspection near the surface of the part. This instrumentation will also require custom software with signal-enhancing algorithms that compensate for the small amplitude of EMAT signals. The 16-channel phased-array EMAT transducers will involve multi-physics simulation of electrical and magnetic components to develop very small and high-density coil elements that can produce enough signal amplitude at high-frequencies while handling the pulsing rates required for effective inspection, and the high-power generated by the custom instrumentation. All these components will need to be enclosed in a battery-powered package that can be used in the harsh conditions typically found in field inspections. The expected result is a portable instrument that can compete in performance with conventional piezoelectric instruments, especially in applications and inspection environments where a conventional instrument is not practical or very costly to use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seismic anisotropy arises when a mantle rock is sheared or stretched by the process of mantle convection; therefore, observations of anisotropy provide seismologists with a method of inferring mantle convection patterns. While measurements of seismic anisotropy from recordings of earthquake waves that have passed through the mantle are relatively straightforward, it is a major challenge to decipher the exact location or depth of the anisotropic structure. One strategy for overcoming this challenge is to move towards an approach that provides an image or picture of anisotropy in the upper mantle, using a technique known as tomography. Much in the same way that medical tomography can provide an image of the inside of a person's body, seismic tomography yields an image of the structure of the Earth's deep interior. The PI will provide support and mentoring for a PhD student.  Codes being developed during the research will be openly available via GitHub. The PI and graduate student will also provide outreach in the form of presentations to the general public.<br/><br/>The application of shear wave splitting tomography has been a long-standing goal in the study of upper mantle anisotropy, but there are only a few examples of published studies that have successfully implemented it. The challenges are many: the inverse problem is highly nonlinear and sensitivity kernels for the inversion depend strongly on the starting model; a large number of parameters are needed for a complete description of the anisotropy; robust shear wave splitting measurements are often difficult to make for noisy data. This project will meet those challenges by developing and applying a framework for finite-frequency SKS splitting intensity tomography that implements a model space search approach for probing parameter space. The investigators propose three specific activities. Activity #1 comprises the completion and implementation of a theoretical and computational framework for our splitting intensity tomography approach. The team is extending existing theory for finite-frequency sensitivity kernels to a new parameterization scheme that takes advantage of constraints on olivine elasticity from mineral physics. They will complete the implementation of a model space search algorithm, based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, for inverting splitting intensity observations. Finally, the investigators will test their implementation with a series of synthetic anisotropic models and splitting intensity datasets, designed to understand the limitations, resolution, and parameter tradeoffs of their imaging approach. Activity #2 will involve the implementation of the shear wave splitting intensity tomography framework for several real-world data sets from dense broadband seismic networks. Activity #3 will extend their model space search approach to simultaneously include other types of observations that constrain upper mantle anisotropy, including anisotropic receiver functions and surface wave phase velocity measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These learning opportunities may also increase students' understanding of how science can help their communities and perceptions of themselves as scientists.<br/><br/>The project aims to provide an urban ecological research experience to disaster-impacted students and to measure the impact of this experience on students' persistence, resilience, and scientific identity. This project has two major goals: 1) To promote science learning, resilience, and persistence among students from communities affected by the recent storms; 2) To collect vital, time-sensitive data on impacts of the hurricane on urban forests to inform future urban ecosystem management in Eastern North Carolina and beyond.  As part of this project, students will complete pre- and post-test measures of their science identity, their academic persistence, and their resilience, as well as an assessment of forestry knowledge and responses. They will also complete a daily journal reporting changes in their interest in science and identity as a scientist, to capture progressive changes across the learning experience. The project will use photographic analysis to rapidly assess the extent of damage to trees and the storms' impacts on urban infrastructure including: 1) aerial photographs and remotely sensed images for before-after comparisons on city-/region-wide scales; 2) 360-degree photos taken from the ground to analyze the three-dimensional structure of the urban forest and effects of hurricane damage; 3) images and reports from social media postings; 4) longer-term comparative analyses using available historical images.

It is estimated that the global counterfeit market will grow from $1.2 Trillion in 2017 to more than $1.8 Trillion by 2020. In an attempt to combat this trend, spending on anticounterfeit packaging will grow from $122 Billion in 2017 to $264 Billion by 2023. Of most dire concern, the counterfeit pharmaceutical industry is estimated at approximately $200 Billion, resulting in about 1 million deaths annually. Existing anti-counterfeit packaging techniques have proven largely ineffective in combating this counterfeiting problem. This project will result, for the first time, in packaging or seals that, without ambiguity, inform users of the authenticity, integrity, and provenance of any product outfitted with the project?s resultant technology. All stakeholders in a supply chain will be enabled to detect fake goods before they can be used or consumed. This increased visibility into the supply chain will also broaden enforcement opportunities for relevant entities and/or authorities and provide special benefit to those industries most urgently impacted: pharmaceuticals, military/defense products and high-priced goods. <br/><br/>The proposed innovation is a novel enhancement to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) that seals any package or container to which it is attached and, when queried by a reader/interrogator (e.g. any modern smartphone), provides the status (i.e. tampered/un-tampered) and identity to the user or system. The project will produce the designs and manufacturing techniques required to create RFID-based seals that provide assurance of authenticity, integrity, and provenance for products to which these seals are applied. Research will be conducted on several specific hardware components required by this innovation and will produce the requisite software and cryptographic systems for the testing, design, and commercialization of this proposed solution to product counterfeiting. Developed software will provide the testing and development framework for commercial applications of the proposed anti-counterfeiting solution. Advances in hardware design, especially concerning the minimization of power requirements for the RFID-based seals and the manufacturing techniques for specific required hardware components (i.e. the components that detect tampering events) will be accomplished during this research project.

When individuals take turns cooperating in a reciprocal fashion, they are better off in the long-term than individuals who care only about their own immediate benefit. However, little is known about the psychological skills needed. What features of the human mind enable us to engage in reciprocity? How can we explain when individuals are more or less cooperative? This project is focused on three psychological abilities that are hypothesized to be critical for reciprocity: The ability to plan for the future, to exercise patience, and to tolerate a level of risk. Measuring these abilities will facilitate understanding fundamental aspects of human cooperation and developing strategies needed to foster cooperation in daily social interactions, including the work environment. This project will examine reciprocity as it first emerges in development (by studying children), it will also examine reciprocity within the context of human evolution (by comparing human abilities to those of chimpanzees). To assess why some individuals are more cooperative than others, the project tests individual differences in reciprocal behavior across adults. An important aspect of this research project is to translate the insights about the basic skills for reciprocity into programs that foster cooperation in society-at-large. In business, practitioners have come to realize the need for more cooperative approaches and are in urgent need of guidelines to promote cooperative work in organizations; therefore, the researchers will partner with the Institute for Collaborative Working, an organization that develops executive training for collaborative working in industry.<br/><br/>The project will use a battery of validated tests to determine the degree to which future planning, patience, and risk tolerance are the foundational skills required for reciprocity-based cooperation. The project will integrate three complementary lines of inquiry. One line will assess the evolutionary basis of the human capacity for reciprocity by studying chimpanzees as one of humans? closest primate relatives. This will test the hypothesis that chimpanzees reciprocate in limited ways because of differences in future planning, patience, and risk tolerance. A second line of inquiry will trace the emergence of reciprocity in children between 3 and 6 years of age. This will enable the researchers to test whether the emergence of reciprocity can be explained by developmental changes in the three component abilities. A third line involves experiments designed to examine individual differences among human adults in their tendency to engage in reciprocal cooperation -- measuring whether variability in reciprocity can be explained by differences in future planning, patience, and risk tolerance. Researchers will meet with key members of the Institute for Collaborative Working and international scholars to discuss the findings and their implications for fostering cooperative interactions in the work place.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, many STEM instructors hesitate to implement effective pedagogies, such as active learning and inclusive teaching practices, even when they know that these practices can improve student learning. However, improvements in undergraduate teaching effectiveness may not require full-scale revision of courses, but instead can result from small changes, and research supports the hypothesis that incremental changes can be enabled by the right kind of teaching resources. This project will support and expand the journal, CourseSource that was created in response to recommendations from the NSF/AAAS Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education initiative. CourseSource is a journal of evidence-based, field-tested lessons in undergraduate biology that publishes rigorously peer-reviewed Lessons in a common format. This project will support the development and publication of additional Lessons. In addition, it will support development of critical automation and functionality needed to make CourseSource a sustainable journal with high levels of usability and user responsiveness. Finally, development of a broad suite of web analytics will enable the identification of teaching materials characteristics that lead to adoption or adaptation by others.<br/><br/>Developing CourseSource will provide an important avenue for publishing evidence-based teaching materials, and project outcomes will contribute to an understanding of the relationship between implementation of evidence-based teaching by higher education instructors and the design/dissemination of effective teaching materials. Publication of evidence-based teaching materials in a peer-reviewed, high-quality journal is expected to increase the value of evidence-based teaching for promotion and tenure, helping to support these practices by tenure-track, research faculty in colleges and universities. In addition, the information learned through the project activities will be used iteratively and directly to improve CourseSource Lessons, thus strengthening the impact of the journal on implementation of evidence-based teaching. The design principles uncovered as a result of this project will be relevant for other educational reform efforts and digital repositories of teaching resources."

A critical issue associated with such catastrophes is the availability of electricity for the recovery efforts. Community resilience microgrids can connect critical loads in the community and share the distributed energy resources of multiple providers to enhance the availability of electricity supply during disruptions. However, community resilience microgrids are complex networked systems, and their operation can be often interrupted or halted due to the cascaded growth of failures in interconnected electrical and communications components or the unwillingness or inability of individual microgrid partners to respond. In order to enable the full functionality of community resilience microgrids, this project investigates an integrated reconfigurable control and self-organizing communication framework for enhancing operations in both grid-connected and islanded modes. The effectiveness and benefit of the proposed framework will be demonstrated and evaluated through the hardware-in-the-loop simulation and an actual community microgrid project, which will ultimately provide a model for the successful deployment of community resilience microgrids in the U.S. and beyond. In addition to including doctoral students in research and creating educational materials for the next generation operators and researchers of electrical and communications systems, projects will involve underrepresented students in evaluating social, economic, and resilience benefits of integrated control and communication approaches.<br/><br/>Coordinated dynamic control strategies for distributed energy resources and loads of multiple owners across different timescales, together with their distinct communication requirements, are the key to the resilient and economic operation of community microgrids in both grid-connected and islanded modes. This research will address these challenges by (1) exploring a hierarchically reconfigurable centralized/distributed control strategy to optimally manage power flows of distribution lines, dispatches of distributed energy resources and flexible loads, and the voltage and frequency of the microgrid across multiple timescales; (2) investigating a self-organizing infrastructure with network topology adjustment and multi-scale data aggregation for flexible, fast, and reliable communication; (3) developing an integrated reconfigurable control and self-organizing communication framework to study the interdependency and interaction between control strategies and communication requirements; and (4) validating, demonstrating, and promoting the developed framework through the hardware-in-the-loop simulation and an ongoing community microgrid project."

Research will focus on (1) using existing techniques to identify and remove non-astrophysical noise in the data stream, and (2) developing new methods to build predictive models for detector noise. Broader impacts on the development of gravitational-wave astrophysics will consist in improving LIGO's search pipelines and the performance of the detectors. Educational and public outreach initiatives will strengthen programs aimed at yielding knowledgeable teachers with enough physics content to effectively teach physics courses in school. New initiatives to promote science among diverse segments of the population will be developed through collaborations with educators in other disciplines.<br/><br/>Removing non-astrophysical artifacts from gravitational-wave data is crucial for reducing instrumental noise non-stationarity, extending the detector network duty cycle, and increasing the statistical significance of gravitational-wave candidate events. Improvements in these areas, in turn, boost parameter estimation of the gravitational-wave detections and enable refined astrophysical interpretations of the signals. Personnel funded under this award will analyze data from LIGO detector output and auxiliary sensors with the goal to isolate and identify sources of noise affecting LIGO's gravitational-wave searches. Results from these investigations will be fed back to LIGO Laboratory commissioners and instrumentation researchers to assist in the mitigation of instrumental and environmental disturbances. At the same time, Mississippi students and researchers will develop new, fast, reliable and accurate methods to model instrumental noise in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Machine learning-based algorithms, such as genetic programming, will be used to build predictive models to uncover the origin of non-astrophysical noise in the detectors."

The core activity of the proposed platform consists of live academic competition, students answering questions in a game-based, online arena. The platform will, in essence, borrow the features and structures found in popular athletic sports, from points, scoreboards and rankings to leagues, tournaments and championships, and reproduce them online so that students can compete academically in the classroom just like they compete athletically on the sports field, with similar performance gains and improvements to peer dynamics expected to follow. Leveraging classic game mechanics in an exciting online format, the platform has the potential to motivate students across the skill and demographic spectrums where offline academic competitions have historically failed. In past attempts to improve learning outcomes and close the achievement gap, the U.S. has focused on inputs, e.g., class-size, book counts, etc., and more recently, outputs, e.g., standardized test scores. This project offers the chance to approach learning improvement from a new angle or perspective. By focusing directly on student motivation with a structure only recently made possible by the advent of the internet age, this project leverages the power of competition in an effort to advance the stated NSF missions of developing a globally competitive STEM workforce and increasing economic competitiveness in the U.S.<br/><br/>Technical paragraph:<br/>This project entails the development of a web and mobile platform with the ability to host and engage every student across the U.S. in robust, online competition activity. As such, the proposed activity is expansive in its breadth and scope and therefore presents an immense challenge, both from a technical and a design perspective. In the U.S., the vast majority of students are educated in a school district setting. Therefore, the platform must be designed in such a way as to fit neatly within the parameters of school district scheduling, processes and structures. It must be comprehensive in its design, seamlessly blending together the experiences of very different users. Three distinct roles are imagined: an administrator of the platform will have the ability to create leagues, tournaments, and championships, team-based and individual-based, for students across the school district/network; a teacher on the platform will be able to arrange matches for a team/class of students by dividing them into multiple teams that play against each other or challenging another team in the same school district/network to a match; a student on the platform will be able to arrange individual-based matches with other students in the same school district/network or play against a personal best avatar. Bringing all such activity together into a single platform, one that can be integrated with existing online education platforms and replicated from school district to school district across the U.S., satisfies NSF?s objective of supporting projects of high technical risk.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the digital electronics in everyday use, smaller and better chips imply lesser cost, higher performance, and more features. As traditional way of IC scaling reaches unsurmountable barriers at sub-10nm technology nodes, the proposed technology provides new directions for scaling through innovations in several layers from fundamental physical components, computing model, to circuits and integration. In addition, the technology promises denser, faster and more power efficient computing with unique capabilities for fault-tolerant and secure hardware through inherent physical capabilities and design choices. The technology, coupled with Intellectual Property (IP) development strategy based fabless commercialization approach is proposed for market penetration and growth at a fast turn-around time.  The product will be beneficial for a wide range of customers from microprocessor producers to consumer electronics manufacturers and be particularly attractive for defense entities. This I-corps teams project will allow customer discovery, business model generation and evaluation of commercialization potentials for successful SBIR/STTR proposals, and can ultimately lead to the transition of lab research to product. It will have a lasting impact on the participants. <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project seeks commercialization potential of a novel computing technology that relies on deterministic interference between adjacent nanoscale interconnects (Crosstalk) for logic computing. The proposed approach departs from current device switching dependent computing paradigm and relaxes difficult device scaling requirements. The scalability in Crosstalk fabric is determined primarily by circuit scheme, integration and the ability to pattern smaller metal nano-lines and deposit dielectrics in between them, which can be done by utilizing existing EDA and manufacturing methods. The proposed computing approach is functionally complete, and provides huge opportunities for logic reduction; by having more than 2 inputs couple to a single output and by varying their respective coupling capacitances, a logic implementation (e.g., Carry logic for Addition) that would typically require more than 15 transistors in CMOS, can be done by just 5 transistors. The benchmarking of a 4-bit adder showed over 5x density benefits vs. CMOS at 16nm. Another distinct feature of Crosstalk technology is the run-time reconfigurability that allows different functionalities to be embedded in the same circuit, which can be transformative for fault tolerance (i.e., if a portion of CPU is damaged, the functioning portion can be configured to do both tasks), and cybersecurity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, four Bio-MAPS assessments are being produced: molecular and cellular biology, physiology and neuroscience, ecology and evolution, and an overall comprehensive measure. The research team is working with biology faculty at diverse institutions that span the breadth of higher education to develop a framework that outlines expectations for what students should know and be able to do at different collegiate levels. <br/><br/>Data from Bio-MAPS are expected to provide dramatic broader impacts and catalyze curricular reform by: 1) diagnosing areas in which students struggle despite instruction, 2) allowing two-year community colleges to evaluate how well they are preparing students for transfer to four-year institutions, 3) inspiring and directing faculty and institutional conversations about enacting change at the programmatic level, 4) helping administrators focus limited resources on aspects of the curricula needing revision, and 5) challenging faculty to re-design courses to scaffold student learning. Biology departments can also use Bio-MAPS assessments to demonstrate evidence of student learning for accreditation processes.<br/><br/>Many agencies now require evidence of student learning and data on how well programs meet the needs of diverse student populations. This focus on tangible learning outcomes requires that institutions have a means of quantitatively measuring student progression through a curriculum. Bio-MAPS can provide a means of measuring student progress through a curriculum. Other science disciplines may be interested in developing similar assessments for their students.<br/><br/>This project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education."

The computer-automated analyses are able to predict human ratings of students' work on these topics and have demonstrated higher inter-rater reliability than a group of trained expert human graders. Constructed response assessments reveal more about student thinking and the persistence of misconceptions than do multiple-choice questions, but require more analysis on the part of the educator. In past work, items designed to identify important disciplinary constructs were created based on prior research. The items were then administered via online course management systems where students entered responses. Lexical and statistical analysis software was used to predict expert ratings of student responses. To date, the work has focused primarily in the fields of biology and chemistry in biological contexts. <br/><br/>The current project is leveraging the previous research on Automated Assessment of Constructed Response (AACR), and extending the work to other institutions and other STEM disciplines. The specific goals of this project are to: 1. Create a community web portal for the Automated Assessment of Constructed Response (AACR) assessments to expand and deepen collaborations among STEM education researchers, thus providing the infrastructure for expanding the community of researchers and supporting the adoption and implementation of the innovative instructional materials by instructors at other institutions. 2. Propagate the innovations by providing instructors with professional development and long-term, ongoing support to use the assessments. This includes information about common student conceptions revealed by the questions, instructional materials for addressing conceptual barriers, and the opportunity to join a community of practitioners who are using the AACR questions and exchanging materials. 3. Expand the basic research to create and validate AACR questions in introductory chemistry, chemical engineering, and statistics. 4. Engage in ongoing project evaluation for continuous quality improvement and to document the challenges and successes the project encounters. 5. Lay the foundation for sustainability by providing interfaces for e-text publishers, Learning Management System vendors, and Massively Open Online Courses as potential revenue streams to operate and maintain the online infrastructure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Improving STEM education requires valid and reliable instruments that provide insight into student thinking. The automated analysis of constructed response assessments have the potential to assess ""big ideas"" in STEM in a richer, more multi-faceted manner than multiple-choice instruments. This project is extending the number of these items and provide an online community where instructors may obtain, score, and contribute to the library of items and resources necessary for their analyses. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The web portal is extending the use of the products created in this project to instructors nationwide. In addition it is providing the foundation for a national collaboration of science and engineering educators interested in developing deeper conceptual assessment tools and supports and mentors postdoctoral research fellows, and graduate research assistants in STEM education research."

As these emerge, verification techniques are necessary to ensure confidence and reliability.  The primary objective of this project is to develop new ways of uncovering errors that occur in quantum systems, while using a minimum of assumptions about those systems. For example, in quantum communication involving quantum key sharing, it is important for the communications partners to be assured that they have successfully shared a secret key, when in fact they have not. The error detection scheme at the core of this project will let them detect this error, while making a minimum of assumptions about their apparatus. The experiments will advance the movement of quantum technologies from theoretical possibility to actual implementation. These experiments will be performed by undergraduate students, preparing them for scientific careers by exposing them to emerging fields of research and new technologies.<br/><br/>Two important operations performed in experiments characterizing quantum systems are (i) preparing systems in particular states and then (ii) performing measurements on those states. State preparation and measurement are usually independent, uncorrelated operations, and when analyzing data it is usually assumed that this is the case. However, if there are indeed correlations between the state preparations and the measurements, it is possible to draw erroneous conclusions from measured data. The primary objective of this project is to experimentally demonstrate a technique called loop state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) tomography, which is capable of detecting such correlated errors while making a minimum of assumptions. No assumptions need to be made about either the state preparation or the measurements, other than that the experimenter knows the Hilbert space dimension of the system they are working with. Experiments will be performed on one- and two-qubit systems, with the qubits encoded in the polarizations of individual photons. The group proposes to demonstrate that loop SPAM tomography is capable of detecting correlations between state preparations and measurements of single qubits. They also propose to detect nonlocal correlations between measurements of two qubits in which one party is attempting to fake a Bell inequality violation."

Currently, nearly two million people in the United States, and far more worldwide, suffer from significant speech production deficits as a result of severe neuromuscular impairments due to injury or disease. In extreme cases, individuals may be unable to speak at all. These individuals would greatly benefit from a device that could alleviate speech deficits and enable them to communicate more naturally and effectively. This project will explore aspects of decoding a user's intended speech directly from the electrical activity of the brain and converting it to synthesized speech that could be played through a loudspeaker in real-time to emulate natural speaking from thought. In particular, this project will uniquely focus on decoding continuous, spontaneous speech processes to achieve more natural and practical communication device for the severely disabled.<br/><br/>The complex dynamics of brain activity and the fundamental processing units of continuous speech production and perception are largely unknown, and such dynamics make it challenging to investigate these speech processes with traditional neuroimaging techniques. Electrocorticography (ECoG) measures electrical activity directly from the brain surface and covers an area large enough to provide insights about widespread networks for speech production and understanding, while simultaneously providing localized information for decoding nuanced aspects of the underlying speech processes. Thus, ECoG is instrumental and unparalleled for investigating the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of speech. The research team's prior work has shown for the first time the detailed spatiotemporal progression of brain activity during prompted continuous speech, and that the team's Brain-to-text system can model phonemes and decode words. However, in pursuit of the ultimate objective of developing a natural speech neuroprosthetic for the severely disabled, research must move beyond studying prompted and isolated aspects of speech. This project will extend the research team's prior experiments to investigate the neural processes of spontaneous and imagined speech production. In conjunction with in-depth analysis of the recorded neural signals, the researchers will apply customized ECoG-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques to facilitate the analysis of the large amount of phones occurring in continuous speech. Ultimately, the project aims to define fundamental units of continuous speech production and understanding, illustrate functional differences between these units, and demonstrate that representations of spontaneous speech can be synthesized directly from the neural recordings.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate ""affection, protection, and correction""  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.<br/><br/>The project, entitled the ""Black Family Racial Socialization Project"" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS ""in the moment"", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race ""in the future"". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families."

Determining the processes by which one species becomes two is crucial to understanding patterns of biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. Speciation, the process of new species formation, occurs when barriers to reproduction evolve between populations or groups. However, studying speciation for flowering plant species with multiple chromosome sets - a condition known as polyploidy - has proven difficult. Most flowering plants are polyploid, and groups with different chromosome numbers cannot easily interbreed, yet they are rarely recognized as different species. Reasons for this range from the physical similarity between plants with different chromosome numbers, to whether they have adapted to different environments. Although creosote bush with different chromosome complements inhabit ecologically distinct areas, they sometimes co-occur suggesting additional reproductive barriers are responsible for divergence. By combining DNA analyses, greenhouse experiments, and field investigations, this project will provide unprecedented insight into the early stages of speciation for groups of plants with different chromosome complements.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to bring polyploid species under the larger umbrella of speciation research by elucidating the biological significance of genome duplication to plant diversification. Polyploidy, especially autopolyploidy, where genome duplication occurs within a lineage rather than through hybridization, poses many challenges for evolutionary biologists, including understanding the relative importance of ecological and intrinsic genetic processes to diversification. Population-level analyses are critical for evaluating how plant-animal interactions and ecological adaptation influence divergence among ""intraspecific"" groups differing in chromosome complement, and whether diversification of polyploid species is similar to model diploid species. Moreover, this project, focused on the keystone plant species Larrea tridentata and its native pollinators in sensitive North American desert biomes, will help characterize the novel molecular diversity and ecological interactions comprising the cryptic biodiversity of polyploid species. The taxonomic recognition of populations differing in chromosome complement could significantly alter biodiversity estimates for certain parts of the world, especially temperate biomes, impacting our understanding of major ecological patterns."

In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.<br/><br/>A two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Development of paleoclimate records from in and near the core of the monsoon region enables an assessment of the strength of the paleo-monsoon signal across the region.<br/><br/>The researchers look to generate independent, yet co-located, records of past climate (speleothems) and vegetation (soil profiles) dynamics from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado (savanna), for which existing records are absent. Paleoclimate and ecological interpretations will be validated using cave monitoring and proxy system modeling.<br/><br/>The researchers intend to evaluate the following questions: i) Do speleothem delta 18-Oxygen values reflect variations in SASM intensity, ii) Do variations in SASM intensity drive corresponding variation in local moisture conditions, iii) What was the nature and driver of Late Holocene variability in SASM intensity and local moisture conditions, and iv) how sensitive were biomes in vegetative transition zones to variability in SASM intensity and local moisture conditions. <br/><br/>The project involves the monitoring of modern cave environments to evaluate speleothem delta 18-Oxygen values as a proxy of SASM intensity and speleothem trace element concentrations and Strontium isotope compositions as a proxy of local moisture conditions.  The research will extend existing speleothem delta 18-Oxygen records of the last millennium from the Amazon and Cerrado further back in time and develop corresponding records of speleothem trace element and 87- Strontium /86-Strontium and soil organic matter delta 13-Carbon to assess the co-variability between regional monsoon intensity, local moisture conditions, and biome shifts.<br/><br/>The project helps promote greater understanding of the SASM and strong collaboration with Brazilian scientists.  The SASM is the most important source of rainfall to the region with great socio-economic and environmental relevance, including defining current ecosystem distribution and stability, hydroelectric production, and agriculture."

In order to encourage female leaders, many companies leverage diversity training initiatives or women-centered solutions, such as women's networking groups or leadership training. While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations. This research highlights ways in which males can contribute to gender inclusivity at work. Results from this project can inform organizations about how to influence, train, and encourage possible male champions to actively support female leadership in the workplace. <br/><br/>Male champions, or male leaders who value diversity in the workplace and support advancing talented females to leader positions, have a critical role to play as agents of change to enhance gender equality. The purpose of this project is to identify the effective behaviors of male champions. Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes. Effects of top-level leaders' gender inclusive behaviors on their direct reports attitudes and performance will be examined using multi-source, multi-level data. Finally, we will conduct an in-depth case study of a best practices company for gender inclusive leadership. This study will utilize observational data and in-depth interviews with high level leaders and their direct reports to better understand the processes through which male champion behaviors create gender inclusive workplace cultures. Results of this research can benefit workers and their organizations by enhancing our understanding of factors contributing to gender equality in organizations."

The goal is to advance understanding about the role of open, volunteered spatial data to produce knowledge needed by public institutions responsible for provision of services to all citizens. Despite that crowdsourced maps contain important information for building resilient communities and infrastructure, rarely are volunteered spatial data integrated into official cartographies. Local and national public institutions may lack trust of data quality, adherence to standards, and completeness. The researchers will closely examine the concepts and practices of using crowdsourced data relative to official cartographies within a small but representative set of national cases characterized by a range of public access, technologies, and governance configurations, namely Mesoamerica and the US Borderlands. This region of interest leverages experience with participatory cross-border harmonization of official fundamental spatial datasets in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize, Mexico, and parts of neighboring Colombia and Texas. Findings will help expand the base of knowledge about evidence-based decision-making. The project will establish a foundation for building community across academic and government sectors interested in sharing and co-creating knowledge on specific applications, such as for hazards, development, and infrastructure services. The research team will provide theoretical insights within Science, Technology, and Society research as well as practical ideas to potentially harness the benefits of the data revolution for the public good.<br/><br/>The research aims are (a) to better understand the barriers and conditions for acceptance when and where crowdsourced spatial data is available to be officially used in Mesoamerica and the US Borderlands (blind spots); (b) to better understand the impact of crowdsourced data when incorporated into official data sources; and (c) to produce missing geospatial data on vulnerabilities by engaging volunteer student mappers and official cartographers through participatory research (blank spots). A mixed-method approach leverages the unique positions of the research team as appointed authorities, commission chairs, and members of the PanAmerican Institute for Geography and History, a specialized arm of the Organization of American States. The researchers will empirically develop knowledge about the needs, opportunities, obstacles, processes and practices of crowdsourcing geospatial data relative to official cartographies. The project will use focus groups, interviews, critical incident techniques, broadly distributed web-based surveys, temporal comparative analysis, and participatory feedback to develop peer-reviewed articles as well as publications of best practices for use by informants, academics, and decision makers, in both English and Spanish. The project will train and engage students in this research from Texas Tech, one of only a few Hispanic Serving, Carnegie R1 Research Institutions in the US. Students will improve their workforce readiness for high-demand geospatial technologies careers. A final symposia at the OAS in Washington DC will provide a forum for input to deliverables and for dissemination. Results will contribute insight on NSF's Big Ideas, Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st Century Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events cannot be felt, but are often detectable with GPS. Here the PI studies the effects of small, but relatively well-known, stress changes on slow slip earthquakes. The gravitational attraction of the Sun and Moon on the Earth stress and slightly deform the Earth and also raise water tides that flow and add to the changing stress. These small stress changes affect deep fault zones and modulate slow slip and tremor, which is recently-discovered weak seismic radiation associated with slow slip. The tidal stresses can be calculated, so one can assess the effect of small known stress changes on the generation of tremor, which is a marker for slow slip.  The results bear on how slow slip is enhanced and suppressed by tidal stressing, on levels of rock friction deep in subduction zones, and on how the fault interface weakens as slip accumulates during large slow slip earthquakes. This work provides the first such estimate of in-situ intrinsic friction deep in a plate boundary. Constraining the friction in deep subduction zones to a very low level, as preliminary results indicate, is potentially tranformative, and has implications for aspects of subduction zone science well beyond seismology, including petrology, slab stresses, and geodynamics.<br/><br/>Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) is a recently-discovered phenomenon in which weak seismic signals called tremor accompany slowly-propagating shear slip on a plate boundary interface in slow earthquakes, often with durations of several weeks. Deep on the Cascadia subduction zone under northern Washington, large M6.6 to 6.8 ETS events occur with unusual regularity for a seismic phenomenon, roughly every 14 months. The proposed approach utilizes the well-calibrated tidal stresses to probe the response of the region accommodating episodic slow deformation in the deep subduction zone. Analysis of tidal stresses at the time and location of 33,000 tremors from 6 ETS events reveals the strong influence of tidal stress, and particularly, that tremor sensitivity to tidal stress evolves, increasing over several days as slow slip accumulates at a given location. This increase in sensitivity implies progressive weakening of the fault. This work will extend the study of the influence of tidal stressing to 1) tremor that occurs between the major ETS events, 2) large ETS events all along Cascadia, and 3) ETS events in Japan. The PI will also determine preferred poroelastic models that provide the best correlation between tremor and tidal stresses. The goal is to better constrain friction and fault weakening and restrengthening on the plate boundary during the ETS cycle. The preliminary research has yielded the first clear finding of evolving tremor sensitivity to tidal stress over days of ETS slip at a given spot, likely due to progressive fault weakening.  These results constrain the timing and degree of fault weakening during ETS, while the proposed work will address the timing of restrengthening during the 14-month intervals between ETSs, as well as the relative behavior of tremor tidal sensitivity in different geologic and tectonic settings along the Cascadia subduction zone, and along the Nankai-Kii subduction zone. Additionally, the preliminary research has yielded the first in-situ estimate of intrinsic friction on the deep subduction interface, while the proposed work will deliver similar results for a wider sampling of locations and portions of the ETS seismic cycle. This approach has shown the potential to constrain key properties and processes in the deep subduction environment: intrinsic friction, fault weakening, and subsequent restrengthening. Furthermore, the possible effects of slow-slip-generated stress on the adjacent hazardous locked portions of subduction zones mandate better understanding of slow slip phenomena. For example, it appears that the recent devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake was preceded by slow slip.<br/>"
