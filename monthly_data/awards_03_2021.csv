This research asks: ?Why are some communities more vulnerable to diseases than others?"" To address this broad question, this work focuses on understanding how biodiversity influences community disease risk. While many studies find that communities with higher biodiversity have lower disease risk, some studies show no effect of biodiversity on disease risk and others even find the opposite effect (i.e. communities with higher biodiversity have higher disease risk). Overall, the idea that biodiversity can reduce disease risk is attractive because it suggests that protecting biodiversity has clear benefits to both nature and society. This research tests the central hypothesis that cryptic differences in population?s responses to past conditions (i.e. evolutionary history) plays an important role in understanding when biodiversity will reduce disease risk. This CAREER award will develop a summer research and outreach program that supports undergraduate artists, engineers, biologists, and educators and a 3rd grade citizen science training program.<br/><br/>The Biodiversity-Disease (BDD) Relationship has generated considerable attention as a theoretical framework for predicting community disease outcomes. Yet, limited consensus on the generality of the BDD relationship has been reached leading to repeated calls to uncover factors shaping the magnitude and direction of the BDD relationship. This research tests the hypothesis that intraspecific host variation, generated by divergent evolutionary histories, plays a cryptic role in shaping the direction and magnitude of the BDD relationship. To this end, the research focuses on amphibian host-parasite interactions and takes advantage of an experimentally tractable group of focal wood frog populations that exhibit intraspecific variation in parasite susceptibility as a result of evolving in contrasting environments. The researchers will first, evaluate the contribution of intraspecific variation to shaping the BDD relationship by generating mesocosm communities that vary in amphibian host species diversity and focal host intraspecific diversity. Second, to integrate ecological context into our understanding of how intraspecific variation influences the BDD relationship, the researchers will conduct lab and mesocosm studies testing whether intraspecific variation in focal hosts can shape the BDD relationship by modifying (a) competitive, (b) predator-prey, or (c) host microbiota interactions. Third, to complement the controlled experimental studies, the researchers will conduct a citizen-led field surveys to evaluate whether intraspecific variation modifies the BDD relationship in more complex natural ecosystems. Towards this aim, the researchers will develop a two-step integrated education-research program: (1) Content development: Researchers will design an interdisciplinary program where undergraduates work with local communication and education experts to develop a citizen training program. (2) Implementation: Citizens will complete training program and collect field data that contributes to the overarching research goals. Collectively, this integration will facilitate citizen data collection efforts, diversify STEM training and engagement, and broaden access to authentic research opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While population displacement is often characterized as contributing to tension in the host contexts to where these populations are displaced, less understood are the conditions that promote cooperation and solidarity, especially in circumstances of protracted displacement and shared residence. This dissertation research addresses these questions by investigating the role of communal water infrastructure, such as public water taps, water truck deliveries, and wells, in promoting cooperation, or instigating tension, between residents of various social, religious, and economic backgrounds. In addition to supporting the training of a doctoral student, the findings from this project will be shared with organizations, development practitioners, and policy experts.<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project examines the factors influencing access to water and the maintenance of communal water infrastructure. This project compares two localities: one marked by citizen-displaced population cooperation and solidarity, and another by continued tension. Both localities contain similar communal water infrastructures which serve as routine gathering sites for both citizen and refugee residents. This project therefore investigates how a shared dependence on infrastructure can enable cooperative relations. In addition to examining how residents' social worlds frame their encounters, this project explores how infrastructure breakdown, repair, and neglect reconfigure social relations. Ethnographic research methods are employed, including participant observation, interviews, and archival research among resident populations, as well as with non-governmental actors who oversee the infrastructure. This research contributes to contemporary social science and anthropology by better understanding the role of communal infrastructure in mediating and reconfiguring cooperative and conflictual social relations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is vital to ensure that different users of web applications are only allowed to access what they are supposed to, i.e., implementing correct authorization. But, unfortunately, broken access control and authorization has been constantly ranked as one of the top web application vulnerabilities. In fact, many web applications cannot provide an accurate specification of their enforced authorization policies due to challenges such as code complexity and fast-paced development. Neither end users nor even developers of the applications could reason about data protection in this environment. To address this problem, this research project devises a novel framework for learning fine-grained authorization policies from web applications without relying on access to their source codes or understanding other internal complexities. The project develops an integrated research and education program to train the next generation of cybersecurity workforce at the intersection of security/privacy, machine learning, and web technologies. Since web-based systems are pervasive in our society, the developed framework and associated solutions will significantly contribute to system safety and user privacy. Furthermore, due to their black-box design, the developed techniques will be critical assets to investigate data authorization practices of applications outside their development environments by application adopters (e.g., companies deploying outsourced applications) and third parties acting in the interest of end users (e.g., security/privacy researchers and regulators investigating compliance with privacy laws and expectations). The project engages a diverse body of students especially from underrepresented groups in security and privacy research and exposes the broad community to security and privacy topics through outreach activities.<br/><br/>This research project develops a novel paradigm for automated learning of web application authorization policies that significantly improves ensuring the security and privacy of web applications. A key characteristic of this research is to treat web applications as black boxes, i.e., learning authorizations by interacting with and observing them as would regular end users. The black-box approach allows abstracting away internal complexities of web applications and focusing instead on what matters: learning what policies are enforced on users as they access application data. The research is carried out in three thrusts. First, a theoretical policy learning framework will be devised for efficiently probing the authorization space of applications as black boxes and constructing formal specifications of their policies. Second, a methodology and associated techniques for learning representation of data objects, relationships, and operations from black-box web applications will be developed in order to realize practical deployment of the theoretical framework in the web domain. Third, the project will develop techniques for analysis and integration of the learned authorization policies to improve the security and privacy of web applications. This paradigm will be transformative for web security/privacy research and practice by providing researchers, developers, and analysts an automated approach to learn the specifications of authorization policies. In addition to enabling them to understand the authorization behavior of web applications, it will revitalize research in formal policy testing and verification techniques that rely on concrete policy specifications. Furthermore, the general framework will be applicable beyond web applications to other domains such as mobile app ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project?s scientists are interested in changes in ocean chemistry and global climate 94 million years ago when the atmosphere had up to 5 times more carbon dioxide than Earth?s present atmosphere, and the concentrations varied dramatically. The researchers are measuring isotopes of strontium, calcium, magnesium, and iron in rocks from the Eagle Ford Group in Texas that formed from an ancient seabed. The results are leading to a better understanding of the factors that led to and sustained that period of global warming, and they are revealing implications for present-day climate change. This research is aiding the career development of a Ph.D. student from an underrepresented group and an early career female scientist. A museum exhibit on climate and energy is being created to outreach to the public about this work.<br/><br/>The Late Cretaceous Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) was a sustained period of high atmospheric carbon dioxide and consequent warming of the global climate. How global warming is related to volcanic activity, and the cascading effects on continental weathering and global ocean chemistry, remain open questions. A complete stratigraphic section through OAE2 from the Eagle Ford Group in Texas is being examined for Sr, Ca, Mg, and Fe isotopes.  Each of these element systems record distinct chemical information on the global ocean environment and on changing climate.  Numerical mass balance models based on the isotope data are being employed to constrain the inputs and outputs to the global ocean and the feedback between volcanic activity and continental weathering. Results are providing a framework for further examination of the causes of ocean anoxia and substantial climate change in the geological past, and are allowing a better understanding of the factors contributing to future climate change. Broader impacts of this project include mentoring and training students from underrepresented groups and public outreach about the links between climate and energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing has gained wide attention in recent years because it can be used to produce geometrically and compositionally complex parts, as well as provide on-demand production and repair capability. Its potential to manufacture true load-bearing parts, however, is not yet fully realized due to several issues. In particular, the complexity of the resultant microstructural features makes it difficult to distinguish their respective effects on fracture and fatigue performance. This project will answer two relevant question with focus on corrosive environments: 1) How does the fatigue behavior of additively processed alloys differ from that of their conventional counterparts under normal and corrosive environments, respectively? and 2) How does the microstructure contribute to the observed differences in behavior? Insights gained from the award will guide the design and manufacture of additively manufactured parts and prolong their service life by limiting the causes of fatigue failure in corrosive environments. Thus, the research will not only promote the progress of science but will also advance national prosperity and welfare by reducing the tremendous financial losses related to corrosion damage. In addition, this award will encourage women in engineering by launching a ?Women in Flight? club and perform outreach to high school science teachers and students through creative audiovisual learning modules.<br/><br/>The unique microstructure formed in additively manufactured metals merit critical investigation into its effect on environmentally-assisted fatigue behavior. This project will employ a combined computational and experimental approach to: 1) evaluate the macroscopic fatigue properties of conventional and additively manufactured alloys in air and corrosive environment using high-cycle fatigue testing; 2) elucidate effects of microscopic features and defects on the local passivity and corrosion properties using electrochemical microcell and adaptive Kinetic Monte Carlo modeling techniques, and 3) reveal the mechanism and the influence of individual microstructure features and their interaction by developing a microstructure-sensitive multiphysics computational framework based on phase field and crystal plasticity modeling. The features that will be considered are sub-grain dislocation networks, solidification texture, porosity, and chemical heterogeneity, as well as residual stress. It is expected that he experimentally-validated modeling framework will introduce a new capability to advance the mechanistic understanding of deformation and failure of additively manufactured alloys in corrosive environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manashi Nath (PI) and Julia Medvedeva (co-PI) from Missouri University of Science & Technology are designing new catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to value-added chemicals and fuels. The project aims to design efficient electrocatalyst compositions by combining an experimental- and computational-based approach that enhance CO2 reduction on the catalyst surface. The project is further developing design principles for such catalysts derived from readily available and abundant metals. This multidisciplinary project involves undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers collaborating on approaches involving chemistry, electrochemistry, physics, and surface science for the discovery of new catalyst compositions. Knowledge generated from this project, falling under the broader scope of clean energy, will be disseminated to the scientific community at all levels employing various mechanisms including conference presentations, public seminars, peer-reviewed publications, and outreach activities. Specifically, demonstration experiments and workshops will be designed for local high school and middle school students by collaborating with a local STEM club, Kaleidoscope, which organizes after-school STEM activities. Public awareness of carbon dioxide capture and conversion will be accomplished through outreach activities at the St. Louis Science Center, through Minority Introduction to Engineering (MITE) camps run by Missouri S&T, and through workshops organized during the summer for local high school teachers. These activities will include live demonstrations of an active CO2 electroreduction cell made by employing catalysts developed in this research project.<br/><br/>With the support of Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Manashi Nath (PI) and Dr. Julia Medvedeva (co-PI) from Missouri University of Science & Technology are studying designing efficient catalyst composition for electroreduction of carbon dioxide to carbon-rich reduction products comprising fuels and other value-added chemicals. The PIs propose that CO2 reduction to longer carbon chain products is a delicate interplay between chemical potential at the catalytically active transition metal site and intermediate CO (carbon monoxide) adsorption energetics on the catalyst surface. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that high d-electron occupancy with less than a fully filled configuration of the transition metal center along with greater covalency of the metal ligand bond will lead to more selectivity for C2 reduction products at lower applied potential. Specifically, it is proposed that increasing dwell time of the intermediate CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface will lead to further subsequent reduction of CO to carbon-rich products. The PIs aim to increase dwell time of the CO intermediate on catalyst surface by controlling the d-electron density on the transition metal site that has a direct effect on the metal-to-ligand back bonding which can tune the CO adsorption energy to be within a specific range (between weak and strong adsorption regimes). This hypothesis will be tested by synthesizing binary, ternary, and quaternary transition metal chalcogenides (selenides and tellurides) comprising Cu, Ni, Fe, Mn, and V, following systematic combinatorial electrodeposition. Experimental studies will be complemented with DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations where CO and CO2 adsorption kinetics will be estimated on different catalytic surfaces and correlated with their performance. Specific tasks of this project include: (i) changing the anions across the chalcogenide series and investigating catalytic activity as a function of electronegativity; (ii) aliovalent substitution at the transition metal site which will lead to redistribution of the d-electron cloud increasing redox tunability of the transition metal center as well as facilitate multielectron transfer; (iii) nanostructuring the functional catalysts to increase the active surface area. Major deliverable of this project will be non-precious-metal-based CO2 electroreduction catalysts that can produce higher hydrocarbon-based fuels with lesser expense of electrical energy. Fundamental insights gained from this comprehensive study have the potential to illuminate design principles used to design more efficient catalysts for carbon capture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High levels of nitrates in drinking water are often attributed to poor nutrient management practices on farms, where fertilizers leach into regional water supplies. Agricultural scientists have widely investigated soil management practices that can reduce nitrate pollution; however, effective practices remain underutilized among farmers. This project, which supports the training of a graduate student in anthropological methods, uses theoretical insights from economic anthropology to investigate the factors that affect farmers? amenability to various soil management practices and implications for nitrate losses to freshwater resources. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation research focuses on farmers? soil management practices among rural residential communities exposed to nitrates in drinking water. Specifically, it asks: how are agricultural soils managed when the people applying fertilizers are also those most exposed to nitrate-contaminated drinking water? To answer this question, the researcher will interview and work alongside farmers, shadow farmer assistance providers, and observe public meetings related to regional water quality.

This research addresses this gap by examining how relationships between mining industry experts and rural residents take shape around speculative projects during periods of market collapse. Throughout North America, new corporate outreach strategies and environmental risk assessment regulations have caused mining companies to engage with rural communities ever further in advance of actual mining activity. This research examines the social consequences of these shifts in the context of a recent ?boom? and subsequent ?bust? affecting several towns and Indigenous reservations. In 2011, a spectacular rise and fall in global market prices for rare earth elements drew half a dozen small companies to the region to conduct geological analysis and local promotion campaigns. While none of the prospects identified became producing mines, exploration experts have continued to visit the region to encourage residents to sustain their hopes that new mines will eventually be constructed. This research will generate new insights into how residents of rural communities come to participate in globalizing knowledge economies by examining how local conversations about mineral exploration, venture finance, and regional economic uncertainty increasingly highlight the individual agency and mobility.<br/><br/>This project contributes to analyses of the roles that experts and expert knowledge play in shaping contemporary rural life by examining how resident-expert relationships take shape around promised projects that may never be realized. The project addresses two main questions: (1) How do new forms of financial and other technical information shape how rural residents understand the ?failure? of exploratory projects and their potential for future renewal? (2) How have venture capitalism and the financialization of resource development planning altered conversations about regional futures and economic life? Data come from interviews and observations of everyday life during prolonged lulls in exploration activity. Analysis will focus on how references to exploratory projects emerge in residents? encounters with political leaders, geologists, and financial experts as each group speculates about delays and discusses other potential futures for regional landscapes. Building on ethnographic engagements with Indigenous corporations and governance groups working to re-shape resource economies, the project also examines how Indigenous groups with diverse political and economic ambitions are working to frame these deferrals alongside longstanding sovereignty goals and other collective prerogatives. Overall, the project explains how venture market-focused regulatory processes have changed the ways experts active in rural areas understand the ethical demands of their work, and how these processes affect residents? sense of their own futures amid profound economic and ecological changes.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Science and Technology Studies and Cultural Anthroplogy in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate participants in this program will conduct novel research under the guidance of an experienced faculty mentor at UNC-Chapel Hill, NC State University, or Duke University. A heavy emphasis during recruiting will be placed on students who have limited opportunities to pursue research at their home institutions. In addition to the in-lab research experience, student activities include synchronous and asynchronous instruction in hybrid perovskites and nanoscopic characterization techniques, professional development and enrichment activities, networking and social activities, and experience with oral and written communication of their research. Each REU participant will be also paired with another participant working in a similar area at a different institution in the REU site collaboration. This integrated program will enhance inter-institutional collaboration, advance research projects, and provide an impactful research experience for REU participants.<br/><br/>There are three objectives for this REU program: (1) To provide a hands-on research experience in hybrid perovskite materials that reinforces student knowledge of cutting-edge characterization techniques and analytical tools that can be used to evaluate the nanoscopic structure of hybrid perovskite systems; (2) to foster student interest in pursuing a career in STEM fields; and (3) to develop communication and networking skills in each of the participants. Student participants will gain exposure to and experience with state-of-the-art synthesis, modeling and characterization tools as applied to a contemporary research topic on hybrid organic-inorganic materials. Students will gain new perspectives on engineered hybrid material systems and will directly apply this knowledge to the improvement of system designs and/or the investigation of novel properties and applications.

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. The aim of this project is to make STEM and higher education more accessible to and inclusive of American Indian/Alaska Native students through a research experience that relates directly to a topic of particular interest to American Indian/Alaska Native communities ? the revitalization and scientific study of Native languages. American Indian/Alaska Native students are greatly underrepresented in academia and this situation has remained virtually unchanged for decades. A growing body of research points to the importance and need for higher education to increase its cultural competency as a critical strategy for becoming accessible to underrepresented groups, such as American Indian/Alaska Native students. Conversely, academia cannot achieve excellence without perspectives from a diversity of backgrounds to inform and improve it. Thus, the broader impact of this REU site is manifold: It uses a culturally informed and competent approach to introduce American Indian/Alaska Native students to linguistics and the various research disciplines with which linguistics intersects; in doing so it contributes towards an increase in participation of American Indian/Alaska Native students in higher education and research; and as a result, this project contributes towards strengthening academia broadly through a diversification of perspectives.<br/> <br/>Through the REU site, participants complete research rotations in multiple areas of linguistics, specifically focusing on experimental linguistics and language documentation and revitalization. The program embraces a usage-based study of language within a community-centered cross-disciplinary approach, which is relatively novel in undergraduate linguistic training. REU participants are exposed to the full range of skills necessary to conduct research in linguistics. These research rotations are supplemented with coursework in topics on descriptive and experimental linguistics and academic and professional development workshops. The workshops focus on providing participants with skills to initiate careers in STEM, as well as pursuing master's and  Ph.D. degrees in linguistics or related fields. The fundamental goal of this work is to help students become active agents of innovation in STEM through linguistics, seeking to break down disciplinary silos and reprioritize the societal value of science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such ?machine-in-the-loop? writing assistants are potentially transformative technologies for improving the writing quality and productivity of human authors, as well as providing new tools for writing pedagogy through cyberlearning applications. However, they have been relatively underexplored by the natural language processing community due to major difficulties in modeling, evaluation, and data collection. The technologies developed in this project address these challenges by (1) developing platforms that leverage existing online author communities to enable the design and evaluation of machine-in-the-loop writing assistants; (2) advancing text generation modeling to improve the quality of generated text; and (3) enabling assistants to rewrite and reorganize human-authored text through developments in automatic paraphrasing. In addition to aiding authors in online communities, the writing assistants developed through the project are deployed in K-12 classrooms to advance writing pedagogy. The project incorporates undergraduate students, including those outside of computer science, in natural language processing research, and provides significant outreach to underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>To make meaningful progress on the development of machine-in-the-loop writing assistants, the project includes a collaboration with Protagonist Labs, which runs online platforms for collaborative storytelling in both creative and pedagogical settings and already has incorporated systems built by the investigator?s team into user-facing interfaces. User interaction on such platforms allows fine-grained evaluation of novel text generation methods, which include neural language models that integrate context compression, context retrieval, and discrete latent variables into the generation process to improve overall coherence and relevance. In addition to producing new text, fully-featured writing assistants must also be able to rewrite user text into a specified form, such as a target writing style or suitability for a target audience. To this end, the project introduces new paraphrase generation models at a variety of units of text, including phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. This research effort aims to spur research into interactive text generation systems, and as such its outputs will include publicly-released pretrained models and open-sourced code.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, students at local primarily undergraduate institutions and community colleges will be connected with PhD students and postdoctoral research associates from regional research-intensive universities for ?near-peer? mentoring through a regular Life Sciences Symposium hosted at Western Washington University. The importance of scientific communication in society will be integrated into an upper-level Honors ?Bioethics of Emergent Technology in Biomedical Research? elective course to be offered at the host institution. <br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that the selectivity and/or activity of catalytic and noncatalytic domains of critical signaling or regulatory proteins are determined by conserved structural loops. The studies will characterize structurally-conserved loops in bacterial sortases, two of which are known to affect specificity, along with site-specific contributions of previously identified specificity-determining loops in SH2 and SH3 domains of the human Src oncogene protein that mediate protein-protein interactions. Natural sequence variation will be applied to design chimeric proteins and other loop variants. The structure-function relationship of these loops with respect to encoding target specificity will be determined using FRET(Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based activity assays, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, biochemical and computational methods, including the structure prediction program ROSETTA, will be used to trace the evolutionary roots that lead to target specificity of conserved loop sequences. This project will identify common principles that broaden the understanding of the relationship between sequence and specificity in structurally-conserved loops across several protein families.

While some professional development programs show meaningful changes in teacher knowledge, these changes do not always translate into changes in teacher practice. This project explores the mechanisms by which teachers translate what they learn from professional development into their teaching practice. The goal of this project is to study how the knowledge and skills teachers acquire during professional development (PD) translate into more conceptually oriented mathematics teaching and, in turn, into increased student learning. The project builds on a promising video-based PD that engages teachers in analyzing videos of classroom mathematics teaching. Previous research indicates that teachers who can analyze teaching by focusing on the nature of the mathematical learning opportunities experienced by students often teach more effectively. The researchers aim to better understand the path teachers follow as they develop this professional competency and translate it into more ambitious teaching that supports richer student learning. The lack of understanding of how a PD program can reach students is a significant barrier to improving the effectiveness of PD. To build this understanding, the researchers aim to test and refine an implementation theory that specifies the obstacles teachers face as they apply their learning to their classroom teaching and the contextual supports that help teachers surmount these obstacles. Lessons learned from understanding the factors that impact the effects of PD will help educators design PD programs that maximize the translation of teacher learning into student learning. <br/><br/>The project will recruit and support a cohort of teachers, grades 4?5 (n=40) and grades 6?7 (n=40) for three years to trace growth in teacher learning, changes in teaching practices, and increases in student learning. The PD will be provided throughout the year for three consecutive years. The researchers will focus on two mathematics topics with a third topic assessed to measure transfer effects. Several cycles of lesson analysis will occur each year, with small grade-alike curriculum-alike groups assisted by trained coaches to help teachers translate their growing analysis skills into planning, implementing, and reflecting on their own lessons. Additional days will be allocated each year to assist the larger groups of teachers in developing pedagogical content knowledge for analyzing teaching. The research focuses on the following questions: 1) What are the relationships between teacher learning from PD, classroom teaching, and student learning, how do hypothesized mediating variables affect these relationships, and how do these relationships change as teachers become more competent at analyzing teaching?; and 2) How do teachers describe the obstacles and supports they believe affect their learning and teaching, and how do these obstacles and supports deepen and broaden the implementation theory? Multi-level modeling will be used to address the first question, taking into account for the nested nature of the data, in order to test a model that hypothesizes direct and indirect relationships between teacher learning and teaching practice and, in turn, teaching practice and student learning. Teachers will take assessments each year, for each mathematics topic, on the analysis of teaching skills, on the use of teaching practices, and on students? learning. Cluster analysis will be used to explore the extent to which the relationship between learning to analyze the mathematics of a lesson, teaching quality, and student achievement may be different for different teachers based on measured characteristics. Longitudinal analysis will be used to examine the theoretical relationships among variables in the hypothesized path model. Teachers? mathematical knowledge for teaching, lesson planning, and textbook curricular material use will be examined as possible mediating variables between teacher learning and teaching practice. To address the second research question, participants will engage in annual interviews about the factors they are obstacles to doing this work and about the supports within and outside of the PD that ameliorate these obstacles. Quantitative analyses will test the relationships between the obstacles and supports with teacher learning and classroom teaching. Through qualitative analyses, the obstacles and supports to translating professional learning into practice will be further articulated. These obstacles and supports, along with the professional development model, will be disseminated to the field. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

The globule-leucine zipper-elastin like polypeptide (GLE) fusion protein complexes to be studied serve as basic building blocks to make globular protein vesicles (GPVs). The biophysical properties of protein building blocks will be engineered to control the self-assembly and function of GPVs. This project combines vesicle assembly of diverse GLE proteins, with precise control over vesicle mechanical and structural properties, and de novo protein synthesis inside GPVs to mimic essential cellular functions including self-growth and cascade reactions. The specific objectives are to 1) elucidate the physicochemical role of globular proteins in vesicle self-assembly, 2) understand the structure-property-performance relationships of GPVs to engineer basic cellular membrane functions such as deformability and fusion dynamics, and 3) functionalize GPVs through cell-free protein synthesis and enzymatic cascade reactions towards an autonomous synthetic cell.

Biological wastes are rich resources that contain a range of nutrients as well as water. Many of the molecules found in bio-waste can be transformed into products of value to society ? fertilizers, protein, energy, clean water, medicine, and advanced biomaterials. This project promotes scientific progress and advances the health, prosperity, and welfare of the nation, consistent with the NSF?s mission. It does this by engaging cohorts of budding researchers into research projects aimed at converting biological waste materials back into products of value. At the same time, it trains student participants on how to conduct research and, of equal importance, how to communicate that work to the broader community. Participant students will be recruited from populations that are underrepresented in technical fields, as well as populations who currently lack access to research opportunities. The outcome will be a better-trained, diverse scientific workforce, which will help deliver solutions that benefit both people and the environment.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to establish a new REU site that integrates undergraduate students in team-based research projects focused on converting biological wastes into products of value. The proposed REU site will provide a 10-week summer research experience for ten students each year, over a 3 year period. REU students will be paired with faculty teams working in four different areas: 1) use of fish waste for sustainable aquaponics vegetable production, 2) upgrading wastewater nutrients into zooplankton fish feed, 3) transforming cellulose into sensors for infectious disease detection, and 4) conversion of lignin into adhesives and carbon fiber. As the most abundant biopolymers on Earth, cellulose and lignin are widely available in a range of waste biomass resources. REU student participants will not only gain research experience through this project, they will also receive training on teamwork and communication best practices through a suite of professional development opportunities.

One significant natural source of VOCs is from plants yet understanding how respective soils contribute to VOC emissions remains elusive. The overarching research goal of this study is to unearth microbial processes of VOC cycling below ground that describe how a changing climate may affect VOC emissions. Interdisciplinary expertise in atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem science is secured through collaborations, and necessary infrastructure is available at the University of Arizona to carry out essential field and laboratory studies. This plan provides opportunities for students to learn and engage in research and education across disciplinary boundaries and anticipates to directly impact ~100 students over the five-year project. This project was co-reviewed and co-funded by the Atmospheric Chemistry (ATC) Program in the Division of Atmosphere and Geospace Sciences and the Ecosystem Science (ES) Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/>Research objectives focus on identifying, separating, and constraining VOC metabolism in soil, and specifically: (1) identifying and collating microbial and root pathways that drive VOC metabolism in soil; (2) separating belowground root-microbe interactions governing VOC cycling in soil; and (3) constraining belowground VOC cycling from gene to ecosystem scales. New measurements of VOC production and consumption by microbial isolates are performed in controlled experiments in laboratory soil columns and at field scale in Biosphere 2. VOC metabolic pathways from diverse data streams are gathered in a new Microbial Volatilome Database. To distinguish root-derived contributions to net soil VOC exchange 13C stable isotope pulse labeling is implemented with online 13CVOC measurements. Finally, new soil surface and subsurface VOC data is collected in a controlled ecosystem drought experiment to advance soil VOC process models and scale belowground VOC cycling from genes to the ecosystem. Results will aid in understanding belowground drivers of VOC biosphere-atmosphere exchange that will improve projections of atmospheric impacts and biological feedbacks of VOCs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They include many staple crops such as wheat, corn, and rice, and are defining features of an entire biome. Thus, the responses of grasses to global change will strongly impact human well-being. At the same time, plants can strongly influence the rates of global change through feedback loops. For this reason, accurately forecasting climate requires understanding these feedbacks. However, these feedbacks are currently one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate models. Physical and chemical characteristics of species, called functional traits, play a central role in predicting both how plants will respond to and influence global change. Classic ecological theory makes predictions regarding how functional traits should relate to climate and other environmental features. This project will test and extend these predictions and perform strong assessments of the predictability of trait-environment relationships. This work will use a combination of long-term monitoring, regional surveys, and analysis of global databases. The results will improve our understanding of plant responses to global change, illuminate the limits of predictability, and produce valuable data that can be used to refine global climate predictions. The project integrates educational opportunities at multiple levels, including field research experience for advanced undergraduates and data science modules developed with and deployed by local high school teachers.<br/><br/>The research includes four component projects that range from intensive local studies to global macroecological analyses. The first will test predictions for the influence of precipitation on functional traits across space and through time, and within and among species, by building a ten-year record of grass traits in sites across the San Francisco Bay Area. In project two, the researchers will sample sites across the Western states that differ in precipitation and rate of atmospheric nitrogen deposition to examine their interacting effects on leaf chemistry. Project three will develop an allometry-based model of resource allocation that can predict grass trait variation along environmental gradients and test these predictions with new data collected by collaborators on five continents. Finally, project four will examine broad-scale within-species variation in grass traits, using machine learning tools and high-resolution range maps for more than 1000 grass species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turbulent flows, coherent structures are closely related to a diverse range of physical phenomena, and understanding their behavior is crucial for characterizing, predicting and controlling these flows. However, reliable identification and characterization of coherent structures is challenging due to their diversity and complex inter-relations across different space- and time-scales. This project brings together experts from both the data visualization and fluid mechanics communities to investigate novel solutions to multi-scale coherent structure extraction, separation, tracking, and visualization. It aims at significantly advancing the ability to analyze large datasets of turbulent flows stemming from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations in a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. This project provides opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students with different and diverse backgrounds to participate in the proposed research. The research outcomes can be integrated into the development of a number of undergraduate and graduate courses taught at the University of Houston. The outreach activities enabled by the proposed research help motivate more students to pursue a career in STEM related fields. <br/> <br/>To achieve an efficient and reliable analysis for large-scale turbulent flow data, this project aims to investigate a new multi-scale coherent structure representation that encodes relevant flow physics, statistics, and uncertainty information, and to develop a robust computation and exploration framework based on this new representation to support data-driven research. To enable this multi-scale analysis, this project applies a number of spatial and temporal domain decomposition strategies to the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) data. Multi-field analysis and high-dimensional data projection techniques are adapted to incorporate different physical attributes to the representation. A novel graph representation is leveraged to encode this multifaceted information in a concise and dimension-independent form to enable multi-scale feature extraction and tracking. A matrix representation of this graph is employed to accelerate its processing by utilizing the recent advances in large-scale matrix calculation. A new visual analytic paradigm is devised based on the proposed graph representation to aid the exploration and comprehension of different turbulence structures individually or collectively. The developed techniques implemented as a number of software libraries can be integrated into existing software, e.g., Paraview, for domain scientists to use in their daily research. The developed techniques can also be used as pre-processing toolboxes to quantify and extract coherent structures, which can then be visualized by existing software that are not suitable for direct library integration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a single data point in a database used for drug design might have tens of thousands of internal degrees of freedom, and such a database may have tens of thousands of such data points. This feature of structural complexity is a major challenge to deep learning methods.  Moreover, diverse data typically originate from sparse sampling of a huge space, and this sparsity is due, in particular, to the cost and time constraints in experimental data acquisition.  This project will address the challenges of complex and diverse datasets with ideas that blend and integrate mathematical techniques from several subfields including algebraic topology, spectral graph theory and multiscale analysis. The methods developed will apply to data representation, advanced machine learning methods, and deep learning algorithms, and will be implemented into software packages available to the community. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students and engage underrepresented groups in data science research.<br/> <br/>This project will develop novel topology and graph theory-based approaches to revolutionize the current practice in data analysis and to deal with the challenge of structurally complex data and diverse data. First, the investigators will develop persistent combinatorial graph theory as a unified paradigm for simultaneous topological data analysis and spectral data analysis.  In particular, they  will develop systematic, scalable, accurate persistent combinatorial graph representations to extract rich topological and spectral information. Secondly,  the investigators will develop multiscale graph models to create a family of nested submanifolds to handle the diverse data originated from sparsely sampled data points in a huge space. These methods will be integrated with advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms for complex and diverse datasets.

Investigating the variation of their relationship will deepen our understanding of teleconnections, air-sea interactions, and climate feedbacks. The paleoclimate data will serve as a testbed for the verification of current theories of the ASM thereby refining dynamical understanding.<br/><br/>The ASM supplies freshwater resources for nearly four billion people annually. Extreme events associated with the ASM cause and/or exacerbate floods and droughts, which have far-reaching social and economic impacts in developing countries.  Large model uncertainties, however, still exist in the model projections of the ASM.  The El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important predictor of the ASM, yet the ENSO-monsoon relationship is not stable and exhibits substantial decadal variability.  The variation of the ENSO-monsoon relationship is likely modulated by external forcing such as greenhouse gases (GHGs) and solar irradiance but also heavily modulated by internal modes of climate variability such as the PDO and the AMO. Paleoclimate records can extend the temporal coverage afforded by the instrumental era and help address such uncertainty.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include integrating climate dynamics and modeling to refine projections of the ASM and its hydroclimate extremes, which impact the economic prosperity of nearly 4 billion people in Asian developing countries.

While today?s legged robot systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in traversing stationary surfaces (e.g., stairs, sand, and grass), legged locomotion on DRS (e.g., ships, aircraft, and trains) is a new robot functionality that has not been addressed. This new functionality will empower legged robots to negotiate complex, dynamic human environments (that are prohibitively challenging for wheeled or tracked robots) to allow them to aid in numerous critical high-risk applications, such as shipboard firefighting and fire suppression and cleaning/disinfection of public transportation vehicles to contain the spread of infectious diseases. Enabling such functionality demands reliable robot estimation and control, which are substantially challenging due to the high complexity of the associated robot behaviors that are hybrid (involving continuous leg-swinging motions and discrete foot-landing events) and subject to the time-varying DRS movement. The CAREER research program seeks to solve these fundamental problems and lay a foundation for the development of next-generation legged robot systems capable of autonomous navigation on nonstationary surfaces. The CAREER education program will enhance the robotics curriculum at the University of Massachusetts Lowell while engaging diverse groups, including underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, K-12 students, and the general public, in robotics education and research.<br/><br/>The research goal of the project is to draw upon dynamic modeling, state estimation, feedback control, and theory of hybrid systems to advance the control theory of legged robots in order to realize provably stable legged locomotion on a DRS. To achieve the research goal, four main objectives will be pursued: (i) formulation of a physics-based model that captures the hybrid, time-varying robot dynamics associated with legged locomotion on a DRS; (ii) creation of new methods of designing state estimators that achieve real-time state estimation with convergence guarantees by provably expanding an invariant filtering methodology from continuous systems to hybrid dynamical systems that include legged robots moving on a DRS; (iii) derivation of a Lyapunov-based controller design methodology to produce stable locomotion on a DRS by handling the hybrid, time-varying robot dynamics under uncertainties that reside in both continuous phases and discrete events; and (iv) integration of the modeling, state estimation, and controller design into a model-based framework that provably sustains legged locomotion on a DRS. The project will support the PI to solve major robotics challenges beyond the capabilities of the state of the art, and help establish a long-term career in robotics and control.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term practical objective is to develop halogen bonding nanoparticle-based explosive sensing tools that are fast, operable by non-experts, field portable and deployable by law enforcement and the military.  On the fundamental side, the project advances knowledge and fundamental understanding of structure-dependent halogen bond interactions and adapts this knowledge to the design of nanomaterials that serve a functional role within sensing schemes.  The project engages undergraduate students in fundamentally-sound, multidisciplinary, practical outcome-oriented research.   In addition to an immersive laboratory experience, undergraduate students will assist in the development of curriculum-based undergraduate research material and will actively participate in community educational and outreach programs aimed at inspiring and retaining interest in STEM fields at local under-resourced K-12 schools. <br/><br/>This project focuses on structure-optimized halogen bonding (XB) as a fundamental intermolecular interaction between strategically-designed XB selector molecules coupled to gold nanoparticles (NPs) and the targeted explosive molecules.  Promotion of strong XB interactions between these functionalized NPs and non-aromatic explosives should lead to analytical signaling, spectroscopic or electrochemical, that indicates the presence of targeted molecules.  To accomplish this overarching goal, there are a number of specific objectives including: (1) the use of 19F and 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) titration measurements to identify specific halogenated chemical structure and experimental conditions for the strongest X-B interactions with explosives and/or explosive-related molecules; (2) synthesis of thiol-terminated ligands with optimized X-B promoting chemical structure; (3) exploration of the surface structure/chemistry of monolayer protected nanoclusters (MPCs) to effectively functionalize their peripheral layer with X-B selector ligands via place-exchange reactions monitored with NMR measurements; (4) the use of sophisticated 2-D NMR, NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement Spectroscopy) and HOESY (Heteronuclear Overhauser Enhancement Spectroscopy) methods, to characterize X-B interactions between functionalized MPCs and explosive/explosive-related target molecules; (5) exploration of X-B induced solution aggregation of selector-modified MPCs in the presence of explosive molecules; (6) demonstration of X-B selector functionalized MPCs within assembled films as an interface for detecting explosives and/or explosive-related molecules in chemical vapor via electrochemical measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas most such interfaces require embedded rigid electronic components, in contrast the inherent structural and other properties of interactive morphing materials drive their sensing and actuation capabilities, from overall shape change to the dynamic tuning of characteristics such as stiffness, opacity, and phase.  Because their properties are intrinsic, many of these materials can be fabricated as thin sheets or films in support of applications such as medical and wearable devices that require conformability and compliance.  Imagine a morphing cast, for example, that could self-assemble by wrapping around the arm.  The initial pattern of holes on the sheet to ensure conformability during the self-wrapping would subsequently seal via self-growth and self-stiffening of the cast. During the healing process, as the arm swells and shrinks, the cast would sense those changes and self-tighten or self-loosen as required; it might also self-degrade gradually to become lighter and more flexible as healing progresses. This project will lay the foundation for a future where physical materials become interfaces that sense and respond dynamically in support of a fundamental transformation in computational interaction modalities.  Since morphing materials can be applied to many aspects of human endeavor, research outcomes will provide broad benefits to society in a wide range of areas including accessibility, learning, future workforce development and sustainable manufacturing. <br/><br/>The research team will take a multifaceted approach and tightly couple the research with courses and independent studies in order to generate a range of prototypes using interactive morphing materials, a framework of design principles, a library of morphing mechanisms, a design tool that facilitates the creation of interfaces leveraging morphing materials, and a formal design study to validate the effectiveness of a morphing material interface.  The project will start by clustering examples of existing and potential interactive morphing material scenarios in participatory design sessions with domain experts, design students, and design professionals to learn what they can imagine creating and figure out how their ideas can be mapped to critical design parameters, including behavior (both temporal and geometrical), input and output modalities (e.g., light-responsive self-stiffening), and functionality. Prototypes based on these ideas will be implemented, and by conducting user studies (including semi-structured interviews and pre- and post-questionnaires), a general evaluation plan and metrics for validating performance both qualitatively and quantitatively will be formulated.  This will be followed by development of toolkits incorporating a library of morphing mechanisms presented as components for interface design.  These mechanisms will be of two basic types: those that convert physical, analog stimulus (such as wetness or temperature) into morphing output, and those that can be activated with a digital signal.  In addition to mechanism development, computational tools based on geometrical principles that can be generalized across different physical morphing principles will be created.  A fast and accurate simulator enabled by the integration of machine learning and finite element analysis will be leveraged to derive the geometrical principles of the underlying computational model, and the design methods and enabling tools will be applied to conduct in-depth investigations of three application areas: advanced manufacturing, morphing wearables, and the future of creative work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigating the variation of their relationship will deepen our understanding of teleconnections, air-sea interactions, and climate feedbacks. The paleoclimate data will serve as a testbed for the verification of current theories of the ASM thereby refining dynamical understanding.<br/><br/>The ASM supplies freshwater resources for nearly four billion people annually. Extreme events associated with the ASM cause and/or exacerbate floods and droughts, which have far-reaching social and economic impacts in developing countries.  Large model uncertainties, however, still exist in the model projections of the ASM.  The El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important predictor of the ASM, yet the ENSO-monsoon relationship is not stable and exhibits substantial decadal variability.  The variation of the ENSO-monsoon relationship is likely modulated by external forcing such as greenhouse gases (GHGs) and solar irradiance but also heavily modulated by internal modes of climate variability such as the PDO and the AMO. Paleoclimate records can extend the temporal coverage afforded by the instrumental era and help address such uncertainty.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include integrating climate dynamics and modeling to refine projections of the ASM and its hydroclimate extremes, which impact the economic prosperity of nearly 4 billion people in Asian developing countries.

In response to this workforce demand, Hudson County Community College recently developed an Associate in Applied Science degree program in Construction Management.  This degree includes transferable general education classes as well as relevant training in construction management.  Current construction management students are trained on new construction methods, protocols, testing procedures, engineering drawings, software, cost estimation, and management principles.  However, the rapid rate of change in construction technology requires continuous curriculum updates and additional real-world experiences prior to graduation.  The project will work to achieve these needs by revitalizing the Industry Education Advisory Board as a Business and Industry Leadership Team.  This change is expected to result in increased engagement of potential employers and improved outcomes for students through academic and industrial co-leadership of the project.  <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to (1) develop structured partnerships with local employers to increase internship opportunities and employment for Construction Management students and graduates, and (2) ensure rigor and relevance of the academic program in partnership with the Industry Education Advisory Board.  It is expected that these changes will result in training of qualified employable graduates in 12 to 36 months of project initiation.  Hudson County Community College will continually evaluate the success of these initiatives, including the quality and number of partnerships created, as well as the number of internships, apprenticeships, and new job opportunities for Construction Management students.  This effort is anticipated to enhance eight courses in the degree program, and enable students to sit for national licensing exams as they proceed.  Co-leadership with the Industry Education Advisory Board will allow Hudson County Community College to continually align their academic programs to keep pace with changes in construction management.  The project plans to recruit and retain veterans, female students, minority, non-traditional students, students with special needs, and incumbent workers.  Hudson County Community College will share the results of their work among the other 19 community colleges in New Jersey and the New Jersey Community College Consortium for Workforce and Economic Development.

This program integrates computation and experiment, such that the computational component provides a unifying theme across a diverse set of projects. Participants will engage in a series of activities that facilitate their professional development including workshops on ethics, preparing a poster, applying and preparing for graduate school or industrial careers, and science communication. Participants will also learn about industrial and governmental research and non-research career options so that they can make informed decisions about their own career and educational paths. Other social activities offered on campus provide participants opportunities to interact with fellow researchers in other undergraduate research programs to gain a sense of community and collegial support.<br/><br/>Available student research projects at this REU site cover many topics in chemistry including: materials science (polymer synthesis, nanomaterials synthesis), life sciences (biomolecule-directed synthesis, biomolecule sensing, and biomolecular interaction studies), and energy sciences (homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, electron capture, biofuels, photochemistry), as well as research in more traditional chemistry sub-fields (organic, inorganic, physical and analytical). An advantage of the integrated computational/experimental nature of program is that the computational aspect serves as a unifying theme for participants regardless of the nature of the individual research project. The program takes advantage of the geographic location of NCSU and exposes students to careers in non-academic settings in the Research Triangle Park (RTP) area. Additionally, students participate in various activities organized by the NCSU Office of Undergraduate Research that are designed to encourage interaction with other undergraduate researchers and aid in their professional development as they embark on future careers.

As one example, utility demand response programs currently increase building cooling temperature setpoints to reduce peak summer energy loads, but this can lead to uncomfortable and frustrated occupants who override those setpoints to maintain comfort. Such overrides increase strain on the electric grid and induce financial losses resulting from the failure to deliver promised energy management. The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is to enable the design of automation in the built environment that models human physiological and behavioral responses to changing environmental temperature conditions to satisfy competing objectives of energy management and occupant comfort. This project will use laboratory-based human subject studies and field studies involving 100 consumer households to develop methods and models for understanding how human thermal comfort and behavior (thermal setpoint control overrides) adapt to dynamic thermal environments. The goal is to develop an adaptive controller that incorporates a dynamic model of occupant comfort, which will allow temporary comfort deviations that nevertheless avoid setpoint overrides. The project will advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by advancing a fundamental understanding of the complex dynamics that arise through the joint optimization of building heating and air conditioning system energy consumption and occupant comfort. A synergistic education program with an urban vocational high school will translate research findings into an applied curriculum. The goal of which is to train the next generation of building technicians and engineers to be effective and equitable in the operation of building automation systems. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to investigate human thermal comfort and interactions with the smart thermostat devices to mitigate conflict between energy management systems and building occupants by designing automated controls that avoid user overrides. This project?s research plan follows an iterative design procedure involving human psychophysiological testing, behavior modeling, and control system design. Laboratory studies of human behavior in response to environmental thermal transients will guide streamlined field experiments to be performed in 100 homes in partnership with a leading smart-thermostat manufacturer. A model of human psychophysiological behavior dynamics will be developed based on the resulting experimental data. Machine learning techniques will be used to improve estimator performance. Emergent behaviors arising from the interaction of users and a variety of existing and novel robust- and optimal-controllers will be evaluated through simulations and field tests.

Given the observed disruption to international scientific teams and collaborative efforts, as well as the risk of future potential disruptions, there is a critical need to understand how to build international scientific collaborations that are resilient and sustainable in the face of disruption. <br/><br/>This project addresses the following questions: what are the characteristics of international teams that influence long-term collaboration? How do such characteristics allow teams engaging within international scientific exchange to recover from disruption to their collaborative efforts, while other characteristics tend to contribute to strain and even failure? To answer such questions, this project aims to create a comparative methodology that will allow us to understand, gauge, and contribute to improving future international scientific collaboration. Analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international scientific collaborations will drive our understanding of i) the potential benefits of international scientific collaboration and how they are realized, ii) the barriers to continued collaboration in the event of systemic disruption, iii) the reasons why some collaborations are more resilient than others, and iv) the ways in which risks to collaboration can be mitigated. <br/><br/>To answer these questions, the investigators will develop and test a method that uses i) publicly available quantitative and qualitative data on international research funding, administration, and use and ii) original interviews with key informants selected for their expertise in analysis of scientific network sustainability and resiliency. Using this information, we will compare international scientific collaboration in polities chosen for their different positions in world science and different policy approaches to scientific collaboration. <br/><br/>The findings from this method will be useful on two levels: to gain informants' understanding of scientific collaboration and resilience; and to gain an understanding of different governmental and policy approaches from comparing the frameworks, policies, and ideas that are enunciated in different systems. Results from this effort will provide international scientific engagements and teams with a critical foundation to develop and enhance their resilience against current and future disruptions ? ensuring that international engagement and scientific innovation shall continue despite any aberration in how such teams and organizations interact, collaborate, and pursue cutting-edge scientific ideas in various fields.<br/><br/><br/>Part II: Technical description<br/>This project aims to develop a scientifically robust methodology to comparatively evaluate international scientific relationships and their resilience in the face of global crises. Anecdotally, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the dynamics of international scientific collaboration, challenging collaboration in many ways while demonstrating its value in addressing shared problems. But the resilience of international scientific engagement is under-researched at present, and there is urgent need to develop resilience structures and practices to prevent permanent disruption. <br/>To develop a scientific and policy approach focused on the resilience of international collaborative teams, this project will generate qualitative data through semi-structured interviews with a purposeful, stratified sample of research funders, administrators and researchers in selected countries. A review of publicly available policy documentation, laws, research outputs and funding amounts will supplement the interview data. An Expert Advisory Group of senior scientists drawn from selected countries (UK, Singapore, EU) will advise the team in identifying and constructing the initial stratified sample of interviewees. The interview data, review of publicly available data, and advice from the Expert Advisory Group will be used by the investigators to identify both qualitative lessons and quantitative metrics relating to the resilience of international research collaborations.<br/>This method would develop knowledge in two ways. First, by having interviewees in science policy discuss their operative theories of resilient collaboration, the lessons they drew from the disruption of COVID-19, and how to build resilient international collaboration, we would bring the practical expertise and theories of experts into the discussion of resilience. Second, by taking an explicitly mixed methods, comparative approach to a diverse sample of science policy systems, we can develop a framework for comparing different science policy approaches to collaboration and their effects on resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Principal Investigators (PIs) will iterate between wet-lab experiments and mathematical modeling to uncover the principles underpinning scaling in the model system Xenopus Laevis (frog). The PIs posit that the dynamics of nuclear growth and ultimately the steady-state size of the organelle depend upon multiple, interdependent processes including (i) nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediated import of soluble proteins, (ii) osmotic/oncotic pressure differences, (iii) microtubule-dependent transport of vesicular membrane building blocks, and (iv) regulated exchange between the outer nuclear membrane and the contiguous endoplasmic reticulum. Using parameter estimation and Bayesian model selection criteria, The PIs will delineate the roles played by each of these processes. The outcomes of this award will provide a framework for data driven discovery in a vast range of biological problems. This award will enable the training of the next generation of biophysical researchers who will be immersed in both theoretical and experimental environments.<br/><br/>The PIs will determine the mechanisms of nuclear scaling using the model system X. laevis within an iterative experimental and modeling approach. On the experimental end, the PIs will combine microfluidics, photolabile hydrogels, and cell-free cytoplasmic extracts derived from X. laevis eggs.  This platform enables recapitulation of nuclear assembly and growth under controlled experimental conditions in which variables such as cytoplasmic volume, cytoplasmic shape, and cytoplasmic composition can be independently modulated. To complement this experimental framework, the PIs will develop a hierarchy of mathematical models ranging from analytically tractable (single nucleus, radially symmetric), to computationally demanding (multiple interacting nuclei, complex cell geometry). These models will take the form of free boundary partial differential equations (reaction-advection-diffusion PDEs) and describe the transport of proteins by unbiased diffusion, directed motion along microtubules and active fluid flow. To incorporate surface details of the nuclear envelope, particularly the arrangement and dynamics of NPCs during nuclear growth, macroscopic laws describing rates of import and growth will be obtained using asymptotic analysis and homogenization theory. Broader impacts arising from this award include 1) cross disciplinary training of graduate students in both experimental and modeling through rotations at U. Wyoming and Notre Dame  2) two international workshops aimed at cementing connections between biological and mathematical scientists and further dissemination of research methodologies and tools.<br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) through the Systems and Synthetic Biology and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster, and the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Page of the University of Texas at Austin is developing light-selective boron containing dyes as catalysts for the synthesis of recyclable polymers.  The structure and reactivity of these dyes will first be optimized through systematic studies in order to understand their electronic and chemical properties.  Successful candidates will then be used to prepare dynamic poly(urethane) networks using light.  Poly(urethanes) are an important class of plastics which is extensively used to make coatings, adhesives and sealants.  The light that will connect individual building units into long polymer chains will also be used to disconnect them one at a time by simple changing its wavelength and intensity.  Hence, this light-toggling will lead to recyclability.  Studies associated with this research have the potential to provide fundamental chemistry knowledge associated with light controlled polymerization and how it can be used to efficiently prepare recyclable polymeric materials.  As such, chemistry emphasized in the proposed work also addresses the current and ongoing global issue of plastic waste accumulation.  This research will provide new opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training in polymer chemistry.  Diversity seminars will be initiated, as well as development of a new course in undergraduate peer mentoring for organic chemistry.  Moreover, the work will also positively support public education and outreach.  Dr. Page will create an interdisciplinary polymer teaching module on light as a tool in science to engage middle and high school students from institutions with disproportionate populations of minorities in STEM fields.  Outreach activities involving intercollegiate student interactions with North Carolina State University will also be established. <br/> <br/>This research will focus on development of wavelength-selective boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photocages bearing benzyl sulfides as catalysts for controlled anionic photoredox polymerization.  The underlying strategy uses mild reaction conditions and visible-to-NIR (near infrared) light to reversibly cleave BODIPY derivatives and generate strong nucleophiles (thiolate anions) that can initiate polymerization.  Specifically, the preparation of recyclable dynamic polymer networks bearing (di)thiourethane and imine/hydrazone/oxime functionality will be emphasized as soft materials that remain largely unexamined using light-driven approaches.  Strong emphasis will be placed on the optimization of reactivities and kinetics through structural modification of BODIPY-based dyes in order to understand their electronic properties and responses to light with different wavelengths and intensities.  Proposed structure-reactivity studies could provide fundamental chemistry knowledge associated with the synthesis of recyclable polymers using photoredox initiated polymerization.  The proposed ability to control the polymerization by different light intensities and wavelengths has the potential to permit the precise 2D-patterning and 3D-printing of polymeric materials, with long-term potential scientific impact upon tissue engineering, robotics, optical coatings and image sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to identify the spatial and temporal components of abrupt climate transitions during the Holocene, the current interglacial period (~10.000 years). The researchers will combine paleoclimate data and models to assess the ability to simulate rapid climate shifts and predict future changes. This project will leverage several recent developments, including a dramatic increase in the number of high-resolution Holocene paleoclimate records over the past decade, the development of new statistical techniques to detect changepoints in paleoclimate records (e.g., temperature or rainfall) and handle uncertainties of the paleoclimate data, and the availability of climate simulations with increasingly realistic drivers and processes.<br/><br/>The work aims to address three questions: (1) What is the spatial and temporal pattern of abrupt changes during the Holocene? Are they organized in time and space, or do they occur more stochastically? (2) What are the forcings (e.g., orbital forcing, solar variability, volcanic eruptions) and climate system nonlinearities (e.g., feedbacks, thresholds) that produce Holocene abrupt events? (3) Do coupled climate models simulate abrupt climate changes of the types observed in the Holocene paleoclimate record, or are models more stable?<br/><br/>To answer these question, researchers suggest to (1) use Bayesian changepoint detection to objectively identify rapid shifts in a large data set of Holocene proxy records while accounting for age, proxy, and methodological uncertainties, (2) aggregate these results into a systematic and integrated view of transitions in time and in space, (3) apply the same algorithm to several transient simulations of Holocene climate in order to test hypotheses about the relative roles of external forcing and stochastic internal variability in generating past abrupt events.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a better characterization of abrupt climate events in the past, and an evaluation of their predictability with climate models.

In these tools, people carefully state their assumptions, and then combine them with observed data. However, these automatic tools only work at a relatively modest scale, and ever-growing datasets require more powerful methods. Recent years have seen the development of a novel strategy for inference that has been able to address data orders of magnitude larger. However, great care and expertise is needed to wield these methods successfully, putting them out of reach for most potential users. This project seeks to promote the progress of science by making these large-scale techniques more automatic, putting them within reach of the vast majority of users not able to invest huge amounts of effort in manual algorithmic engineering.<br/><br/>This project advances methodology for automatic and general-purpose variational inference, with the goal of answering two questions. The first question is when does variational inference work. This is paramount, since no method can succeed on all problems. We take three directions, namely new diagnostic error measures, improved scalability for diagnostics, and an empirical evaluation on a corpus of real non-expert models gathered from an integrated course. The second question is how to automate algorithmic design choices. Variational inference algorithms require many delicate design choices, currently made manually. The core idea to automate these decisions is to maintain statistics so the effect of any set of choices on optimization speed can be predicted. This project will contribute 1) a corpus and evaluation of automatic inference on non-expert models, 2) improved diagnostic performance measures, and 3) methods to automatically make variational inference choices, guided by convergence rates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This integrated research and education project aims to develop machines that are able to spatially sense their visual surroundings, even when the surroundings have low visibility with significant obstructions. On multiple levels, the investigators will furthermore use their integrated approach to advance education in artificial intelligence, such as outreach activities for K-12 students and streamlined curriculums for both undergraduate and graduate education in computer vision.<br/><br/>The research program introduces a framework that tightly integrates geometry, motion, and acoustics in order to learn rich spatial representations of natural scenes from unlabeled visual data.

The framework will leverage the propagation of sound through objects to learn visual tracking under occlusion. In other cases, the project will use scene geometry to transfer incidental supervision between camera views in order to learn spatial memory models. A key advantage of the approach is the efficiency to operate on videos that span both large physical spaces and long temporal horizons.

For instance, given frames of a video showing a traffic intersection, how can a machine anticipate the situation at the intersection a few seconds after the last observed video frame? Humans have a remarkable ability to address this task, which is used permanently, e.g., to safely navigate at an intersection, to effectively collaborate in a kitchen, and even when reading. To address this task, neuroscience hypothesizes that the situation is simulated using mental models. This helps to quickly converge to a set of likely outcomes while ruling out implausible situations. In contrast, present-day computer vision, machine learning and autonomous systems which address this challenge are at their infancy. While the last decade has shown tremendous progress for tasks which analyze observations, e.g., to detect visible objects and segment their contours, present-day systems are challenged when reasoning about something that is not directly observed, e.g., the situation a few seconds from now. Reasoning about the unobserved is challenging because the number of possibilities grows quickly. Yet, the ability to forecast is important for any system that wants to interact safely with its surroundings. To close this gap and lay the foundations for systems to anticipate, this project studies three aspects: 1) representations of the data which are suitable for forecasting, 2) properties of methods that permit accurate forecasting, and 3) what data is necessary to develop accurate models for forecasting.<br/><br/>Technically, to address the aforementioned three aspects, the project develops methods which learn how to anticipate via visual simulation. Specifically, the methods use the observed data to retrieve a model of the scene either explicitly or implicitly (Thrust 1). The methods also learn from data how this model is transformed to match likely futures, i.e., the systems learn to perform visual simulation. For this, the methods disentangle geometry, dynamics and relations between observed entities via latent variables (Thrust 2). Disentangling is important because geometry, dynamics and relations influence futures differently. The amount and detail of the annotated data which is used to develop these methods will affect the outcomes. This project studies those relations by collecting a novel dataset (Thrust 3). The representations, algorithms and data innovations will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses as well as an outreach program which is developed to teach audience-centric presentations to undergraduate and graduate students, providing an opportunity to learn to anticipate audience behavior (Thrust 4).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by advancing a fundamental understanding of adaptive technology for human activity and intent recognition and robot learning algorithms that can promote worker safety during construction materials handling scenarios. Human activity and intent recognition will be performed by directing real-time signals from wearable and environmental sensors to advanced machine learning and neural network algorithms.  Worker safety during materials handling will be promoted using a robot motion planner that optimizes, in part, ergonomics of the material transfer from the robot to the human. Additionally, the project team will develop a model for trust-building and a framework for trust-calibration within worker-robot teams to ensure that construction workers accurately assess how much to trust their robotic partners on the job site. The project also includes an education and outreach component that builds STEM education capacity for a diverse group of individuals including high school students and their teachers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This use-inspired CAREER project contributes to a future in which collaborative robots (co-robots) learn from and assist construction workers, thereby decreasing physical workload while promoting ergonomic safety.

This study challenges deficit narratives through an investigation of how a computational justice program model can support girls of color (ages 13-16) in developing agentic computing identities. An agentic computing identity describes the ability to view oneself as an active participant in computing with the knowledge and skills to enact social change and control future life trajectories.

This feature of structural complexity is a major challenge to deep learning methods.  Moreover, diverse data typically originate from sparse sampling of a huge space, and this sparsity is due, in particular, to the cost and time constraints in experimental data acquisition.

Model representation of plant functioning mirrors student understanding of these processes, as exemplified by the simplistic way in which they are represented in popular press and textbooks. This project will quantify long-term plant responses, including acclimation, to ongoing global change and will use findings from the lab and field to improve climate models. The research program will be integrated with an education program focused on student exploration of the interrelationships between plants and climate change. Hands-on research experiences for students will help to develop the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This research will use an integrated model-experiment approach to define the mechanisms underlying photosynthetic acclimation responses and their impact on larger ecological processes. First, it will quantify the effect of soil nutrients and nutrient acquisition on photosynthetic acclimation and the resulting impact on whole-plant functioning. This will test the general hypothesis that soil nutrient demand alters photosynthetic trait responses to soil nutrient availability. Second, the project will determine what plants acclimate to and how long acclimation takes. This will address the general hypothesis that less resource conservative species will acclimate faster than more resource conservative species. Third, the project will quantify the impact of photosynthetic acclimation on community- and ecosystem-scale processes. It will test the hypothesis that the response of individual physiology can substantially alter larger ecological processes by testing refined theory in multiple models. The research will be integrated with an education program that will develop two course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). The first will teach non-majors the role of plants as regulators of the global climate using semi-independent research projects. The second CURE will refine a majors-level CURE, providing opportunities for students to participate in the main research funded by this project by developing, carrying out, and disseminating independent spin-off projects. The CUREs will specifically target underrepresented minority students at TTU, a Hispanic Serving Institution, as a means to increase diversity in the fields of plant physiological and global change ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As data analytics becomes a routine business tool, there is an urgent need for data analytics technicians who can work in a wide range of job roles. Currently, only a few Certificate and Associate Degree Programs are available to students who wish to become data technicians. As a result, the number of students pursuing a data analytics career is not keeping pace with workforce demand. This project aims to address the critical need for data technicians in the upstate South Carolina region.  It will do so by establishing a Business and Industry Leadership Team that will partner with Spartanburg Community College to define the skills data technicians need to be successful in the workplace. Working with these industrial partners, the College will design and implement a Data Analytics Certificate program that will use online educational approaches to reach students throughout the region. <br/><br/>The project will begin by expanding and maintaining a Business and Industry Leadership Team, and then perform a Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) analysis to determine the skills required of data technicians. Information from the KSA analysis will be used to create a certificate program curriculum that can be administered remotely. Once faculty are trained to teach the new courses, the College will recruit students into the certificate program, with an emphasis on recruiting women. Anticipated outcomes of this project include the creation of a new Data Analytics certificate program that supports remote and online synchronous participation, training of faculty members in the new curriculum, and increased recruitment, retention, and graduation of women in data analytics. The results of this project will be made publicly available to advance data analytics technician education and the Business and Industry Leadership Team model nation wide.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, solid-state Na batteries (SSNBs) that use solid Na-ion conductors instead of liquid electrolytes improve device safety and are applicable to mid- and large-scale energy storage systems such as electric vehicles and utility grids. In this project, sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) will be investigated for their superior ionic conductivity. However, for sulfide-based SSNBs, high interfacial resistance remains a challenge to maximizing performance and commercialization. This research project will systematically investigate structural changes at the two main interfaces in sulfide-based SSNBs to fundamentally understand the sodium ion transport across those interfaces. The investigators aim to address critical interface issues preventing high battery performance. This research will be integrated with outreach and education efforts such as creating Women Engineering Network program and a collaboration with Kentucky Science Center. These initiatives will encourage more students from underrepresented minority groups such as K-12 Girls to enroll in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors, as well as increase the public?s scientific awareness on electrochemical energy storage and its role in using clean energy sources. <br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is to fundamentally understand the origins of interfacial resistance at both Na anode/sulfide SEs and cathode/sulfide SEs interfaces. The investigators will use this fundamental knowledge to engineer sulfide SEs with reduced resistance across interface and achieve advanced SSNBs with high energy density and stability. The first objective is to investigate the compatibility of halide doped sulfide solid electrolyte with electrodes (both Na anode and cathodes) to elucidate the halide doping effects on interface resistance. The second objective aims to understand Na-ion transport mechanisms in sulfide-polymer composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) as well as across the interfaces of CSE/electrodes in Na symmetric cells and SSNBs. The third objective focuses on study the cycling performance of sulfide based SSNBs that use metal-sulfide cathodes with different levels of volume change, aiming to determine the volume expansion /contraction effects on the interface resistance in SSNBs during their repeated charge/discharge cycling process. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this project will give insights into engineering interface design to reduce the interfacial resistance, overcome an important roadblock to achieve advanced solid-state Na batteries with high capacities and long lifetimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nucleus is a particular organelle where scaling is tightly regulated and aberrations are often hallmarks of disease. Consequently, a better understanding of these fundamental mechanisms may lead to novel treatments. The Principal Investigators (PIs) will iterate between wet-lab experiments and mathematical modeling to uncover the principles underpinning scaling in the model system Xenopus Laevis (frog). The PIs posit that the dynamics of nuclear growth and ultimately the steady-state size of the organelle depend upon multiple, interdependent processes including (i) nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediated import of soluble proteins, (ii) osmotic/oncotic pressure differences, (iii) microtubule-dependent transport of vesicular membrane building blocks, and (iv) regulated exchange between the outer nuclear membrane and the contiguous endoplasmic reticulum. Using parameter estimation and Bayesian model selection criteria, The PIs will delineate the roles played by each of these processes. The outcomes of this award will provide a framework for data driven discovery in a vast range of biological problems. This award will enable the training of the next generation of biophysical researchers who will be immersed in both theoretical and experimental environments.<br/><br/>The PIs will determine the mechanisms of nuclear scaling using the model system X. laevis within an iterative experimental and modeling approach. On the experimental end, the PIs will combine microfluidics, photolabile hydrogels, and cell-free cytoplasmic extracts derived from X. laevis eggs.  This platform enables recapitulation of nuclear assembly and growth under controlled experimental conditions in which variables such as cytoplasmic volume, cytoplasmic shape, and cytoplasmic composition can be independently modulated. To complement this experimental framework, the PIs will develop a hierarchy of mathematical models ranging from analytically tractable (single nucleus, radially symmetric), to computationally demanding (multiple interacting nuclei, complex cell geometry). These models will take the form of free boundary partial differential equations (reaction-advection-diffusion PDEs) and describe the transport of proteins by unbiased diffusion, directed motion along microtubules and active fluid flow. To incorporate surface details of the nuclear envelope, particularly the arrangement and dynamics of NPCs during nuclear growth, macroscopic laws describing rates of import and growth will be obtained using asymptotic analysis and homogenization theory. Broader impacts arising from this award include 1) cross disciplinary training of graduate students in both experimental and modeling through rotations at U.

The reliance of numerous technologies, from electronics to medical care to building and construction, on polymer adhesion has vastly increased the range of environments and loading conditions that these interfaces encounter. This range of environments and conditions will grow as polymer interfaces are expected to play more important roles in protective gear and in robotic devices that are specifically designed to minimize human exposure to potentially harmful extremes. Additionally, the quantity of waste that is created due to polymer adhesion and adhesives is growing at significant rates. This waste is not only polymers directly used in bonding but also the bonded materials, which are typically difficult to separate in order to be recycled or upcycled efficiently. This research project will lead to new understanding of adhesion at polymer interfaces at extreme rates of loading and temperature change. This foundation will help to meet a deficiency in the fundamental knowledge of polymer interfacial properties at extreme conditions, and we anticipate that the results will guide the development of new protocols for separating interfaces that help build a more sustainable society. Graduate and undergraduate students who participate in this project will learn a broad range of skills, including polymer synthesis and formulation, characterization methods for adhesion, mechanical and thermal properties, and the development and implementation of custom instrumentation designed to address challenges at the forefront of technology. They will also develop writing, management, mentoring, and presentation skills. Additionally, the team of researchers will launch a new K-12 outreach program geared toward under-represented minority students throughout the Western Massachusetts region to help inspire future careers in STEM. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>While polymer interfacial strength has been studied classically, open questions, and seemingly contradictory results, remain unresolved in how material structure controls the deformation of interfaces loaded, mechanically and thermally, at high rates. The PI's group will combine a new experimental method, called power amplified dynamic mechanical analysis (PADMA), with model materials to provide insight and pathways for controlling polymer interfacial strength. Three model polymer systems based on poly(n-butyl acrylate), which is broadly used in many current commercial adhesives, will form the foundation of the study. Two systems will be designed with similar low strain and low strain rate properties but different large strain and large strain rate responses. This difference will be associated with the network?s crosslink junctions. These materials will provide insight into how the elasto-adhesion length scale evolves at high velocities and how this change is related to changes in the polymer network structure. The third materials system, poly(n-butyl acrylate)-co-poly(dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels with controlled volume fractions of water, will provide insight into how localized phase transitions initiated by high rate thermal changes alter interfacial separation. Specifically, the size and interconnectivity of water swollen domains will be related to changes in interfacial strength when loaded at high thermal rates. Overall, the results will contribute to the limited, yet growing, knowledge base of polymer properties at high rates, especially at interfaces. This knowledge will lead to new methods for separating polymer interfaces with decreased energy and without the need for harmful solvents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such interfaces act much like the electronic gates found in modern electronic devices, which allow current to pass in one direction, but not the other. However, interfaces based on soft ion-conducting polymers offer other interesting properties, such as the ability to reversibly stick and release with the application of a small voltage, and the ability to generate currents when mechanically deformed. This project seeks to deepen our understanding of this emerging class of materials, and to thereby open the door to new types of devices built from them. To do so, it will develop a library of ion-conducting polymers and characterize how the behavior of the resulting interfaces depends on the polymer characteristics. It will provide insight into the tendency of these oppositely charged polymers to mix, or not mix, and use this knowledge to engineer systems that spontaneously assemble into junctions with improved performance. The project will provide opportunities for training and mentoring of students and researchers from the high school to post-doctoral levels, and will partner with nearby high schools and several organizations at the University of Colorado Boulder to engage, recruit, and retain a diverse group of participants.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Crosslinked networks of polyelectrolytes with low glass transition temperatures formed from ionic liquid monomers, or ?ionoelastomers?, have recently emerged as a promising class of soft ion conductors. While recent work has shown that heterojunctions between polyanionic and polycationic materials serve as inherently stretchable ionic diodes, enabling the formation of transistors, low-voltage electroadhesives, and electro-mechanical transducers, much remains to be understood about their operation. This project will establish a library of copolymers with varying content of different ionic charge carriers and different backbone chemistries, and characterize how the behavior of the resulting ionoelastomer heterojunctions depends on these characteristics. It will characterize the tendency of poly(ionic liquid) blends and block copolymers to mix, or undergo micro- or macro-phase separation, as a function of these parameters as well. Finally, it will establish routes based on self-assembly and photochemical patterning of ionic species to yield high surface area nano- and micro-scale heterojunctions, offering potentially dramatic improvements in the performance of the resulting devices.                 <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soft robotics has demonstrated the potential for mimicking the diverse multifunctionality of biological organisms, thereby creating the next generation of adaptable, versatile, and human-friendly robots. However, much work needs to be done to enable this development beyond research laboratories. In a fundamental shift from traditional robotics, this project will explore the design and modeling of simple plug-n-play modules to achieve complex and reconfigurable emergent functionalities. Among other societal impacts, the outcomes of this project would aid in the development of co-robots for factory automation, wearable rehabilitation systems, and search & rescue and reconnaissance robots. The project will also support an extensive education plan that includes undergraduate robotic curriculum development, undergraduate research internships, and international student exchange program, as well as an outreach plan that includes workshops and summer academy for local high school students in Chicago.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a systematic methodology for the optimal configuration of canonical variable stiffness soft robotic units into sophisticated cyber-physical systems. To achieve this objective, the research will proceed with two thrusts. The first thrust focuses on formulating a novel nonlinear bioinspired design philosophy that harnesses the ?strength in numbers? and the art of ?assembly?. The central feature of this approach is the leveraging of a set of simple soft robotic modules or designs with varying operational complexity and mechanical properties. The second thrust focuses on finding how to optimally configure these modules to solve challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks. The strategy is based on learning and evolutionary computing techniques and iterative assembly around the goal of minimal design complexity and reduced control challenges for a given task. Along with research, a third thrust focuses on integrating research with education at the high school, college, and post-college levels. Endeavors include incorporating robotics into the curriculum at the undergrad level within the Engineering program in the School of Computing at DePaul University. Additionally, outreach activities will also take place to raise awareness of robotics in the Chicago Public School System high school students via workshops and annual summer academy.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is still very challenging to massively bring heterogeneous drones by many different manufacturers to real-world applications. One main reason is that, whenever a new drone is built, the planning and control algorithms for the drone usually have to be designed very carefully and the actions for the drone to take usually have to be laboriously programmed with considerable tuning effort. To remove, if not lessen, such limitations, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project establishes a novel learning-based framework that equips drones with new capabilities of ""learning from the experience"" of other drones despite their different dynamics and platforms. This approach to design of planning and control of drones will significantly reduce the design, test, evaluation and certification of drones, uniquely and efficiently customized for applications in their operating environment. The integrated research-and-education activities will provide students in the Western New York area with hands-on experience and internship opportunities on drone techniques, toward better preparing the future workforce for the unmanned aerial system industry in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will establish a novel learning-based feedforward control framework and equip drones with new capabilities for learning three particular skills, i.e., (1) how to generate a dynamically feasible trajectory, (2) how to sense and compensate external disturbances, and (3) how to learn from others' learned experience, called ""dynamic learning."" These three skills are crucial for drones to perform complex tasks, and the foundation for understanding of how one robot could efficiently learn from the experiences gathered by other robots with different dynamics. Key to this approach is an architecture that automatically adjusts the original outputs of the baseline planners and controllers by adding feedforward learning signals to improve drone's flight performance. This learning framework is neither to completely replace the existing planning and control methods nor to compete for the highest optimized performance possible but rather to provide an elegant learning mechanism that is highly adaptable and reasonably efficient involving minimal hardware modification and software reconfiguration for commodity drones.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These pledges were made to address growing concerns from the public about the surveillance capabilities of private companies and their impact on privacy, agency, and sovereignty. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, the purpose of this study is to (1) investigate the data-gathering practices of tech companies in the U.S., (2) examines the ways in which users and privacy advocates have contested or resisted forms of surveillance, and (3) analyze the justifications of private corporations in their attempts to build a world in which everything and everyone is being constantly recorded. This research is centered on non-creative recording practices, investigating the recording and listening capacities of everyday technological devices, as well as their impact on citizens. The first case study is on the so-called ?Smart Cities??the connected city of ?the future,? according to tech companies involved in urbanism?that gathers massive amounts of data on citizens in their daily lives. The second case study is on ?Smart Home? device Amazon Echo, equipped with a voice assistant named ?Alexa.? Devices such as Echo are constantly ?on? and listening, gathering sonic data from users through opaque practices. <br/><br/>This project treats policy, legal texts such as terms of use, marketing discourses, and discourses in the media and on social media as ethnographic data. In addition, it uses traditional fieldwork methods such as interviews and participant observation conducted in non-profit organizations, at conferences, and in public spaces, primarily in New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. The ethnographic work gathers qualitative data on three main points of view: those of privacy advocates, tech company workers, and ?users? of technology. The aim is to observe and inquire about the way people conceive of and build the technology, how people interact with it, and the impact of these interactions on notions of privacy. This project seeks to bring competing viewpoints together, thereby resisting current contemporary tendencies towards polarization, and provides relevant analysis of the main constituencies involved in the privacy wars. By looking at privacy as a complex, nonhegemonic concept, and interrogating the very notion of the boundary between the public and the private, this work can serve to inform policy that strikes a balance between individual freedom and the public good.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project is focused on cases where this happens because the argument is indirect, proving a fact about finite numbers using a detour through various notions of infinity. In these cases, it is often possible to provide a translation in which we reinterpret statements about infinite numbers as more complicated statements about explicit computations. The goal of this project is to develop ""meta-theorems"" for cases where this happens - results allowing us to systematically translate infinitary proofs into finite, explicit proofs - and to test these methods by applying them to examples in model theory. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students through their involvement with the research topics.<br/><br/>This project considers an assortment of situations where abstract logical ideas, particularly saturation, compactness, forcing, and uncountable cardinals, are used to prove concrete theorems. One of the lessons of proof theory is that we often expect such proofs to point the way towards proofs that are more concrete; the goal of this project is to find such concrete proofs. The project focuses on results in model theory, including the combinatorial part of stability theory and its links to graph and hypergraph quasirandomness, and saturated embedding tests for quantifier elimination. The proof-theoretic functional interpretation is a central tool; domain-specific adaptations will be developed to make the approach practical.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to predictably break specific amide bonds in complex peptide structures would be a tour de force in biomimetic catalyst development and would provide important information about the principles underlying enzymatic catalysis. Dr. Wasa and his research team have designed catalysts that can activate acidic and basic groups simultaneously without reacting with each other. In this project, they are further developing this catalytic technology to mimic the spatial differentiation of active sites in enzymes and investigating new ways to cleave amide bonds in ways that are not easily achievable with naturally occurring protease enzymes.  Dr. Wasa's team seeks to achieve a generalizable solution to this challenge. Dr. Wasa and his research group are also involved in outreach activities to promote engagement with STEM disciplines among diverse populations through internship programs for students and teachers from high schools in Boston and Brookline.<br/><br/>Dr. Masayuki Wasa and his research group are developing ?frustrated? Lewis acid/Bronsted base pair catalysts for the site-selective cleavage of polyfunctional peptides to access fragments that are difficult to form by known methods and have significant biological and chemical value. ?Frustrated? Lewis acid/Bronsted base catalyst systems are being targeted for these reactions because they have the unique ability to increase the acidity of the amide functionalities towards deprotonation without undergoing self-quenching and the modularity to be tuned toward site-selective alcoholysis and hydrolysis. A diverse array of cyclic and acyclic peptide substrates are being explored in these studies, including complex peptide-based natural products whose structures have not been fully elucidated.

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to Fayetteville State University supports research in nanochemistry.   More specifically, it supports research that investigates novel synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts where nickel is supported on carbon nanotubes.  Furthermore, the project engages undergraduate engineering students in the research activities.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to develop a straightforward, simple, and cost-effective method for preparation of nickel nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (Ni/MWCNTs) to serve as an efficient heterogeneous nanocatalyst for carbon-carbon cross coupling reactions. The method involves a dry mixing of the corresponding nickel salt with carbon nanotubes at ambient temperature without the necessity of any reducing agent or solvent under mechanical shaking of a ball-mill. Notably, both the transition metal and solid support used for making these nanocomposites are inexpensive and highly abundant. The as-prepared Ni/MWCNTs nanoparticles will be used for cross coupling reactions under batch and continuous flow process conditions. In this regard, the use of microwave energy will be investigated as an alternative, convenient, green, and efficient heating source to develop the necessary conditions for the catalytic reactions.  The proposed research will not only address fundamental aspects of carbon-carbon bond formation reactions but will also aid in exploring the continuous flow technology (e.g., FlowLab) for translation to large-scale production of useful organic molecules. This section of the project will bring together the best techniques to develop a technology with direct industrial applicability and will expedite broader application of continuous throughput manufacture technologies for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) through the major bond formation utilizing the cross-coupling catalysis in flow.

Although humans successfully learn to control complex machine dynamics when they fly planes, drive cars, or perform robot-assisted surgery, these applications avoid the abrupt changes in dynamics encountered when one's feet hit the ground, or when one's hands initially grasp objects.  Despite the prevalence of contact-rich dynamic interactions in daily life and work, state-of-the-art robots struggle with making and breaking contact whether or not there is a human in-the-loop.  In many applications of current and future interest -- remotely-operated robots, active prosthetics and exoskeletons, and brain/machine interfaces, to name a few -- humans and machines will collaboratively learn to control legs and arms as they make and break contact with the environment.  The project will advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by advancing understanding of how humans learn to control contact-rich dynamics and how machines can adapt to ensure safety and improve performance of the human/machine system.  In the long term, the results of this project will human/robot teams to perform complex tasks involving dynamic interaction with the world.  Since many jobs are becoming increasingly automated, and since many people will experience impaired movement at some point in their lives, the goals of this research have tangible benefits for work and/or health of many people.  To ensure these benefits are shared equitably, this project includes three evidence-based education and outreach programs designed to broaden participation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to test the hypotheses that humans can learn dynamic models of complex contact-rich machine dynamics, that they can and invert those models to control machine interactions with the environment, and that machines can exploit these facts to adapt their behavior to assist the human to perform desirable tasks.  This goal will be pursued through three objectives.  The first is to mathematically derive and computationally approximate inverse models for contact-rich dynamics. To achieve this objective, the PI will derive conditions that ensure that a forward model involving contact dynamics is invertible (exactly or approximately) and create algorithms that compute representations for the (approximate) inverse model. The second objective is to experimentally test whether humans control contact-rich dynamics as if they learned and inverted forward models, and to discern how sensorimotor pathways are integrated to implement the human?s controller. To do so, the project team will conduct human subject experiments using a novel teleoperation testbed to study trajectory tracking tasks involving intermittent contact events. The third objective will mathematically derive and experimentally test performance of human/machine co-adaptation algorithms based on game theory.

Residential real estate in particular has become more common, accelerating patterns of land speculation and urbanization in areas undergoing agricultural decline. The socio-ecological effects of these transformations are vast and include processes such as the displacement and segregation of rural populations, livelihood change and work precaritization, deforestation, water privatization, and increases in climate vulnerability. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical data collection and analysis, this doctoral dissertation project provides a scientific analysis of the economic and political practices driving these processes of landscape transformation as well as the experiences of rural communities in areas impacted by rapid urbanization.<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation research project examines the relationship between real estate speculation and water resource access among agricultural producers in a context of rapid urbanization. It asks three questions about the processes of land speculation and real estate development in rural areas: (1) How have different rural communities experienced the pressures for urbanization and the process of deruralization implied by it? (2) Which are the main groups acquiring residential property in the area and what are the main uses assigned to those properties? (3) What are the rationalities of governmental officials in prioritizing the urbanization of water supply promoted by real estate actors? To answer these questions the doctoral student will analyze the histories of two former agricultural production properties which have been targeted as residential development sites. The researcher will also conduct archival research, oral histories and semi-structured with residents, state officials, developers, urban planners, and other relevant groups. These histories will contribute to scientific understanding about the relationship between rapid urbanization and the financialization of real estate markets, and to what extent human-environment relations are defined by the growth of global financial markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coxeter groups are collections (usually called ""groups"") of symmetries of highly symmetric objects, like for example the Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron) and higher-dimensional analogues.  An important theme of mathematics in the last hundred years or so is that Coxeter groups and related geometric objects provide a very accessible and useful key to unlock many other mathematical theories.  This project explores the applications of Coxeter groups to Artin groups (including the ""braid group"", which describes the mathematics of braided strands), scattering diagrams (a key tool for ""mirror symmetry"" in string theory), and cluster algebras (a newer theory that also functions as a key to other mathematical theories). The award will also fund graduate students working on this project.<br/><br/>One part of the project concerns the combinatorics of cluster scattering diagrams and their theta functions.  The goal is to connect theta functions to the mutation fan (a fan that encodes the piecewise-linear geometry of matrix mutation) and also to construct the cluster scattering fan in the surfaces/orbifolds case and show that the theta functions are the bracelets basis in that case.  A second part of the project is to extend (from finite type to affine type) the deep connections between the noncrossing partition lattices (which appear in the theory of Artin groups) and generalized associahedra/scattering fans.  Closely related to this goal is the project of constructing planar diagrams that realize noncrossing partition lattices of classical affine types.  The third part of the project is (in its most ambitious formulation) to extend the weak order on a finite Coxeter group to an infinite lattice (not semilattice) for completely general Coxeter groups and then carry out the Cambrian fan construction of cluster scattering diagrams in complete generality.  In finite type, the weak order can be understood in terms of shards and the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Semidistributive Lattices (FTFSDL).  In the infinite case, the plan is to construct a lattice from shards and an infinite version of FTFSDL.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although these communities provide a major source of affordable housing and low-income home ownership, case study research suggests that they are spatially marginalized and exposed to concentrated forms of economic, social, and environmental vulnerability. Due to the difficulty of identifying their location across a broader geography, there is currently no systematic data on their total number or location, nor are there national-level analysis of the spatial inequalities they face. This project uses big data and machine learning to produce more robust and refined measurements of the characteristics of all U.S. neighborhoods (formally planned suburbs, ISs, and MHCs). This allows documentation of the location of ISs and MHCs nationwide and modeling of policy and market factors that explain patterns of uneven development, segregation, and environmental inequalities across neighborhood types. The databases and publications generated by this project have the potential to generate knowledge needed to develop more equitable housing policies   as well as to support further research. The dissemination plan allows knowledge sharing with the public, local planners, and other stakeholders and policymakers through local community engagement workshops, a series of regional webinars, and an easy-to-use publicly available data mapping and visualization dashboard. <br/><br/>The study builds on geographic theories of socio-spatial peripheralization and uneven development by examining the nature, causes, and consequences of the proliferation of ISs and MHCs and their relationship with the uneven spatial distribution of poverty and vulnerability in the United States. The project uses Python programming language, a national dataset of building footprints, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to identify the distinct dimensions of neighborhood morphology (the size, shape, orientation, and other arrangements of buildings) in ISs, MHCs, and formally planned suburbs across the country. In doing so, it produces more robust and refined measurements of the characteristics of all U.S. neighborhoods, as well as a first-time national level database of ISs and MHCs. This dataset enables the examination of the relationship between segregation by neighborhood types and spatial inequalities, including residential segregation by race, income, and tenure as well as exposure to various types of environmental risk. Project findings contributes to: (1) methodological advancements in the spatial study of neighborhood morphologies, (2) theoretical advancements in scholarship on peripheralization, uneven development, and suburbanization of poverty and (3) empirical advancements in the documentation and analysis of informal housing relative to social vulnerabilities and environmental hazards. The study allows users of the research products to analyze neighborhood morphologies; examine social, economic, and environmental impacts of uneven community development; and identify policies that can ameliorate these impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

VR has applications in education, training, rehabilitation, tourism, and other domains. However, because many VR experiences rely on vision, making them inaccessible to people with visual impairments, research is needed in how to make these experiences more widely available. One key barrier to accessibility is that people using VR frequently interact with objects in the simulation that move. This project will develop methods for incorporating sound, vibration, and other cues to help people with visual impairments locate and interact with virtual objects more effectively. Based on this work, the project team will create guidelines and tools software developers can use to create more accessible VR experiences, allowing people with visual impairments to reap their educational, immersive, and social benefits. The team will work closely with people with visual impairments as both participants and collaborators, including providing opportunities for youth with visual impairments to participate in computing through an annual computing camp.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to help people with visual impairments understand and act on virtual reality environments that have moving targets. To meet these goals, the team will focus on three key components of VR interaction: 1) helping people accurately select nearby targets on a vertical plane, 2) accurately depicting the time-to-contact of approaching targets, and 3) using positional metaphors to indicate the location of multiple virtual targets simultaneously. Addressing each objective requires innovation in how to provide information to users with visual impairments, how to process input from users with visual impairments, and how to model a user's intent. The team will develop the virtual reality experiences using user-centered design approaches and conduct both lab and longitudinal evaluations of the solutions to each challenge. The project's education plan includes teaching computing concepts to youth with visual impairments, disseminating the research to less technology-centric fields, and integrating accessibility topics into computing coursework.

An essential step toward improving infrastructure resilience involves assessing risks from numerous natural hazards and then using the resulting risk-insights to plan for and respond to events in real-time. Probabilistic hazard assessments serve as the starting point for risk assessments. Typically, these assessments focus on specific hazards such as earthquakes or hurricanes. However, major disaster events often result from combinations of multiple hazards. Probabilistic hazard assessments that do not capture ?multi-hazard events? can ultimately lead to suboptimal risk mitigation and event response. Research and education gaps currently prevent fully integrated multi-hazard assessments. These gaps exist because the approaches used for various natural hazards were developed in relative isolation. This has led to meaningful differences in the tools professionals use to assess hazards and how hazard assessment is taught, researched, and addressed in regulation. <br/><br/>This project involves research and education activities centered around three aims that provide a strong foundation for creating dynamically updatable, multi-hazard risk assessment models for spatially-distributed infrastructure. Aim #1 will focus on developing Bayesian-network-based formulations to assess multiple, spatially-distributed hazards. This will provide a unified quantitative and graphical structure for ?linking? hazard-specific models based on their probabilistic dependencies. Aim #2 will focus on computation enabling strategies needed to implement Bayesian networks for probabilistic assessments of multiple, spatially-distributed hazards (modeled as random fields) at practical scales. Physically-informed surrogate models will be developed using statistical and machine-learning methods to reduce the computational (processing) demands associated with generating conditional probability tables required by the Bayesian networks. Surrogate model development research will be coupled with a project-based university course on the subject. Finally, Aim #3 will focus on creating a dynamically updateable, multi-hazard Bayesian network case study to demonstrate, validate, communicate, and seek feedback on project outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will provide a new tool for understanding the controls on sea-level change and flood hazards near large rivers, which are home to many coastal cities, of relevance to NSF?s Coastlines and People (CoPe) initiative.  These efforts will be paired with four education and outreach tasks focused on sea-level change, including the development of a new university course on sea-level change, training of students in pedagogy and mentorship, public outreach through the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum, and a five-year outreach program to K-12 students from underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the feedback between sea level and sediment redistribution.

The proposed work is aimed at closing this knowledge gap through the development of a novel model that couples Earth?s topographic evolution to sea-level change.  This will be used to explore the controls on the sediment-sea level feedback by quantifying the sensitivity of sea-level changes to marine sediment transport, the sensitivity of lowland rivers to sea-level change, and the effects of sediment redistribution on estimates of global mean sea level and global ice volume at the Last Interglacial period, an analogue for modern climate.  This will clarify the sensitivity of sea-level change to sediment erosion and deposition?a common feature of Earth?s coasts?and provide a basis for improving projections of future sea-level change.

Prior research has found that the data that such approaches rely on is frequently biased, incomplete, or missing. As a result, data infrastructures--individual health records, frontline health surveys, activity on social media and online health fora?often fail to capture local, sociocultural specificities. This project will work to actively engage the underrepresented voices of predominantly women frontline health workers (FHWs)?also among the most vulnerable and impacted?toward designing technology-mediated frontline health workflows. It will investigate supporting these technology workflows by making frontline health work more visible, distributing the burden of care work through selective automation, and providing avenues workers can use to transition toward improved economic livelihoods. It will work toward improved health outcomes for care-seekers from underserved communities, improved futures for the workers, and robust overall healthcare ecologies.<br/><br/>The project will research how data-driven and technologically mediated healthcare can be directed toward the design of stronger frontline health ecologies, using community-centric, participatory approaches. Advancing scholarship at the intersection of human-centered computing and frontline health, the project will investigate three research questions. First, how can data practices and tools be designed and augmented to capture the work of FHWs that is currently not adequately visible, to enable better recognition of this work across state and healthcare authorities? Second, how can routine, everyday workflows be automated or supported to make work more manageable and the burden effectively distributed? Third, how can mobile health technologies support digital and data literacies among FHWs, to enable professional growth and employment opportunities in increasingly sociotechnical ecologies of frontline health? These research questions will be addressed through a combination of data collection methods, in conjunction with designing and developing systems, with local partners.

Research is needed to examine models of mathematics teacher professional development that explicitly addresses bias reduction. The goal of this project is to study the design and development of community-centered, job-embedded professional development for classroom teachers that supports bias reduction. The project team will partner with three school districts serving racially, ethnically, linguistically, and socio-economically diverse communities, for a two-year professional development program. The aim is to reduce bias through: analyzing and designing mathematics teaching with colleagues, students, and families to create classrooms and schools based on community-centered mathematics; engaging in anti-bias teaching routines; and building relationships with parents, caretakers, and community members. The project team will study teacher leader professional development, including the professional development model, framework, and tools, along with what teacher leaders across district contexts and grade-levels take up and use in their instructional practice.  This will potentially have wider implications for supporting more equitable mathematics teaching and leadership.

The project seeks to understand how the professional development model supports the development of teacher leaders' knowledge, dispositions, and practices for teaching and leading anti-bias mathematics education, and how teachers' subsequent classroom practice can cultivate students' mathematical engagement, discourse, and interests. The project will measure aspects of teacher knowledge and classroom practice by integrating existing classroom observation rubrics and STEM interest surveys to assess the impact on teacher classroom practice and student outcomes. The project will engage 12 TLs and approximately 60 additional teachers working with those TLs in two years of professional development using the Community Centered Math Studio Model to support anti-bias mathematics teaching. Data will be collected for all teachers related to their participation in the professional learning, with six teachers being followed for additional data collection and in-depth case studies. The project's outcomes will contribute to theories of how TLs build adaptive expertise for teaching and leading to reduce bias in classrooms, departments, schools, and districts. In addition, the project will contribute new and adapted research instruments on anti-bias teaching and leading. The research outcomes will add to the growing research base that describes the nature of equitable mathematics teaching in K-12 classrooms and increases access to meaningful mathematics for students, teachers, and communities.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

However, managing end-of-life plastics must be improved, as the life-cycle of most materials currently end in landfills or an incinerator.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop technologies to manage the environmental and economic consequences of end-of-life plastics. Unfortunately, the options available to compete with disposal are limited. Mechanical recycling is the most common current technology, but requires separation of a mixed waste stream to provide pure polymer as most polymer pairs produce ill-defined mixtures with inferior properties. The development of novel and effective polymeric surfactants can improve the properties of mixed plastic waste streams that are ubiquitous in polymer recycling.  This research program will therefore provide a foundation to develop novel polymeric modifiers that are required to enhance current polymeric recycling. Notably, these results enable the development of materials that will have near-term benefits allowing the efficient reclamation of plastics currently in the environment. As such, the identification of these molecular design principles provides a bridge between emerging chemical recycling, new materials design efforts, and current technologies to mechanically recycle plastics. Workforce development and training of the next generation of scientists and engineers who are prepared to tackle the grand challenges in mitigating the economic, environmental and societal effects of the end of life of plastics will be realized through this research program and also by engaging public high school students in hands-on research experiences. Additionally, an online clearinghouse for curriculum modules focused on sustainable materials will be established and made available to the public.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research program is to provide a foundation from which optimal polymeric compatibilizers for mixed plastic waste streams may be designed. As crystalline polymers dominate polymer recycling, research efforts will provide fundamental information that delivers molecular design characteristics for effective compatibilizers of phase separated crystalline polymer blends. Initial experiments will seek to identify crucial molecular characteristics that enable the co-crystallization of compatibilizers and homopolymers in phase separated crystalline polymer blends, thereby strengthening weak interfaces. These studies will be coupled with efforts to intercept telechelic intermediaries in the chemical recycling of polymers that may be used as value-added materials, such as their use as feedstocks to synthesize multiblock copolymers that compatibilize polymer waste stream-derived phase separated blends. The targeted molecular characteristics of these optimal compatibilizers will be informed by the molecular design efforts described above. The efficacy of these building blocks to form optimal compatibilizers in both passive and reactive processing schemes will be studied, with the goal of providing routes to jointly utilize chemical and mechanical recycling in developing improved materials from end-of-life plastics. This portion of the research program will therefore have an amplified environmental impact as it links and improves both chemical and mechanical recycling of polymers.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants can achieve complex responsive morphing via a pre-programmed anisotropic deformation of cell walls, which are made of hierarchically arranged fibrous polymers of different stiffness. This project aims to mimic the cell wall structures and functions by programming the anisotropy in fibrous polymers, while exploring molecular heterogeneity and phase separation that are ubiquitous in biology. The research will foster synergistic interactions across disciplines of polymer science and engineering, soft matter physics, and mechanical engineering to develop complex, multi-component, multi-phased networks. The research outcome will lead to potential applications in next generation smart sensors, actuators, soft robots, smart wearables, and 3D displays. It will also act as an effective tool to recruit and train students at all levels. Special emphasis will be given to underrepresented groups to carry out research on campus. The latest research results will be showcased at the Philadelphia Materials Day and Penn Science Caf Program. Shape morphing and reshaping of the polymer networks will create a significant outreach opportunity to excite the general public, thereby provoking and engaging interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). A symposium will be organized to feature research outcome and facilitate interactions with researchers from academic, industrial and national labs.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The planned research is based on multi-pronged activities, including design, synthesis, assembly, fabrication, characterization, and property optimization of a unique set of environmentally responsive polymers.  These are liquid crystal elastomers and their composites in the form of fibers with precisely controlled compositions, molecular orientations, architectures and mechanical responses from nano- to macroscales. Importantly, the research will offer a holistic view on how to dynamically configure the material?s intrinsic properties at the molecular level, that is chemical composition, phase separation, and crosslinking gradient, while keeping sights of geometric controls at the micro- to macroscale in the form of cylindrical confinement. The multi-component, multi-phased networks will broaden the materials palette to create more complex structures with precisely controlled anisotropy in material elasticity. Complex shapes in response to an external stimulus will be created to mimic plant cell wall structures and functions, with bonuses such as tunable photonic colors and mechanical adaptivity. The research outcome will enrich fundamental knowledge that relates the locally controllable degrees of freedom to the global geometries, shapes and shapeshifting paths. The insights could contribute to the development of the next generation composite fibers for potential applications such as smart sensors, actuators, 3D displays, soft robots, and smart textiles. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From bias in artificial intelligence to privacy violations on social media to systems that enable online harassment, when tech companies and researchers come under fire, people wonder: why are they not thinking about potential harms? Unintended consequences of technology are a significant social issue, both with respect to the harms that can result and widespread impact on perception of the computing field. However, even when technologists want to do the right thing, doing so requires consideration of future harms. This project will investigate an Ethical Futures Toolkit to help technology development teams be forward-thinking about ethical issues. Because the toolkit can be used in industry practice and in the classroom, this project is expected both to impact technology design directly and to contribute to ethics education for future technologists. This project will directly intervene in tech industry settings and educating computing professionals of the future. Through these interventions, this project has the potential to transform how technology is designed to better address ethical outcomes.<br/><br/>This project involves complementary methods and goals: (1) deriving a taxonomy of ethical pitfalls based on semantic analysis of media coverage and subsequent public reaction to existing tech ethics controversies; (2) using the taxonomy to drive speculation--the process of forecasting a possible future based on evidence from the past or present--about possible harms to technology users, with a focus on vulnerable and marginalized populations; and (3) analysis of the outcomes of speculative design exercises, focusing on ethical considerations of technologies. Based on insights from these studies, the final stage will be (4) the creation and iterative evaluation of an Ethical Futures Toolkit to be used within design teams to consider ethics early and in forward-thinking ways. Generating both data and societal impact, this evaluation stage will begin in project-based computing classes, later be integrated into startup competitions that mirror real-world business decision-making, and also be incorporated into work with tech industry partners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Likewise, users have little guidance surrounding technology when it comes to end-of-life planning. Drawing from the principles of hospice care, this project aims to support end-of-life planning for online accounts and data and the design of systems that support post-mortem data management.

Additionally, this research will focus on collaboration, identifying the specific properties of coordination that end-of-life planning involves - for example, delegation between stakeholders (some of which may not be known pre-mortem), interaction across long periods of time, and the inability to continue coordination post-mortem when plans go into effect. Together, this work will lead to theoretical insights that extend the state-of-the-art in human-centered design by developing frameworks for end-of-life design that address interdependencies between pre- and post-mortem interactions, as well as identifying fundamental limits to user-centeredness and developing frameworks for designing systems in a user's absence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This question is relevant to animal biodiversity, but also human health research, where one goal is to mitigate the behavioral impacts of experiences like social trauma. Though dynamic brain gene activity underlies experience-induced changes in behavior, the exact mechanisms that regulate the persistence of an experience are unclear. For example, experience may chemically alter brain DNA and therefore permanently change gene activity. However, a change in gene activity itself may be temporary, but lead to permanent changes in other factors that influence behavior, like brain structure. This study uses experimental manipulations of gene regulating mechanisms to determine whether certain ones reliably predict the longevity of an experience. The subject of these studies is the honey bee (Apis mellifera), a critical crop pollinator with a well-established relationship between social experience, brain gene activity, and aggressive behavior. Teams composed of students and beekeepers will complete research objectives and organize a summit that introduces high school students to research results and academic, industry, and non-profit career opportunities in Agricultural STEM. In addition to filling critical knowledge gaps in the study of behavioral diversity, this project will improve public science literacy and enhance partnerships among students and professionals inside and outside of academia. These steps contribute to an overall outcome of increased STEM workforce diversity, retention and career success.<br/><br/>In honey bees, adult defensive aggression and brain gene expression are persistently changed by social information accrued over the course of several days. To a degree, these phenotypes are also responsive to immediate information about threats to the beehive, enabling researchers to assess the circumstances under which persistent social experiences are updated by new information. Persistent effects are correlated with changes in brain DNA methylation and decreased lipid content in a peripheral endocrine tissue known to impact brain gene expression, the fat body. Thus, the longevity of social experience could be a result of the gene regulatory impacts of brain DNA methylation, endocrine signaling patterns, or both. Researchers use intricate adult social manipulations to produce bees that display similar levels of aggression, but with different gene regulatory underpinnings (variation in brain DNA methylation, fat body lipid content, or both). These bees will be used to examine which regulatory mechanisms predict the strength of response to new information, in terms of behavior, brain physiology (mitochondrial bioenergetics), and genome function (gene expression and chromatin accessibility measured using RNA-seq, bisulfite-seq and ATAC-seq). Larval bees also show persistent behavioral effects of their pre-adult environment. Manipulations of larvae and measures of adult behavior will be used to determine whether the longevity mechanisms identified in adults also apply to a second life stage. This study addresses critical knowledge gaps in the relationship between brain genomics and behavioral plasticity, including how peripheral systems and brain epigenetic mechanisms work together to regulate brain gene expression and behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is presently difficult to combine different materials in a 3D-printed part to create a complex device with multiple functionalities. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports  research to address this need by conducting fundamental research into the development of a multi-material additive manufacturing process. The research will provide the knowledge needed to support a new manufacturing process that can rapidly pattern different structural, conducting, and functional materials in a compact, three-dimensional layout with high precision and manufacturing speed. Parts made from combinations of electronic and structural materials in a designed layout are instrumental in the development of new materials and devices in the energy, healthcare, robotics, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries; thus, new manufacturing knowledge to rapidly print these parts can catalyze new technologies and capabilities for future products that have large economic and societal benefits. This research crosses several disciplines, including manufacturing, materials science, solid and fluid mechanics, and electro-kinetics. This project broadens participation in STEM by creating interactive learning activities based on 3D printing for K?12 and community college students and students with vision impairments. It will also develop an interdisciplinary course based on additive manufacturing to train the next generation of scientists, engineering leaders, and entrepreneurs who will address global challenges through advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>Current additive manufacturing methods which aim to create multifunctional materials lack the ability to quickly and easily exchange, pattern, and deposit multiple materials (including dielectric, structural, conducting and functional materials) in a complex 3D layout. This constraint stems from the inherent limitations in toolpaths, sequential writing, and deposition kinetics in existing 3D printing methods. This research will provide the foundational and transformational knowledge needed to improve 3D printing of multifunctional and multi-material devices by creating a continuous dynamic material-switching interface, controlling multiple materials with electrostatic charges, and creating a curing zone at the interface of immiscible fluid flows. The research will address the knowledge gap related to the mechanisms of the charge-programmed additive microfabrication process that underpin process speed, efficiency, resolution, feature sizes, and material properties and structures of the final parts. The research encompasses analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experimental studies to elucidate the effects of fluid flow, kinetics, catalysts, and material properties. The effort will demonstrate the fabrication of multifunctional all-in-one devices to validate the new manufacturing approach for use in novel smart materials, robotics and communication applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is well understood that muscles in the lower body produce forces and that tendons, which attach to muscles, transmit those forces to the skeleton, allowing animals to stand and walk. However, most current knowledge about muscle and tendon comes from experiments that study these tissues when functioning outside of the body. What is not well understood is how muscle and tendon function as an integrated system within the body and, in particular, how they function to meet the demands of maintaining balance while moving. This project will measure the mechanical behavior of muscle and tendon when the body responds to a push intended to challenge the ability to maintain balance. Integrated within the research component is training for two students from underrepresented groups pursuing a PhD in STEM. These students will gain knowledge in the field, develop first-hand experience in carrying out scientific experiments, and develop as leaders in the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. This CAREER project will impact society by translating new knowledge about how muscle and tendon function during movement by (1) contributing design principles for biologically inspired prosthetics and (2) developing teaching units and workshops offered to students at the Multicultural Education and Counseling through the Arts (MECA) non-profit organization, which serves K-12 grade students (~4,000 underserved youth) in Houston?s historic 6th Ward.<br/><br/>This CAREER project focuses on understanding the role of muscle-tendon units to control movement and stability using a live, freely moving animal, and integrates research, education, training, and outreach. Movement stabilization can be accomplished by several interacting mechanisms: a muscle?s force-modulating properties, the energy-modulating capacity of variable-stiffness tendon springs, and the co-behavior of agonist-antagonist muscle-tendon units. The project?s primary research objectives and outcomes are to use a work-energy based framework to: (1) Determine the muscle-tendon unit properties that modulate the rapid flow of energy absorption during active lengthening in situ. (2) Determine the properties that allow ankle joint agonist-antagonist muscle-tendon units to govern the response of destabilizing perturbations elicited during standing in vivo. (3) Determine the properties that allow ankle joint agonist-antagonist muscle-tendon units to govern the response of destabilizing perturbations elicited during walking in vivo. The experimental approach involves the use of a custom-built, high performance linear actuator to elicit unexpected perturbations to the body during standing and walking. Custom sensors implanted into muscle-tendon tissue and force platform measurements are used to understand the response to perturbations at multiple scales, from muscle-tendon units that control ankle joint function to whole body mechanics. In addition, the project will implement an educational outreach plan that will advance a summer STEM camp curriculum that serves K-12th graders from underrepresented groups.

Drought can negatively impact riverine ecosystems?particularly if streams that generally flow year-round become intermittent. Climatic droughts can isolate entire portions of the river network, and synchronize fluctuations in abundance of aquatic organisms across large spatial scales. How these isolation and synchronization processes may endanger aquatic species directly, or indirectly by modifying species interactions, remains largely unknown. Here I propose to address this gap by combining long-term monitoring and field experiments in an intermittent river network in Pinnacles National Park, with large-scale modeling of stream biodiversity and hydrology data. This CAREER integrates research and education goals, and will provide hands-on experience to undergraduate students on stream sensor instrumentation, biodiversity sampling, and analysis of time-series data. It will also create an Ecological Drought Collaboratory spanning academic, government, and museum institutions researching drought-related questions.<br/><br/>Despite much research on freshwater biodiversity responses to drought, it remains difficult to predict responses at high levels of biological organization (food webs and metacommunities). This is largely because biotic interactions can dampen or amplify impacts of abiotic stress on each species. Moreover, drought may erode the capacity of organisms to disperse and recolonize from other sources (resilience strategists), or to persist locally and bounce back after drying events (resistance strategists). Through a combination of approaches that span spatio-temporal scales and disciplines (metacommunity ecology, stream hydrology, time-series analysis), the investigator will determine the net contribution of drought to metacommunity stability. The specific goals of this project are: (i) understanding the controls of metacommunity stability in streams, with a focus on the relatively understudied mechanisms of drought-driven dispersal limitation and synchrony; (ii) determining to what extent recent climatic droughts, in isolation or in conjunction with human activities, synchronized flow regimes within and across river networks; and (iii) forecasting the vulnerability of U.S. stream invertebrates and fishes to future droughts, considering not only local biotic and abiotic change (temperature and flow) but also network-level shifts in habitat portfolio and connectivity. This work will fill a critical gap in our mechanistic understanding of metacommunity dynamics in dendritic networks, and will help better quantify risk of freshwater biodiversity loss under increasingly-variable climates. Integrated educational objectives targeting undergraduate and graduate students, conservation practitioners, and the public will promote understanding of how biodiversity persists in river networks. This increased understanding should improve conservation outcomes via robust design of environmental flows and habitat restoration actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research is needed to examine models of mathematics teacher professional development that explicitly addresses bias reduction. The goal of this project is to study the design and development of community-centered, job-embedded professional development for classroom teachers that supports bias reduction. The project team will partner with three school districts serving racially, ethnically, linguistically, and socio-economically diverse communities, for a two-year professional development program. The aim is to reduce bias through: analyzing and designing mathematics teaching with colleagues, students, and families to create classrooms and schools based on community-centered mathematics; engaging in anti-bias teaching routines; and building relationships with parents, caretakers, and community members. The project team will study teacher leader professional development, including the professional development model, framework, and tools, along with what teacher leaders across district contexts and grade-levels take up and use in their instructional practice.  This will potentially have wider implications for supporting more equitable mathematics teaching and leadership. Project activities, resources, and tools will be shared with the broader community of mathematics educators and researchers for use in other contexts. <br/><br/>The goal of this two-phase, design based research project is to iteratively design and research teacher leaders? (TLs) participation in community-centered, job-embedded professional development and investigate their subsequent impact on classrooms, schools, and districts. The project builds on the existing Math Studio professional development model to create a Community Centered Math Studio, integrating the Anti-bias Mathematics Education Framework into the work. The project seeks to understand how the professional development model supports the development of teacher leaders' knowledge, dispositions, and practices for teaching and leading anti-bias mathematics education, and how teachers' subsequent classroom practice can cultivate students' mathematical engagement, discourse, and interests. The project will measure aspects of teacher knowledge and classroom practice by integrating existing classroom observation rubrics and STEM interest surveys to assess the impact on teacher classroom practice and student outcomes. The project will engage 12 TLs and approximately 60 additional teachers working with those TLs in two years of professional development using the Community Centered Math Studio Model to support anti-bias mathematics teaching. Data will be collected for all teachers related to their participation in the professional learning, with six teachers being followed for additional data collection and in-depth case studies. The project's outcomes will contribute to theories of how TLs build adaptive expertise for teaching and leading to reduce bias in classrooms, departments, schools, and districts. In addition, the project will contribute new and adapted research instruments on anti-bias teaching and leading.

Success in this project will transform how electrolytes are designed and implemented using a computational approach before costly synthesis and testing.

The proposed methods will leverage a novel combination of two recent breakthroughs, making this an ideal time to investigate electrolyte degradation problem from a computational perspective. First, we will use modern semi-empirical quantum chemistry to provide the simulation throughout required to comprehensively describe the complex reaction networks associated with electrolyte degradation. Second, we will apply transfer learning models to improve the accuracy of describing reactions in condensed phases and at electrode interfaces. In combination, these strategies will address the tradeoff between computational accuracy and cost that has limited the application of reaction network characterizations to liquid electrolytes. These simulation methodologies will initially be applied to liquid electrolyte formulations that have widespread usage in contemporary Li-ion and post Li-ion batteries. Despite the fact that these are established electrolytes, the degradation chemistry that drives solid-electrolyte interphase formation and electrolyte-related failure is still incompletely resolved. Thus, by focusing on these electrolyte chemistries, we will be able to validate our characterization methodology while also providing the first complete view of the degradation reactions that occur in these electrolytes. The reaction data generated by these characterizations will also be used to create reaction databases that will facilitate machine learning activities aimed at prioritizing or even circumventing more costly physics-based simulations of electrolytes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this CAREER award, the PI intends to integrate laboratory and field studies to increase understanding of pesticide oxidation reactions on particles and their deposition. State-of-the-art instrumentation is used to characterize reactants and products as well as components in field samples.

Regional transport and deposition will be determined through measurements performed at 4 sites in a regional network in Ohio, where herbicides are regularly used on corn and soybean fields. Air mass back trajectories and statistical testing of pesticide levels in samples across sites and seasons will aid in assessing whether local or regional sources dominate pesticide deposition.

Even its most studied element ? the return stroke ? remains to be fully quantified. A central question in lightning physics has to do with how the widely-observed asymmetry in positive- and negative-leader propagation maps into the overall contrasting differences between cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes of both positive and negative polarities (leader is the term used to describe the elongation lightning channel before its connection to the ground). One important example is the origin of recoil leaders, which are observed to only retrace the channels of positively-charged leader channels. Recoil leaders in its turn may be the root cause for the asymmetry in stroke multiplicity between positive and negative CGs. Understanding the physics of lightning at a fundamental level is required for quantifying its effects in our planet's atmosphere (e.g., production of nitrogen oxide compounds) and to mitigate its societal impacts (e.g., power transmission and distribution disruptions). Through the development of novel computer models, this project addresses outstanding questions in lightning physics outlined in the second paragraph below. The broader impacts of this project are heavily tied with the educational plan. The backbone of our educational plan is to develop teaching strategies based on the simple idea that a physics instructor can use lightning and thunderstorms ? something that any student is familiar with ? to introduce complex physics concepts.<br/> <br/>This project tackles two key problems in lightning physics. Problem 1: When leader channels connect to a ground structure, a strong current surge known as the return stroke travels upward. The most widely-employed type of return stroke model assumes that the wave propagation velocity and its attenuation with height are free parameters of the model. Despite a few attempts from previous investigation, a detailed characterization of the return stroke dynamics from first-principles remains an open problem. Problem 2: Positive and negative leaders have different propagation mechanisms (different velocities and channel branching rates, and continuous vs. stepped propagation). It has been hypothesized that this polarity asymmetry maps into how differently current cutoff and recoil leader formation takes place in positive and negative CG flashes. However, there is no computational simulation tool available that can fully answer this complicated question. The main goal of this project is to advance the current understand of lightning by introducing two novel physics-based models to describe the main stages of a lightning flash, and address the two problems outlined above: (1) a return stroke model that calculates the velocity of current and optical luminosity waves and their attenuation as they propagate upward towards the cloud, and (2) a stochastic, 3-dimensional model of the leader channel network, which accounts for probabilistic branching and has different propagation mechanisms for positive and negative extremities. The most important advance aimed here is the coupling of these two electrodynamics models with a realistic treatment of the plasma channel's nonlinear resistance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research focuses on understanding how early experiences shape the brain, and how brain development supports learning, which can be leveraged to individualize educational interventions and generate new strategies for broadening participation in STEM. The project is supported by a CAREER award through the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental research on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The project involves three studies that will investigate early science learning by studying cognitive and behavioral predictors of early science learning and will use structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study neural networks. In the first study, 144 children between the ages of five- and seven-years-old will be recruited from schools and after-school programs in low-income neighborhoods. Children will participate in MRI and cognitive assessments, as well as eight science lessons designed to align with Next Generation Science Standards. Parents will complete questionnaires about children?s early experiences. The study will test whether exposures to stress and cognitive enrichment are associated with the development of learning, memory, and motivation systems, and whether connectivity in these neural systems predicts science learning. In a separate longitudinal study, 200 two-year-old children from low-income families will be randomly assigned to an intervention that includes weekly home visiting by an early learning specialist or to a control condition that includes information about physical health. In the first year of this study, parents will complete questionnaires about their children?s experiences and development. In the subsequent years of the study, children will complete cognitive measures and MRI and participate in science lessons. This longitudinal design will allow the researchers to assess whether early cognitive enrichment causally influences learning, memory, and motivation systems in the brain, as well as children?s ability to learn science in Kindergarten. A final experimental study will investigate the efficacy of specific pedagogical approaches for enhancing children?s learning. The study will examine whether encouraging children to ask questions improves their learning and other behavioral aspects of curiosity. Together, these studies will provide insights into how to best support children?s early science learning, which will be shared with parents and educators through partnerships with community organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teachers, even with positive intentions, have biases, causing them to treat students differently and impacting how they distribute students? opportunities to learn in K-12 mathematics classrooms. Research is needed to examine models of mathematics teacher professional development that explicitly addresses bias reduction. The goal of this project is to study the design and development of community-centered, job-embedded professional development for classroom teachers that supports bias reduction. The project team will partner with three school districts serving racially, ethnically, linguistically, and socio-economically diverse communities, for a two-year professional development program. The aim is to reduce bias through: analyzing and designing mathematics teaching with colleagues, students, and families to create classrooms and schools based on community-centered mathematics; engaging in anti-bias teaching routines; and building relationships with parents, caretakers, and community members. The project team will study teacher leader professional development, including the professional development model, framework, and tools, along with what teacher leaders across district contexts and grade-levels take up and use in their instructional practice.  This will potentially have wider implications for supporting more equitable mathematics teaching and leadership. Project activities, resources, and tools will be shared with the broader community of mathematics educators and researchers for use in other contexts. <br/><br/>The goal of this two-phase, design based research project is to iteratively design and research teacher leaders? (TLs) participation in community-centered, job-embedded professional development and investigate their subsequent impact on classrooms, schools, and districts. The project builds on the existing Math Studio professional development model to create a Community Centered Math Studio, integrating the Anti-bias Mathematics Education Framework into the work. The project seeks to understand how the professional development model supports the development of teacher leaders' knowledge, dispositions, and practices for teaching and leading anti-bias mathematics education, and how teachers' subsequent classroom practice can cultivate students' mathematical engagement, discourse, and interests. The project will measure aspects of teacher knowledge and classroom practice by integrating existing classroom observation rubrics and STEM interest surveys to assess the impact on teacher classroom practice and student outcomes. The project will engage 12 TLs and approximately 60 additional teachers working with those TLs in two years of professional development using the Community Centered Math Studio Model to support anti-bias mathematics teaching. Data will be collected for all teachers related to their participation in the professional learning, with six teachers being followed for additional data collection and in-depth case studies. The project's outcomes will contribute to theories of how TLs build adaptive expertise for teaching and leading to reduce bias in classrooms, departments, schools, and districts. In addition, the project will contribute new and adapted research instruments on anti-bias teaching and leading.

HEAs are a relatively new class of engineering materials that show significant promise for replacing traditional engineering alloys, such as steel, in high temperature and load-bearing applications. HEAs are unique because they are typically composed of five elements in approximately equal proportions, whereas traditional engineering alloys, such as conventional steel, have one base alloying element (e.g. iron) which makes up at least 95% of the composition. Determining properties of HEAs using physics-based simulations, however, are challenging because of the large computational resources required to handle the multiple elements and atomic configurations of HEAs. The PI and her team will investigate an important mechanical property of HEAs, known as creep failure, which is the time-dependent and permanent deformation of a material under applied load or stress. A fundamental understanding of creep failure in these materials could potentially lead to the replacement of traditional engineering alloys with HEAs that could create faster, more fuel-efficient, and less costly machines. <br/><br/>This award also supports an education plan which is aimed at (i) developing and delivering research-focused workshops to undergraduates, and (ii) facilitating faculty involvement in the current mentoring program.

HEAs are a relatively new class of engineering materials that show significant promise for replacing traditional, single-principal element engineering alloys in high temperature or structural engineering applications. However, HEAs pose several challenges when atomistic-level calculations are used to determine their properties, since (i) such calculations are more time consuming than those for ordered systems with an equivalent number of atoms, (ii) they require averaging of several atomic configuration permutations of a structure when a defect is present, and (iii) a model for predicting diffusivity in non-dilute random structures does not exist for body-centered cubic materials at the atomic level.  <br/><br/>Four research objectives will be completed to solve the challenges of applying atomistic-level calculations to HEAs. First, an efficient first-principles methodology validated with statistical inference will be developed for structures with point and planar defects. The inferential statistics method allows the user to select an appropriate error bar based on the sample set of a larger, global population. Second, a diffusion model for calculating atomic jump frequencies and diffusion coefficients in HEAs will be developed by combining Manning?s theory of diffusivity in random alloys with a novel frequency model for paired solutes in a body-centered cubic host lattice. When combined with inferential statistics, an efficient method for calculating the diffusion coefficients of each element in the HEA will be obtained. Third, stacking fault energy and elastic constants will be calculated by applying the inferential statistics method. The effect of impurity segregation on stacking fault energy in body-centered cubic HEAs will be explored. Finally, the calculated diffusion and deformation properties will be incorporated into a universal secondary creep law. Through a series of relationships in the universal creep law, contributions to creep behavior from deformation and diffusion properties will be investigated. This project will provide valuable data that is necessary to focus future experimental and computational research on HEA systems, while giving the materials science community a framework that can be used for efficient property determination in other engineering alloys.<br/><br/>This award also supports an education plan which is aimed at (i) developing and delivering research-focused workshops to undergraduates, and (ii) facilitating faculty involvement in the current mentoring program.

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to Prairie View A&M University will support research in Civil and Environmental Engineering.  The project will explore a preliminary design model that would serve as a framework to evaluate the use of synthetic turf as a landfill top cover, and will engage undergraduate students from the institution who pursue degrees and careers in Civil and Environmental Engineering.<br/><br/>The sustainable and cost-effective design of final cover depends on the design methodology, appropriate materials selection, effective construction, and operation of the cover. Typical final cover systems employed for waste containment still have issues with construction difficulties, cost, local climatic factors, and most importantly, performance degradation over time. The fundamental objective of the proposed project is to utilize a relatively new material ?Synthetic Turf? as landfill top cover and investigate if the engineered (synthetic) turf cover can improve the environmental and economical sustainability compared to the typical cover methods. The technical scope of the project includes the estimation of cover soil moisture and pore water pressure, analyzing the critical depth of soil moisture variation, investigating the field soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), examining of the effect of climatic factors on cover hydrology, and numerical modeling to simulate the field behavior of the cover systems. To determine the feasibility of the engineered turf cover and pursue the technical tasks of the project, a field pilot study will be conducted that includes side-by-side construction of three types of cover (Engineered Turf Cover, Traditional Clay Cover, and ET Cover). The field installation includes high-performance moisture and temperature sensors, tensiometers, and a weather station. The project also involves the pre-construction laboratory characterization of the cover soil to model efficient cover construction and standardize the numerical simulation.

Despite their important role in health and diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, and chronic wounds, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating lymphatic vessel formation. By designing biomaterials to control stem cell differentiation, this CAREER project seeks to determine the roles of oxygen signaling and environmental cues in regulating lymphatic vessel formation during early development. Ultimately, the proposed research promises to uncover the mechanism underlying lymphatic growth. In addition, the integrated education and outreach programs aim to promote learning at all levels by focusing on early engagement of students in service learning to inspire their interests in STEM fields. This project supports education and broadening participation by: (1) stimulating interests in stem cell research through a science exhibit; (2) introducing middle school students to the emerging field of biomaterials using hands-on modules; and (3) educating high school teachers and students through NSF?s Research Experience for Teachers (RET) on contemporary topics in bioengineering.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to use engineering principles to make breakthroughs in stem cell differentiation and lymphatic vessel morphogenesis, while integrating research with education and training of engineers for the future workforce. Toward this goal, this CAREER project aims to integrate research and education programs dedicated to the transdisciplinary investigation of functional interactions between hypoxia-signaling pathways and matrix-driven cues that are essential for stem cell differentiation into lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and eventually their morphogenesis to form lymphatic vasculatures. Specifically, the three fundamental questions to be addressed are: (1) How do changes in oxygen concentrations during the early separation process between the blood and lymphatic networks affect the fate of vascular progenitor cells into LECs? (2) How are matrix types (e.g., hyaluronic acid, collagen) and properties (e.g., stiffness, mesh size, degradation) altered during lymphatic morphogenesis and network assembly in vitro? and (3) What functional interactions occur between hypoxia and matrix-driven cues during lymphatic network assembly? To answer these important questions, the proposed research will utilize a transdisciplinary approach that covers many fields from polymer science to stem cell and lymphatic biology. Collectively, this project will develop fundamental knowledge that can aid in stimulating lymphatic vessel growth, enabling effective and robust cell-based therapies, as well as in vitro models for diseases and drug development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

P-PBL is a powerful approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics, and provides students with opportunities to engage in authentic mathematical practices. For example, conjecturing in mathematics, a form of problem posing, often plays an important role in solving complex problems, and problem posing is an important component of mathematical modeling. Yet despite its importance, widely used curriculum materials fail to incorporate P-PBL in substantial and consistent ways, leaving teachers with few resources to enact this process. This project will develop problem-posing lessons and illustrative cases of teachers implementing P-PBL that will not only support teachers to develop a vision of what P-PBL looks like and how to implement it in their own classrooms, but will also serve as rich resources for professional development (PD) providers. This project will generate valuable findings about teaching using problem posing for district administrators, mathematics teachers, educators, and researchers as well as curriculum developers and policy makers. The team will develop and pilot a set of 20?30 research-based P-PBL cases that provide critical details for the implementation of P-PBL and reveal ?lessons learned? from the development process. <br/><br/>The project promises broader impact on the field of mathematics education as the first goal is to support teachers to teach mathematics through engaging their students in mathematical problem posing. By guiding students to construct and investigate their own problems, P-PBL both helps to create mathematical learning opportunities and develops students? mathematical agency and positive mathematical identities. A networked improvement community of teachers and researchers will integrate problem posing into daily mathematics instruction and continuously improve the quality of P-PBL through iterative task and lesson design. The intellectual merit of this project is its contribution of new and important insights about teaching mathematics through problem posing. This will be realized through the second project goal which is to longitudinally investigate the promise of supporting teachers to teach with P-PBL for enhancing teachers? instructional practice and students? learning. A quasi-experimental design coupled with design-based research methodology and improvement science will be used to understand how, when, and why P-PBL works in practice. Specifically, we plan to follow a sample of 36 teachers and their approximately 3,600 students from six middle schools for multiple years to longitudinally explore the promise of P-PBL for developing teachers? beliefs about problem posing, their beliefs about P-PBL, and their actual instructional practice. We will also investigate students? learning as measured by problem-posing performance, problem-solving performance, and mathematics disposition. The findings of the project will add not only to the field?s understanding of the promise of supporting teachers to integrate P-PBL into their mathematics instruction, but also to its understanding of the challenges that teachers face when engaging in a networked improvement community that is focused on improving tasks and lessons by integrating P-PBL.  <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Although climate models predict continued increases in the severity of floods and losses in crop productivity, they currently do not include the feedback loops for how the landscape changes over time. Virtually all models predicting impacts of climate change rely on topographic and soil maps that are assumed to stay the same. We know these assumptions are incorrect, but those static inputs are used because they are the best data available. The ultimate goal of this project is to assemble an erosion-deposition model for landscapes where the rate of sediment transport, not rate of weathering, limits the amount that those processes change the topography and soil properties of hillslopes. The recent implementation of highly accurate, remotely sensed elevation measurements more than a decade apart offers a unique opportunity to validate such a model at the regional scale. This knowledge is crucial for incorporating landscape change into models that predict impacts of climate change, such as effects on flooding and crop productivity. The model will also be used to generate scenarios of landscape change from real landscapes, which can be explored and employed as an educational tool through a publicly accessible, web map interface. Training and curriculum materials will be developed in collaboration with educators experienced with delivering Earth Science content to K12 students.<br/><br/>The major barriers limiting the use of hillslope erosion-deposition models to predict topographic change for low relief landscapes are the disciplinary divides between geomorphology and soil science as well as the absence of data for full validation. Geomorphology studies tend to focus on high-relief landscapes. In contrast, soil scientists typically investigate lower relief, agricultural areas in the context of mass removed and effects on soil properties, such as carbon content. Therefore, an integrated landscape model is needed that combines the theories of geomorphology and soil science to predict landscape change in the areas that currently experience the most active erosion and that are crucial to securing food and feed needs in the future. The PI will study hillslope erosion-deposition models and calibrate them to multiple landform regions within the USA Corn Belt. These models will be validated and evaluated through the elevation differences observed between the 2009 and 2020 LiDAR-based elevation data collected for the state of Iowa. This project is jointly funded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics (GLD) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the lack of research opportunities in engineering and other STEM-related fields prevents undergraduates from underrepresented groups from considering STEM as a viable and rewarding career path. To improve this situation, this Imaging in Medicine and Biology for Underrepresented Minorities REU site will provide an environment for underrepresented minorities (URM) undergraduates to complete individual research projects under the mentorship of leaders in their respective fields, in a world-class interdisciplinary research environment.  The Imaging in Medicine and Biology for Underrepresented Minorities REU site will also provide structured enrichment programs to participants that will allow students to develop critical skills needed to be successful in STEM graduate education (GRE preparation, time management, oral/written presentation). The University of Rochester (UR) is an ideal setting for this REU site; it is the home of the Rochester Center for Biomedical Ultrasound (RCBU), the Institute of Optics, the Goergen Institute for Data Science (GIDS), and the Del Monte Institute of Neuroscience?members of which will serve as mentors in this REU site. Imaging is crucial to medicine (disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring), but it is also the driving force behind many transformative technologies, including robotics, self-driving cars, and facial recognition. At its foundation, imaging is a highly multidisciplinary field that combines various engineering disciplines (e.g., electrical engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, materials science, and medicine) to create a cohesive whole. Like other disciplines, artificial intelligence is changing imaging. It requires diverse teams to solve new challenges, which requires us to train and expand the diversity of researchers capable of making meaningful contributions to imaging science and engineering. <br/><br/>This REU program will provide ten students annually with exciting interdisciplinary research opportunities in computational imaging, optical imaging, and ultrasonic imaging science with mentors in disciplines ranging from engineering to computer science to neuroscience to microbiology. The REU site program will organize workshops on career development, community colloquiums, scientific research in chosen laboratories, and a bootcamp on scientific programming focusing on fundamental medical imaging techniques. Students will regularly meet with professional and research mentors to formulate the next steps regarding appropriate graduate programs that align with research interests discovered during the REU experience. Participants in the REU site will complete individual projects under the mentorship of leaders in their respective fields. In these projects, participants will use computational, optical, or ultrasound imaging techniques to solve significant medicine and biology problems. Participants will interact with their professional advisors to demystify the graduate school program and improve their professional skills. Other planned activities will include community colloquiums, a MATLAB programming bootcamp that teaches students image processing techniques such as image segmentation, principal component analysis, and multidimensional filter design, which are fundamental to medical imaging. Students will work with their professional and research mentors to formulate the next steps to pursue their research interests. Research mentors in the proposed REU will teach participants how to develop their research project; collect data from several imaging modalities (functional ultrasound, shear wave elastography, bioluminescence, micro-CT, magnetic resonance imaging); design algorithms for image analysis, 2D and 3D image reconstructions, computer vision; perform experiments on rodents, cell culture, and phantoms; and iteratively refine the solutions. Students will present their research findings to other students, mentors, and the research community at UR at a research symposium at the end of the 10-week research experience. Students will also be encouraged to submit their research findings to national conferences or co-author peer-reviewed publications. Three thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this REU site: 1) ultrasonic Imaging, 2) computational Imaging, and 3) optical Imaging.<br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This diversity likely evolved due to the complex environmental and geological history of this region. However, exactly how plant diversity arose from the combination of mountain uplift, the development of new habitats, and species interactions is unclear. This research aims to understand how these factors led to plant diversity in cloud forests and high-elevation grasslands. The researchers will develop new software to compare plant genomes to understand the ancestry of four groups of flowering plants in the Andes. The project will also result in new mathematical models to test the importance of different factors in shaping diversity in these plant groups. These new methods will have broad application to studies of biodiversity in the Andes and beyond. Additionally, this project aims to train the next generation of scientists in the study of biodiversity through a variety of interrelated activities, including: (1) a course for undergraduates to do guided genomic research; (2) collaborative training for students; and (3) computational training for diverse students.<br/><br/>The project will first establish well-supported phylogenetic hypotheses for each of the four focal clades of Andean plants using low-coverage and targeted genome sequence data. Samples will be collected from Colombia as well as museums. This work highlights the importance of natural history collections in cutting-edge biological research, and new fieldwork will add to those collections. A component of the research will be to develop new approaches to address complexities common in plant genomes, including polyploidy and paralogy, that can affect estimates of evolutionary relationships. These methods will be made available through open-source software such that other researchers can easily estimate phylogenies and examine support for phylogenetic hypotheses using sequence data. Second, the project will develop new models that jointly infer the roles of dispersal and trait evolution in species diversification. These methods will be applied to phylogenomic, morphological, and distribution data collected for this project. These methods will also be made publicly available for widespread use. Finally, by comparing the roles of biogeographic and ecological processes in generating diversity in these clades, the research will address the generality or idiosyncrasy of the processes facilitating rapid radiation in tropical Andean plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this day, how the complex interactions found in biological systems produce their emergent properties and behaviors remains elusive (and is considered one of the grand challenges of biology). Theoretical mathematics offers a possible route forward, and one that could, in time, have a profound influence on biology. This research project aims to cut through the complexity of biological models and elucidate the mechanisms that determine cellular behavior. Further, this project develops a mathematical framework for the algorithmic construction of chemically implemented neural networks, which are a popular means of performing machine learning and ""artificial intelligence."" Finally, this project aims to develop new computational methods that can address currently infeasible problems related to the long-term behavior of biological processes. The project will not only greatly enhance our understanding of biological systems but will also serve as a fertile training ground for the next generation of scientists at the intersection of mathematics and biology. A key focus is on building research teams that involve faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, with a special emphasis towards the recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>Discrete-space, continuous-time Markov chain models are commonly used to model biological interaction networks, including gene regulatory networks, viral infections, signaling systems, neuronal networks, etc. These models can be depicted via a reaction graph, which is a graphical representation of the interactions between the constituent molecules of the model. Interaction networks can be extraordinarily complex; for example, there are over 20,000 genes in the human genome and the proteins they encode may be modified in myriad ways. Further, cellular systems often have different sub-systems that operate on multiple different scales (both temporally and in terms of copy numbers), with the species operating at one scale greatly influencing those at a different scale. Hidden within this complexity there are often underlying structures that, if properly quantified, give great insight into the dynamical or stationary behavior of the system. The first part of this project aims to develop mathematical theory that relates the emergent properties of these systems with easily checked properties of the associated reaction graphs, and their sub-graphs. A second part focuses on the development of biochemical reaction networks that implement neural networks and machine learning algorithms. Here the goal is not solely rooted in the algorithmic construction of such networks, but also in developing a proper mathematical framework for this research area. A final part focuses on algorithm development (and analysis) for the unbiased estimation of stationary distributions for the stochastic models commonly utilized for biological interaction networks. The primary tools and methods utilized by the investigator and his students are from probability theory, stochastic analysis, dynamical systems theory, chemical reaction network theory, and computational mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teachers, even with positive intentions, have biases, causing them to treat students differently and impacting how they distribute students? opportunities to learn in K-12 mathematics classrooms. Research is needed to examine models of mathematics teacher professional development that explicitly addresses bias reduction. The goal of this project is to study the design and development of community-centered, job-embedded professional development for classroom teachers that supports bias reduction. The project team will partner with three school districts serving racially, ethnically, linguistically, and socio-economically diverse communities, for a two-year professional development program. The aim is to reduce bias through: analyzing and designing mathematics teaching with colleagues, students, and families to create classrooms and schools based on community-centered mathematics; engaging in anti-bias teaching routines; and building relationships with parents, caretakers, and community members. The project team will study teacher leader professional development, including the professional development model, framework, and tools, along with what teacher leaders across district contexts and grade-levels take up and use in their instructional practice.  This will potentially have wider implications for supporting more equitable mathematics teaching and leadership. Project activities, resources, and tools will be shared with the broader community of mathematics educators and researchers for use in other contexts. <br/><br/>The goal of this two-phase, design based research project is to iteratively design and research teacher leaders? (TLs) participation in community-centered, job-embedded professional development and investigate their subsequent impact on classrooms, schools, and districts. The project builds on the existing Math Studio professional development model to create a Community Centered Math Studio, integrating the Anti-bias Mathematics Education Framework into the work. The project seeks to understand how the professional development model supports the development of teacher leaders' knowledge, dispositions, and practices for teaching and leading anti-bias mathematics education, and how teachers' subsequent classroom practice can cultivate students' mathematical engagement, discourse, and interests. The project will measure aspects of teacher knowledge and classroom practice by integrating existing classroom observation rubrics and STEM interest surveys to assess the impact on teacher classroom practice and student outcomes. The project will engage 12 TLs and approximately 60 additional teachers working with those TLs in two years of professional development using the Community Centered Math Studio Model to support anti-bias mathematics teaching. Data will be collected for all teachers related to their participation in the professional learning, with six teachers being followed for additional data collection and in-depth case studies. The project's outcomes will contribute to theories of how TLs build adaptive expertise for teaching and leading to reduce bias in classrooms, departments, schools, and districts. In addition, the project will contribute new and adapted research instruments on anti-bias teaching and leading.

As a result, significant skills gaps have emerged within advanced manufacturing industries. These industries need multi-functional engineering technicians who have both manufacturing and engineering skillsets. Such skills are embedded in mechatronics, an engineering discipline that integrates mechanical, electrical, and programmable engineering technologies.  Mirroring national trends, the Denver metropolitan area has seen a significant increase in the number of advanced manufacturing employers. This project aims to help meet this regional workforce need for qualified mechatronics technicians.  To do so, the project will update its current Associate of Applied Science in Mechatronics Engineering Technology to be more responsive to industry needs.  It will also launch new efforts to increase recruitment and success of students in this degree program.<br/><br/>The project aims to improve the Mechatronics degree program and expand the number of students earning the degree and entering the regional workforce.  To do so, the project team will collaborate with its Business and Industry Leadership Team to guide experiential learning and align the curriculum more closely with industry needs.  It will expand access to the program by developing concurrent enrollment opportunities for high school students and recruiting from partnering workforce centers.  A new position called ?Navigator? will lead recruitment efforts, as well as provide mechatronics students with advising, support, and career connections.

Bird lungs have held a special place in this regard, because their design is so radically different from mammalian lungs, and it has been thought that one-way airflow is related to the energetic demands of flight. However, the lungs of other non-flying vertebrate animals, including snakes, turtles, and chameleons, also differ from those of mammals. This research will provide a better understanding of how aerodynamic valves in the lungs of reptiles give rise to one-way airflow, the physiological significance of these patterns of flow, and their distribution across vertebrate animals. It will reveal fundamental, form-function relationships linking lung structures to patterns of airflow in reptiles and amphibians; enhance understanding of the effects of these patterns of airflow on gas exchange, respiratory water loss, and heat loss; and be applied to reconstruction of the respiratory systems of extinct tetrapods. The project also includes significant educational and outreach activities, including science communication training for lab personnel, participation in public-education, distance-learning programs run by Utah's Hogle Zoo, and development of virtual reality infrastructure for research, outreach, and teaching.<br/><br/>Three primary activities will result from the proposed research. (1) A phyletic survey will be made of patterns of airflow in the lungs of amphibians and reptiles. (2) Tests of the following hypotheses for the mechanistic basis of pulmonary aerodynamic valves will be made by measurements and visualizations of patterns of airflow, computational fluid dynamics simulations, and physical models: i) that turtles have a pulmonary Tesla valve; ii) that the expiratory valve of archosaurs functions like an internal nozzle, where a Coanda surface induces and amplifies flow; iii) that the expiratory valve arises from a caudal guiding dam. (3) Balloon catheters will be implanted into the lungs of alligators which will allow unidirectional flow to be converted to tidal airflow. Under these two flow regimes hypotheses for the functional significance of aerodynamic valves will be tested: i) that alligators have counter-current or cross-current gas exchange; ii) that unidirectional flow reduces rates of evaporative water and heat loss, and improves wash-out of lung CO2 and wash-in of O2. Measurements will made of O2 extraction and CO2 removal with each breath, rates of lung washout of CO2, rates of respiratory evaporative water loss and heat loss, and rates of ventilation relative to rates O2 consumption and CO2 excretion. The proposed research has four strands of educational and outreach broader impacts: 1) Recruitment of underrepresented participants into STEM; 2) Training of lab personnel in science communication, working closely with the Natural History Museum of Utah; 3) Outreach to the lay community, including K-12 schools, through distance-learning programs of Utah's Hogle Zoo; 4) Development of virtual reality infrastructure for research, outreach, and teaching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current and predicted climatic conditions are characterized by increased magnitude or variability in heat and drought, which has the potential to threaten the productivity of natural and agricultural plant systems. Sustaining the steadily growing human population will require corresponding increases in the efficiency of agricultural systems. The overarching aim of this work is to better understand how light availability, plant architecture, and leaf surface temperature interact to determine the efficiency of plant systems with respect to input resources. In order to examine such processes, novel experimental and analytical techniques will be used that allow for measurement and prediction of interactions between plant structure and function in three dimensions. Educational activities associated with this project will produce a novel model/data visualization tool that will help to educate the next generation of plant scientists through outreach activities. New three-dimensional plant modeling software will be developed that will allow students to explore scientific questions related to plant-environment interactions in an immersive virtual environment. This project will engage and mentor students at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, and provide interdisciplinary training that spans the biological, engineering, and computer sciences. <br/><br/>The water-related costs associated with CO2 uptake for photosynthesis are managed by plants in the short-term by varying the aperture of stomatal pores in response to environmental conditions to avoid excessive water loss and can also be augmented in the long-term by varying canopy architecture (e.g., leaf angle and area distributions) and underlying physiological function. A complete mechanistic theoretical basis that describes how plants simultaneously control stomatal aperture, canopy architecture, and physiological parameters in order to maximize carbon gain with respect to water loss has remained elusive, and represents a significant knowledge gap that has inhibited efforts to quantitatively describe plant responses to drought stress, and ultimately to predict plant responses to future climate scenarios characterized by elevated temperatures and precipitation variability. This project proposes to advance research and education in plant water-use efficiency by fusing novel experimental, modeling, and visualization techniques to better understand the roles of simultaneous variation in light, temperature, and canopy architecture in optimization of gas exchange by plants across spatial and temporal scales. Experimental research will span leaf to whole-plant scales, and from a controlled environment to natural landscapes that traverse a gradient in temperature and precipitation. High-fidelity functional-structural plant models will be used to facilitate theoretical analyses that complement experimental data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The hypothesis underlying this project is that new techniques in academic computer science (such as purely functional architectures, machine learning, and low-latency real-time distributed systems design) are ready to be applied successfully to this area. The ultimate goal will be to create new systems that allow people to feel like they are in the same place, able to perform music or theater or have a robust conversation while separated over the Internet.<br/><br/>The project plans to pursue scientific inquiries in three areas: protocols, codecs, and compression. For protocols, the core idea is to apply Model-Predictive Control and in-situ learning to study an individual network path and predict its packet-by-packet dynamics at a fine grain, in order to control near-term behavior. For codecs, the main hypothesis is that incorporating machine learning tightly in an encoder's inner rate-control algorithm can reduce end-to-end latency and produce a proxy objective function that is useful to the transport protocol. If these efforts are successful, this opens up an opportunity for compression: the idea that low latency can be used to substitute for bandwidth, and that real-time gaze information and gaze-contingent compression can lead to manyfold compression gains and ""retina-quality"" 360x180 (virtual reality) video streaming over realistic path capacities.<br/><br/>The project will include in a series of live online theatrical and musical performances, using far-flung actors and audience members connected over the Internet.

This project seeks to understand the effect of large glaciers on weathering processes beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet and the consequences for life. During summer, nutrients and other products are flushed out of the Greenland Ice Sheet with water from melting ice. While these products have been sampled in spring and summer, it is not known how weathering processes are different during winter. In this project, researchers will sample the seasonal ice that forms in front of two of Greenland?s glacial outlets, Isunnguata Sermia and Leverett Glacier, during the freezing months to assess the chemistry and microbiology processes that reflect wintertime conditions beneath the ice sheet ? periods when input of fresh meltwater is minimal. These samples will increase knowledge of winter conditions under the Greenland Ice Sheet and help better understand the interior portions of the ice sheet which are largely inaccessible. Such information will help in assessing past conditions, when colder atmospheric conditions resulted in minimal meltwater input through the ice sheet and to the glacial bed. These analyses will inform understanding of the role of glaciers on earth?s nutrient cycles presently, under past ice age conditions, and in a future deglaciating world.<br/><br/>The Greenland Ice Sheet is a major exporter of biologically important elements to the world?s oceans. However, most of our knowledge of chemical and biological fluxes from the ice sheet comes from the summer outflux of outlet glaciers whose channelized waters contact only a limited portion of the glacier bed. The majority of the glacier-bed interface contains slow-flowing, distributed waters not representative of this flux. The project will test the hypothesis that overwinter chemical and biological processes under outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet differ substantially from summer outflow and represent a window into widespread, but typically inaccessible, distributed flow. The principal sample collection method will be early spring coring of naled ice that forms at glacial termini from wintertime subglacial flow. Chemical, mineralogical, and biological constituents of this flow will be compared to material emerging from the initial, peak, and terminal phases of the melt season. Elsewhere in the Arctic, the chemistry of frozen overwinter subglacial material shows significant limitation in oxygen or sediment supply compared with even the first spring melt, supporting the idea that naled ice reveals a unique overwinter system. The naled ice and outflow of Isunnguata Sermia and Leverett Glacier will be sampled over two years. These West Greenland outlets differ by more than an order of magnitude in the size of the catchments they drain, thereby testing the effect of scale on biogeochemistry. Naled ice structure will be characterized by ground penetrating radar and ice borehole temperature profiles. The aqueous geochemistry, stable isotopes of carbonate and sulphate, and mineralogy of the suspended sediment of ice and water will be assessed. These analyses will document changes in the mineral flux and supply of atmospheric gases at the glacial bed between winter low flow conditions and peak summer melt. Microbial abundance, diversity, metagenomics, and stable isotopes of biomass will also be measured to understand the concomitant relationship between geochemical conditions and biological communities. Researchers will incorporate findings into a number of outreach efforts including developing a new curriculum module for the Center for Earth and Environmental Sciences, providing research opportunities for underrepresented students as part of the Bridge to Research Program and preparing hands-on activities for the Market Science Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two prime examples are the Million Veteran Project (MVP) at US Veterans Affairs (VA) and UK Biobank. The data are big, with up to a million subjects and occupying terabytes of storage (volume). Their sample sizes and data content keep increasing (velocity). They contain heterogeneous sources of information: genome, electronic health record (EHR), wearable devices, images, and most recently, COVID-19 data (variety). Furthermore, they are fraught with missingness and inaccuracy (veracity). This project seeks to develop novel statistical methods and computational algorithms that address specific aspects of 4V. The methods are motivated by the principal investigators' recent experience in analyzing MVP and UK Biobank data, and are generalizable to any biobank or other generic big data. The methods provide solutions to some of the most pressing issues in biobank data analysis. The work will push forward several frontiers in statistics, optimization, and genetics. The research will be integrated with substantial education and outreach activities, including developing new courses and software and mentoring students. These activities aim to expose a diverse set of students, including women and minorities, to state-of-the-art statistical and computational techniques for big data analysis.<br/> <br/>Three sets of problems are to be investigated. (1) Electronic health records and wearable devices generate a vast amount of longitudinal data in biobanks. In many studies, the within-subject variability of a longitudinal outcome is the primary scientific interest. Motivated by studies of the impacts of blood pressure variability and glycemic variability on diabetes complications, the PIs propose a robust and scalable method for the estimation and inference of the effects of both time-varying and time-invariant predictors on within-subject variance. Compared to existing approaches, the method is robust to the distribution misspecification and orders of magnitude faster. Computational scalability makes it a powerful tool for studying trait variability based on massive longitudinal data in biobanks. (2) The PIs will develop a new class of online learning algorithms, which combine the majorization-minimization principle in statistics and the stochastic proximal iteration algorithm. The new algorithms apply to a broader class of models and are demonstrably more stable and robust. They help solve the volume issue and will be applied to genome-wide association studies of massive biobank data. (3) The PIs propose a bag of little bootstraps (BLB) approach for estimating massive variance component models, which play a central role in genetics and biostatistics. Fitting such models is prohibitive for biobank data because of the inversion of the giant covariance matrix. The BLB approach breaks the massive variance component model into many smaller ones, which are bootstrapped in parallel and then averaged. The new method will enable quantifying heritability and genetic correlation of complex traits in biobank data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these NLP models often suffer from brittleness in many different ways: they latch onto erroneous artifacts, do not support natural variations in language, are not robust to adversarial attacks, and only work on a few domains. Existing pipelines for developing NLP models lack support for useful insights, and identifying bugs requires considerable effort from experts both in machine learning and the domain. This CAREER project develops several techniques to support this need for more robust training and evaluation pipelines for NLP, providing easy-to-use, scalable, and accurate mechanisms for identifying, understanding, and addressing NLP models' vulnerabilities. The developed methods will support diverse application areas such as conversational agents, sentiment classifiers, and abuse/hate speech detection. Further, the team engages with the developers of NLP models in academia and industry to develop a data science curriculum for K-12 education, particularly for students from underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>Based on the notion of vulnerability as unexpected behavior on certain input transformations, the team will contribute across the following three thrusts. The first thrust identifies vulnerabilities by testing user-defined behaviors and searching over many possible  vulnerabilities. In the second thrust, the investigators develop methods to understand the model's vulnerabilities by tracing the causes of errors to individual training data points and data artifacts. The last thrust will develop approaches to address vulnerabilities in models by directly injecting the vulnerability definitions into the model during training and using explanation-based annotations to supervise the models.

A curious phenomenon is the following: if one assumes that initially all gas particles are in one half of the space, then infinitely often in the future, the gas molecules will collect in the initial portion of the space. This conclusion, which is predicted by mathematical aspects of the system, seems paradoxical. However, the mystery may be revealed if one observes that the number of the degree of freedom in this system is very large, thus in order to return to the original state, one needs to observe the system for very long (practically impossible) time intervals. This proposal aims at the study of finitary aspects of dynamical systems where one is interested in approximating various states of the system within an error. This project also include the training of a graduate student.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator seeks extensions and strengthening of certain rigidity results in dynamics and their applications in number theory and geometry. Special attention will be given to finitary and effective aspects of the analysis. The following will be the main objectives: (i) Dynamical systems have become a major player in modern mathematics. However, arguments relying on techniques from ergodic theory and dynamics are often non-quantitative. Providing finitary versions of these arguments are challenging and much sought after, especially in view of various applications. The principal investigator seeks results in this direction with two main goals in mind: provide finitary arguments which yield polynomial rates for strong rigidity results in homogeneous dynamics in some specific examples with interesting applications to number theory and geometry; provide finitary versions of these celebrated results in great generality, even though one may not obtain a polynomial rate in general. (ii) Geodesic planes in hyperbolic 3-manifolds have been studied from different angles. These investigations have made it clear that the behavior of geodesic planes is intimately related to the geometric, topological, and arithmetic properties of the ambient manifold. This proposal seeks to refine and strengthen results in this direction using tools from homogeneous dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fossil collection ? with specimens from the United States, Egypt, Madagascar, and Colombia ? helps researchers use the tree of life to connect lemur research to other primates, including humans. Unfortunately, some of the most important fossils at the DLC, including some of the oldest lemur fossils and some of the oldest monkey fossils, are actively breaking down because unstable salt minerals were embedded in the specimens during fossilization. This project is a rescue mission to stabilize and preserve these fossils in physical and digital form. Highly trained fossil technicians will remove salt minerals from the most endangered specimens and store the revitalized fossils in new specimen cabinets that better control the temperature and humidity around the specimens. The team will also create 3D scans of the specimens using x-rays. The scans create a back-up record of the fossils in case they continue to deteriorate. The scans will be uploaded to MorphoSource, an online repository that allows educators, students, and researchers to examine fossils in 3D from any device with internet access. With a better-stabilized collection, the DLC fossil collection can open to the public for in-person and virtual tours, and online exhibits and curriculum guides will be created by the DLC education team using scans and 3D prints.<br/> <br/>The most unstable fossils in the collection come from Locality 41 in the Fayum Depression in Egypt. The site is one of the most fossil-dense terrestrial Paleogene localities in Africa. Along with primates like Catopithecus and Plesiopithecus, the site preserves giant hyraxes, rodents, bats, snakes, birds, and carnivores. The tennis-court sized fossil deposit in the Western Desert of Egypt was actively quarried in the 1980s through 2010s. The most fossil-rich sections were targeted by the excavation teams. This makes the collection at the DLC irreplaceable through additional fieldwork. This project partially supports a Fossil Preparator who will focus on the Egyptian collection as well as other unstable materials in the collection. It also partially supports a Digital Tomographer who will use the Duke microCT scanner to generate scans of the most at-risk specimens, and the DLC Data Manager who will work with the Tomographer to backup and upload scan data to MorphoSource. The data manager will lead the effort to add higher resolution specimen data to the DLC Specify database, which will integrate with iDigBio (idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif.org). The project also supports microCT scanner access and new specimen storage cabinets. The DLC education team will use these newly stable specimens to create curriculum-targeted tours and guides for North Carolina K-12 students and visitors to the DLC. Ultimately, exceedingly fragile fossil specimens will be available in-person and online to researchers, students, and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This may be especially true for students who are directly experiencing the intertwined burdens of structural racism and environmental injustice. This project will adapt and extend successful Solar Suitcase curricula that explicitly link technology learning experiences to environmental science and social purpose. Examples include carbon-neutral energy technologies for electricity generation and transportation, off-grid solar power for disaster preparedness and response, and apps allowing for direct participation in science and supporting community outreach for local resilience projects. Situated in a largely Latinx community, this project explores the transformation of school-wide pedagogy for a high school and feeder middle school through Networked Improvement Community (NIC). The NIC, comprised of teachers, students, community-based organizations, and university faculty, will engage in co-development and improvement science research. If as successful as the focus groups that envisioned it, this project will offer an innovative approach to school-wide transformation. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. <br/><br/>Critical transformation learning (CTL) provides the theoretical framework for this project. CTL focuses on how people think, behave and relate to the natural environment, and to the local and global community. As such, CTL-driven educational practices directly address students? lived socio-historical experience while also considering the climate crisis and its adverse impacts on students? engagement in learning and connection to society. The team will develop and maintain an NIC that draws on partnerships between teachers, principals, students, community-based organizations, and university faculty. Research participation will include two schools and their principals, 28 teachers and 600 students. Using iterative improvement cycles the NIC will co-create, test, and improve an integrated climate-justice/climate-science curriculum to support student learning, including environmental content knowledge, STEM and ICT engagement and belonging, and related career interest. The curriculum development and implementation are a major activity of the NIC, and the curriculum will be shared widely. However, the primary outcome sought is school-wide transformation, including teacher and student identity as agents of change in the community based on STEM engagement and knowledge. The project will draw on surveys, interviews, audio recordings, classroom observations, field notes and hierarchical linear modeling to investigate whether and how co-creation through an NIC can lead to rapid educational innovation that optimizes whole school, teacher and student outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cellulose represents an inexpensive, sustainable feedstock with a number of desirable properties, including good mechanical strength and high permeability. However, cellulose has been underutilized in the development of advanced materials for applications such as energy storage and carbon dioxide capture, both of which are extremely important in today?s world. In this work, ion-containing, cellulose-based materials will be synthesized and characterized in order to understand fundamental relationships between material structure and properties. Cellulose will be used extensively as a foundational material for the formation of conductive polymers and the results will help advance knowledge in energy storage and transport. The work proposed here will be completed collaboratively by a team of primarily undergraduate students from Murray State University (MSU) and Rutgers University-Camden (RUC) in the hopes of not only providing a rich and rewarding educational experience for the students involved, but also to continue a sustainable collaboration between the two groups. Through this RUI proposal, the Integration of Rural and Urban educational Experience (IRUE) will be created, offering students from each university the opportunity to spend part of a summer at the other respective institution to learn polymer synthesis, morphology, and materials characterization, thus advancing the breadth of their scientific education. As MSU is located in rural Kentucky and RUC is located in urban New Jersey, these students will also experience vastly different sociological environments, further enhancing their appreciation for collaborative scientific research. Student participants will receive a rewarding, cutting-edge research experience that will prepare them for STEM-related majors, careers and/or pre-professional school.<br/><br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The central hypothesis of this proposal is that, through functionalization of cellulose with an ionic liquid (IL) or poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) group, a new class of conductive materials will be developed and that their end-use properties (mechanical, conductive, morphological) can be manipulated through careful choice of IL/PIL structure. Although the segmental dynamics of cellulose itself are relatively slow, leading to high stiffness and poor conductivity, functionalization with an IL or PIL group will lead to enhanced flexibility and ionic conduction due to changes in morphology. The PIs propose three objectives as part of this proposal: (1) synthesis and characterization of IL-functionalized cellulosic materials, (2) synthesis and characterization of PIL-grafted cellulosic materials, and (3) evaluation of select materials in CO2 capture/absorption. Ionic conductivity, backbone-to-backbone spacing, polysaccharide crystallinity, ion aggregation, and microphase separation will be evaluated using a combination of techniques, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, chemical mapping, electron microscopy, and calorimetry experiments. MSU will serve as the lead institution of the proposal and will oversee all of the synthetic thrusts as well as the overall management of financial/technical reporting. RUC will be responsible for characterization (conductivity, morphology) of the materials, including the affect of humidity on these properties, and then integrate with MSU in the synthetic efforts during years two and three as promising leads are developed. Carbon dioxide separation/capture measurements will be made at both institutions and completed as time permits in year three. As mentioned above, a significant number of undergraduate STEM students will be supported by this award, acquiring skills that encompass monomer/polymer synthesis and characterization (FTIR, TGA, DSC, X-ray scattering, DRS, SEM, etc.). Students in the proposed IRUE program will gain a unique sociological perspective as well as a broadening of their scientific skills. Synthetic approaches, materials analyses and applications were carefully selected so as to provide student participants with a rewarding research experience while generating high quality data which will be disseminated in nationally and internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journals and presented at professional meetings. The PIs firmly believe that their results will greatly enhance the area of sustainable, conductive materials with long-range implications in energy transport/storage and CO2 capture.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to use perceptual science to improve a family of emerging display technologies called smartglasses that are wearable devices inspired by the form factor and functionality of eyeglasses but incorporating state-of-the-art digital displays and optics. Smartglasses present an opportunity to expand the impact and use of computing, but they also pose a number of challenges with respect to the quality of the visual imagery and the integration with normal vision. Overcoming these challenges is important, because technological advances in display systems such as smartglasses can have broad impact on the public good by facilitating access to digital information for people with both typical and impaired vision. This project will focus on developing perceptual insights to advance the development of emerging visual technologies that are useful, effective, and affordable for people across a broad range of individual differences in vision. The research will have additional impact through close integration with outreach and teaching activities focused on training the next generation of vision scientists.<br/><br/>This project will exploit behavioral, psychophysical, and computational approaches to develop insights that advance both our basic and applied understanding of human visual perception. Customized laboratory display and optical equipment will be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art wearable systems to study how people perceive natural and augmented visual stimuli. Guidelines will be developed for how best to design emerging visual display systems that merge digital information with natural vision; these guidelines will encompass populations of people with both typical and impaired vision. The research activities will also advance our fundamental knowledge of human vision by focusing on the perception of complex, binocular stimuli; thus, project outcomes will contribute insights that hasten the development of next-generation technologies while deepening our basic understanding of how humans sense and perceive the natural world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As data center capacity expands, a trained engineering technology workforce is required to run these data centers. To address this urgent need, this project will expand the engineering technology program at Northern Virginia Community College by improving the recruitment and education of qualified technicians. By fostering a community of practice between industry, secondary educators, and college faculty, the project team plans to improve the workforce pipeline for engineering technology in the northern Virginia region and ensure that students have the skills required to be successfully employed in the data center industry.<br/><br/>This project intends to advance understanding about the efficacy of bridge programs to promote recruitment of underrepresented minorities into higher education. It will also examine the efficacy of bridge programs and internship preparation for improving student career attitudes and readiness.

Combining the strengths of political communication and socioeconomic theories with the methodological rigor of computational and experimental approaches, this research will identify: (1) which regulators, or strategies, are suitable or most effective for combating disinformation and cross-partisan animosity online; (2) how their strengths vary across behaviors and social media platforms; and (3) how these regulators interact, at times undermining or supporting each other. Scholars once thought that online social media platforms would bring in a new era of democratic discussion and debate. However, scholars and users alike are now mostly concerned about the dark side of these platforms - problems such as incivility, cross-partisan animosity, and disinformation are all commonplace online. While there have been efforts to combat these problems - such as the use of moral suasion to curb incivility and media literacy to curb misinformation - the approaches thus far lack a unified theoretical framework that allows for a systematic exploration of the solution space.<br/> <br/>This research will develop a framework connecting three of the modalities that regulate behavior online and offline: (1) Norms constrain through the sanctions or rules of a community. (2) Market constrains through price. (3) Architecture - built environment or code in online space - constrains through the structural burdens it imposes. The impact of these modalities on disinformation and cross-partisan animosity will be examined by developing a broad range of methodological approaches, spanning fields such as machine learning, network science, and causal inference. First, the project will contribute rich datasets and scalable machine learning and network science approaches for identifying cross-partisan animosity and disinformation online. Second, this project will bring together the theoretical strengths of legal and political communication scholarship and the computational strengths of computer and information sciences to combat problematic behaviors online. It will investigate the efficacy of different modalities of regulation through natural and randomized experiments and identify their interdependencies using structural equation modeling. Third, it will determine the generalizability of strategies by examining the behavior and efficacy of regulators across different platforms. Finally, most approaches that address problematic behaviors online treat individuals as the unit of analysis. However, structural regulators act upon communities. This project will overcome issues that generally undermine research at the individual level by performing comparative analyses across not just individuals but also communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But while narratives are a form of information to which our minds are predisposed, an open question remains: how do people understand stories?  By establishing the foundations for a science of narrative that is focused on prediction, this effort aims to afford (to scientists, technologists, and the broader public) the ability to systematically construct stories that resonate with audiences as one intends. This is useful where we already see the use of narrative, when having a higher degree of predictive control in its design would benefit society: the advancement of personalized learning, rehabilitation therapy and healthcare communication, intelligence analysis, automated news generation, and human-aware artificial intelligence (AI).<br/><br/><br/>In AI, inventing systems that can model and explain how we process stories is the long-standing grand challenge of ?story understanding.? However, this challenge has been broadly approached with methods that ignore the cognitive processes through which humans understand stories. To elevate narrative design from imprecise practices into a systematic and predictable methodology requires a broad, interdisciplinary, and cognitively-grounded effort to reformulate the foundation for story understanding AI.  This project outlines a pathway toward using AI planning to generate narratives that predictably elicit a trajectory of mental effects that shape an individual?s story understanding over time across three key cognitive processes that form its basis: event-based mental model updating, inferencing, and memory. The research team will architect algorithms that predict (1) under what conditions people generate inferences about what they read, key to maintaining them engaged, (2) how story structure helps or hinders updating a person?s mental model of a story relative to human inferencing and memory, and (3) how understanding is mediated by said structure in relation to a person?s experience and skill at processing stories (a presently unanswered question in story psychology).

Cellulose represents an inexpensive, sustainable feedstock with a number of desirable properties, including good mechanical strength and high permeability. However, cellulose has been underutilized in the development of advanced materials for applications such as energy storage and carbon dioxide capture, both of which are extremely important in today?s world. In this work, ion-containing, cellulose-based materials will be synthesized and characterized in order to understand fundamental relationships between material structure and properties. Cellulose will be used extensively as a foundational material for the formation of conductive polymers and the results will help advance knowledge in energy storage and transport. The work proposed here will be completed collaboratively by a team of primarily undergraduate students from Murray State University (MSU) and Rutgers University-Camden (RUC) in the hopes of not only providing a rich and rewarding educational experience for the students involved, but also to continue a sustainable collaboration between the two groups. Through this RUI proposal, the Integration of Rural and Urban educational Experience (IRUE) will be created, offering students from each university the opportunity to spend part of a summer at the other respective institution to learn polymer synthesis, morphology, and materials characterization, thus advancing the breadth of their scientific education. As MSU is located in rural Kentucky and RUC is located in urban New Jersey, these students will also experience vastly different sociological environments, further enhancing their appreciation for collaborative scientific research. Student participants will receive a rewarding, cutting-edge research experience that will prepare them for STEM-related majors, careers and/or pre-professional school.<br/><br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The central hypothesis of this proposal is that, through functionalization of cellulose with an ionic liquid (IL) or poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) group, a new class of conductive materials will be developed and that their end-use properties (mechanical, conductive, morphological) can be manipulated through careful choice of IL/PIL structure. Although the segmental dynamics of cellulose itself are relatively slow, leading to high stiffness and poor conductivity, functionalization with an IL or PIL group will lead to enhanced flexibility and ionic conduction due to changes in morphology. The PIs propose three objectives as part of this proposal: (1) synthesis and characterization of IL-functionalized cellulosic materials, (2) synthesis and characterization of PIL-grafted cellulosic materials, and (3) evaluation of select materials in CO2 capture/absorption. Ionic conductivity, backbone-to-backbone spacing, polysaccharide crystallinity, ion aggregation, and microphase separation will be evaluated using a combination of techniques, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, chemical mapping, electron microscopy, and calorimetry experiments. MSU will serve as the lead institution of the proposal and will oversee all of the synthetic thrusts as well as the overall management of financial/technical reporting. RUC will be responsible for characterization (conductivity, morphology) of the materials, including the affect of humidity on these properties, and then integrate with MSU in the synthetic efforts during years two and three as promising leads are developed. Carbon dioxide separation/capture measurements will be made at both institutions and completed as time permits in year three. As mentioned above, a significant number of undergraduate STEM students will be supported by this award, acquiring skills that encompass monomer/polymer synthesis and characterization (FTIR, TGA, DSC, X-ray scattering, DRS, SEM, etc.). Students in the proposed IRUE program will gain a unique sociological perspective as well as a broadening of their scientific skills. Synthetic approaches, materials analyses and applications were carefully selected so as to provide student participants with a rewarding research experience while generating high quality data which will be disseminated in nationally and internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journals and presented at professional meetings. The PIs firmly believe that their results will greatly enhance the area of sustainable, conductive materials with long-range implications in energy transport/storage and CO2 capture.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, they are routinely unemployed (or underemployed) as young adults. Consequently, there is an urgent need to create workforce development models that advance ASD students toward viable education and career paths. This project is a three-year project that will motivate and prepare high school students with ASD to enter postsecondary educational training programs and careers in geospatial and data science sectors. Example careers include: surveyor, cartographer, GIS technician, geospatial analyst, Geographic Information Science (GIS) software engineer, GIS project manager, intelligence analyst, remote sensing scientist, and unmanned aerial vehicle operator. The program's goal is to develop an innovative, research-based workforce development model that increases student self-regulation, interest, and motivation and expands students' understanding of Geographic Information Science and workforce development Technology (GIST). The research aim of this project is to generate knowledge about how the design elements of a model intersect with self-regulation constructs among high school students with ASD in face-to-face, online, and hybrid learning contexts. The project will advance the research in the field by facilitating insight into theoretical constructs around self-regulation and connecting conceptual ideas to best STEM education practices for youth with ASD.<br/><br/>The project will recruit three cohorts of students (80 total) over three years from the Durham Public Schools district near the Research Triangle Park region of North Carolina.  Research efforts will investigate self-regulation among students with ASD in online and hybrid learning settings using a mixed-methods (pre/post surveys, semi-structured interviews, and qualitative observations) approach. Furthermore, the project will utilize a strengths-based approach to enrich STEM education and leverage traits commonly documented among individuals who have the disability.  The project will infuse evidence-based practices into GIST-focused distance and hybrid education experiences to investigate self-regulation constructs among the ASD student population. The results will present factors that aid or inhibit student gains while gearing young people toward growing GIST careers. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to understand the effect of large glaciers on weathering processes beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet and the consequences for life. During summer, nutrients and other products are flushed out of the Greenland Ice Sheet with water from melting ice. While these products have been sampled in spring and summer, it is not known how weathering processes are different during winter. In this project, researchers will sample the seasonal ice that forms in front of two of Greenland?s glacial outlets, Isunnguata Sermia and Leverett Glacier, during the freezing months to assess the chemistry and microbiology processes that reflect wintertime conditions beneath the ice sheet ? periods when input of fresh meltwater is minimal. These samples will increase knowledge of winter conditions under the Greenland Ice Sheet and help better understand the interior portions of the ice sheet which are largely inaccessible. Such information will help in assessing past conditions, when colder atmospheric conditions resulted in minimal meltwater input through the ice sheet and to the glacial bed. These analyses will inform understanding of the role of glaciers on earth?s nutrient cycles presently, under past ice age conditions, and in a future deglaciating world.<br/><br/>The Greenland Ice Sheet is a major exporter of biologically important elements to the world?s oceans. However, most of our knowledge of chemical and biological fluxes from the ice sheet comes from the summer outflux of outlet glaciers whose channelized waters contact only a limited portion of the glacier bed. The majority of the glacier-bed interface contains slow-flowing, distributed waters not representative of this flux. The project will test the hypothesis that overwinter chemical and biological processes under outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet differ substantially from summer outflow and represent a window into widespread, but typically inaccessible, distributed flow. The principal sample collection method will be early spring coring of naled ice that forms at glacial termini from wintertime subglacial flow. Chemical, mineralogical, and biological constituents of this flow will be compared to material emerging from the initial, peak, and terminal phases of the melt season. Elsewhere in the Arctic, the chemistry of frozen overwinter subglacial material shows significant limitation in oxygen or sediment supply compared with even the first spring melt, supporting the idea that naled ice reveals a unique overwinter system. The naled ice and outflow of Isunnguata Sermia and Leverett Glacier will be sampled over two years. These West Greenland outlets differ by more than an order of magnitude in the size of the catchments they drain, thereby testing the effect of scale on biogeochemistry. Naled ice structure will be characterized by ground penetrating radar and ice borehole temperature profiles. The aqueous geochemistry, stable isotopes of carbonate and sulphate, and mineralogy of the suspended sediment of ice and water will be assessed. These analyses will document changes in the mineral flux and supply of atmospheric gases at the glacial bed between winter low flow conditions and peak summer melt. Microbial abundance, diversity, metagenomics, and stable isotopes of biomass will also be measured to understand the concomitant relationship between geochemical conditions and biological communities. Researchers will incorporate findings into a number of outreach efforts including developing a new curriculum module for the Center for Earth and Environmental Sciences, providing research opportunities for underrepresented students as part of the Bridge to Research Program and preparing hands-on activities for the Market Science Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding viruses is critical to the study and applications of microbiomes in diverse fields such as agriculture, medicine, biotechnology, ecosystem science, oceanography and biogeochemistry. In spite of this recognized importance, computational tools for studying viruses are lacking compared to similar tools for other microbes like bacteria. To that end, the goals of this project are to develop new machine learning-based approaches for the study of viruses and their ecology. The project has the potential to transform the study of microbiomes and the field of viral ecology by maximizing information gained from viruses and elucidating their roles in nature. The current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is projected to vastly increase student interest in STEM and specifically, virology in the coming years. In parallel, there is an increasing demand for a workforce adept in bioinformatics and data science approaches in biology. The project aims to advance the development of a talented, educated, and skilled workforce and increase participation of underrepresented minorities and first-generation college students in STEM. The project will also increase literacy of virology and data science across K-12 and undergraduate education through teacher-training workshops & course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) at the interface of bioinformatics, data science, and virology.<br/><br/>This project will develop algorithms and bioinformatic tools to enable the study of uncultivated viruses from mixed communities with little to no biases (bacterial/archaeal/eukaryotic, DNA/RNA, lytic/lysogenic). The goals of the project are to develop new genome and protein databases and machine learning approaches to identify viruses; network-based frameworks for reference-free prediction of viral hosts; and network and statistical approaches for determination of viral taxonomy and estimates of genome completion. These methods will be validated using simulated and real-world metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data and formalized through the development and release of open access databases and software. The approaches will be applied to study viral ecology of deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems, and the role of viral infections in impacting nutrient cycling in the oceans. Additionally, the project will also enable investigation of fundamental questions in viral ecology governing the roles of viruses in diverse microbiomes and environments such as soils, human health, freshwater, and marine systems. Two CUREs will be developed in virus cultivation and bioinformatics, respectively, using novel interactive education approaches including blended learning, and are expected to reach in excess of 1000 students. A teacher-training workshop ?Viruses in nature? will be conducted to train K-12 biology teachers (especially from rural and underrepresented communities).

This project will tackle this challenge and develop a new computationally feasible framework to integrate disparate field observations and computer simulations.  The new framework will deliver substantial upgrades in computational efficiency for natural hazard quantification. One testbed will be the 2018 eruption of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, which injured 23 people and destroyed more than 700 dwellings. For this event, extensive field observations from disparate sources, such as radar satellites, global navigation satellite system receivers, borehole tiltmeters, and seismometers, as well as large-scale computer simulations, will be used to analyze methods for volcanic hazard quantification. The methods developed in the project will be implemented in open-source software available to a wide community of scientists and engineers.

This challenge will be overcome by developing Gaussian process (GP) emulators as a computationally feasible surrogate model to approximate outcomes of computer experiments. This approach is appealing because it not only includes parallel predictions with linear computational order with respect to the number of coordinates, but it also leverages the correlation between coordinates to enable fast predictive sampling. The second computational challenge is in fusing disparate data from multiple sources to calibrate physical models. The project will address this challenge by quantifying uncertainty in data processing and estimating the discrepancy between the physical model and reality to allow for data integration. While this project focuses on applications in natural hazard quantification, the new GP emulator, computational tools for model calibration, and data integration methods will more generally extend the applicability of data science and machine learning algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By requiring the storage of biometric trait measurements (templates) for subjects, biometric systems are vulnerable to violation of user privacy. Unprotected storage of biometric reference data poses severe privacy threats such as identity theft. Despite recent research in the security of biometric systems, research on physical side-channel attacks in biometric systems are still nascent, especially when compared to cryptographic and information technologies. Although side-channel attacks are well-developed techniques in the information technology security and cryptography fields, they have been understudied in the context of biometric systems. The project?s novel aspects are developing methodologies such as metrics, deep learning algorithms, protocols, and tools for physical side-channel attacks and countermeasures in biometric systems. This project intends to be a first step towards bridging the knowledge gap between seemingly isolated research field on hardware security and biometric security. The project's broader significance and importance are improvement of security and privacy of biometric systems against physical side channel attacks followed by protection schemes and involvement in the ongoing biometric evaluation and standardization efforts led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<br/><br/>This project offers insights for future biometric designers on how to efficiently take advantage of physical side-channel attack frameworks to recognize vulnerabilities in biometric systems.

Here, an ""object"" is represented by a point in some mathematical structure, and ""motion"" is understood to mean a group of symmetries of this structure. By considering different mathematical structures, ideas from dynamics interact with several other areas of mathematics, in particular logic, group theory, and combinatorics. In turn, ideas from these fields give rise to new phenomena in dynamics. This project will focus on ideas coming from ""countable combinatorics,"" broadly construed. Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures, as opposed to continuous ones, while the emphasis on ""countable"" combinatorics means that these discrete structures will be infinite, but still small enough that we can write down a list, or enumeration, of their elements. Much research in the past two decades has elucidated how pigeon-hole principles on countable structures can yield examples of groups with simple dynamics; here, the group of symmetries will be large, i.e. uncountable. On the other hand, attention has shifted recently to considering combinatorial arguments on countable groups themselves; these can be used to show that countable groups always have wild dynamics.<br/><br/>The PI has two primary goals for this project. The first is to continue to develop the dictionary back and forth between combinatorial principles and dynamical properties of countable groups and more general Polish groups. In the case of countable groups, the existence of certain patterns on the group can lead to the construction of subshifts with interesting behavior, such as doubly minimal shifts or shifts disjoint from another given dynamical system. For more general Polish groups, Ramsey-like principles can be used to produce interesting spaces of ultrafilter-like objects on which the group can act. These dynamical systems will then have important universal properties, such as being universal for minimal flows, or being a universal ""completion flow,"" a dynamical object previously defined and investigated by the PI. The second is to develop techniques to prove new theorems in countable combinatorics. Of particular interest are theorems asserting that various countable first-order structures have finite big Ramsey degrees. While the properties of interest are about countable objects, the techniques used can deal with extremely large objects, such as spaces of ultrafilters or forcing posets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has demonstrated that in some of the world's most productive agricultural regions, crop growth may cool the local climate, reducing the impact of crop-damaging hot temperatures, thereby boosting crop yields. This project's geographical analysis demonstrates the strength and spatial variability of the crop-climate feedback, as well as the physical mechanisms driving it. By better understanding how crops interact with local climate, this project informs efforts to anticipate environmental changes that could impact future agricultural potential as well as adapting strategies to limit crop yield losses. The project's findings will be made available to the public via media outlets and presentations and will be of interest to various agricultural stakeholders and those who analyze food security. <br/><br/>This project integrates spatial analysis, climate science, and statistical crop yield modeling to assess the extent to which crop growth affects local climate, and how this, in turn, impacts crop production. This research is guided by four questions: (1) what are the physical mechanisms driving the crop-climate feedback? (2) how does the strength and importance of the feedback vary across geographic space and across differing levels of economic development and patterns of vulnerability to natural disasters? (3) how might the crop-climate feedback affect crop yield trends in the coming decades? and (4) could the crop-climate feedback enable an adaptive strategy of agricultural consolidation to reduce crop yield losses in a warming climate? The project's findings inform researchers about the interaction between crops and the climate, which is critical for assessing the future risk of climate-driven food insecurity, the potential for economic losses in agricultural regions, and for developing adaptation strategies to increase the climate resilience of food production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many basic theoretical open questions in this area of mathematics which remain unsolved despite the many incredible successes the field has already achieved. In this project a family of questions will be studied in the area of geometric averages. These correspond to quantifying the relationship between small changes in the imaged objects and the expected changes in measured data (which in practice is processed computationally to recover an approximate picture of the original object). The main goals of this project will advance a number of related areas of mathematics and may influence future imaging technologies. Graduate students are involved in the project.<br/><br/>PI will focus on several topics in mathematical analysis related to the development of new geometric methods for a family of questions relating to the mapping properties of Radon-like operators, oscillatory integrals, and Fourier restriction operators. The specific classes of operators to be studied include multilinear Radon-like averaging operators as well as related nonsingular oscillatory questions of the sort first studied by other researchers. Major special cases deserving mention include multiparameter sublevel set estimates, maximal curvature for Radon-like transforms of intermediate dimension, degenerate Radon transforms in low codimension, Fourier restriction and related generalized determinant functionals, Phong-Stein operator van der Corput methods, and multilinear oscillatory integrals of convolution and related types.

Blowing sand and migrating dunes disrupt agriculture and transport, causing economic and logistical problems for local populations. The behavior of individual dunes is well-studied, but understanding and predicting how whole dune-fields migrate remains a complex and unsolved problem. In this work, the research team will study the large-scale patterns that arise in dune fields, and then use those patterns to develop a numerical model of dune migration. Measurements from three dune fields in the southwestern United States and dune fields created experimentally in a wind tunnel will inform the development of the numerical model. This strategy has been successfully applied in other systems, and will improve scientists? ability to predict and mitigate dune encroachment near populated areas. As part of this work, the team will also develop a library of virtual field trips that can be experienced using commercial virtual reality headsets. These publicly available virtual field trips will leverage improvements in virtual technology to enhance the quality and accessibility of geoscience education. This project is co-funded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics and the EAR Education and Human Resources Programs.<br/><br/>To study dune field migration through the lens of dune patterns, this research will take advantage of the strengths of field, modeling, experimental, and remote sensing methods. The three dune fields will be monitored using high-frequency measurements collected by meteorological stations and precise spatial measurements of dune position. Wind tunnel experiments will also be conducted to test how dune patterns can be influenced in controlled experimental settings. Measurements from both dunes in nature and wind tunnel experiments will be integrated into an open-source model of dune-field development to set the timescales and length scales in the simulation. The virtual field trips developed to improve geoscience education will be captured using 360 degree stereo video cameras.

For example, GIS-based agricultural practices enable farmers to increase production and reduce costs by providing tools for monitoring soil properties and crop health. GIS technologies are also used by public land managers to track invasive species and to plan maintenance activities such as controlled burns. The emerging applications of GIS technologies in agroindustry and land management has resulted in the need for technicians with a variety of GIS skills such as ArcGIS, remote data collection, and spatial data presentation. This project at the Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas intends to address the need for GIS-trained technicians in southwest Arkansas.  This area is dominated by farmland, interspersed with local, state, and federal public lands. <br/><br/>Baseline surveys of regional employers indicated that their employees require training in GIS skills, which they use daily on the job.  The employers also indicated that they would give hiring priority to individuals with GIS training.  To meet this workforce need, the project team and faculty will work with an industry advisory board to develop a new Introduction to GIS Technology lab course. This board will also help to design experiential learning opportunities in GIS, including internships with local industry.  The project will provide professional development to help faculty incorporate GIS activities into their teaching, including novice, advanced, and expert GIS skill applications. The project will also create two new courses in GIS and establish a new Certificate of Proficiency in GIS Technology.  UA Cossatot is a Hispanic Service Institution.  Consequently, the project plans to increase participation of Hispanic students in GIS programs by supporting bilingual career coaches and faculty professional development regarding strategies to support diverse students. The project will develop a website to highlight student internships, job shadowing, and career opportunities that require GIS training. It is expected that this model can be adopted and adapted by other community colleges in areas with similar workforce needs.

New forms of digital communication have fundamentally shifted the arenas and mechanics of public conversations. Widespread adoption of voting systems and user-managed communities on social media can create group processes that normalize and protect societally unacceptable ideas and behaviors. This grand shift begs for a research agenda on deviance with a new theoretical scope and empirical relevance. Drawing on linguistic and sociological theory and computational methods, the project will enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms and determinants of online deviant behavior and extremism.  Findings will serve the public interest by shedding light on governance decisions that affect behavior in online public spaces. <br/><br/>A complete conversation database of posts and comments from a large online information-sharing and discussion website will be used to investigate the empirical puzzle of divergence and polarization on digital platforms. The main theoretical aim is to understand a transition to deviant ideologies or behaviors within communities in which non-deviance is the norm and actively enforced by members. The central hypothesis is that deviant communities create localized conversations and incentive structures in which cultural meanings of deviant linguistic codes and extremist behaviors can be formed, shared, and enforced. The project will explore the conditions and processes of the transition by connecting micro-level conversation dynamics with macro-level ecological competition. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1) What conversational dynamics underlie the shifts in linguistic conventions, normative standards, and cultural interpretations of deviance? 2) How do inter-community interaction and exclusion contribute to group deviation and polarization? By simultaneously adjusting the lens at the conversational level and ecological level, the project aims to offer a set of middle-range theories explaining the emergence and solidification of deviant, and in certain cases extremist, behavior in online public spaces.

Women remain significantly underrepresented in many STEM fields and in the educational pathways that lead into those fields.  This situation has been attributed to gender-based experiences that result in feelings of invisibility and isolation. Such experiences tend to be exacerbated for women who hold other marginalized identities, such as social class, citizenship, age, and race. Yet, most efforts designed to broaden STEM participation try to advance student persistence by targeting singular marginalized identities. Researchers have cited the importance of developing a dual race- and gender-based social network to increase student success. The importance of an intersectional approach is even greater because of the COVID-19 pandemic?s impacts on women of color. In addition to managing their own education in an online format, many women of color have major responsibilities in maintaining their families' health and survival during the pandemic.  These efforts often require managing food, financial, and housing insecurity while navigating complex, disjointed support systems. Advancing STEM participation of women of color requires the creation of spaces that holistically support the complex interplay of their intersecting identities. In these ?counterspaces,? women of color can develop asset-based narratives and the mindset and skills needed to thrive academically and psychologically. This project will examine the effectiveness of a culturally responsive counterspace that features multigenerational mentorship and is focused on wellbeing and thriving.  It is expected that this counterspace will promote the persistence of women of color in their pursuit of STEM education.<br/><br/>The project will evaluate the effectiveness of a program designed to address the psychological and emotional challenges that women of color experience in pursuing STEM careers. Project goals include include applying the model of counterspaces and multigenerational mentoring to women of color in community college and understanding the ways in which an explicit focus on STEM identity development and psychosocial wellbeing may affect STEM persistence among women of color at community colleges. To achieve these goals, the project team will conduct a multi-methodological research study and a program evaluation comprised of both process and outcome evaluation components. This study will add to the understanding of counterspaces, including the specific features of counterspaces that support STEM identity development of women of color at community colleges. The study expects to identify the ways in which activities that employ multigenerational mentorship can promote feelings of belonging, emergent STEM identities, and STEM persistence of women of color at the community college. The research will expand understanding of the factors that inform the decision-making processes of Black/African American, Latina, Asian American, and Indigenous women in community colleges who complete a two-year program and enter the STEM workforce or transfer into a four-year STEM program, or do not persist in STEM.

For instance, the study of <br/>physical laws has led to the development of a refined mathematical framework where elaborate <br/>geometric structures are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the <br/>symmetries underlying quantum physics. Another example comes from networks, which are ubiquitous in modern society. From the <br/>World Wide Web and its powerful search engines to social networks, from telecommunication networks <br/>to economic systems, networks represent a wide range of real world systems. A network can naturally <br/>be seen as a geometric object by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two <br/>nodes in the network as a quantity measuring their proximity. The shortest path distance on a graph is a <br/>fundamental example of an abstract mathematical object called ""metric"". The notion of a metric space is <br/>an overarching concept that is pivotal in mathematical models of optimization problems in networks, <br/>and in a vast range of application areas, including computer vision, computational biology, machine <br/>learning, statistics, and mathematical psychology, to name a few. This extremely useful abstract concept <br/>generalizes the classical notion of a Euclidean space, where the distance from point A to point B is <br/>computed as the length of a straight line connecting them. In numerous practical problems, <br/>the heart of the matter boils down to understanding whether we can find a<br/>representation of a given metric space, in particular a graph equipped with its shortest path distance, <br/>inside some other geometric object that we understand much better and that carries <br/>additional structure. Our ability to perform such a task in a <br/>quantitatively efficient way has tremendous applications. The project will provide opportunities for <br/>undergraduate students to develop a global mindset and superior communication skills, and graduate <br/>students to acquire the algorithmic and programming skills that are crucially needed in the modern <br/>workplace. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI proposes to implement in several instances the geometric approach, which is a <br/>strategy that consists in understanding and solving problems of seemingly non-geometric nature via the <br/>uncovering of a hidden metric structure that allows the application of a wealth of powerful metric <br/>techniques. Due to its versatility, the geometric approach has permeated virtually all fields of <br/>mathematics. Creating datasets with billions of entries has become a routine and ubiquitous task. <br/>Optimization, search, and data mining problems on these huge datasets are computationally extremely <br/>hard to solve. Graphs are natural mathematical models for many datasets, and a central computer <br/>science task is the design of efficient and fast approximation algorithms for optimization and search <br/>problems on various graphs. A graph is a combinatorial object of seemingly non-geometric nature. <br/>However, once equipped with a shortest path metric a graph becomes a metric space and the collection <br/>of all metrics supported on the graph carries geometric information that can be used to understand and <br/>study the combinatorial structure of the graph. After its rise in the mid-90's, there are by now numerous <br/>situations where availing to geometric embeddings of graphs, most notably embeddings into tree-<br/>metrics or into the classical Lebesgue sequence spaces, provides elegant, very often optimal, and on <br/>some occasions the only approximation algorithms for computationally intractable problems.  The first <br/>goal of this proposal is to advance significantly our understanding of the general problem of <br/>embeddability of finite metrics. In particular, we will investigate the connection between <br/>lamplighter metrics and Wasserstein metrics from an algorithmic perspective, and the geometry of thin <br/>Laakso structures in relation to the Metric Kadec-Pelczynski Problem. The second goal, which is <br/>motivated by the geometric approach to the Novikov conjecture in topology and to Gromov's positive <br/>scalar curvature conjecture in Riemannian geometry, is to advance significantly our understanding of the <br/>coarse geometry of Banach spaces and the asymptotic behavior of Banach spaces, most notably the <br/>relationship between concentration inequalities on non-locally finite graphs and the Szlenk index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One particular challenge that the project seeks to overcome is the fact that existing methods are poorly suited to the study of waves that are not well localized in space. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The problems to be studied lie at the intersection of nonlinear dispersive PDE, completely integrable systems, and probability theory. These problems are of well-established interest and chosen both because they have resisted previous technology and because the principal investigator believes that the new techniques she helped develop make them finally accessible. Among the topics that will be investigated as part of the project are large-data sharp well-posedness for the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation, well-posedness for periodic and tidal completely integrable systems, constructing Gibbs dynamics for the Landau-Lifshitz model, and understanding the long-time behavior of solutions to both defocusing and focusing completely integrable systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These amyloids, in which composition is disease dependent, are generally considered to be ideal markers for disease diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Unfortunately, existing probes are limited in that they are only able to detect the presence of a single targeted amyloid protein. This project will develop a new class of generic, multiple-mode, multi-target amyloid probes that will detect a wide variety of proteins associated with different amyloid diseases. Design principles for the multimodal probes can be transformed to numerous molecular-recognition applications for targeted drug therapy, biomarker detection, and disease diagnostics (e.g., cancers and COVID-19). The proposed multi-disciplinary research activities will provide diverse training for students at all levels, especially from underrepresented and low-income families. The students will develop knowledge and skills in data mining, molecular simulations, neuroscience, and lab-on-chip techniques in close relation to public health problems. Finally, the integrated educational and research activities will enrich the curriculum of the Corrosion Engineering program at the University of Akron.<br/><br/>The overall objectives of this project are to (1) fully explore, identify, and engineer ? with both data-driven simulations and experiments ? a new family of AIE@?Ps (an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecule conjugated with small ?-sheet-forming peptides (?Ps)) probes capable of early and enhanced detection of multiple pathological aggregates and co-aggregates formed by the same and different amyloid proteins, which co-exist in human body fluids across different amyloid diseases and (2) conduct fundamental sequence-structure-recognition studies on these multi-mode, multiple-target AIE@?Ps probes. The AIE molecule targets the aggregated amyloids and avoids the aggregation-induced quenching, while ?Ps target the ?-structures of amyloid aggregates via specific ?-sheet interactions. The project?s objectives will be achieved via three tasks: (1) develop a machine-learning model, combined with molecular simulations and biophysical experiments, to screen, identify, and validate a library of ?Ps capable of self-assembling into ?-sheet structures and cross-interacting with both A? (associated with AD) and hIAPP (associated with T2D); (2) design and synthesize a series of AIE@?Ps probes to detect A?, hIAPP, and hybrid A?-hIAPP species at different aggregation states for demonstrating ?conformational-specific, sequence-independent? mechanisms via synergetic AIE- and ?Ps-induced binding modes; and (3) transform AIE@?Ps probes into different amyloid sensors via surface immobilization by controlling their packing structures, densities, and patterns of AIE@?Ps. In parallel, multiscale molecular simulations will be conducted to study the structures, dynamics, and interactions of ?Ps and AIE@?Ps with amyloid aggregates in solution and on surfaces, which will be correlated with amyloid recognition mechanisms of AIE@?Ps by experiments. If successful, this work will provide new design principles and sensor systems for early amyloid detection beyond few available today.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional PD is typically costly in terms of time and money, and efforts tend to be delivered as a one-size-fits-all approach. Furthermore, for teachers who adopt novel techniques such as flipped instruction, there may be few resources to support their efforts. This project seeks to develop a personalized, scalable PD approach that centers on and builds from algebra teachers? practices and individual strengths. The project will focus its PD efforts on instructional actions that are tailored to teachers' existing practice, can be readily adopted, and are easily accessible. The project team have termed such instructional actions high-uptake practices. The project will develop and field test PD materials to support algebra teachers at scale via these high-uptake practices.<br/><br/>In addition to developing the PD materials, the project team will research the efficacy of this PD model in terms of student learning outcomes and teacher instructional practices in approximately 60 algebra classrooms. The main data sources will include teacher observation data, teacher interviews and surveys, student pre/posttests, student surveys, and PD analytics. The research will characterize the immediate and longer term impacts of the PD on teachers? instructional practices; and characterize the impact of teachers? participation in the PD on students? learning outcomes and engagement. The research questions include: 1) In what ways does teachers? participation in the PD impact their instructional practices? 2) Do students of teachers who participate in the PD demonstrate differential growth in learning outcomes? 3) Do students of teachers who participate in the PD have increased rates of homework completion?; and 4) Do students of teachers who participate in the PD have increased engagement during individual work time?

This project will concentrate on developing a deeper understanding of such methods so as to enable interpreting the outputs of such procedures better. The novel methodology developed in this project will be disseminated to the applied fields based on existing collaborations of the PIs.

The contributions of this project will hence lie at the intersection of statistical machine learning, and geometric and topological data analysis. The PIs will work both on developing a deeper understanding of existing methodology via a geometric lens, and on proposing novel methodology for unsupervised machine learning based on a topological lens. In the first part, the PIs will study the reason for the emergence of a certain geometric orthogonal cone structures when constructing low-dimension embeddings of high-dimensional data, with non-linear dimension reduction techniques like kernel principal component analysis, diffusion maps, non-local method like ISOMAP and Local Linear Embedding (LLE), and topological methods like Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).

The most classical diffusion equation is the heat equation, describing the evolution of the distribution of temperature in some homogeneous media. One remarkable characteristic of the heat equation is that, even for very irregular initial data, the solutions become immediately smooth. This behavior is observed in many other partial differential equations that are classified as ""parabolic"". In general, the regularization effect of the equation plays a key role in our understanding of the nature of solutions and in obtaining a priori bounds for them. The investigator seeks to understand the regularization effect in equations whose diffusion appears in a nonstandard form. For example, in equations with integral diffusion, like the Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics, in fully nonlinear parabolic equations, or in entropy solutions of inviscid conservation laws. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The study of integro-differential equations has been a very active area of research in the last twenty years. The principal investigator played a central role in the development of regularity results. The equations are motivated, for the most part, from probabilistic models involving jump processes. More recently, the methods are also finding applications in deterministic models. The investigator has been studying the Boltzmann equation from this perspective. It is a model from statistical mechanics describing the evolution of the density of particles in a dilute gas. When the particles are assumed to repel each other in small scales by a power law potential, the equation exhibits a subtle regularization effect, driven by a nonlinear integro-differential diffusion that acts like an elliptic operator of fractional order. In the most singular scenario, the Boltzmann equation turns into the Landau equation, which is a kinetic equation with a more classical second order diffusion. The principal investigator is also interested in studying more general and abstract fully nonlinear parabolic equations, in order to understand their regularity and possible singularity formation. Even in conservation law equations, without any explicit diffusion term, there is a subtle regularization effect in low order Sobolev spaces that can be arguably understood as a remnant of the vanishing viscosity approximation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To satisfy the real-time requirement of such applications, edge computing provides a low-latency and high-throughput computing environment near the end devices and users. However, the complex structures of modern applications significantly hinder providing end-to-end real-time guarantee to these applications, especially in face of the also complex structures and dynamic nature of various edge computing networks. This project investigates the joint optimization and configuration of edge applications and the edge network, for providing end-to-end performance guarantee to modern distributed real-time applications.<br/><br/>Specifically, this CAREER project aims to co-design the provisioning of both computing and network resources in edge computing, to provide end-to-end performance guarantee for a wide range of applications and edge network scenarios under a general optimization framework named the WolfPack. The project will focus on three complementary research thrusts: (i) a general packing-based optimization framework for applications and edge networks with arbitrary structures, (ii) a set of modeling and algorithmic tools for handling risks and providing robustness in face of application and network dynamics, and (iii) economic mechanisms for incentivized edge resource provisioning with performance guarantees. Collectively, the outcomes of this research will contribute to not only the core knowledge of edge resource management and performance guarantee, but also the literature of packing/covering optimization, truthful mechanism design, and optimization-based system design.<br/><br/>The research component of this project will empower life-changing real-time applications that benefit citizens and society, including but not limited to smart city, connected industry, autonomous driving. The research outcomes will be broadly disseminated through journal/conference publications, tutorial papers, public talks, research seminars, and course teaching.

In the first part of the project the PI will collaborate with scientists who study the basic biology of cystic fibrosis. This disease arises when someone has a variant of the gene making a certain protein.  The behavior of this protein cannot be observed directly.  The PI will help scientists better understand what the cystic fibrosis protein is doing based on the partial measurements available.  In the second part of the project the PI will study molecules called ion channels, located in nerve cells in the brain that allow brain cells to communicate with each other. Ion channels can open and close.  Although the random opening and closing of ion channels cannot be observed directly, their fluctuations can be observed indirectly through their effects on the electrical activity of individual nerve cells.  The PI will provide ways to understand how irregular the electrical activity of certain nerve cells will be, due to the random opening and closing of ion channels. Finally, the PI will work on certain life stages of animals can be directly observed while others cannot.  Ecologists have carefully studied how populations of certain frogs change over time.  The frogs and their eggs can be counted in the ponds where they live, but immature frogs spend a year living on land near the ponds, where they are difficult to observe. The PI will provide mathematical tools that our ecologist collaborators can use to understand fluctuations in populations that can only be partially observed.<br/><br/>Discrete state, continuous time Markov processes occur throughout cell biology, neuroscience, and ecology, representing the random dynamics of processes transitioning among multiple locations or states. Complexity reduction for such models aims to capture the essential dynamics and stochastic properties via simpler representations, with minimal loss of accuracy. Classical approaches, such as aggregation of nodes and elimination of fast variables, lead to reduced models that are no longer Markovian. Stochastic shielding provides an alternative approach by simplifying the description of the noise driving the process, while preserving the Markov property, by removing from the model those fluctuations that have the least impact on observable features of the process. The PI will build on their prior work developing the stochastic shielding framework in three ways. 1. The PI will establish rigorous mathematical foundations for the stochastic shielding approximation by developing a nonlinear master equation description for the evolution of the probability of the unobserved nodes, conditioned on the observable trajectory of the process. 2. The PI will establish the applicability of stochastic shielding to nonstationary hybrid (conditionally deterministic) processes. Prior rigorous analysis of the stochastic shielding approximation was confined to stationary processes, such as stochastic hybrid conductance-based ion channel models under voltage clamp. Under current clamp conditions, each edge makes a distinct contribution to fluctuations in pathwise properties such as interspike interval variance. 3. The PI will extend stochastic shielding from the constant population case, appropriate for noisy ion channels, to the case where populations can grow or decline, as in ecological models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The modular construction of steel structures using castings reduces the structural weight, construction time, and erection costs. Steel castings also offer exceptional architectural freedom and high seismic and blast resistance. However, they are often large and geometrically complex, hence traditional mechanical testing is not commonly feasible, which prevents structural engineers from exploring their full potential. The outcome of this project will enable engineers to perform multiple tests on scaled-models using testing laboratories with limited capabilities instead of fewer tests on full-scale prototypes in sprawling facilities with expensive equipment, providing a better understanding of system-level behavior at a relatively meager cost. The research will also facilitate the development of design guidelines for structural steel castings, increase their market share, create new jobs in the US manufacturing sector, and reduce the carbon footprint. As part of the grant, an extensive set of education and outreach activities will also be pursed to increase the participation of Native Americans in STEM disciplines and improve their retention and graduation rates, including undergraduate internships, multi-day workshops, and competitions and debates.<br/><br/>Satisfying the geometrical and material strength similitude requirements and deriving scaling relationships are the two challenges that accurate reduced-scale physical models are required to overcome. This research aims to quantify the fundamental scaling relationships between strength, ultra-low cycle fatigue fracture (ULCF) initiation strain, and life of additively manufactured, reduced-scale physical models and full-scale steel castings subject to seismic loads. The approach is centered on the additive manufacturing of reduced-scale models with the help of data-driven process and build parameters and post-heat treatments to satisfy geometric and material strength similitudes. It also comprises development of a deep neural network framework to be trained with large quantities of fracture data, numerically generated from realistic microstructures, to learn the damage scaling relationship that will relate the fatigue fracture behavior of additive manufactured models to full-scale steel castings. The experimental validation plan includes characterization of the microscopic fatigue damage using x-ray tomography and structural testing of two full-scale components. Overall, the similitude theory based on mechanics, additively manufactured physical models, and machine-learned scaling relationships will advance the use of reduced-scale physical modeling beyond large deformations into the realm of fatigue fracture.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key equation of General Relativity is due to Einstein, and black holes are its most surprising solutions. Black holes occupy a central stage in our understanding of gravity and tremendous progress in their research has been accomplished in the past decades. They are expected to form as a result of gravitational collapse and are surrounded by matter with which they interact. They are expected to radiate energy away in the form of gravitational waves (as detected by LIGO) and settle to a stationary state. Most mathematical models used in the study of such evolution of black holes do not consider any matter or energy field present in the spacetime: more precisely, they only assume the presence of the gravitational field. This is called the case of the vacuum Einstein equation. Even though the vacuum Einstein equation already presents many difficulties from the mathematical point of view, they hardly represent a complete picture about the physics involved. In order to obtain a realistic model for astrophysical black holes, matter fields should be added to the Einstein equation to model the surrounding of the black holes. This research is aimed at the study of black hole stability both for the vacuum Einstein equation and for the coupled equations with electromagnetic radiation.<br/> <br/> <br/>The plan of this research is to create a rigorous and systematic approach to understand the interaction of gravitational radiation with other matter fields present in astrophysical objects. We plan to consider the interaction between gravitation and electromagnetic fields, governed by the Maxwell equations, and develop a rigorous and clear understanding of their interactions. Our approach is based on the Teukolsky formalism. The Einstein-Maxwell equation has many features in common with the vacuum Einstein equation, but also presents new substantial difficulties related to the coupling of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions.  One of the difficulties is to identify gauge-invariant quantities which transport electromagnetic and gravitational radiation and derive the partial differential equations they satisfy. We then plan to be able to generalize the main ideas in dealing with those interactions to other matter systems, like Einstein-Vlasov, null dust or complex scalar, which are of fundamental importance in astrophysical systems. In general, in the case of the Einstein equation coupled with matter fields, we expect to obtain coupled hyperbolic PDEs with sources which interact one with another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rare earth elements (REEs) are important components in many facets of our day-to-day life, for example, in permanent magnets, many electronics, and batteries in hybrid cars. Platinum group elements (PGEs) are important components in catalytic agents and are utilized in many industrial and electronic applications. Despite critical element enrichment in many alkaline magmatic systems, our understanding of the igneous processes that influence their enrichment and distribution is limited. A better understanding of the igneous processes that control critical element concentrations in alkaline systems can aid in informing focused critical element exploration. This project aims to evaluate igneous processes that may influence the enrichment and distribution of PGEs and REEs within the alkaline magmatic system at the Rattlesnake Hills Alkaline Complex, Wyoming. Broader impacts of this project include graduate student training, research experience for undergraduate students, and the development of 3D rock models and associated assignments for distribution to educators. This project is jointly funded by the Petrology and Geochemistry program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>Alkaline systems show extreme variation in critical element enrichment (e.g., REEs, PGEs, Te, V, W, Ba, and F) and Au contents. The proposed project will evaluate potential controls on critical element enrichment at the Rattlesnake Hills alkaline complex (RHAC). End-member hypotheses for critical element enrichment include: 1) country rock control, potentially as crustal assimilation or hydrothermal scavenging and redistribution of critical elements from country rock, 2) liquid immiscibility, and 3) initial composition of alkaline magmas. The project will document the igneous history of the RHAC, distinguishing timing and sources of igneous units and their relationship to mineralization. Geochemical and isotopic data will be collected to evaluate the input of critical elements from country rock. The role of liquid immiscibility will be investigated through the use of geochemical and melt inclusion data. Despite recognition of economic enrichment in alkaline systems for over 100 years, the processes that control critical element enrichment within these deposits are unclear. Understanding these controls will better elucidate the evolution of shallowly-emplaced, mantle-derived melts, the cycling of critical minerals in the upper-crust, and inform targeted exploration for critical minerals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting growth in the Central Appalachian digital economy has created unprecedented challenges and opportunities for region?s current skilled technical workforce and future talent pipelines. As business and service providers in the region use this high-speed infrastructure, there is an increased need for skilled cybersecurity technicians. To meet this need, this project will design and offer Kentucky?s first associate degree in Cybersecurity. Design of the new degree program will be informed by regional industry needs and federal standards. This project intends to increase understanding of effective recruitment strategies, student support services, and curricular design in Cybersecurity education for remote rural environments such as Central Appalachia. <br/><br/>This project will use the Business and Leadership Team framework as published by the National Convergence Technology Center to validate course content and learning outcomes for an associate of applied science degree program in Cybersecurity. Student success will be supported by implementing a student cohort program model, embedding a contextualized first-year experience course into the curriculum, and providing tutoring. Students will participate in external opportunities such as the National Cybersecurity Student Association, Cyberleague competition, and apprenticeships. The project team will work closely with other NSF ATE projects in Cybersecurity, the National Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance at Moraine Valley Community College, and the National CyberWatch Center to adapt course content and create exercises for remote and virtual delivery.

A basic example can be seen in the undergraduate classroom, where symmetries of a system are used to solve difficult flux integrals. Classically the symmetries of a physical system are described by a mathematical object known as a group. One of the major advances of modern physics has been the revelation that groups are not sufficient to capture the symmetries of a quantum system. It is now understood that the symmetries of a quantum system can be captured on its algebra of observables (a von Neumann algebra). The mathematical tool which describes these generalized symmetries is known as a tensor category. This award will support the proposer's plans to use the theory of tensor categories to answer several long-standing questions in mathematical physics and von Neumann algebras. The award also will contribute to US workforce development through the training of undergraduate students via undergraduate research projects.<br/><br/>This project has two main goals. The first is to classify type II quantum subgroups for many of the low rank Lie algebras.

Faulty cell polarization contributes to birth defects or diseases such as cancer. The PI will develop stochastic and deterministic models to better understand how biochemical factors in the cell interact and regulate each other for proper cell function. This project will model the segregation of chemical reactions taking place on cell membranes and in the interior of the cell.  Such segregation is thought to give rise to interesting dynamical phenomena, such as oscillations of the central polarity regulator, Cdc42, and establishment of multiple polarity zones.  The effects of compartmentalization and geometry on the dynamics of polarization is just beginning to be explored and may lead to novel biological insights of how cell polarity is maintained in cells. The PI?s long term educational goal is to encourage female undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in STEM fields, specifically in Applied Mathematics.  Broader educational impacts will involve organizing a workshop for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Notre Dame. <br/><br/>The PI will focus on establishment of polarity in fission yeast and budding yeast, two model organisms for understanding how cells integrate polarity and spatial coordination of growth. The current mathematical approach to modeling cell polarity using reaction-diffusion equations does not take into effect the spatial segregation of polarity molecules in the cell.  The goal of this project is to model cell signaling occurring during cell polarization by coupling bulk diffusion to active surface-bound chemical species. The PI will apply this bulk- surface PDEs  framework to specific scientific aims: (1) Extend the deterministic bulk-cytosol 1D model framework to a spatial stochastic one that describes the inherent noise in the underlying biochemical system, and compare model findings for increasing cell size and molecule number using compartment based SSA approach, (2) Extend the 1D framework to higher dimensions, where cortical domains are modeled as a thin patches to allow for lateral diffusion and the cytosol is modeled as an enclosed volume, and consider effects of cell geometry on intracellular signaling. The educational objectives of this proposal are: 1) organize a workshop for undergraduate women encouraging them to pursue careers in Applied Mathematics and other STEM fields, 2) participate in Women Leaders in STEM program at Notre Dame, 3) develop new materials for graduate course on Mathematical Cell Biology, which will be open to interdisciplinary students, 4) lecture in existing national educational programs such as the q-bio Summer School that introduces students from diverse disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science to modeling in biology. <br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and the BIO Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) through the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores possibilities for localized change led by parents. By making explicit how to foster and increase Black and Latinx parents? engagement in solidarity with community organizations and teachers, this project could provide a model for other communities and schools seeking to advance racial justice in mathematics education. <br/><br/>Through critical community-engaged scholarship and in collaboration with ten Black and Latinx families, ten teachers, and two community organizations, the research team will co-design and co-study two educational programs aimed at advancing racial justice in elementary mathematics. The first program seeks to build parents? capacity to catalyze change across classrooms and schools within their local communities; and the second program will provide teacher professional development that supports elementary teachers of mathematics to learn with and from Black and Latinx families. A mixed methods research design that utilizes narrative inquiry and social network analysis will facilitate refinement of the educational program models by addressing two research objectives: (1) to understand the experiences of Black and Latinx parents as they build capacity to lead change and (2) to study the development, nature, and impact of parent-teacher-community partnerships that promote a shared vision for racial justice in mathematics.

Representation theory is the study of algebraic structures by realizing their elements as linear maps on vector spaces or modules and decomposing them into their smallest constituents. Both probability and representation theory lend themselves to combinatorial analysis. For example, in probability the events could be discrete states and in representation theory the index set of a representation is often a combinatorial object such as a partition. The main premise of this proposal is the development of new combinatorial techniques for answering fundamental questions in both probability and representation theory. This project also has a substantial computational component (contributing to and using the rapidly growing open-source mathematical software SAGEMATH). The outcome of this research will impact areas beyond those of their original motivation. For example, it relates to invariant theory, complexity theory, and voting procedures. These investigations are fueled by extensive computational experimentation. Robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project will lead to new, open-source code for the SAGEMATH computer algebra system. The dissemination of this new SAGEMATH software will not only advance the proposed research program, but will (and has already) cross-fertilize various areas in mathematics and computer science. In addition, the project will support a diverse group of graduate students and encourage the participation of female students and researchers. The PI also plans to organize workshops, engage in promoting open access publishing, and disseminate results via lecture series.<br/><br/>The project is aimed at solving open problems on five topics in combinatorial probability and representation theory. The five proposed projects will be attacked with various teams of collaborators and include: (1) Mixing times of Markov chains using the recently developed new theory for computing stationary distributions for any finite Markov chain. This approach uses sophisticated methods in semigroup theory. (2) A new uncrowding algorithm for hook-valued tableaux in relation to canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials in K-theory. (3) The generalization of a crystal associated to stable Grothendieck polynomials. This approach will likely yield new K-theoretic insertion algorithms. (4) Insertion algorithms for the partition algebra and its subalgebras. The partition algebra is a centralizer algebra. New insertion algorithms are required to match the underlying representation theory in various cases. (5) Symmetric chain decompositions of crystal bases can answer questions about plethysm coefficients and have applications to physics, invariant theory and complexity theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, common sources of non-genetic heterogeneity such as epigenetic phenomena and environmental noise have been shown to induce transient or reversible drug-resistant states in tumor cells.  Since these phenotypic switches often operate at significantly faster time scales than genetic evolution, they can exert large influences on the course of tumor evolution and response to therapy.  These observations have generated tremendous interest in the clinical potential of novel drugs, such as epigenetic therapies, that target the cellular machinery controlling these phenotypic switches; however, the success of these therapies has been limited so far. One obstacle to these efforts has been an inadequate mechanistic understanding of how stochastic phenotypic transitions at the level of individual cells arise and influence tumor population-level responses to therapy.  This project aims to elucidate these questions through the development of mathematical theories that link the mechanisms of phenotypic transitions at the subcellular level to population-level tumor evolutionary dynamics, within the context of a changing tumor microenvironment. This framework will be applied to understand the development of therapeutic resistance in leukemias and colorectal cancers, and to explore novel treatment strategies for preventing treatment failure.  Since analogous phenomena occur in the context of bacterial populations treated with antibiotics, such models can also be leveraged to provide insights into antimicrobial therapy resistance.<br/><br/>In the first part of the project, the PI will develop and analyze a continuous-time Markov process model of drug resistance driven by reversible phenotypic transitions in response to stromal cell-secreted factors in the tumor microenvironment. In the second part of the project, the PI will develop a novel multiscale modeling framework using branching random walks to link stochastic subcellular epigenetic dynamics to population-level evolutionary dynamics, and use this model to explore the impact of epigenetic processes on the evolution of drug resistance in cancer. These models will be analyzed to elucidate how the underlying processes driving non-genetic heterogeneity in a population influence overall evolutionary shifts towards drug resistance and tumor recurrence.  This  work will involve the analysis of state-dependent branching random walks on nonstandard geometries as well as branching process approximations of continuous time Markov processes. In particular, analyses of the limiting behaviors of these models, stochastic hitting times (e.g. recurrence time, gene silencing/activation times), and extinction probabilities will be conducted. The PI will work closely with experimental collaborators to apply these models and results to understand specific cancer systems in which drug resistance is driven by non-genetic mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Co-requisite instruction can help academically underprepared undergraduate students succeed academically and stay on track to their intended STEM degree.  The potential impact of co-requisite courses is particularly relevant for linear course sequences like the Precalculus through Calculus course sequence. This project aims to test an integrated approach to increase success in Calculus 1 through co-requisite Precalculus instruction. The project will rapidly identify students who will likely benefit from precalculus corequisite instruction and provide them with this support.  In doing so, the project will test a data-driven, quick-response strategy for helping students succeed in Calculus I and subsequent Calculus courses. If this approach is successful, it could provide Institutions of higher education with a practical and effective strategy to ensure that students have more equitable access to success in college-level mathematics courses.   It is expected that this approach will be of particular benefit to undergraduates whose education has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>This three-year Engaged Student Learning Level I project at University of Alaska Fairbanks aims to implement an experimental academic intervention that will measure Precalculus content knowledge acquisition, success in Calculus I, and persistence to Calculus II for roughly 500 Calculus I students. A key focus of the project will be the implementation and evaluation of an experimental 2-credit co-requisite Precalculus course over four semesters. Through an experimental design, student cohorts with access to the intervention will be compared to historical cohorts with similar measures of academic preparation. The comparison will provide a multifaceted evaluation of the effectiveness of co-requisite instruction in support of the Calculus sequence and provide a rigorous test of whether co-requisite Precalculus instruction in support of Calculus 1 contributes to increasing student success in Calculus 1. Materials developed from the experiment, including identification protocols, curriculum materials, and statistical methods and analyses, will be publicly shared through a public project webpage.

The soft bodies of animals such as earthworms allow them to travel through narrow spaces and to navigate complex arrangements of obstacles. Soft robots have the potential to emulate those capabilities through the combination of passive mechanical compliance and active response. Like their biological analogs, these robots continually make and break contact with their surroundings as they move. The high number of degrees of freedom of structurally soft systems, combined with the dynamically changing contact points, makes centralized control of this type of robot motion an intractable problem. In contrast, studies of animals such as earthworms have shown that complex whole-body maneuvers may be generated as the collective action of simple movements of individual body segments. Inspired by this example, this project will develop composable architectures of dynamically rich, but easily computed local response primitives that will combine to produce desired motions. These architectures will provide the basis for an on-going project to translate the locomotion strategies of soft-bodied animals into new classes of intelligent and responsive robots. The research program is complemented by an educational plan to provide an alternate to traditional ""pipeline"" models for students who want to contribute to science -- including students learning from home. The goal is to create in-place connections between scientists, engineers, and students to increase awareness of scientific research, expand access to STEM careers, and foster public trust in communities that would otherwise rarely meet scientists. <br/><br/>The central hypothesis of this project is that building responsive movement primitives around saddle points in state space will enable an especially rich and versatile architecture of composable dynamic response.  Using saddles instead of the typical stable attractors enables sensory input to influence trajectories without altering underlying dynamics, leading to more modular control within a larger network. This will be demonstrated by developing tools to coordinate control primitives in architectures that scale spatially for many degrees of freedom, hierarchically for broad sensor information, and topologically for decision-making. The different scaling approaches will be validated and demonstrated by adding responsiveness to earthworm-like locomotion for confined spaces.  Spatial recruitment of neighboring segments in response to local failures will address the problem of slip.

Topological data analysis (TDA) captures the 'shape' of data with descriptors (e.g., persistence diagrams and Reeb graphs).  Individually, these topological descriptors have proven to be powerful data-analysis tools; however, a single topological descriptor is often not rich enough to capture the intricacies of large, complex data that arises in real applications.  For that reason, this project develops a framework for studying topological spaces and data by transforming them into families of descriptors that capture the topology of different 'views' of the data.  Studying this family of descriptors enables new methods for summarizing and comparing topological spaces, and creates a pathway for their use in statistical settings.  As a result, this project will develop usable, theoretically-grounded data-analysis techniques that will enable TDA for large complex data, including networks, images, and point clouds.  Through the research activities, the investigator will train graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project builds the foundations for representing and comparing large, complex topological spaces and data sets through parameterized families of topological descriptors, where a topological descriptor is any summary of a topological space.  These families of topological descriptors are called topological transforms.   The two objectives to accomplish this are: (1) Studying topological transforms and quantifying their ability to represent topological spaces.  The project team will study existing transforms, reframe other topological and data analysis concepts as a topological transform, and propose new transforms.  By allowing a diverse set of topological descriptors (from persistence diagrams to Euler characteristic curves to small graphs) and a choice of parameterization set (e.g., subspaces or ambient directions), the topological transform framework is flexible.  (2) Developing the statistical tools necessary for using topological transforms for data summarization and comparison.  In doing so, the project team will define distances between transforms and study the transforms as distributions over spaces of topological descriptors.  Throughout, theoretical developments will be grounded in applications, thus establishing mathematical foundations and algorithmic developments that address core issues in analyzing data from real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world?s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease. Ultimately, this project will generate conditions, in parameter space, for the effective control or elimination of malaria using existing insecticides-based resources, thereby contributing to the global malaria eradication efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This branch of convex geometry is called geometric tomography. One of the examples is x-ray tomography, which has numerous applications in science, medicine and engineering. The PI recently discovered that important problems of geometric tomography can be solved using the most popular tool of harmonic analysis, the Fourier transform. This tool allows one to decompose the data into a simple combination of harmonics, functions with periodically repeating values, and, by doing this, one can reduce geometric problems to computations related to the harmonics, the theory of which is well developed. This approach has led to solutions of the 1956 Busemann-Petty problem on sections of convex bodies, the 1938 Schoenberg's problem on positive definite functions, the slicing problem for arbitrary functions. The PI plans to further develop the Fourier approach and apply it to a range of problems at the interface between convex geometry, functional analysis, probability theory and algebra. For example, can one find an algebraic equation whose solutions are sections of a given solid? Can one estimate the volume of a solid from data involving areas of certain sets of sections or projections of this solid? Which random variables are stable, that is, have the property that the sums of several copies of these variables always reproduce the same variable up to a constant? An important part of the project is the involvement and training of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The problems considered connect several areas of mathematics - convex geometry, functional analysis, probability and algebra. However, the strategy of solution is common for most of the results - the question is translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as a problem from harmonic analysis. The PI plans to develop further connections between convex geometry and algebra by considering the problem of Arnold, going back to Lemma 28 from Newton's ""Principia."" The problem is to characterize those convex domains whose cut-off area is an algebraic function of the parameters of the cutting plane. The classical slicing problem of Bourgain asks whether every symmetric convex body of volume one has a hyperplane section with area greater than an absolute constant. The PI plans to study the lower-dimensional and non-symmetric versions of the Busemann-Petty problem asking whether a convex body with uniformly smaller areas of plane sections necessarily has smaller volume. Another direction is to study the general properties of the Radon transform associated with volumetric results about convex bodies. A connection with functional analysis is the study of distances between convex bodies, embedding and duality problems. The question about positive definite functions and embeddings in Lebesgue spaces is related to an old problem in probability theory asking for a characterization of stable random vectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soft matter crystals such as those comprised of block copolymer molecules form via self assembly of the component molecules into periodic arrays.  Recent advances made with new types of microscopy now enable 3D visualization of the fine-scale features of organized block polymers.  While the structures are mostly regularly periodic, defects occur and the aim is to use microscopy tools to see these local disruptions in the order, classify them by their geometry, learn how they form during processing of the material and how each type of defect influences material properties.  The performance of periodic materials depends to a great extent on having well ordered structures and when desired, precisely positioned and aligned defects.  The PI seeks to discover valuable types of defects that can then be manipulated to enhance and even create brand new technological applications of block copolymer materials. For example, a defect that forms a type of ""molecular mirror"" inside a structure without mirror symmetry may create new opportunities for manipulating the propagation of light waves.  Since defects are relatively rare events, the search to discover and classify heretofore mostly unknown objects requires high quality, large data sets and use of machine learning for statistically sound and unbiased microstructural data analysis.  Locating, analyzing and classifying all the various types of defects created under a given set of processing conditions will benefit materials researchers in fields well beyond polymeric materials.  Such processing ? structure relations have been the goal of materials science since its inception and while much has been learned about how different polymer processing procedures influence microstructure, the level of information has generally been limited to observations on polymer chain, domain and crystal orientation, domain shapes and periodicities has but rarely been related to the type, amount and distribution of the many types of defects throughout the material.  <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL:<br/><br/>The PI's group will utilize the advances made with slice and view dual ion and electron beam microscopy for reconstruction of very large volumes of 3D tubular network microdomain block copolymer samples to identify and characterize the defects and relate them to the processing route used to prepare the sample and to their influence on properties such as charge, mass and wave transport. Since defects are relatively rare events, the search to discover and classify heretofore mostly unknown objects requires near distortion-free microscopy to provide large data sets. The inherent complex topology and morphology of defects in network phases requires the help of machine learning for morphological analysis. Machine learning on these large data sets will afford statistically sound and unbiased microstructural data analysis for location and characterization of all the various defects with the ability to find the most abundant and also distinctive patterns of defects.<br/>Understanding how various types of defects are created under a given set of processing conditions will benefit materials researchers in fields well beyond polymeric materials.  Development of improved processing protocols such as membrane homogenization of microparticles to avoid anisotropic sample deformations and perhaps even growing the first faceted true single crystals of block copolymers may demonstrate that polymers can realize near-perfection as do other classes of soft matter.

Many individual neurons orchestrate the processing and transmission of information across different areas of the brain, so it is necessary to record neuronal activity with high temporal and spatial resolution. Surgically implanted neural probes are widely used to record the electrophysiology activity in the brain. In this project, the investigators seek to design a novel neural probe, in which the neural signals are transduced to an optical signal using an electro-opto-mechanic sensor. The single optical interconnect in this probe can carry the wavelength-multiplexed data from many different channels, rather than requiring many wires to transmit the signals from different channels. This approach will enable scaling up the number of channels without having to increase the size of the neural probes. This multifaceted project will showcase how photonics, electro-mechanics, nanotechnology and neural engineering can be combined to bring about novel design concepts. Therefore, this project will provide a rich educational and training opportunity for undergraduate and graduate researchers seeking career opportunities in these fields.<br/><br/>The goal of this multidisciplinary project is to leverage advancements in photonics and electromechanical systems to design a radically new implantable neural interface platform based on electro-opto-mechanical detection and wavelength-domain multiplexed transmission of neural signals.

The proposed research introduces a new platform for recording neural activity that enables simultaneous recording from many channels to better understand the neural basis of brain function and dysfunction. In this design, the electrophysiological activity of neural signals will be converted to a mechanical signal and then to an optical signal that will be routed to an optical detection system located outside the brain. This way, the neural signals can be recorded with a very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Different channels are encoded into different wavelengths of light and the aggregate data is transmitted over a single optical channel with no interference. This new platform for neural recording can be used in different neuroscience and clinical applications in future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gestures are a type of action??an action done in the air that does not directly affect objects. Both gestures and actions-on-objects can promote learning, but having gesture as part of a math lesson makes it easier to remember and extend that lesson than having action as part of the lesson. This program of research uses neural data to figure out why. Two hypotheses, both of which might be correct, are possible: (1) Gesture promotes learning by helping children abstract beyond particular exemplars used in instruction. (2) Action impedes learning by tying children to the particulars of the exemplars used in instruction. It is difficult to disentangle these two mechanisms at the behavioral level because both hypotheses lead to the same outcome??better learning following gesture than action. The research uses neuroimaging to measure activity during a math lesson and determine whether different areas of the brain are activated during gesture- vs. action-based instruction. Understanding the neural processes that underlie learning through gesture vs. action can help distinguish between these two hypotheses, and lead to more finely tuned recommendations to teachers for using these tools in the classroom. <br/><br/>The research program aims to distinguish between the two hypotheses in a math lesson under two conditions: when children observe an instructor produce gestures or actions (Study 1); when children themselves produce gestures or actions (Study 2). Study 1 uses fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and Study 2 uses fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) to measure neural activity while 8- to 10-year-old children in 3rd and 4th grade receive gesture- or action-based instruction in the pre-algebra concept of math equivalence (the notion that two sides of an equation must be equal). Neural activity in abstraction areas is expected to occur during gesture instruction; neural activity in object areas is expected to occur during action instruction).

Because lead does not break down over time, remediation of urban soils to some previously pure or safe baseline condition may be impossible. Given this challenge, how do scientists, decision-makers, and affected communities attempt to reduce the harms caused by soil lead? This project answers these questions by tracing soil lead residues in four regions with distinctive roles in the lead industry. The main goal is to understand how people in each area create knowledge about soil lead, develop and promote methods to reduce exposures, and change the social and economic circumstances in which lead exposures occur. By ""following the chemical"" across four areas, from lead mines to the soils of urban neighborhoods, this project has potential to affect environmental politics and policy, offering new ways to conceptualize the global problem of lead residues, while illuminating possible solutions that are emerging in particular locales. Other broader impacts include communicating with urban gardeners about the hazards associated with lead exposure, developing ties among academic and community-based soil researchers and advocates, and demonstrating how soil science and social science can mutually support and inform each other.<br/><br/>This is the first sustained analysis of soil lead as a ubiquitous residue that continues to accrete around the globe. This project contributes to research conversations in science and technology studies about life in polluted environments, where toxic contamination and its consequences often evade scientific apprehension. Furthermore, it expands the work of historians and social scientists whose research on lead poisoning and the long struggle to regulate the lead industry has generally focused on single locations. In addition to multiple field sites, multiple methods are used in this study: 1) ethnographic fieldwork in historical and present-day lead mining and processing communities; 2) interviews of scientists and activists who conduct community-based soil testing research; 3) analysis of documents about lead mining, the lead-acid battery industry, and other historical and contemporary sources of lead residues in soils across the planet; and, 4) examination of the scientific literature and risk modeling about soil lead exposures. This study also deploys a novel research method called ethnographic soil testing. By interviewing urban gardeners while collaboratively testing their soil for traces of lead, insights are produced regarding how people think about their own exposures to lead, their relationships to the environmental histories of their communities, and living safely in contaminated environments.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Science and Technology Studies program in SBE and Environmental Engineering Program in ENG.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will tackle this challenge and develop a new computationally feasible framework to integrate disparate field observations and computer simulations.  The new framework will deliver substantial upgrades in computational efficiency for natural hazard quantification. One testbed will be the 2018 eruption of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, which injured 23 people and destroyed more than 700 dwellings. For this event, extensive field observations from disparate sources, such as radar satellites, global navigation satellite system receivers, borehole tiltmeters, and seismometers, as well as large-scale computer simulations, will be used to analyze methods for volcanic hazard quantification. The methods developed in the project will be implemented in open-source software available to a wide community of scientists and engineers. The project is complemented by training for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/>                                                                            <br/>The first major roadblock for precisely quantifying uncertain natural hazards is the computational scalability of computer simulations, as they often require the numerical solution of partial differential equations on massive spatio-temporal domains with multi-dimensional input. This challenge will be overcome by developing Gaussian process (GP) emulators as a computationally feasible surrogate model to approximate outcomes of computer experiments. This approach is appealing because it not only includes parallel predictions with linear computational order with respect to the number of coordinates, but it also leverages the correlation between coordinates to enable fast predictive sampling. The second computational challenge is in fusing disparate data from multiple sources to calibrate physical models. The project will address this challenge by quantifying uncertainty in data processing and estimating the discrepancy between the physical model and reality to allow for data integration. While this project focuses on applications in natural hazard quantification, the new GP emulator, computational tools for model calibration, and data integration methods will more generally extend the applicability of data science and machine learning algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to travel restrictions and lockdowns, international research conferences have been forced to move online and collaborators have transitioned to remote means for connecting and continuing scholarly work. The sudden transition to extensive use of videoconferencing and digital tools for collaborative research came with unanticipated side effects, including coordination barriers, communication challenges, and heightened levels of burnout known as Zoom fatigue. Research is needed to better understand the benefits and challenges of participating in online versus in-person forums, and the resulting impacts on research collaborations and scholarly productivity. This is especially important for research areas that rely on place-based experiential learning such as agritourism, which is broadly understood to encompass the farm-community-tourism nexus in agroecosystems. The emerging research area of agritourism has profound implications for sustainable community development, local food systems, management of working landscapes, and ecosystem services. In addition to the direct benefits of strengthening collaborative international agritourism research, findings from this project will be documented and shared with a focus on lessons that are transferable to other fields seeking to strengthen future collaboration. The ultimate goal is to contribute to international research collaborations that are resilient, robust, and sustainable so they can withstand many types of disruptions, ranging from disease to war to natural disasters.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2.<br/>This project has four primary objectives: (1) strengthen the emerging international agritourism research collaboration by implementing a series of team development interventions including webinars, virtual networking, and a hybrid international conference that supports both online and in-person participation; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of different modalities of team engagement by examining the challenges, barriers, and opportunities presented by each mode and by measuring outputs such as collaborative publications, presentations, grant proposals, and additional scholarly products; (3) develop interdisciplinary scholarship around agritourism through undergraduate and graduate student engagement in team science implementation; and (4) assess the transferability of the results to other fields to support the development of transdisciplinary research collaborations with place-based elements and emphasis on resilience and sustainability of international collaborations. The research team will track and survey participants in project activities to document scholarly efforts, new collaborations, and benefits of using different modalities for international collaboration and research productivity. In addition to surveys, a series of social network analyses will be conducted to measure growth of collaborations and relationships within the field. Research productivity will be measured using co-authorship network analysis, bibliometric indices, submission of collaborative extramural funding, and student engagement across institutions. Findings will be assessed for transferability across disciplines, and knowledge will be advanced with respect to identifying barriers and challenges to collaboration and the methods that are most effective for enhancing engagement and productivity of international research collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Models are often useful for understanding and projecting pathogen spread, but most models assume that host organisms move so rapidly that the distances between organisms do not matter. This assumption may be appropriate for some pathogens of humans and other animals, but for others host movement rates are slow enough that distances matter. When movement rates are slow, it is possible for local hot spots of disease to develop, but predicting where and when these hot spots will occur requires new models. This project will begin by constructing models that describe the spread of insect pathogens of the Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata, which is a serious pest of forests in the western U.S. This species undergoes outbreaks at 10- to 11-year intervals, such that its densities increase from levels that are undetectable, to levels at which entire forests are destroyed. The devastation that the insect imposes would be far worse if not for pathogen epizootics (epizootics are epidemics in animals), which decimate the insect population. By then simplifying these models so that they can be applied to a wide range of pathogens, the project will construct a general theory of the spatial spread of disease. Because the initial models will focus on insect pathogens, the models will be useful in predicting when populations of pest insects will be controlled by pathogens, allowing pest managers to determine when artificial insecticides are not needed. The researchers will be working with the US Forest Service to apply their results to contol efforts for the Douglas-fir tussock moth. In addition, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>The project?s first step will be to use statistical model selection to choose between competing spatial models, by comparing the models to spatial data on viral pathogens of the Douglas-fir tussock moth. Previous work by the PIs showed that epizootics in small forest patches can be accurately predicted by non-spatial disease models, but at larger scales the data for the tussock moth show strong spatial patterning. These patterns roughly resemble the patterns predicted by some spatial models of disease spread, but whether the models can explain the data is unknown. The project will therefore compare the ability of a range of spatial models to explain the data. To do this, the investigators will use a Bayesian statistical approach, in which informative Bayesian priors constructed from experimental data are combined with likelihoods based on large-scale spatial data to calculate model selection statistics, and thus to choose the best model. This approach will allow the investigators to determine whether the mechanisms incorporated in the models are truly useful for understanding the spread of disease in nature. The models that best explain the data will undoubtedly incorporate mechanisms that are specific to the tussock moth-virus interaction. The investigators will therefore develop a more general theory of the spatial spread of disease by producing simpler version of their models that can be used to generate analytic results relating the spatial spread of pathogens to the biology of host-pathogen interactions. The project thus aims to create a general theory of the spatial spread of disease that is useful for describing the spread of real diseases in nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The prevalence of computational science in industry and everyday lives necessitates the development of a STEM workforce knowledgeable to solve complex real-world problems. Researchers will train high school youth to program low-cost micro-controllers to collect data and use that data to automate hydroponic systems. To support the high school youth's interest in obtaining a post-secondary degree, they will be mentored by first-generation college students from alumni of Boston College's College Bound program and Lasell University's Pathways to Diversity.<br/><br/>This project will study ways to design an internal learning environment that promotes youth skills and interest in pursuing STEM careers. Utilizing a design-based research framework and drawing upon a mixed-method data collection approach including observations, surveys, interviews, and youth generated artifacts, the project team will explore how and in what ways the use of physical computing coupled with computational science improves youth interest and knowledge to pursue STEM careers. Survey data will be analyzed by first evaluating the measurement quality of the latent variables using confirmatory factor analysis and then using latent variable growth modeling to assess changes in repeated measures for four time points.

Practice with these simulations will help adolescents build collaborative skills and career interest in STEM fields, especially those that use mathematics and require strong teamwork.  By creating an innovative simulation to support mathematics collaborative skills development and STEM career identities, and grounding its use in informal learning environments that capitalize on youths? cultural assets, this project will increase the likelihood that students historically underrepresented in STEM careers will persist in the STEM career pipeline.

It features customized access to robotic telescopes, support for authentic engagement with scientific and computational analysis tools and practices, opportunities to pursue space science-related activities and investigations of personal interest. It also includes live and asynchronous interaction with peers, educators, and diverse adult volunteers from related STEM and information and communications technology (ICT) fields who serve as online role models and mentors. YouthAstroNet?s in-school and out-of-school activities engage learners to plan and request remote observations from robotic digital imaging telescopes, to analyze and enhance telescopic images, and to create and share reports on their astronomical findings. The project draws on a growing collection of educator-contributed resources that support culturally-relevant adaptations of the program for different communities. Prior research has demonstrated that these learning experiences and other specific program factors promote gains in important skills and content knowledge along with science affinity, STEM career interest, computer affinity and science identity, especially for youth from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. The insights generated by this project will help educational stakeholders and the developers of learning innovations understand how promising interventions can be effectively scaled up in ways that sustain impact on learners while providing both equity of access and equitable participation. Over the course of the project, YouthAstroNet will expand its reach to 500 educators in both school and community settings, and up to 15,000 students ages 11-14, particularly underrepresented minority students in under-resourced schools and communities.<br/><br/>The project begins with a leadership cadre of experienced YouthAstroNet educators, teen advisors, and the project?s advisory board to optimize the intervention and its online professional development (PD) model for broadened participation, sustainable adoption, and spread. Over the following three years, the project team will then strategically recruit 150-200 new educators each year into the program from a variety of institutional contexts -- teachers of Earth and Space Science in grades 5-9, and out-of-school educators from afterschool programs, libraries, museums, and community centers -- focusing especially on the recruitment of participants from groups underrepresented in STEM. Recruited educators will be randomly assigned to one of four different conditions of initial PD training, implementation coaching by peer leaders, and access to STEM expertise, with decreasing involvement of the project team. This tests how different strategies for educator PD promote (or inhibit) the successful adoption and integration of a technology-rich learning innovation into different settings, and to examine the conditions under which YouthAstroNet is most impactful on student and educator outcomes. The project aims to answer the following research questions: 1) Does a focused version of the YouthAstroNet intervention, optimized for scale-up, produce equal or better results (as measured by student and teacher outcomes) than the original project? 2) How do student experiences, teacher practices, and student and teacher outcomes differ between the YouthAstroNet program and other STEM programs of similar duration? 3) How do student experiences, teacher practices, and student and teacher outcomes differ between novice educators and those who have previously participated in the program? 4) Under which conditions of PD support is the intervention most successful in producing gains in STEM interest, identity and career interest ? especially for female and underrepresented minority students? Research instruments include previously validated pre- and post-surveys for students that measure STEM knowledge, interest, affinity, and identity, along with online participation analytics. Educators will complete pre- and post-PD, and post-implementation surveys, using a concerns-based adoption model to measure their progress in readiness to integrate the project into their program and to gather relevant data on classroom, organizational, and community contextual factors. Studying the broad implementation of YouthAstroNet will produce generalizable findings of how innovative technology experiences that promote STEM and ICT career interest can be adopted and adapted in sustainable ways on a large scale.

In the software industry, programmers are faced with numerous challenges that stress the limits of human cognition, leading to errors, lost productivity, and ultimately failed projects. For example, programmers face an exploding array of choices in which languages, platforms, and frameworks they choose to learn and build expertise?all of which may become obsolete or irrelevant when switching to a new project or team. This project?s goal is to understand programmer cognition through brain-imaging techniques and low-cost, widely available, high-fidelity biometric sensors. The anticipated result is the design of tools that more effectively support programmers in working with complex code and acquiring expertise. Beyond the general benefit of better-educated programmers, techniques for teaching computer programming are important in particular because programming is a crucial skill for a digitally literate society.<br/><br/>Past research on programmer cognition has relied on psychological and observational experiments using indirect techniques, such as comparing task performance or having programmers articulate their thoughts in think-aloud protocols. To overcome these limitations, the project will first establish a methodology for conducting a series of brain-imaging studies to obtain brain-activation contrasts between an experimental comprehension task and a control task. To study code complexity, the project will use a parameterized analysis of code, where code is systematically selected to contrast different complexity metrics. The project will develop techniques for automatically reducing code complexity based on discovered principles. To study programmer expertise, the project will use brain-imaging techniques to identify brain regions associated with expertise, identify any cortical differences, and examine any differences in neural efficiency. Furthermore, the learning trajectories of programmers acquiring a new skill will be used to understand the time course of knowledge acquisition. From these studies, one is able to explain the neural mechanics of cognition in programming and derive more effective mental representations, strategies, and training techniques for rapid training of expertise. More generally, understanding and supporting programmer cognition has broader impacts on reducing frustration and dropout in newcomers and identifying unique support needed for neuro-diverse populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will support the training of graduate students at UCLA.<br/><br/>The PI proposes research on Weiss's question on amenability and hyperfiniteness using tools from Gromov's theory of asymptotic dimension. This approach to Weiss's question has already greatly extended and simplified prior results on the problem and clarified their proofs. This investigation has applications to topological dynamics and operator algebras. The PI also proposes research on classical geometrical paradoxes such as the Banach-Tarski paradox and Tarski's circle squaring problem. Recent advances in measurable combinatorics have led to new theorems giving measurable solutions to these problems using combinatorial techniques from the study of flows and matching problems on Borel graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Small cities, towns, and rural communities adapting to major economic changes since the 1970s have increasingly leveraged the demand for correctional facilities as sources of new employment and growth opportunities. This project examines what sort of variation exists in the way prisons impact community cultural, social, political, and religious life. It has been well established that the reliance on prisons has important socioeconomic impacts for neighboring regions, as norms and ideas circulate across traditional community borders. Less understood is how variation in prisons intersects with individual characteristics to affect livelihoods in prison towns and neighboring areas. This project uses cultural anthropological fieldwork methods to investigate the broad impacts of incarceration on contemporary society and individual livelihoods. Investigating variation in prison factors such as their age, security level, and inmate population, in conjunction with data on surrounding community cultures and livelihoods, this comparative study provides insights that inform public officials and residents at local, state, and national levels to understand the specific ways that prisons shape culture, religion, society, and politics outside prison walls, informing rehabilitation efforts in marginalized communities. The project trains numerous undergraduate and graduate assistants in scientific data collection and analysis methods. <br/><br/>Through a broad comparison of prison and non-prison towns, this project investigates the specific ways by which local cultures and institutions shape local livelihoods and understandings of prisons in prison towns and more widely. Specifically, the investigators are conducting collaborative ethnographic research through participant observation, interviews, life histories, and document analysis. Their research focuses on a range of towns housing prisons in a region with 35 prisons, jails, juvenile facilities, and immigration detention facilities within a two-hour radius, including prisons that are significant to the history of incarceration. The research focuses attention on the interface between prison and everyday life, and therefore provides empirical evidence of how, both as brick-and-mortar institutions and as a set of ideas, prisons shape how people understand and experience diverse notions of law and politics, including community, citizenship, justice, and accountability. The project thereby merges theory in law and science with anthropological ideas to generate a more nuanced, community-centered set of insights that seek to specify how individuals, embedded within diverse communities, create and transmit meanings relevant to carceral life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Everyday life exposes us to many inhaled irritants.  These can cause our airways to constrict, making it difficult for us to breathe. Although it is known that airways constrict due to the force generated by the airway smooth muscle, how the muscle detects the inhaled irritant and generates a proportionate force is not well understood. The basic scientific knowledge gained in this work can lead to new therapies.  For example, therapies that target the airway's extracellular components may offer lasting relief for the millions of people worldwide who struggle with breathing difficulties. In parallel with the laboratory research, this award will engage students and pique their curiosity about the world around them. Specifically, high school students from underrepresented minority groups will have opportunities to perform laboratory research, receive mentoring support, and coaching for college admission. Online educational modules will make innovations in teaching science and engineering accessible for K-12 educators in remote, rural areas. Together, this work will inspire a new generation of bioengineers who are driven to understand the fundamental mechanisms that maintain human health and create a better world through science and technology. <br/><br/>This project investigates the mechanisms that underlie a newly discovered phenomenon in the smooth muscle where cells can work together to sense contractile stimuli as a collective. In collective agonist sensing, smooth muscle cells communicate with each other, using their force to modulate the frequency of intercellular calcium waves. By communicating with each other, the ensemble can completely change how each cell perceives contractile stimulus and the overall force it generates. The mechanisms that underlie this collective behavior of the smooth muscle and its implications for airway narrowing are currently unknown. The research goal of this is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate collective agonist sensing and to understand the impact of the underlying mechanobiological interactions in regulating airway caliber. Specifically, this will test a hypothesis that collective agonist sensing by a multicellular smooth muscle cell ensemble relies on its ability to dynamically change the connectivity among individual cells in a force-dependent manner. To this end, we have set up the following aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that mechanical signaling between smooth muscle cells regulates agonist sensing in SMC ensembles. 2) Quantify the impact of deep breaths on the force response of smooth muscle cell ensembles. 3) Establish the role of mechanobiology in regulating airway narrowing in lung tissue. Upon successful completion, we will provide the community with a detailed description of a hitherto unknown control system that regulates airway caliber.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These equations arise as models for physical phenomena, which play important roles in our world and sometimes even in our daily lives. Key examples range from the water waves at the surface of our oceans, the quantum mechanical interaction of multiparticle systems, to the surface dynamics of gaseous stars. The common feature in all of these phenomena is the interplay between linear waves and nonlinear interactions, whose balance affects both short and long range dynamics. Different parts of the project aim to study both short time phenomena, such as singularity formation, as well as their long time behavior, such as scattering. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The proposed research spans a broad array of research topics in nonlinear partial differential equations. The problems to be investigated are all associated with the field of nonlinear dispersive equations, but also carry strong connections to related areas such as geometry, harmonic analysis, complex analysis and microlocal analysis. For the most part, these problems are strongly nonlinear, and also fundamentally based on physical models from areas such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and general relativity. In a nutshell, one can view the objective of this work to be the understanding of nonlinear wave interactions, beginning with short time scales, continuing with long time scales, all the way to scattering and blow-up phenomena. One of the main research areas targeted by this project is in fluid dynamics, more precisely water waves, as well as a broader class of free boundary problems. This has been an area of intense interest in recent years, not in the least because of its great potential for applications, ranging from oceanography to medical science and to stellar dynamics. But the most interesting problems are still unresolved, and their study is bringing forth an array of extremely difficult questions. Another goal is the study of completely integrable systems, which often arise as models for more difficult nonlinear problems in fluid dynamics in general, and water waves in particular. The main objective is to gain a sufficiently accurate understanding  of the long time dynamics, which combine solitons, dispersive shocks and nonlinear scattering in a complex pattern. The study of geometric nonlinear wave equations is a third objective of this project. After the recent proof of the Threshold Conjecture for Wave Maps and Yang-Mills systems, the current work is directed toward a full classification of blow-up solutions and of non-scattering solutions, as predicted by the Soliton Resolution Conjecture. Finally, quasilinear wave and Schrodinger evolutions bring forth some of the most challenging problems in nonlinear partial differential equations, and understanding both their short and long time dynamics is another major goal of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rapid environmental change threatens the productivity of aquaculture and crops on which humans depend. Predicting organisms' vulnerabilities to rapid and multifactor environmental change, however, is a major scientific challenge. A hurdle to addressing this challenge arises from the complex and non-intuitive ways that organisms adapt, through changes at the level of the DNA sequence, to many environmental stresses at the same time. Thus, there is a need for new approaches to understand and predict adaptation in multivariate environments. To address this need, this project integrates research and education with a Model Validation Program (MVP). The research is developing and evaluating Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) for understanding and predicting adaptation of organisms to multivariate environments from their DNA sequences. To evaluate MLAs, this research combines both data simulation and an empirical test in the field with the Eastern Oyster, which provide important ecosystem services and support a multi-million dollar industry. For oysters, this research is studying how temperature, disease pressure, and salinity interact with evolutionary history to determine fitness in the field. This research advances efforts toward addressing the major scientific challenge of predicting adaptation in complex environments by integrating concepts across the frontiers of marine, evolutionary, and statistical sciences in a new way. Machine learning and model validation are not traditionally taught in the marine and environmental sciences, but are becoming increasingly relevant to these fields. As part of a broader education program, this research is developing MVP Learning Modules for high school students and undergraduates, which help students build the foundational knowledge they need to critically evaluate and apply models. Modules are being disseminated to hundreds of students in the greater Boston area and are being made available online for widespread use. The MVP mentoring program is training graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students in marine evolutionary ecology, statistical genomics, and machine learning. This research addresses a pressing societal need to more informatively match genotypes to environments for restoration, farming, and assisted gene flow efforts. Results are being disseminated to stakeholders in the oyster industry.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to evaluate if MLAs, which can model non-linearities, can be used to understand and predict adaptation to multivariate environments under a wide range of scenarios. In Objective 1, the Principal Investigator (PI) is creating simulated datasets with different aspects of realism, and using them to evaluate and refine the MLAs. This novel set of simulations is studying genome evolution under high gene flow in complex, multivariate environments. In Objective 2, the PI is building on their expertise with the Eastern oyster to evaluate the MLAs in a field setting. The PI is first developing a comprehensive seascape genomic dataset and using it to train MLAs to predict an individual's multivariate environment based on a single nucleotide polymorphism genotype. Then, the PI is testing if the MLA prediction can predict the fitness of different genotypes from across the species range when raised in common garden field conditions. In Objective 3, the PI is integrating research and education by using the data obtained from Objs. 1 and 2 to develop a series of original ""MVP Learning Modules"" with interactive web apps for persons at different levels of understanding, using the relatable example of an oyster restoration project. This research lays the foundation for future studies by producing datasets that could become classical examples for developing and benchmarking innovative modeling approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world?s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease. Ultimately, this project will generate conditions, in parameter space, for the effective control or elimination of malaria using existing insecticides-based resources, thereby contributing to the global malaria eradication efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results in this field often have applications to search algorithms, data classification, and optimization. The methods used to answer discrete geometry questions can be wildly different. Some are based on linear algebra, where the rigid structure of the space is important. Some are based on topology, and the results hold up to smooth deformations of the objects involved. This research project aims to develop new ways to use topological and linear algebraic methods in discrete geometry to expand the connections between combinatorics and other fields.

This is because their origin and mode of preservation in the mantle are unclear. Tungsten isotopic compositions, however, could provide unparalleled constraints on mantle evolution as tungsten is one of the few isotopic tracers able to track the final stages of accretion, early planetary differentiation, and potentially ongoing core-mantle interaction. To effectively utilize this tracer, the scope of tungsten isotopic variations must be robustly identified and incorporated into physical mantle evolution models. Our starting point is a survey of the most ubiquitous rock type sampling the mantle: mid-ocean ridge basalts. We will test hypotheses of the origin and preservation modes of tungsten isotopic anomalies in the mantle by synthesizing new and existing tungsten isotopic data with numerical models of thermochemical mantle convection. The proposed integration of data, techniques, and interpretations is novel and has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of mantle evolution beyond the tungsten isotope community. Three additional broader impacts planned. (1) Development of interdisciplinary partnerships by coordinating early career scientists who are experts in different disciplines. This includes support for a postdoctoral associate to conduct state-of-the-art research. (2) Advancement of teaching and participation in science by providing a structured research program for an undergraduate student at Rutgers University facilitated by the Aresty Research Center for Undergraduates and diversity and inclusion centers affiliated with the university. (3) Further development of the planetary science research track at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Rutgers University.<br/><br/><br/>With the recent discoveries of tungsten isotopic heterogeneity in ocean island basalts, it is now necessary to understand if mid-ocean ridge basalts possess tungsten isotopic variation and investigate what causes these variations. Using proven analytical methods, we will measure high-precision tungsten isotopic compositions in samples from compositional diverse mid-ocean ridges. This task will address the issue that little research has been reported to define mantle reservoirs which are purportedly normal for tungsten isotopic composition. To advance broader scientific implications provided by tungsten isotopic studies to the community, we will test the plausibility of the leading hypotheses of the origin of tungsten isotopic anomalies in the mantle by integrating our new and existing tungsten isotopic data with numerical models of thermochemical mantle convection. These results are anticipated to have broad implications for our understanding the dynamic evolution of our planet.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI aims to investigate the nanoscale dynamics, transport, and structural behavior in ionic media of nanoparticles with attached polyelectrolyte and poly(ionic liquid) molecules. The concept of polarization of the ionic liquids and electrolyte molecular chains will be investigated; it can find transformative uses for magnetic polyelectrolyte hybrids. The molecular conformational behavior of polyelectrolytes as well as ionic transport in poly(ionic liquid)-based copolymer-grafted nanoparticles and their morphologies will determine the transport efficiency of the membranes. The PI plans to use the project deliverables in undergraduate level chemical engineering courses and will also work with high school science teachers to help course development on nanotechnology. Multifaceted educational approaches will include virtual nanoscience educator workshops. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Polyelectrolytes and poly(ionic liquids), possessing strong ion binding and ion transport properties, can exhibit switchable responses which make them ideal candidates for sustainable membranes with easy regeneration; similarly, polyelectrolytes with enhanced durability and ion transport. This project aims to investigate the role of hydrogen-bonding and polarization of molecules on the conformations and orientations of electrolytes, either as solvent medium or as polymer chains. Network formation in polyelectrolyte-grafted particles under fields will be examined using rheology and small-angle neutron scattering experiments. Interactions between the polyelectrolytes and the solvent media will determine the solvation state, ion transport, conductivity, viscoelastic properties and the polarization of chains. In addition, hydrogen interactions between non-conductive polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate), and imidazolium-based ionic liquid will be verified by Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques, and the polarization of ionic liquids with the polymer-grafted particles will be studied through in-situ TEM experiments. Imidazolium based poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)-grafted particles will be synthesized and their interactions with the ionic liquid medium will be explored to understand ionic conductivity. Two copolymer-grafted nanoparticles with different PIL blocks will be prepared and the ion conduction mechanism in ionic liquid will be investigated. Ultimately, the morphological study will be correlated to the conductivity. The overall aim of the proposed research is to explore the hydrogen interaction-induced and polarized structures of nanoparticle-based polyelectrolytes in solutions. The research plan will underpin the fundamental mechanism of orientations both for the polymer and for the ionic liquid media and will help us understand competing factors and how they influence the ion transport properties through nanoscale interactions.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to serve the national interest by addressing the inequitable representation of graduate Women of Color (WoC) (i.e., Black/African American, Latina, Indigenous, and Asian American women) in STEM. This continued underrepresentation of WoC has been attributed, in part, to negative encounters in STEM characterized by alienating and marginalizing program environments. Yet, existing efforts designed to broaden participation in STEM have largely focused on academic and professional challenges that influence STEM persistence, with little attention to the psychological toll of persisting in STEM environments rife with systemic oppression (e.g., gendered racism). Research has linked racism-related stress, perceived discrimination, microaggressions, minority status stress, and isolation to many negative psychological outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, increased psychological distress has been shown to negatively influence academic and research productivity. Evidently, mental health and distress are crucial, yet unexamined, factors that can influence STEM persistence. To address this knowledge gap and improve the representation of graduate WoC in STEM, this project seeks to understand the psychological toll that results from navigating negative STEM environments. It will also identify specific institutional factors that either mitigate or perpetuate the marginalizing encounters that affect graduate WoC?s mental health.<br/><br/>The project employs a two-phase, multi-methodological, longitudinal, and experimental approach grounded in well-established theories from social and counseling psychology. Phase I will obtain rich insights about the contributors and deterrents to STEM graduate WoC?s mental health using three complementary studies: a sequential mixed-methodological nationwide examination of the state of mental health among graduate WoC in STEM (Study 1); and a series of semi-structured critical incident interviews with both current graduate WoC in STEM as well as those who have prematurely discontinued their STEM doctoral pursuits to understand supportive (Study 2) and unsupportive (Study 3) faculty behaviors that affect the respondents? mental health. Phase II will build on the insights gained in Phase I to design and evaluate an innovative and transformative culturally responsive wellness intervention for graduate WoC (Study 4). The output of this research will serve the following educational goals: (1) cultivate awareness and change among STEM faculty to combat racist and marginalizing encounters; (2) establish a scalable and sustainable restorative wellness program designed to promote graduate WoC?s STEM persistence in a manner that is wholesome, enriching, and centered on thriving; and (3) leverage cross-disciplinary partnerships with counseling professionals to design an innovative and culturally responsive graduate curriculum. This effort will increase our understanding of the ways in which marginalizing STEM encounters negatively affect graduate WoC?s mental health and, in turn, their persistence to degree completion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thermosets thus have limited potential for reuse, ultimately having a negative impact on the environment through resource consumption and accumulation of large amounts of waste material. At the molecular level, the difference between these two classes of materials arises from the fact that thermoplastics consist of discrete polymer chains that can move and flow when heated, whereas thermosets are built from a crosslinked molecular network that is permanently bonded together. To bridge the gap between these materials, recent efforts have focused on making their fixed networks reversible -- that is, enabling them to de-crosslink under certain conditions followed by reformation of the network, allowing thermosets to be remolded and reprocessed. These systems represent a new class of materials known as dynamic polymer networks. While dynamic polymer networks have been the focus of considerable research during the last two decades, many fundamental questions about them remain, detracting from their practical utility and restricting their applications beyond the research lab. This research will leverage the unique characteristics of a novel chemical reaction aimed at de-crosslinking thermosets in order to gain generalized insight into the fundamental principles of dynamic polymer networks. Successful realization of the PI?s research goals will yield a wide variety of reprocessable thermosets and link specific molecular-level characteristics with macroscopic properties, helping to shape future designs and applications of these advanced materials in areas as varied as sustainable manufacturing, advanced medicine, and next-generation batteries. Students participating in this research will be trained in an interdisciplinary manner involving synthetic chemistry, polymer characterization, and a variety of techniques for property determination.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Dynamic polymer networks are covalently crosslinked materials that combine the desirable properties of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics. Their crosslinks undergo reversible exchange reactions that are activated under specific conditions, continuously reorganizing the network. Recently the PI demonstrated a new type of these materials based on previously unknown exchange reactions of guanidines. This proposal seeks to leverage the unique capabilities of dynamic guanidine-based polymer networks to answer fundamental questions in the field of dynamic materials and expand the window of achievable properties of these systems. Specific objectives of this proposal are to: (1) use the versatility of the guanidine functionality to both modify its reactivity and introduce noncovalent bonding partners, establishing the link between fundamental molecular-scale properties and macroscopic rheological behavior; and (2) incorporate guanidine crosslinks into a variety of precisely altered polymer structures to elucidate the role of specific characteristics of the ?background? polymer in determining the behavior of dynamic networks. These studies will be accomplished by student researchers using a combination of synthetic techniques, polymer characterization, rheological analysis, and dielectric spectroscopy.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To assess the sensitivity of polar ice caps and sea-level change to increase in temperatures, this CAREER award examines how sediments accumulating on the shallow seafloor archive sea-level change. As ice sheets melt, the earth?s surface bends predictably in response to the shrinking weight of the ice sheets and ocean waters flooding continent edges. This bending causes local sea-level change to differ from the rise predicted if melt water evenly filled the world?s oceans, like a bathtub. The sea-level rise in response to a melting ice sheet will differ across the globe, with some sediment archives retaining a more accurate measure of sea-level change than others. This research will use computer models to make global maps of differences in sea-level change for two past geological epochs with temperatures higher than 21st century projections. Such maps will clarify the circumstances for which geologists can leverage the apparently different magnitudes of sea-level change from sediment archives around the globe to provide more accurate reconstructions of past ice sheet melt location and scale. This project advances climate understanding by creating a ?Rosetta Stone? to decode the magnitude of ancient sea-level change retained in coastal geology of past warm periods so as to refine future sea level projections. The integrated education plan will generate novel curriculum on the science and ethics of sea-level change to inspire university students to participate in a growing workforce addressing sea level projection and mitigation. The education plan will engage non-STEM undergraduates to create and disseminate artistic outreach products explaining geographic differences in sea-level change to the public.<br/><br/>Collaboration between solid earth geophysicists and Quaternary stratigraphers has revealed that glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) concurrently creates and destroys accommodation, such that the stratigraphic record of glacial?interglacial cycles should appear different from place to place; in turn spatial differences in contemporaneous local sea level deduced from the stratigraphic archive should provide insight into the magnitude and melt source of a deglaciation. This proposal undertakes numerical GIA simulations to ?fingerprint? spatial deviations from glacioeustasy for literature-proposed magnitudes and melt sources for the mid-Pliocene warm period and the Oligocene inception of the Antarctic ice sheet. These spatially variable sea-level records will then serve as inputs into a software that models how sedimentation and subsidence modulate how GIA manifests in stratigraphy. The results will serve to decode spatial patterns in sea level retained in ice-age stratigraphy applicable across the geological timescale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This University is a Catholic and Franciscan university in Indianapolis, Indiana. Over its five-year duration, the project aims to fund scholarships to at least 15 full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, chemistry, or mathematics. The Scholars will be recruited in two cohorts of first-year students and receive up to four years of scholarship support.  The project will provide Scholars with innovative support services focused on strengthening their understanding of the role of ethics in STEM and building their identities as STEM professionals. The project aims to advance understanding of the value of ethics instruction and identity-building activities in retaining and graduating STEM students.  It also plans to diversify the local STEM workforce and help to meet STEM workforce needs.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. A known contributor to retention in STEM is the development of students? self-identity as STEM professionals.  However, the efficacy and impacts of ethics instruction on professional identify are scarcely researched aspects of STEM education. Marian University will recruit students from local Catholic schools, public schools, and community colleges to study the effectiveness of early-career ethics coursework and STEM activities designed to build identity as a scientist.  The project will be guided by two research questions: 1) How does the introduction of Responsible Conduct of Research principles and subsequent evaluation of case-studies impact a student?s ability to recognize and apply these principles to various research scenarios and make ethically sound decisions regarding their own research projects?  2) To what extent does the intentional discussion of identity issues surrounding STEM majors affect their self-identification as ?scientists? throughout their undergraduate career and to what extent do these students cite specific aspects of identity development as contributing to their persistence in STEM? Expected project outcomes include that at least 80% of the Scholars will remain in STEM majors into their third semester, at least 70% will graduate with a STEM major, and all graduating Scholar will be placed into STEM employment or graduate education. The project will be evaluated by an external evaluator based on student academic and career outcomes, student perceptions of themselves, and the value of participation in the project.  It will also synthesize these results into lessons learned for replicating and scaling the project. Project findings will be disseminated by investigators and participating students through peer-reviewed publications and regional research venues.

In agriculture, unpredictable severe storms can cause significant crop damage.  This includes crop loss due to mechanical failure. This mechanical failure is called lodging, and can be the outcome of stem breaking or plant uprooting.  Research on crop mechanical failure has been limited by uncontrolled and unpredictable weather patterns. Instead, tools have recently been developed to measure plant mechanical properties and link these measurements to plant resilience and lodging-resistance. This work will quantify plant mechanics over the lifespan of a maize (corn) plant, and determine the cellular signals and architectural features that influence plant mechanics. Understanding how plant mechanics are established provides a foundation for the development of mechanically resilient crops. This will enhance the future of agriculture, which is a significant portion of the U.S. economy. <br/><br/>This project addresses the problem of multi-scale signal perception in shaping crop biomechanics across plant lifespans.  A major knowledge gap exists in understanding lifespan-related biomechanical adaption and mechanobiological response of crop plants when subject to dynamic forces (e.g., wind). This project tests the hypothesis that lifespan-related changes to plant flexural stiffness are due to cellular-level mechanoreception of dynamic forces interacting with growing plant architectures.  To address this hypothesis, the researchers will quantify changes in maize flexural stiffness over lifespans and determine if there is a role of cellular-level mechanosensing and plant architecture in establishing lifespan flexural stiffness.  Overall, the research in this project will link multi-scale crop biomechanics and provide a foundation for future crop improvement.

Past research has shown that interactions with someone from an unfamiliar group changes attitudes towards other members of that group. But most communities do not have people from every background. This project develops a new idea: that exposure to a variety of people more broadly (rather than to a specific group) may change how people think about and process information. This idea is tested by developing new measures, for example to measure linguistic variability of infants? and children?s neighborhoods and networks.<br/><br/>The project develops novel measures of exposure to variability, based on the principle of entropy: networks that contain a greater number of groups are scored as having more variability. By pairing this novel measure with validated measures of children?s social cognition, the research will test whether children who are exposed to a greater variety of people show differences in processing of (social) information. This approach will help address a number of fundamental questions including how children's own social networks and neighborhoods influence their developing cognition. The broad aim is to better understand how early exposure to variability is related to social cognitive processes in infants and children. The laboratory-based research is a critical first step that can be leveraged for future work that translates the findings into resources.

Dense packs of icebergs and sea ice, known as ice mlange, occur in many Greenland fjords, and may occur near many Antarctic glaciers in the future. Observations suggest that ice mlange may directly affect iceberg calving by pressing against the glacier front and indirectly affect glacier melting by controlling where and when icebergs melt which can impact ocean circulation and ocean heat transport towards glaciers. However, the interactions between ice mlange, ocean circulation, and iceberg calving have not been systematically investigated due to the difficulty of conducting field work in Greenland fjords. The GLACIOME project will investigate the complex interactions between glaciers, ice mlange and the ocean using laboratory experiments and models to provide the first comprehensive model of the co-evolution of these systems.<br/><br/>The GLACIOME project will use detailed process models and laboratory experiments to investigate thermodynamic and mechanical couplings between ice mlange and fjord waters. A stand-alone, numerical model of ice mlange granular flow will be developed using state-of-the-art continuum approaches from granular physics. This standalone model will be used to test the sensitivity of ice mlange flow and stress to external forcings. Results from experiments and simulations will be used in the development of a fully coupled glacier-ocean-mlange model (GLACIOME), which includes the new standalone mlange model, the Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System Model (ISSM) and the MITgcm ocean model. The coupled GLACIOME model will be used to test the impact of ice mlange on glacier stability over decadal time scales. In addition to the scientific advances, the GLACIOME project will provide opportunities for career development and outreach.

Here, the name ''Janus'' comes from the ancient Roman God of beginnings and transitions with two faces one looking to the future while the other facing to the past. Like Janus himself, Janus materials have top and bottom faces made of different atoms. This unique atomic arrangement brings promising optical properties towards next-generation quantum technologies, especially, if one manages strong interaction between materials and light. This project aims to discover new quantum properties by encapsulating these materials within a special mirror, a Bragg reflector, designed to trap light and achieve strong light-material interaction. While doing so, an innovative educational plan is proposed to train the undergraduate and high school students in an active research environment to create next-generation science and engineering workforce. In parallel, the educational plan introduces ?Living in a Materials World? outreach activity to stimulate and prepare K12 students for careers in sciences and engineering through monthly and quarterly online and in-person lab tours, demonstration, and tutorial events.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Recent studies have demonstrated exciton-polaritons in two-dimensional excitonic dichalcogenides. These bosonic quasi-particles have highly appealing properties and functionalities that are not accessible with excitons alone. Exciting new material properties are possible if the density of exciton-polaritons is sufficiently increased to form polariton Bose condensates. Here, owing to the presence of colossal dipole moment and dipolar excitons, Janus layers offer extended exciton lifetimes, exotic valley-physics, and non-linear properties that are ideal for reaching this quantum regime. As such, this project first aims to stabilize exciton-polaritons in the strong-coupling regime by encapsulating 2D Janus layers in designer high-Q factor microcavities. Systematic studies next aim to demonstrate Bose polariton condensates in the high-density regime and establish their quantum properties. Lastly, the research team investigates the formation of topological excitons, controls the super-radiant phase formation, and explores new regimes of Bose-Hubbard physics by using their Moir lattices and tuning its potential landscape. Once completed, the introduced Janus and Moir exciton-polaritons, polariton condensates, and topological excitons are anticipated to fill a large fundamental knowledge gap in the field. Potential societal impacts include high-temperature polaritonic lasers and new quantum information devices as well as educational training activities for high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the popular understanding of the importance of women?s leadership in these recent movements, there is a lack of micro-level data on how and why individual women engage in such movements, and to what extent their participation matters for movement success. This CAREER project encompasses a groundbreaking research and educational program on women?s engagement in social movements.<br/><br/>This project has two core components: (1) cutting edge research aimed at better understanding how strategies that prioritize the inclusion of women, ethnic and racial minorities, and other marginalized groups are associated with the success of social movements; and (2) education and training programs that seek to disseminate evidence-based research to graduate students, broader academic and policy communities, and movement activists across the globe. The unique strength of the Inclusive Global Leadership Initiative lies in the synergy between its different stakeholders?including activists, students, researchers, policymakers, and the general public. The research component focuses on gathering micro-level data from women-identified activists in 10 recent movements across the globe to produce a book, dataset, and training manual. Their stories will help us understand why women join social movements, how they participate (including the tactics, strategies, and gendered repertoires of contention they deploy), and whether their participation matters for the movement?s success or failure.

This project investigates how exceptional fossil deposits ? which contain the remains of soft-bodied animals ? impact our knowledge of marine biodiversity and ecology during the early stages of the GOBE. New investigations of the Fezouata fossil biota of Morocco will lead to the discovery of dozens of new extinct animal species, produce an unrivalled understanding of the organization of the first modern-like marine communities, and allows for an evaluation of the rise in ecological complexity that defines the biosphere today. This project integrates undergraduate students from groups that are underrepresented in geology and evolutionary biology into an ambitious research, educational and outreach program.

These techniques will allow for the description and characterization of the full biodiversity of the Tremadocian-Floian Fezouata biota of Morocco.  Conducting stratigraphically controlled sampling and working with specimens in museum collections will allow the PI to reconstruct the paleoecology and community structure of fossil organisms from the Fezouata biota and assess their spatiotemporal variability within this deposit.

Figueroa and his research team at the University of California, San Diego develop a new class of metal/organic hybrid solid-state materials. There is significant current interest in the development of solid-state materials with advanced function and properties for a range of technological and industrial applications, including chemical separations, chemical storage, energy harvesting and chemical catalysis. Among such materials, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), which are a type of hybrid inorganic/organic solid-state material, are a standout. The reason for this is because MOFs can be prepared with diverse structures, for example with different inorganic portions of the material, and it is relatively easy to tune the organic component for specific applications. While the synthetic and materials chemistry aspects of MOFs have significantly advanced over the past two decades, a common paradigm is followed for their preparation. This involves the interaction of oxidized metal centers with anionic organic linker groups. From a fundamental perspective, this particular constitution limits the chemical and physical properties of the materials, especially from the perspective of mediating chemical or adsorptive processes that rely on the presence of metal centers with high electron counts. In this respect, this project establishes a class of neutral linker groups for the routine and reliable incorporation of electron-rich metal centers into network materials. The scientific work of this award is augmented by a significant effort to broaden participation of junior- and community-college transfer student participation in materials science research at the University of California, San Diego, as well as to introduce local San Diego Area high school students to modern aspects of materials science research.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Joshua S.

Organoisocyanides are well established to form robust metal-ligand linkages via strong sigma-donation and highly efficient pi-backbonding interactions. This electronic duality has also been long recognized to stabilize low-valent metal centers. Seeking to transport these discrete molecular properties into a network-materials context, synthetic investigations are undertaken to prepare porous, three-dimensional solid-state networks featuring low-valent transition metal nodes using multi-topic isocyanide linkers. Furthermore, in an effort to simultaneously impart coordinative saturation on the metal nodes of these materials, the m-terphenyl isocyanide ligand topology are a predominant feature of these studies. Newly prepared isocyanide coordination networks are investigated in the context of their fundamental materials properties. An emphasis is placed on chemiabsorptive properties of these materials as function of the low-valent metal center incorporation. The experimental work undertaken as part of this award is complemented by an educational program targeting the early inclusion of junior/community college transfer students at the University of California, San Diego in materials science research.

While the basic symmetries of polymer crystals are not different from their small molecular counterparts, the long-chain nature of polymers does significantly affect their crystallization behavior. Understanding the structure and morphology of semicrystalline polymers is crucial to improving their properties and broadening their applications. This project concerns the structural control of polymer crystals. The overarching goal of this research is to achieve unique spherical polymer crystals by controlling the crystallization conditions and/or the polymer molecular structure and to elucidate the morphology and the fundamental molecular-level processes involved in such curved-crystal growth. It is anticipated that these well-controlled spherical crystals may find applications in the fields of drug delivery and immunotherapy. The educational component of the proposal includes: 1) Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. 2) Addressing the need for the education of modern polymer science by developing two class modules that will be used in graduate courses at Drexel University. 3) Involving high school students and teachers, particularly under-represented populations, in the proposed research activities.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The long-chain nature of polymers brings the most interesting feature to their crystallization behavior: the intricate amorphous domains in a crystalline material. The hierarchical morphology of the intertwining crystalline and amorphous phases accounts for some unique properties of semicrystalline polymers. Based on the correlation between crystal morphology and translational symmetry, polymer crystals are divided into shape-symmetry commensurate crystals and shape-symmetry incommensurate crystals (SSICs). In the latter, crystal morphology dictates broken translational symmetry along at least one unit-cell axis. This project aims to systematically investigate a class of polymer spherical crystals in the context of SSICs. Two approaches, namely a top-down templating technique and a bottom-up molecular engineering method, will be employed to break the translational symmetry in polymer crystals. The recently discovered spherical crystalsomes will be used as the model system. Accordingly, the specific aims of the proposed work are: 1) Understanding curvature-dependent crystallization and melting in polymer crystalsomes. 2) Developing complex crystalsomes via morphological control. 3) Fabricating crystalsomes using spontaneous translational symmetry breaking. This project will advance the field of polymer crystallization and lead to a library of crystalsomes as tailor-designed polymeric nanoparticles.  Potential applications for these include drug delivery and immunotherapy.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research goal is to create and curate a unified set of critical tools in open-source environments that will provide the necessary baseline for researchers using tree-ring data to adopt open-science practices and increase both rigor and transparency in dendrochronology.<br/><br/>Much of the software used in dendrochronology are in legacy programming languages and have been maintained by a small number of volunteers for decades.  The codes are at risk of becoming inoperable or incompatible as advances in computing architecture accelerate. The techniques and tools adversely impacted include specialized data input and output, detrending, cross-dating, chronology building, spectral modeling, descriptive statistics, and other common data-handling and data-processing tasks. <br/><br/>The research team argues that this situation could be addressed by incorporating these legacy programs into a modern open-source and open-science framework.  While some of this work has been completed in the R package dplR, many of the tools most needed by the broader research community are still not widely available in R (including signal free standardization) and virtually none are implemented in the Python ecosystem. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include creating a modern open-source software base that will be immediately usable by paleoclimatologists using tree-ring data for paleoclimate research.  Modernizing and enhancing this software will also extend both their reach and utility beyond the dendrochronology community and allow integration into related initiatives in the atmospheric and earth sciences including LinkedEarth and Pangeo.  Making these tools open source will also facilitate further collaborative development, broaden the responsibility for collective maintenance and enhancement of this software, and ensure the persistence of these unique tools.

Yet, research has shown that people tend to trust robots and automation too much. This puts them at risk because they have unrealistic expectations about what a robot sees, knows, and can do. The overall goal of this project is to develop robots that can help people correctly calibrate their trust in the robot. The project looks at this problem in the context of robot-guided emergency evacuation with the goal that robots stationed inside of buildings can serve as instantaneous first responders helping people safely evacuate during an emergency. The project will lay the groundwork for a career long research program devoted to understanding the causes that underlie over-trust and predicting situations that may induce people to accept too much risk. In addition to ensuring safe evacuation, this work will also foster the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles and healthcare robots. The safe use of robots is also an ethics question. This project therefore proposes a wide range of educational and outreach objectives focused on using robots to: (1) keep students safe in schools; (2) expand and develop robot ethics-related curricula; and (3) educate those in need.<br/><br/>This project concentrates on three objectives: 1) understanding the situational, experiential, and robot-related factors that lead people to trust a robot too much; 2) perceptually recognizing when a person is trusting a robot too much; and 3) generating robot conveyed commands and explanations to inform and engage an evacuee. The first objective examines how situation ambiguity and recent experiences with a robot influence trust. This objective will generate data that will be used to create methods allowing a robot to predict the likelihood that a person?s trust is mis-calibrated. The second objective will produce a suite of new perceptual methods allowing a robot to evaluate how much the person is trusting the robot and to detect if the person is trusting the robot too much. The final objective will investigate whether and how robot generated commands and explanations can be used to improve trust calibration during a robot-guided evacuation, developing behaviors that allow a robot to assert authority and provide explanations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This biome extends kilometers deep into the Earth's crust and contains as much organic carbon as surface life. While scientists know a lot about who these microbes are, understanding what they do for a living is a harder question. Ecologists use chemical signatures of plants and animals to map food chains. In this work, Prof. Osburn will develop a new tool to similarly map microbial food webs, focusing on those found 100s to ~10,000 feet underground. Just like the signatures in fingernails distinguish carnivores from vegetarians, this tool will reveal which carbon and nitrogen sources are uses in the shallow vs. ultra-deep places underground. The implications of what subsurface microbes eat are surprisingly global. If they eat mostly organic matter made by surface plants, then they are sequestering carbon in huge amounts and depend on surface ecosystems. If these microbes instead eat and breathe inorganic materials and use CO2, then these ecosystems could be very ancient indeed. The scientific concepts underlying this work (food chains, microbial ecology, earth system science, and field-based inquiry) are well suited to be adapted for high school classrooms. Prof. Osburn will develop activities featuring these concepts in collaboration with Science in Society and Chicago Public Schools, with the ultimate goal of introducing Earth Science and field-based inquiry to students with a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. She will also host some of these students as interns for immersive laboratory experiences.<br/><br/>The continental subsurface harbors vast and active microbial biospheres; however, the net dependence of these microbes on surficial inputs remains unknown. This work will interrogate the dependency of subsurface microbial food webs on surface carbon, within a gradient of subsurface environments (shallow to 2.9 km deep). Ultimately the questions are: Are subsurface ecosystems dependent on surficial inputs, how does this change with depth, and how might it have changed with time? Ultra-deep continental ecosystems may live independently of surficial organic matter and record signatures of dark primary productivity in their biomass. Prof. Osburn will develop a novel amino acid (AA) triple isotope fingerprint and apply it to deconvolve trophic relationships in a range of deep subsurface environments. To accomplish these ends, first she will calibrate the isotopic fingerprint with relevant heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic microbes (Objective 1), then analyze subsurface biomass from three well-characterized localities including shallow (1-150 m), intermediate (250-1500 m), and ultra-deep (2.4-2.9 km) environments (Objective 2). Education and outreach activities center on addressing the grave problem of diversity in Geoscience by building interactive, analytical content modules for diverse Chicago public high school classrooms (Objective 3) and creating immersive laboratory experiences for high school students via internships and field opportunities (Objective 4). By incorporating research products into the K-12 classroom and inviting high school interns into research arenas, she directly links research and education objectives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Matson of Virginia Tech and Prof. Ronit Bitton of Ben-Gurion University in Israel lead a team that is creating new polymers that take on a conical shape. How cone-shaped polymers behave and interact in solution is currently unknown because methods to synthesize these polymers were only recently developed. This work is important because polymers that interact in water to form aggregates on the size range of 1-100 nanometers are used in a variety of applications, but fundamental studies on how cone shape influences aggregate shape and size are lacking. The research team will rely on an approach that connects polymer synthesis, characterization of nanometer-scale aggregates, and computer simulations of aggregates to generate theories describing how these unique polymers behave in water. Collectively, these efforts will advance the field of polymer self-assembly, offering potential benefits in the design of polymers for applications in biomedicine, catalysis, food science, and other areas. Due to the collaborative and cross-cultural aspects of this NSF-BSF proposal, this platform will be used to enhance scientific communication with assistance from the Virginia Tech Center for Communicating Science. Off-campus educational goals of this proposal focus on enhancing the Youth Experiencing Science (YES) program for 4th?8th graders in southwestern Virginia.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This NSF-BSF project focuses on tapered amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs), which are graft polymers with high grafting density designed to take on an approximately conical shape. The work incorporates an integrated approach to the synthesis, characterization, and simulations of tapered bottlebrush BCPs. Synthetic efforts will rely on ring-opening metathesis (ROMP) grafting-through methods to make a wide range of tapered bottlebrush BCPs with variable degrees of polymerization for the backbone and side chains. The solution self-assembly of tapered bottlebrush BCPs will be systematically investigated using a range of characterization techniques including electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS). Modeling studies will include coarse-grained models, in a feedback loop, to explain the observed morphologies and suggest new tapered bottlebrush BCPs that could self-assemble into unique or unexpected solution morphologies. The central hypothesis for this project is that the cone angle of the tapered bottlebrush BCPs will influence self-assembled morphology and size distribution. Expected outcomes from this synthesis?characterization?modeling approach include discovering how cone angle influences polymer self-assembly, ultimately revealing new understanding of how polymer structure influences material properties. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PIs, one in the US and the other in UK, will work on questions at the interface of graph theory and theoretical computer science. The line of inquiry that guides this research project is the following: what is the global difference between general graphs and graphs that do not contain particular configurations (known as an induced subgraphs)? This is a fundamental question and the mathematical understanding of it is very limited. The project will study the impact of the absence of those configurations on algorithmic properties of the graph: what questions (that are known to be difficult in general) become tractable if we are given this kind of additional information about the input? This project will also provide graduate student training both in the US and UK.<br/><br/>In recent years significant progress has been made in the theoretical computer science community toward designing methods that address NP-complete problems in graph theory when certain restrictions are placed on the input. These are beautiful and powerful results that have significantly deepened the understanding of the limits of efficient algorithms. This project aims to combine the power of structural graph theory with these recent developments and apply them to several longstanding open questions. The project will study the impact of excluding an induced subgraph on the complexity of such well-known algorithmic tasks as finding the chromatic number, the stability number, and the clique number of a graph (as well as their weighted analogues). Progress on any of these aspects will advance the understanding of the structure of families of graphs defined by forbidden induced subgraphs, contribute to answering important open questions, and have significant algorithmic consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sensor networks, ecological observatories, and open data shared from classical experiments can be brought together to provide more holistic picture. However, problems often arise when combining data from multiple sources because of both environmental variability and, importantly, subtle differences in howobservations are made as a result of human choices. These issues can be exacerbated when studying how processes that unfold over time, leading to contradictory interpretations. For example, several recent studies which examined evidence of insect populations declining at a global level have found a full range of possible conclusions, depending on the data selected and the way in which the studies? calculations were performed. The objective of this CAREER award is to understand and explain these discrepancies by building and evaluating tools for combining ecological data and to provide new approaches for ecologists to evaluate the uncertainty in the patterns they observe over time in ecological systems. An integrated education and outreach program will enable scientists-in-training to take a flexible, critical and transparent view of data and analytics, and will also offer insights into how students conceptualize data and promote public data literacy. Effective synthesis of broad scale ecological data is key to tackling a wide variety of environmental problems and has the potential to form the basis of ecological forecasting. Because ecological systems often have non-linear behavior, understanding process trajectory and changepoints in dynamical systems is a key aspect in describing their future behavior, but inadequate diagnostics for data quality and synthesis issues can mask or confound these patterns. <br/><br/>This CAREER award addresses both technical and cultural gaps preventing meaningful synthesis of temporal processes in ecology through three specific aims. Aim 1) develop novel approaches to data integration and tools for evaluating the reliability of trends in ecological timeseries data. This will be achieved through comparative field experiments to assess biodiversity monitoring strategies, data mining approaches, and development of novel software products for processing temporal data. Aim 2) develop a new graduate quantitative methods course which integrates critical numeracy and historical context. Aim 3) develop an interdisciplinary podcast in collaboration with sociologists and education specialists to advance societal understanding of data and information, as well as highlight the work of early-career and minoritized scientists to give diverse context to issues of ""knowing"" and data.

The projects on fluids and related equations will allow one to make rigorous mathematical predictions about the formation and structure of shock waves (e.g. sonic booms). A key new contribution will be accounting for the presence of swirling motion, a notoriously complex phenomenon that is ubiquitous in nature. The projects in General Relativity will make rigorous predictions about whether a Big Bang occurred in the past, based on assumptions about the present state of the universe. The results will rigorously confirm the dynamic stability of the Big Bang for the full range of situations where it has been expected to occur, thus providing a proof of a conjecture that has its roots in ideas stretching back 50 years. A common theme unifying the projects in fluids and gravity is that they involve wave-like motion. In previous work, the PI developed new tools for the study of waves, shaped by ideas from geometry. In particular, his recent work has shown that the equations of fluid motion have some unexpected, remarkable commonalities with Einstein?s equations. These connections allow the PI to blend insights and techniques from the seemingly separate fields of fluids and gravity, which in turn serves as a driving force behind the projects. The research directions are highly interdisciplinary and are ripe with opportunities for training the next generation of researchers across disciplines. Undergraduates, Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral researchers will be involved in the work of the project. <br/> <br/>In a first line of research, the PI will study stable shock-forming solutions to the compressible Euler equations in three spatial dimensions, with a focus on giving a complete description of the maximal classical development up to the boundary. A key new feature of the research is that the vorticity and entropy can be non-zero, and the behavior of these quantities must be tracked all the way up to the boundary. Because the shape of the boundary is unknown in advance, and because elliptic estimates are needed to control the vorticity and entropy, the analysis requires a multitude of new geometric techniques and insights about fluid flow. In a second line of research, the PI will study the shock development problem for various multiple speed quasilinear hyperbolic PDE systems. This is the problem of describing the transition of initially smooth solutions past their first shock singularity in a manner such that they become unique weak solutions, while simultaneously constructing the shock hypersurface, across which the solution jumps. The shock development problem for multiple speed systems in multiple spatial dimensions is completely open. This research requires new techniques that account for the distinct singularity strengths exhibited by the different solution variables as they transition across the shock hypersurface. In a third line of research, the PI will study stable Big Bang formation (i.e., stable curvature blowup along an entire spacelike hypersurface) in solutions to Einstein's equations. The proposed approach is based on a new gauge that will allow one to prove stable Big Bang formation in the entire regime where it has been conjectured to occur. Due to the character of Big Bang singularities and shock singularities, the methods have deep analytical connections to the problems on shocks. Conversely, the techniques relevant for the problems on shocks have their origins in General Relativity. Thus, there is cohesiveness between all the research directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The evolution often has chaotic nature (i.e., sensitive dependence on initial conditions), and fractal sets often come up when studying systems with chaotic behavior. An important fractal set is the Mandelbrot set, which has played a major role in dynamical systems and is one of the most recognizable fractal sets in mathematics. Among central themes of this project is understanding certain self-similarity aspects of the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set encodes how a quadratic polynomial depends on a parameter. It is a test object for several fundamental problems in dynamics, in particular on how exactly chaos arises, even in simple systems. The proposed activity also covers topics involving higher degree rational maps (i.e., ratios of polynomials). The projects will involve multiple collaborations with early-career researchers, and the training of graduate students. One of the goals of the principal investigator is to promote broader interactions between experts in different branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will continue developing the near-neutral renormalization theory responsible for the self-similarity features of the Mandelbrot set near its main cardioid. Renormalization (interplay between different scales) appears in many branches of mathematics and physics; the exact dictionary is yet to be formalized. In the case of quadratic polynomials, central conjectures are essentially equivalent to establishing rigorous theories of the associated renormalizations (for example, proving hyperbolicity of the renormalization operators). The principal investigator will also study the geometric and topological properties of parameter spaces of higher degree rational maps. A concrete theme is understanding the boundaries of hyperbolic components using near-neutral renormalization. The PI will continue designing the algebraic and algorithmic theories of self-branched coverings of a two-sphere, such as maps obtained from post-critically finite rational maps by forgetting the complex structure. The last topic is closely related to the theories of mapping class groups and self-similar groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experimental approaches can profile where specific proteins attach to the genome, providing insight into regulatory relationships between proteins and genes in a given cell type. Such experiments are expensive and laborious, however, and provide limited insights into gene regulatory activities in the large portion of the genome that is composed of repetitive DNA. This project will develop new machine learning software methods that will predict where regulatory proteins bind to the genome in currently problematic settings. Specifically, these investigators will train neural network methods to recognize features of gene regulatory sites from existing experimental data and transfer that knowledge to predict gene regulatory sites in the genomes of other species, repetitive DNA areas, and in other cell types. Our new software methods will therefore unlock new layers of insight into gene regulation in healthy and diseased cells. All software produced by this project will be made freely available and accessible to the general research community. This project directly supports computationally intensive training and research opportunities in machine learning for graduate and undergraduate students who are working at the interface of computer science and biology. Strong efforts will be made to recruit students from under-represented groups. The education goals of this project will support the development of broader education initiatives in bioinformatics and genomics. This project will develop discovery-oriented bioinformatics research modules for use in teaching genetics and developmental biology concepts in high-school science classes. These research modules will be implemented in collaboration with Pennsylvanian high-school science teachers and students and will offer a new way to engage students in inquiry-based science. The PI will also develop curriculum proposals for a new degree program in bioinformatics at Penn State University. <br/><br/>This project will develop neural network-based transfer learning approaches that predict transcription factor (TF) binding sites across three domains where TF binding activities are difficult to assay. Aim 1 will focus on predicting TF binding sites across species. Neural networks will be trained on observed TF binding data from one species, and used to predict where the same TF binds in the same cell type in other species. A new domain adaptation strategy will be developed that addresses systematic biases resulting from shifts in the genomic makeup of different species. Transferring TF binding information across species will enable the study of regulatory evolution and innovation in many species without the need for expensive TF ChIP-seq experiments. Aim 2 will apply related domain adaptation approaches to predict TF binding sites within transposable elements and other repetitive regions. In this application, neural networks will be trained on observed TF binding data from uniquely mappable portions of the genome and will be applied to impute binding sites from partial signals in low-mappability regions. Predicting TF binding in low-mappability regions will provide a new way to study the regulatory contributions of transposable elements and other currently ignored parts of the genome. Finally, Aim 3 will predict where a TF would bind if it were expressed in a new chromatin environment. This last application differs from approaches that aim to impute unobserved TF binding signals from concurrent chromatin features; the goal is rather to use information from a preexisting chromatin environment to predict the future binding patterns of an induced TF. Developing the first principled approach for predicting where a TF would bind in new chromatin environments will be the first step towards predicting which regulatory perturbations can be used to transform cellular phenotypes. Predictions from all three aims will be tested in ongoing collaborations focused on understanding TF-driven cell identity specification in hematopoiesis and neuronal differentiation, thus providing new insights into how TFs select their regulatory targets during development.

Dense packs of icebergs and sea ice, known as ice mlange, occur in many Greenland fjords, and may occur near many Antarctic glaciers in the future. Observations suggest that ice mlange may directly affect iceberg calving by pressing against the glacier front and indirectly affect glacier melting by controlling where and when icebergs melt which can impact ocean circulation and ocean heat transport towards glaciers. However, the interactions between ice mlange, ocean circulation, and iceberg calving have not been systematically investigated due to the difficulty of conducting field work in Greenland fjords.

The dominant experimental methods for structure determination, called Cryo-Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Crystallography, rely upon fitting the atoms from biological molecules into three-dimensional ?maps?, seeking agreement with experimental data. This fitting process is laborious and difficult, but preliminary studies have shown that this task could be performed very effectively by citizen scientists playing the biochemistry computer game Foldit. As a premier citizen science computer game, Foldit has already been played by over 600,000 people since its inception. This project aims to improve the capabilities of Foldit to enable scientists and citizen scientists alike to accurately build biological structures of varying types and sizes. This capability could strongly improve science?s ability to understand the basis of many biological phenomena. In addition to these scientific benefits, this project benefits both science education and society as a whole. This new capability will enhance the variety and quality of educational options using Foldit, improving it as a major interface between the scientific community and society.<br/><br/>There is an ongoing need for improvements for methods to solve crystal and cryo-EM structures. Foldit is a citizen science project in which users aid in many biochemistry problems, including model building and real space refinement in protein structure solving projects. Early tests suggest that these ventures produce high quality crystal and cryo-EM structures, but many improvements are needed to make Foldit a go-to option for structure solving problems. Recently, new versions of Foldit have been introduced that can be used by single scientists or lab groups, in addition to standard citizen science Foldit puzzles. These options will be leveraged to create a multi-scale modeling toolbox for structural biology problems. The additions proposed in this grant include integrating new crystallography refinement capabilities within Foldit, and adding new modes that allow much larger proteins to be handled in Foldit for cryo-EM.

Through a central artifact called a goal model, engineers visualize the goals and dependencies of both the system under consideration and the project stakeholders. By creating goal models, engineers can reason about project trade-offs and how stakeholder goals and dependencies may evolve. Prior work assumes that only a single individual creates a goal model. This project has two research objectives. First, the project aims to enable multiple modelers to gather features from stakeholders separately and merge them into a single model for analysis. By merging goal models, practitioners may collaborate and capture additional perspectives leading to a more complete representation of the project, with inconsistencies and conflicts being resolved in the process.  Second, the project aims to improve the usability of trade-off analysis and make analysis techniques more accessible to stakeholders. By providing stakeholders with more realistic models, practitioners can make better informed decisions, which in turn provides society with higher quality software. The project will contribute to the teaching of GORE modeling, an important part of software-engineering education. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigators aim to support stakeholders' ability to collaborate in GORE activities, specifically the creation and analysis of large goal models. Researchers investigate integrating the viewpoints of multiple stakeholders for models with timing information by merging model syntax and model semantics. In a second research activity, the investigators improve the interpretation of analysis results and define a methodology for applying GORE reasoning, which supports stakeholders in decision making. For example, this project combines color visualizations with filtering analysis results to narrow the state-space of potential solutions. The project will provide tool support for model-management features, such as traceability links to validate the provenance of the merge operation. The research team will validate the effectiveness of the merge operation and analysis visualization through empirical observations of modelers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proper and long-term management of natural history collections, including both physical specimens and their associated data, is crucial for scientific research by contemporary and future researchers. The Collection of Fishes at Texas A&M University is a substantial university-based ichthyology collection that has experienced rapid growth over the last 20 years. This collection serves a dual research and teaching role on the Texas A&M campus and more regionally, acting as both reference collection and specimen repository for researchers at other universities in Texas and other southern US states. A major goal of this project is a collection-wide physical re-organization and re-curation of specimens, coupled with a database platform migration that will safeguard the physical and digital content of this collection, facilitate growth, and broadly improve capacity to serve the national and international ichthyological research community as well as a growing community of non-traditional users of specimen data (e.g., K-12 educators, artists). Goals also include training of undergraduate students and Texas Master Naturalist volunteers in natural history specimen curation and management, novel undergraduate student course assignments and K-12 science-based art workshops focused on vertebrate natural history and ichthyology, and development of a temporary public exhibit showcasing the rare specimens from this university-based collection.    <br/><br/>The project will involve installation of new shelving and metal tanks to facilitate wholesale reorganization and re-curation of current alcohol specimens in the Collection of Fishes at Texas A&M University and to generate ample space for future growth.  A globally unique collection of oversized (10?14ft) shark specimens will be secured through container updates, specifically the replacement of a 40 year old custom-made oak casket with an industry standard air-tight metal unit.  Finally, data management platform upgrades will improve basic digital data management and enhance real time availability of specimen records via online international archives, including through iDigBio.org and VertNet.org.

Howard University?s award supports research that seeks to optimize the engineering of random composite materials that have electromagnetic (EM) capabilities.  Such capabilities include EM interference shielding and EM observability enhancing, and/or EM sensing capabilities. This opens a wide range of applications in commercial and defense technologies, such as electrical/electronic devices, communication systems, oil and gas industries, and military and law enforcement. <br/><br/>The macroscopic properties of composite materials depend on the geometry, distribution, volume fraction, and property of each constituent. While the numerical extraction techniques for the effective EM properties of periodically distributed composite materials are relatively well established and straightforward to implement, those for the randomly distributed composite materials have not been fully explored. The objective of this proposed research is to develop a rigorous theory and accurate and efficient numerical methods to provide the scale-dependent bounds of the effective EM properties of random composites in both static and dynamic cases. The proposed EM homogenization theory will be incorporated in the construction of an all-frequency stable formulation, which will be solved in Monte-Carlo simulations using finite element and domain decomposition methods. A stochastic simulation method will also be developed to characterize the material randomness and geometrical uncertainty and achieve an improved efficiency in the EM property retrieval. The proposed theories and methods will lead to the development of state-of-the-art homogenization tools for the characterization and analysis of random composite materials. This in turn would enable new design methodologies in random composites based on the theoretical guidance and computational support.

Many of us use it daily -- to dictate text messages on smart phones or to navigate automated phone systems. As good as these systems are, humans still outperform them in complex, crowded, and noisy acoustic environments. If more were known concerning how humans adapt to these challenging situations, speech technology might be made more adaptive and robust. For example, computer systems for speech recognition use complex ""deep learning"" networks that often need to be trained in ways that are very different from how humans learn language. Although neural network models aimed at simulating human language processing are much simpler, which allows scientists to develop hypotheses about how human language processing works, they don't use real speech as input. Instead, they use phonetic features that are more like text than speech and so fail to address the core problem of how humans map the acoustics of speech to words. This research program focuses on bridging the gap between the complex artificial neural network models used in current technologies for speech recognition and the simpler neural network models used to investigate how humans actually perceive speech.<br/><br/>This research program builds on a new neural network model for speech that aims to achieve high recognition accuracy on many words produced by several speakers. Crucially, the model can do this with minimal complexity (using many fewer layers than commercial speech recognition systems), which allows researchers to understand the computations it performs. The research plans include extending the model to a large vocabulary, training on naturalistic speech, and adding biologically plausible preprocessing modeled on the human auditory pathways. The model will be compared with key aspects of human spoken word recognition behavior as well as with human neural responses to spoken speech. The work has the potential to generate new insights to advance speech technology by making it more robust in challenging environments, with potential impact on speech technology used for health, law, education, and the automatic captioning that makes speech accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing. In addition, individuals ranging from high school students to Ph.D. students will be part of the research team and will have rich research experiences that will promote development of technical skills useful for careers in academic research or a variety of non-academic careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the near-surface environment, slow slip may impact a range of tectonic processes and seismic hazards, including reducing earthquake energy, controlling how earthquakes stop, and the intensity of ground shaking. A critical unknown is how the material properties of fault rocks control this phenomenon. This project focuses on a segment of the San Andreas fault that is overdue for a large earthquake and has experienced recent slow slip events. Investigators will make use of the unique textural and geochemical qualities of hematite, a common mineral in faults, to determine the prevalence, timing, and impact of slow slip along the southern San Andreas fault in Mecca Hills, California. Comparison of observations from natural hematite-coated faults with laboratory deformation experiments will document how hematite deforms to understand what governs where and why slow slip occurs. Data will be integrated into a new educational program, the Providence (Utah) to Providence (Rhode Island) Partnership, that will connect rural and urban students in different parts of the country and impact more than 450 elementary and middle school students. Research and broader impact activities will provide mentoring and role modeling opportunities for middle school through faculty levels, critical for expanding and diversifying the sciences through each stage of education and training.<br/><br/>Hematite is a common mineral on fault surfaces and its textures and thermochronometry data patterns can characterize a range of fault behavior. This project tests the hypothesis that hematite on fault surfaces promotes shallow slow slip by comparing data from hematite-coated slip surfaces in upper crustal, bedrock fault damage zones from Mecca Hills, with results from deformation experiments at sub-seismic slip rates on both hematite gouge and natural fault surfaces. Multi-scale microscopy and spectroscopy of hematite (and comparisons to clay textures), hematite (U-Th)/He analyses, and 4He/3He thermochronometry will be used to investigate rate-dependent friction behavior of hematite, related fault slip temperatures, deformation mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of past shallow fault slip. This research will generate bedrock material property data that are critical for realistic physics-based models integrating shallow slow slip into the seismic cycle. The Providence to Providence Partnership will connect eighth graders at the Center for Creativity, Innovation, and Discovery in rural Utah, situated in the Intermountain Seismic Belt, with fourth graders in urban Rhode Island, via Zoom teleconferences. Researchers and students will engage in annual virtual and field education modules on faults and earthquakes.

Within the realm of dynamics, the idea of using engineered structures to produce novel properties has been historically focused primarily on linear waves. This work seeks to understand the propagation of non-linear waves in mechanical metamaterials with application toward control of mechanical signals in larger-amplitude loading (for example, to provide protection during impact events) and toward reconfigurable soft structures (for example, locomotion of soft robots). This research will promote interdisciplinary research and teaching. Students of all levels will learn concepts and techniques from materials science and engineering, computational and analytic mechanical modeling, advanced manufacturing, and sensing. Moreover, the research team will integrate these efforts with undergraduate research programs, outreach efforts, and educational material development at both institutions to provide research opportunities to underrepresented groups of all ages (K-12, undergraduate, and graduate).<br/><br/>The objective of this work is to understand the fundamental connection between geometry and the propagation of non-linear waves in compliant mechanical metamaterials comprising rotating polygons. Rather than limiting the scope to periodic systems as in previous work, the geometry of the metamaterials will be locally tailored, and inhomogeneities will be harnessed to achieve target dynamic responses such as maximal energy absorption, soliton lensing, and locomotion. The multi-faceted research program will intertwine theoretical, numerical, and experimental activities to generate new insights into the non-linear dynamic behavior of mechanical metamaterials based on rotating units. To achieve this, the research is organized into three thrusts, focusing on (1) the effect of inhomogeneities on the propagation of non-linear waves, (2) reconfigurability of system dynamics via non-linear waves, and (3) optimization of geometry and defects via machine learning to achieve targeted dynamic properties (energy absorption, steering waves, locomotion, etc.).<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Dynamics, Control, and Systems Diagnostics (DCSD) and the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MOMS) programs in the Civil, Mechanical, and Industrial Innovation Division.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interactions between climate change, wildfire, and water cycles are well-studied in many mountain regions, such as the western United States, where forest fires are very frequent. Recent events suggest that wildfire may also be an emerging threat to tropical mountain environments, where natural fires are thought to be rare. The effects of wildfires on forest composition and water resources in tropical mountain regions are poorly known. The goal of this project is to investigate the causes of changes in fire, vegetation, and flooding in tropical mountains, specifically in the Rwenzori Mountains National Park, Uganda. This research will improve our ability to predict the responses of tropical mountain systems to future climate change and establish a basis for management strategies related to fire in these ecosystems. The project will provide opportunities for many graduate and undergraduate students to conduct research, will deliver a short course on climate and vegetation modeling, and will develop new classroom modules to be used in the Providence Public School System.<br/> <br/>This research will investigate the interactions between climate, fire regimes, vegetation composition, and flooding through analysis of lake sediment cores recovered from alpine environments in the Rwenzori Mountains, a site famous for its biodiversity. The project will test the hypothesis that changes in fire regimes in tropical mountain environments are influenced by temperature change. The role of changing fire regimes in influencing vegetation assemblages and catalyzing flood events will also be examined. The project will generate new paleoecological and paleoclimatological records based on several aspects of the sediment cores: fossil charcoal and pollen composition, organic geochemical data, and sediment composition.  These analyses will focus on time intervals such as the mid-Holocene, when temperatures were warmer than the present day, to investigate how warm temperatures influenced ecosystem dynamics.

The area of mathematical dynamical systems consists of the study of the evolution over time of a system under a transformation rule that governs the behavior of the system. Methods from the study of dynamical systems, when applied to systems of algebraic origin and admitting a lot of symmetries, shed light, perhaps strikingly, on some of the oldest and most well-studied questions in mathematics, namely solutions in whole numbers, or integers, of polynomial equations, and approximations of arbitrary real numbers by fractions. In turn, developments in number theory, driven by dynamical methods, have had interesting and surprising applications, reaching recently as far as impacting wireless communication technologies. This project aims to deepen these fruitful connections between dynamics and number theory by, in particular, developing new methods for counting the number of integer solutions to certain types of highly symmetric polynomial equations.

For applications in computer vision, genomics, and social networks, the hidden structures are often of discrete nature, making traditional algorithms not scalable to modern large data sets. To address this computational challenge, this research will introduce statistical methodologies to develop new models and fast algorithms for recovering discrete structures in data. The integration of computational and statistical perspectives will lead to not only advancement in theory, but also statistical packages for learning tasks. Moreover, multiple components of the research will bring societal benefits such as uncovering threats to online anonymity and understanding social polarization. This project will also provide high-quality training and research opportunities to next-generation data scientists.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research will focus on three types of problems: graph and shape matching, graph layout problems, and mixture models. Central to all these problems is the inference of permutations from noisy, incomplete observations.

To develop efficient algorithms, this research will take an average-case perspective and employ a variety of techniques including spectral methods, convex relaxations, and non-convex local search. Theoretically, the fundamental limits of the proposed problems and algorithms will be characterized in terms of the trade-off between statistical and computational efficiency.

Over the past half century, it has grown from humble origins into a rich field with deep connections to and applications in disparate fields across mathematics and the sciences. A central mathematical framework that has spurred combinatorics' development from its inception is the challenge of understanding geometric spaces by their decomposition into constituent pieces. Recent breakthroughs of this type have led to deeper understanding of fundamental problems in theoretical physics, probability theory, algebraic geometry and many other fields. Since the 19th century, mathematicians have applied this framework to better understand collections of two-dimensional arrays of data called matrix spaces. This project will use combinatorial tools to determine properties of matrix spaces broken down into pieces determined by imposing redundancy conditions on the underlying data. In addition, funds will support undergraduate research, training graduate students and outreach efforts including work with a prison education program.<br/><br/>To a mathematician, the spaces this project studies are quite simple: matrices, idempotent matrices, symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices. The pieces of matrix spaces considered in this project, called matrix Schubert varieties, are comprised of matrices satisfying rank restrictions on specified submatrices. Matrix Schubert varieties are invariant under certain row/column operations -- this extends to a natural group action. By taking this group action into account, geometric and topological properties of matrix Schubert varieties solve central questions in enumerative algebraic geometry and intersection theory. Using a collection of tools from combinatorics and commutative algebra known collectively as 'Grobner geometry', this project will describe polynomial representatives that encode the geometric properties of matrix Schubert varieties. A potential application is the first combinatorial description of structure constants in the Lagrangian Grassmannian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, apart from conversational assistants, most smart devices and environments rely primarily on presenting information visually, a poor fit for many situations where users' visual attention is on something besides the device. One way to support these situations is to let people use sound or touch for interactions. However, adding separate microphones, loudspeakers, and vibration mechanisms using conventional means can impose extra costs and reduce the device?s durability and aesthetics. This project seeks to develop alternative technologies for recording and reproducing spatial audio through bending vibrations on flat surfaces ranging from smartphones to video walls. These vibrations can also allow the smart acoustic surface to serve as a touch interface. The advantage of this approach lies in the fact that the surface is already part of the device, allowing the device to maintain its durability and aesthetics while incorporating these new features. Adding spatial audio and haptic feedback to OLED displays, smartphones, and video walls will provide fundamental technology to improve people's ability to navigate complex data sets such as menus and maps, and enable a greater sense of immersion for remote applications such as video conference calls. <br/><br/>The project develops a framework for designing surfaces such as the display screen of a device to serve as acoustic and vibrotactile interfaces. The research objectives will address the following three challenges by employing the vibro-acoustics of extended surfaces: (1) spatial audio reproduction, (2) spatial audio capture, and (3) haptic feedback and touch sensing. The vibrations of the extended surface induced by acoustic and touch interactions with the structure can be detected using arrays of sensors distributed on the surface. Similarly, arrays of force actuators distributed on the surface will induce bending vibrations that cause the structure to radiate sound. Loudspeaker and microphone array processing methods will be adapted for the vibration actuators and sensors with applications including noise reduction, sound-field control, and beamforming. Machine learning techniques will be used to identify source-location features stemming from vibration patterns induced by acoustic and touch interactions with the structure. Acoustic recordings and scanning laser vibrometer measurements will be used to analyze the effectiveness of the framework in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some Amazonian birds live and forage together in close associations and are an ideal system to quantify the relative importance of alarm and safety signaling. By capitalizing on ecological gradients created by logging and development, which have reduced the number of birds living together, this project will be among the first to compare and contrast interspecific threat and safety networks and while doing so determine how robust they are to anthropogenic challenges. These insights are foundationally important to manage populations in an era of human modified environmental changes, and these results will identify key behavioral mechanisms that may ultimately be drivers for species interactions in diverse biological communities. While doing so, this project will train students at the undergraduate and graduate level and will generate a local academic bridge for students from diverse backgrounds at California State University Long Beach, a primarily undergraduate institution, and the University of California at Los Angeles. Additionally, this project will generate inquiry-based lesson plans for public schools in two California school districts as part of an ongoing outreach effort stemming from research activities in Peru and present students with a broader representation of diverse people as role models in science and to demystify the scientific process. <br/><br/>There is a growing awareness that animals often benefit from the public information contained in alarm signals produced by members of other species. While much research has focused on mixed-species groups of related or similar species, some recent examples illustrate how signals are also used between quite distinct taxonomic groups. Despite the emphasis on eavesdropping on alarm signals, animals also acquire information about safety by eavesdropping on the non-threat-related sounds produced by other species. Understanding the interplay between alarm signals and cues of safety within the public information landscape is essential to understand the role of communication in shaping species interactions within groups and how this influences the larger community. This project will study the roles of mixed-species flocks of Amazonian birds in community-wide alarm and safety eavesdropping networks along a gradient of forest degradation. Results will identify the relative importance of these networks and how robust these systems are to the loss of individual species.

Fundamental research issues are to be explored within this mobile network, for example, understanding how the mobile acoustic channel fluctuates in the micro-scale of tens of milliseconds and investigating the optimal ocean sampling strategy for given spatial correlation properties. The gained insights will help develop innovative signal processing techniques at multiple layers, from channel modeling to system optimization. Three research thrusts will be launched, including 1) mobile acoustic channel modeling, 2) mobile adaptive acoustic communications, and 3) integrative sampling, communications, and navigation.

When and how humans obtained this ability is uncertain. This project seeks to clarify the timing and nature of human ecosystem modification over the course of human evolutionary history. Specifically, this project examines the potential impacts of a new emphasis on meat-eating by Pleistocene Homo erectus on mammal communities using a quantitative, food-web approach, informed by studies of the anatomy and isotopic composition of fossil predators with which human ancestors competed for access to meat. The project broadens participation in paleoanthropology by creating new opportunities for student research, enhances international, multidisciplinary research collaborations, and disseminates results broadly, including public-facing outreach events. <br/><br/>The Ancient Hominin Impacts Hypothesis (AHIH) states that meat-eating by Homo erectus caused profound impacts on Pleistocene mammal communities, driving both large herbivore prey species, and competing predators to extinction. However, at the time Homo erectus first appeared, the region in which they appeared was experiencing climate-driven grassland expansions, which may also have contributed to extinctions in predators and prey. It is currently unknown whether environmental change, human impacts, or a combination of both best explains the observed Pleistocene mammal extinctions. This project tests the AHIH using a paleo food webs approach at the site where Homo erectus first appears in the fossil record. Anatomical and isotopic studies of local carnivores reveal which herbivore species extinct carnivore consumed, informing a quantitative paleo food-web model of the local community. The outputs of numerical food-web modeling experiments will be compared to the predictions the AHIH to reveal what impact, if any, human ancestors had on Pleistocene mammal communities. The project expands an understanding of the evolutionary significance of meat eating to ecosystem modification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The African trypanosome is an example of one such parasite that moves between the blood of infected animals and the tsetse fly. When a tsetse fly bites a human or a hooved animal, parasites are transferred to the bloodstream and cause a fatal disease called African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Understanding how the parasites adapt to each environment is important for understanding the dynamics of infection in regions where the disease is endemic. In addition, because African trypanosomes diverged very early from other well studied model organisms, understanding the gene regulation that occurs as parasites adapt to different environments will shed light on how gene regulatory systems evolved. The study of parasite adaptation in a research lab setting will provide opportunities for first- generation high school students and first year college students underrepresented in STEM fields to forge close connections with a research mentor, which is important for retention in the field. Students will also be given the opportunity to pursue open ended projects on parasite adaptation in a classroom laboratory setting, ideally increasing their confidence and interest in joining a research lab.<br/><br/>The trypanosome (T. brucei) genome is organized into large polycistronic transcription units of functionally unrelated genes. No DNA sequence-specific transcription factors have been identified, nor are there obvious promoter sequences. Histone modifications also differ substantially from other eukaryotes. The lack of sequence specific transcription factors in T. brucei have led some to hypothesize that they harbor a ?primitive? version of the histone code. Despite these differences, substantial transcriptome reprogramming is required to facilitate the huge changes in morphology and metabolism that occur as parasites cycle between the tsetse fly vector and the bloodstream of infected mammals. The molecular mechanisms that drive these large- scale changes in the transcriptome are poorly understood. The premise of this research project is that chromatin interacting bromodomain proteins act as key modulators of transcriptome reprogramming in parasites adapting to a new host. This premise will be investigated by 1) determining whether bromodomain proteins are required for maintenance of the midgut transcriptome in insect-stage parasites using RNA-seq, 2) characterizing the changes in bromodomain protein occupancy that occur during parasite adaptation from the bloodstream to the insect stage using CUT&RUN, and (3) determining the knockdown phenotype of candidate genes proximal to areas of dynamic bromodomain protein occupancy as parasites transition from the bloodstream to the insect stage. This knowledge is expected to highlight differences in gene regulation in a eukaryote that diverged early from better studied model systems.<br/><br/>This award was cofunded by the Symbiosis, Infection and Immunity Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate the genomic consequences of abandoning photosynthesis and the evolution of extreme fungal host specificity in a comparative context, enabling a better understanding of how this partnership varies at a genetic level. It will bring together research and education by creating lesson plans in high school Biology, through a collaboration among researchers, teachers, and students. This educational program will focus on rural schools in Appalachia, from which recruitment into STEM careers remains low, engaging the next generation of STEM researchers in a region where employment opportunities are changing. The project will result in sustainable and accessible educational resources for teachers and students that will be disseminated broadly.<br/><br/>The project will focus on: 1) sequencing and evolutionary analysis of plastid genomes for all parasitic orchids and close relatives; 2) molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses of fungal hosts in several focal orchid species complexes; 3) densely sampling the genomes of focal orchid taxa to identify the genomic basis of adaptation in host preference; and 4) creating an integrated model of genomic modification and fungal host specificity.

The project's novelties are developing tools that play an integral role in the design of privacy-preserving protocols. Such protocols have societal benefits, enabling computation on sensitive data while keeping the data private. The project's impacts include achieving more efficient protocols for many important real-world applications and deepening our understanding of efficient constructions and fundamental limits in many areas in cryptography that are related to OT, such as secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs, advanced types of encryption and more. The investigators integrate their research results into curricula for both undergraduate and graduate level courses and are committed to mentoring and advising students at all levels, from undergraduate to PhD, especially those from under-represented groups in computing.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three main thrusts to expand the realm of oblivious transfer. First, the investigators design efficient constructions of OT with advanced functionality and strengthened security, which can be better leveraged in cryptographic systems. These OT notions provide features for reducing communication and computation costs in various settings, making them indispensable tools in big-data applications. Second, the project investigates a specific MPC problem that has close connections to OT. In particular, using advanced OT tools, the investigators improve the efficiency and enrich the functionality of private set intersection (PSI) protocols, which have wide applications in practice.

Imaging these important molecules is hampered by the lack of sensing tools, limiting our ability to understand how certain biological molecules allow the brain to communicate with the body. This project will develop new experimental and theoretical tools to detect the presence of brain-relevant molecules, with a focus on two molecules called serotonin and oxytocin, which are involved in human mood, emotions, social behavior, and their dysregulation in disorders like depression and autism. The new tools are based on DNA molecules, long molecules composed of repeating subunits, wrapped around long and rigid carbon nanotubes, which will detect serotonin and oxytocin in the sample by emitting light. The key objective is to discover special DNA molecules that will bind strongly to serotonin and oxytocin, bring them close to the nanotube surface, and change the optical signal that the nanotube emits. This objective will be addressed by combining the information obtained in experimental screening of DNA-nanotube systems with the artificial intelligence computer methods and computer simulations. The project will lead to new methods for discovery of useful DNA molecules, which could be applied towards developing tools to detect other biological molecules of interest that currently remain ?invisible?. The efforts in this project will enrich the training and research experiences of underrepresented students at the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of California, Berkeley and provide the basis for demonstrations on science behind serotonin and oxytocin to middle school student groups.  <br/><br/>Sensing and imaging of small molecular analytes within complex biological samples is of high interest but remains a challenge due to the lack of suitable imaging tools. This project will establish methods to systematically develop conjugates of single-walled carbon nanotubes and single stranded DNA for optical sensing of selected analytes. The methods will be established for two analytes, serotonin, and oxytocin brain neuromodulators. To develop new DNA-nanotube optical sensors, unique DNA sequences, which simultaneously bind with high affinity to the analytes on nanotube surfaces and lead to strong optical response of the nanotubes, need to be identified. Yet, discovering these useful DNA sequences has been a challenge, with most research efforts relying on screening-based serendipity. In this project, the research team will combine the high throughput datasets of experimental DNA sequence screening methods, lower throughput spectroscopic measurements, and the artificial intelligence-based methodology to learn and predict DNA sequences that bind with high affinity to analytes on nanotube surfaces and induce high nanotube optical activity. First, the team will develop and validate new methods to: 1) determine short DNA sequences that bind with high affinity to serotonin and oxytocin molecules on nanotube surfaces; and 2) learn and predict DNA sequences that provide high optical response to DNA-nanotube conjugates in the presence of the analytes. Then, the molecular basis of analyte recognition by DNA sequences on nanotube surfaces will be explored with simulations. This project should have a significant impact on many individuals from underrepresented groups at the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of California, Berkeley through several activities that will be organized. The computational chemistry modules will be introduced into physical chemistry laboratory classes, a student-coordinated research event will be organized, and demonstrations on the science behind serotonin and oxytocin will be developed for middle school student groups.

Extensive efforts have been devoted to synthesis of sequence-specific synthetic polymers (oligomers and multi-block copolymers) and to probe how the changes in monomer sequence affect the polymer behavior. However, it remains as a question: ?what extent of sequence specificity is needed in synthetic polymers to exhibit protein-like behavior??  Recent experimental studies demonstrated that random heteropolymers (RHPs) with statistical sequence control could be designed to recapitulate proteins? functions. This is orthogonal to well accepted protein sequence-structure-function approaches in biology. The proposed studies aim to answer an important question on what these RHPs are at different levels ranging from segment, single-chain, to clusters in solution. Systematic studies from the angle of polymer phase behavior will combine the fountain of knowledge in traditional polymer science and biology. Successful RHP developments may enable polymers to molecularly interface with biological processes and ultimately lead to hybrid functional materials. <br/><br/>The project includes broad interdisciplinary educational and mentoring aspects, outreach, development of undergraduate laboratory modules, as well as creation of publicly available software tools for RHP sequence simulation and analysis to overcome the initial barriers in RHP design.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>RHPs act as chaperon proteins to stabilize enzymes in non-native environments and channel proteins to selectively, rapidly transport protons.  Recently results on such RHPs suggested that monomeric sequence specificity is not the prerequisite to replicate some properties of natural proteins. It is feasible to rationally design RHPs with protein-like behavior. This project will experimentally study the RHPs? synthesis and solution behavior at the single-chain level and as ensembles and provide experimental foundation toward initial understanding of this class of complex, challenging, and useful polymeric materials. Specifically, the planned studies focus on: (1) Synthesis and characterization of RHP libraries with controlled composition and statistical monomer distribution; (2)Phase behavior of RHPs in dilute solutions; (3) Assemblies of RHPs in solutions with increased concentration.  In parallel, the PI's group will synthesize and characterize model block copolymers to delineate effects of statistical monomer distribution in RHPs. <br/><br/>As an orthogonal approach to sequence-specific polymers, RHPs represent a rarely explored area in terms of polymer design and encompass controlled randomness as a critical design parameter. If successful, the planned studies will pave the path toward truly protein-like polymers synthetically. With the interdisciplinary nature of RHP approach,these studies provide a platform to promote polymer science among different scientific communities and training opportunities for the next generation of materials scientists.  The project includes broad interdisciplinary educational and mentoring aspects, outreach, development of undergraduate laboratory modules, as well as creation of publicly available software tools for RHP sequence simulation and analysis to overcome the initial barriers in RHP design.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the near-surface environment, slow slip may impact a range of tectonic processes and seismic hazards, including reducing earthquake energy, controlling how earthquakes stop, and the intensity of ground shaking. A critical unknown is how the material properties of fault rocks control this phenomenon. This project focuses on a segment of the San Andreas fault that is overdue for a large earthquake and has experienced recent slow slip events. Investigators will make use of the unique textural and geochemical qualities of hematite, a common mineral in faults, to determine the prevalence, timing, and impact of slow slip along the southern San Andreas fault in Mecca Hills, California. Comparison of observations from natural hematite-coated faults with laboratory deformation experiments will document how hematite deforms to understand what governs where and why slow slip occurs. Data will be integrated into a new educational program, the Providence (Utah) to Providence (Rhode Island) Partnership, that will connect rural and urban students in different parts of the country and impact more than 450 elementary and middle school students. Research and broader impact activities will provide mentoring and role modeling opportunities for middle school through faculty levels, critical for expanding and diversifying the sciences through each stage of education and training.<br/><br/>Hematite is a common mineral on fault surfaces and its textures and thermochronometry data patterns can characterize a range of fault behavior. This project tests the hypothesis that hematite on fault surfaces promotes shallow slow slip by comparing data from hematite-coated slip surfaces in upper crustal, bedrock fault damage zones from Mecca Hills, with results from deformation experiments at sub-seismic slip rates on both hematite gouge and natural fault surfaces. Multi-scale microscopy and spectroscopy of hematite (and comparisons to clay textures), hematite (U-Th)/He analyses, and 4He/3He thermochronometry will be used to investigate rate-dependent friction behavior of hematite, related fault slip temperatures, deformation mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of past shallow fault slip. This research will generate bedrock material property data that are critical for realistic physics-based models integrating shallow slow slip into the seismic cycle. The Providence to Providence Partnership will connect eighth graders at the Center for Creativity, Innovation, and Discovery in rural Utah, situated in the Intermountain Seismic Belt, with fourth graders in urban Rhode Island, via Zoom teleconferences. Researchers and students will engage in annual virtual and field education modules on faults and earthquakes. Eighth graders in Utah will teach these concepts to rising Utah eighth graders and fourth graders in RI.

Despite significant research into the development of autonomous robotic agents, humans are still experiencing ambivalence towards their robotic teammates. The problem lies not only in the limitations of robots to interacting with humans, but also in the humans? inability to understand their robotic partners. Humans tend to be overly optimistic or pessimistic towards robots, resulting in an unforgiving discordance between reality and expectations and, ultimately, egregious teaming failures. This study will address a fundamental cause for such a discordance due to different understandings of the task domain between the human and the robot. In such situations, it is crucial for the robot to understand how to reconcile the discrepancy to maintain proper teaming. The framework to expand the applicability of robotic technologies aligns with the broad call for co-robot development. It represents a key enabler of interpretable and safe robots for human-robot interaction. The educational goal is to innovate robotics education to excite and attract students, train the next generation of scientists and engineers in human-robot collaboration, engage the public audience in the discussion, and boost trust in robotics technologies. The activities will benefit K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, and students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The specific research goal is to address the different understandings of the task domain between the human and the robot, referred to as reflective domain models, by developing model reflective planning and learning methods to form the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of Reflective Robotics. The key to containing such reflective domain models is for the robot to maintain estimates of the true domain model and the human?s understanding of it and utilize both to inform its operation. In particular, 1) Model Reflective Planning contributes uniquely to the paradigm shift in planning to generalize planning methods to open-world domains for real-world applications. In contrast to the traditional planning methods that depend only on a single domain model, model reflective planning also considers the human?s understanding of it. A Bayesian approach is to actively model such an understanding while incorporating the hierarchical information as state and action abstractions to inform planning methods. As such, model reflective planning contributes to the realization of real-world autonomy for robotic teammates. 2) Model Reflective Learning advocates a paradigm shift in the design of learning methods to generalize to situations with reflective models, which are the norm rather than the exceptions with non-expert users. A framework based on entropy augmented reinforcement learning integrated with variational inference will be investigated. It avoids a pitfall by addressing a critical gap in the existing learning systems where human users can mislead learning in non-trivial and systematic ways. At the same time, these results will provide an exciting new foundation for the PI?s long-term career in robotics and generate new growth and leadership opportunities in the community.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It underpins nearly every Internet activity, translating user-friendly names like www.google.com to computer-friendly IP addresses. Though designed as a highly reliable infrastructure in its blueprint, DNS failures are not rare, sometimes even leading to the network outage of a country. Debugging DNS failures is undoubtedly important but also challenging. Though DNS can be seen as a distributed system, it is open-ended and fragmented, containing numerous service providers and being interfered by powerful network adversaries. Though the basic logic of DNS is conceptually simple, its implementation is highly customized on the client-side devices and DNS bugs can be caused by the complex interactions between code and non-code resources. These unique settings make DNS failures and bugs complex and difficult to be diagnosed.<br/><br/>This project is to develop novel platforms, techniques, and tools to enable holistic debugging for the DNS Infrastructure. This work is organized through two research thrusts: debugging DNS failures at the network layer, and debugging client-side DNS bugs at the software layer. For the first thrust, a comprehensive reference to the real-world DNS failures and bugs are to be created first by mining the public text with DMiner, a tool powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. To reproduce a DNS failure, a new measurement platform, DTrap+, will be developed with innovative usage of peer-to-peer proxies to crowd-source the debugging tasks. To enable cross-layer and adversary-resilient debugging for DNS, DTrace, an end-to-end tracing framework for DNS, and DARTrace, a secured tracing protocol, will be developed. The second thrust focuses on the DNS bugs embedded in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The DNS implementations will be extracted from the IoT firmware with DFirm, a tool powered by symbolic execution and library matching. The DNS bugs will be uncovered by DScope, a tool enforcing multi-component analysis on the DNS implementations.<br/><br/>The proposed project will have significant societal impacts in the following aspects. First, ensuring reliable network services for the Internet users is one core mission of the Internet community. By enabling effective fault discovery and root-cause analysis of DNS services and clients, this project makes an important contribution to this mission. Second, through a set of educational tasks, this project will democratize DNS and the general network debugging for students, researchers, industry partners, and the public. Third, this project will prioritize research opportunities for the underrepresented population through programs like UCI ASPIRE and OC STEM.<br/><br/>The data, code, and knowledge base developed under this project will be released at dns-debug.github.io.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Making these tools open source will also facilitate further collaborative development, broaden the responsibility for collective maintenance and enhancement of this software, and ensure the persistence of these unique tools.

Specifically, Dr. Fournier?s group is investigating a special class of reactions in which protons and electrons simultaneously move from one molecule to another. These reactions are at the heart of many fundamental biological and chemical processes, including photosynthesis and cellular respiration, but are difficult to study with existing experimental methods. In order to overcome such difficulties, Dr. Fournier and his students are developing a new approach that allows them to directly track the reactions in real time with molecular-level detail. The results of their measurements help to unravel and quantify the most important factors that drive these reactions, which is vital information for understanding key biological processes and for developing new molecules for applications in green energy and chemical synthesis. The project also includes an effort to modernize physical chemistry education at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as outreach events that introduce St. Louis-area high school students to the ways in which the quantum mechanical behavior of atoms and molecules affects the world around us.  <br/><br/>Catalytic processes driven by proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions are ubiquitous in chemistry and biology, yet the current understanding of these reactions and the ability to quantitatively predict mechanisms and reaction dynamics involving PCET remains limited. Dr. Fournier and his team are using a suite of infrared spectroscopy techniques to study PCET reactions for a series of biomimetic model complexes. These spectroscopic techniques include gas-phase cryogenic ion vibrational spectroscopy (CIVS), solution-phase two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR), as well as the development and implementation of a novel approach called time-resolved cryogenic ion vibrational spectroscopy (TR-CIVS). The TR-CIVS measurements will systematically probe well-defined systems in the gas phase with both high frequency resolution and ultrafast temporal resolution, with the goal of characterizing the elusive proton transfer coordinate in more detail than previously possible. The experiments target the identification of transient intermediates and the dynamics of their formation, and will probe the role of tunneling and low-frequency hydrogen-bonding modes in the proton transfer process. This work aims to provide important insight for understanding PCET mechanisms and to aid in the development of new computational models that predict how the chemical architecture of catalytic systems determines their reactive properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced deep learning techniques provide a new paradigm to learn end-to-end insider threat detection models from complex user behavior data. This project develops a deep learning framework for insider threat detection.

Fiber networks are the main structural component of many synthetic and natural materials: polymeric or biological fibers and nanofibers with rigid inclusions are omnipresent in biological tissues, tissue scaffolds, biomedical implants, electrospun air filtration systems, cellulose products, etc. Most of these fibrous systems form composites with embedded non-fibrous entities. While continuum matrix composites have been studied extensively, the mechanics of hybrid networks with a discrete matrix has received no attention to date, despite the plethora of applications. The results of this research will influence the design of a wide range of applications of fibrous networks, such as non-wovens, gels, rubber, tissue scaffolds, cellulose products, etc. as well as our understanding of the mechanical behavior of a wealth of biological systems which are comprised of heterogeneous random networks. On the educational front, a program geared towards high school, undergraduate and graduate students with computational activities and hands on laboratory experiments will include several aspects of this research.<br/><br/>This research will (i) establish structure-property relations of hybrid fiber networks, (ii) extend the theory of composites with continuum matrices to composites in which the matrix is a discrete fiber network, (iii) establish new methods to experimentally investigate fibrous materials and their composites. The theory of continuum matrix composites will be extended to hybrid materials in which the matrix is a fiber network reinforced with particles or fibers of different properties from those of the main network (matrix). Thereby, effective ways will be identified to reinforce networks with small volume fractions of fillers, and concomitantly improve dramatically on the composite stiffness and strength. First, experiments and computational modeling will evaluate the perturbation introduced by an isolated filler to the deformation fields of stochastic networks in order to establish an equivalent Eshelby solution for networks. Then, the effect of filler concentration on the small and large strain mechanical response and network strength will be explored to establish effective homogenization methods for hybrid networks. Data from controlled experiments performed with the aforementioned systems will be used to validate the numerical models, which will be then used to broadly explore the design space defined by the network and filler parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Development of these materials is informed by their unique ""ball and stick"" atomic structure, wherein atoms (balls) are interconnected by covalent bonds (sticks) to produce a continuous network where bond density largely determines the response (rigid or flexible) of the material to applied shear forces. However, several recent observations are inconsistent with this simple model and appear to be better explained by appealing to an alternative network of ""weakest linkages"" obtained when certain redundant connections are omitted. The project seeks to attain deeper understanding of how atomic-level glass structure ultimately determines material properties by generating much needed new observations of the glassy dynamics that can definitively test model predictions. Work is performed primarily by undergraduate students who gain valuable research skills as part of their trajectory toward advanced studies. The project also offers non-science students a peek at the excitement of science and engineering research through the creation and delivery of a new hands-on materials science course that incorporates service-learning activities in the surrounding K-12 community.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The properties of oxide glasses vary from floppy to rigid depending on the degree to which mechanical constraints imposed by a network of covalent bonds percolate within the structure.  Properties also include the complex dynamics (both non-Arrhenius rates and non-exponential decay) of the viscoelastic relaxation of melt which has rarely been studied in network-forming oxides. Recently, two competing models propose differing ways in which thermodynamics might be integrated with static bond constraints to predict viscoelastic properties like the glass transition temperature and fragility. One assumes atomic constraints with an hierarchy of thermal strengths while the other emphasizes a mean field structure obtained by coarse-graining over certain pockets of rigid matter. Here, dynamic light scattering (together with high-resolution Raman spectroscopy) is performed on a selection of oxide systems to provide a critical test of the two models while also providing much needed characterization of the relaxation in these refractory melts. These studies, conducted primarily by undergraduate students, provide hands-on experience with multiple forms of spectroscopy and serve to train the next generation of science practitioners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, it will create the Robert Noyce Spatial Thinking Academy, which will be designed to motivate talented STEM students and professionals to become successful STEM teachers in high-need public schools. In the process of moving to certification, the future teachers will improve their spatial thinking knowledge and skills.  In addition, they will learn to use spatial thinking as an approach to improve their students' STEM learning. The project will provide two pathways to New York State Teacher Certification: Pathway 1 for recent STEM graduates and Pathway 2 for STEM workforce professionals. Three combined cohorts of Pathway 1 and Pathway 2 students will receive scholarships or stipends. Through the Spatial Thinking Academy, the project will: (1) train and retain talented individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds in STEM education; (2) increase future teachers' understanding of the context in which STEM learning occurs in both informal and formal settings; and (3) increase the capacity of highly qualified STEM educators to advance learning of STEM concepts by reinforcing them with spatial thinking skills.<br/><br/>This project at Saint John's University includes partnerships with New York City metropolitan area high-three need school districts (Yonkers, New York School District and School District 31 in Staten Island). The goal of the project will be to recruit, support, and retain talented STEM graduates who will pursue a career as a biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, or mathematics teacher in high-need public schools. In doing so, the Spatial Thinking Academy will support 36 talented STEM graduates to serve in these schools and will provide two pathways leading to New York State Teacher Initial Certification. Pathway 1 is designed for 24 recent Saint John's graduates with STEM majors. Pathway 2 is designed for 12 STEM professionals seeking initial teaching certification as career changers. Both Pathway 1 and 2 future teachers will enroll in a one-year master's degree in education and will receive scholarships or stipends for that year. Through a longitudinal mixed methods research approach, the project investigators will: (a) design, test, and verify a STEM teaching residency model intended to be sustainable and adaptable at other universities; (b) test and verify institutional policies and best practices to increase the number of STEM majors from culturally diverse communities who pursue careers in teaching; (c) review, modify, and implement institutional strategies that provide a career pathway for STEM majors to pursue careers as STEM educators; (d) design, test, verify, and validate curricula that recognize the importance of spatial thinking as a 21st-century STEM educational, professional, and career-readiness skill; and (e) design, test, and validate a model for ongoing professional development and instructional coaching for STEM teachers. Testing and validation will be conducted by tracking scholars prior to participation, during the program period, and for one year following employment in the partner school districts.  The study will explore not only future teachers' abilities to connect spatial skills and STEM subjects, but also their ability to teach STEM topics from the perspective of spatial thinking. The results of this work may have far-reaching implications for connecting spatial cognition research with STEM teaching practice throughout the country. This Track 1?Scholarships and Stipends?project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

This in turn advances applications ranging from adaptive lenses and memory storage devices to nonlinear optics, fuel cells, or field-effect transistors. A specific example is that the proposed crystalline photoresponsive materials enable future optoelectronic materials. The research is synergistic with the Materials Assembly and Design Excellence in South Carolina (MADE in SC). In addition to transformative research, PI Shustova also continues the development of the Carolinian Women in Science (Wi-Sci) Supportive Network. The major Wi-Sci goal is to create and grow a network of support for women currently at the Carolinian institutions of higher education, including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and therefore increase opportunities for women to attain at least 50% of the positions projected for STEM disciplines in the Carolinas. The proposed Wi-Sci initiative integrates educational and research opportunities for female students in STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>Achieving control over photoisomerization kinetics through material design is a challenge that must be addressed to advance the fields of optoelectronics or memory and energy storage. However, fundamental principles, that allow for enabling control over photoisomerization kinetics (i.e., achieve reversible and fast material photoresponse) are still vastly underdeveloped. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, furthers the development of crystalline stimuli-responsive hybrid materials exhibiting tunable and reversible photoisomerization of coordinatively-immobilized stimuli-responsive units as a function of material topology. The research team pursues two routes to assemble photoresponsive MOFs: a) assembly of MOFs from a combination of photochromic ligands, such as diarylethene-based ones, and non-photochromic ligands; and b) photoisomerization through MOF-linker side groups. Extensive photophysical analysis of the resulting photoresponsive frameworks are elucidating structure-property relationships related to electronic structure modulation. Additionally, the project promotes integration of educational and research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, with a special emphasis on women in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These choices can endanger livelihoods and well-being. This project advances knowledge about differences between measurements and perceptions of rainfall trends and how farmers decide to act on this uncertain environmental information. From this information this research will develop meaningful rainfall metrics in direct collaboration with farmers that can be used to reduce their vulnerability and enhance local adaptation strategies in anticipation of future droughts. <br/><br/>Large gaps exist in knowledge of where changes in rainfall variability and extremes are occurring, when and how these affect individual farmers and their agricultural decisions, and if these are currently represented in instrumental datasets and by local climate services organizations.

Local perceptions and knowledge of past and present precipitation variability are assessed using a set of surveys, focus groups, and interviews in agricultural communities. This project will determine how local organizations integrate these different and possibly disparate knowledge systems as part of their attempts to help farmers become more resilient to rainfall variability.  This project expands knowledge of the cognitive frameworks that farmers use to understand and act on their own observations of environmental phenomena in combination with the information provided to them by other institutions and organizations.

The State of Nebraska is participating in the second quantum revolution by launching an interdisciplinary, interdepartmental, and multi-campus research and education cluster on Emergent Quantum Materials and Technologies (EQUATE) to increase jurisdictional competitiveness in the  area of quantum science and technologies. The project focuses on research and workforce development to advance knowledge on topics related to quantum materials, technologies, and computation.  Quantum materials are a new class of materials that exhibit quantum phenomena at macroscopic length scales and are expected to advance the technological landscape through the advent of quantum technologies.  These new technologies will revolutionize fields such as information technology, medical technology, and cryptography, with impact on security areas such as defense and banking.  EQUATE converges for the first-time the complementary quantum science and technology expertise of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, the University of Nebraska at Kearney, and Creighton University, in partnership with Nebraska?s community and tribal colleges, to open up unique opportunities for Nebraska.  EQUATE consolidates the quantum science and technology expertise of 20 faculty researchers across the four Nebraska research institutions, establishing collaboration and feedback between theory and experiment to guide discoveries and expedite the findings of new emergent quantum materials and phenomena.  <br/><br/>Nebraska?s history of cutting-edge nanomaterials research has positioned the EQUATE project not only to be at the forefront of quantum materials research and education, but also to actively shape directions to help secure the future economic well-being of the State of Nebraska and the nation. EQUATE?s  main research goal is to bring Nebraska to the forefront of scientific discoveries and innovation in the design, synthesis, growth, and use of materials and hybrid systems with large-scale quantum properties for applications in sensing, metrology, communication, and information processing.  EQUATE is divided into three focused research groups (FRGs). FRG 1 will explore the emergent phenomena driven by the complex interplay between correlation, topology, and spin-orbit coupling in a variety of quantum and topological materials. FRG 2 will address current limitations impeding quantum technology by exploring solid-state spin qubits for quantum sensing and metrology, and photons for ultrafast, compact, and low-power quantum communication nanophotonic devices. FRG 3 will utilize Bose Einstein condensates for the implementation of quantum emulation and quantum computation, which have applications in fundamental problems of strongly-correlated, many-body physics and can potentially allow quantum computation above the ultra-low temperature regime that limits current platforms.  The three FRGs complement each other by combining fundamental science, applications, and computational activities.  These are necessary to advance quantum science knowledge and technologies in the jurisdiction.

It has been speculated that near-surface heating is enhanced in the presence of algal blooms and surface slicks but this has not been accounted for in current models. Although surface slicks are common in the world oceans, our knowledge of how these slicks impact ocean heating has been limited due to the lack of appropriate observational tools. By using ship-deployed high-endurance Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UASs), the investigators targeted large-scale slicks and covered 10s of km2 several times a day.  The project is a quantum advance in utilizing UAS technology for science. This investigation will provide new insights into the distribution of heat in the upper ocean due to the presence of surface slicks. This project will improve models of the daily cycles of surface ocean heating, global biogeochemical cycles, and sea surface temperature. These results are in great demand within the regional modeling community of the South Pacific, Maritime Continent, and Indian Ocean. The project will foster the development of the next generation of scientists in Oceanography.  The inverstigators will create teaching materials for their existing course at Columbia University. They will also work closely with K-12 teachers in the greater New York City area and with large numbers of students from underrepresented groups through the Earth2Class Workshops.<br/><br/>This research project will analyze measurements made onboard the R/V Falkor in November-December 2019 in the Southwest Pacific near Fiji from a combination of novel tools.  UASs were equipped with hyperspectral visible, and broadband thermal infrared cameras to study the albedo of sea surface biogenic slicks as well as the sea-surface skin temperature (SST). UASs and ship-based instrumentation measured air-sea heat/radiative fluxes and SST; an autonomous catamaran sampled sea-surface microlayer surfactants and the surface microlayer algae populations; drifters measured the near-surface response of the upper ocean temperature, salinity, ocean currents, and turbulence; spectro-radiometric profiles provided estimates of net radiant flux at depth; and shipboard infrared imaging measured the response of ocean surface SST important to upper-ocean heating.  The results will further our understanding of the role cyanobacteria blooms and surface slicks play in physical air-sea interaction. The analyses will expand our knowledge of the upper-ocean mixed layer response to algal blooms and provide novel observations of near-surface ocean heat budget.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, adverse quantum effects at extremely small length scales present an impending limit to shrinking of these circuits, and many researchers have looked to biological systems for inspiration for further improvement.  Neuromorphic, or brain-inspired, computing has the potential to enhance performance and computational speed while reducing power consumption by mimicking the biological function of neurons.  The research team from the undergraduate-only physics departments at SUNY Brockport and Ithaca College, along with collaborators from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, are studying thin films of niobium oxide for use in neuromorphic circuits.  Thin-film niobium oxide is an ideal candidate for neuromorphic circuits, as it is plentiful, inexpensive, non-toxic, and can mimic both the brain?s neuronal and synaptic behaviors.  This project focuses on the growth of the thin films, incorporation of other elements (such as zinc and aluminum) in the films, post-growth thermal annealing, and fabrication into electronic circuit components.  The research team is focusing their effort on correlating the various material changes (e.g., oxide composition, thickness, growth parameters) with the device?s resulting electronic behavior.  Ultimately, the project?s goal is to develop niobium oxide based electronic components that can seamlessly integrate with the current state-of-the-art silicon-based electronics.  Undergraduate students are integral members of the research team, and participation in this research is often attractive to members of groups underrepresented in physics.  Undergraduate student members of the research team participate in all aspects of the research project during both the summer and during the academic year, and present their work at regional and national conferences.  The PIs regularly present at local schools in areas with students from underrepresented groups and include information on successes, challenges, and opportunities in materials science and computer science to ignite interest in science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>Niobium oxide is a polymorphic material that, depending on stoichiometry, has a number of interesting and potentially useful electrical and optical properties. Crystalline niobium dioxide (NbO2), in particular, displays volatile memristive behavior, and is a leading candidate for architectures that merge traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor components with brain-inspired neuromorphic circuit elements, which are generally required to have both synapse-like and neuron-like components. This project focuses on developing a better understanding of NbO2, which undergoes a volatile phase transition from high to low resistance around 800 degrees Celsius. This transition mimics the spiking electrical behavior of neurons by abruptly changing resistance once a temperature threshold is achieved. The research team ? which consists of two principal investigators, with specialties of materials development and electric transport, their undergraduate research students, and collaborators from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory ? is studying both the material deposition and post-deposition treatment processes, as well as the optical and electrical behavior of the resulting films. On the materials side, the research team uses atomic layer deposition (ALD), doping, and post-growth crystallization techniques to fabricate high-quality NbO2 in a way that is fully compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes. Specifically, the project examines the addition of dopants during ALD to encourage crystallization with a thermal budget compatible with low-power device operation.  Following crystallization, an ultra-high vacuum system is used to thermally cycle the material through its phase transition while observing reflected and transmitted optical signals to quickly establish the effect of growth conditions or dopants on the phase transition temperature. On the device side, electrical measurements are performed to establish the effect that material preparation and properties have on key device operation parameters, such as the number of transitions that can be performed before failure, the device yield, and the switching power requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrons (negatively charged particles) and holes (positively charged particles) in these isolated atomic membranes are bound by strong attractions to form excitons. Excitons are hydrogen atom-like particles; they possess a series of quantum states and display characteristic peaks in the absorption spectrum. On the other hand, excitons are much larger than hydrogen atoms; while the electrons and holes are confined in the atomic membrane, their interactions extend substantially outside. This property endows the excitons--both the energy and the intensity of the absorption peaks--with extreme sensitivity to surroundings. When a membrane is placed near a metal, the electron-hole interactions are significantly screened; and the exciton absorption spectrum is substantially altered. Conversely, a nearby insulator affects the exciton spectrum much less. In this project, the research team exploits this unique property of excitons in atomic membranes to develop a new sensing technique that can be applied to a wide range of materials including those that are inaccessible by conventional techniques. The team applies the technique to probe new forms of insulators and superconductors in two dimensions. The project supports the research and development of one graduate student and several undergraduate students. Other activities involve modernizing the physics advanced laboratory course at Cornell University and developing materials for outreach activities, including several science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs on campus that specifically target young girls.<br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors have emerged as a new platform for strong light-matter interactions. The optical response of monolayers is dominated by excitons (bound electron-hole pairs), which are extremely sensitive to the surrounding dielectric environment because most of the electric-field lines responsible for exciton binding are outside the monolayer material. The project exploits this unique property of excitons in monolayer semiconductors to develop a new optical sensing technique for dielectric function or electronic compressibility of nanoscale materials. The goals are to develop imaging and time-resolved measurement capabilities, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the technique, its applicability and limitations. Two experiments are selected to focus on each of the measurement capabilities. The first experiment studies the sensitivity of the technique to the quantum Hall effect in graphene and explores the possibility of imaging the chiral edge states in the quantum Hall regime. The second experiment investigates the sensitivity of the technique to superconducting transitions and explores ultrafast dynamics of two-dimensional superconductors following photon-excitations. The methods involve the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures and devices and optical spectroscopies, including the reflection contrast, hyper-spectral imaging and pump-probe spectroscopy. The new sensing technique can be applied to a wide range of materials including those that do not form good electrical contacts for conventional capacitance or transport measurements. It opens up unprecedented opportunities for studies of quantum many-body dynamics in correlated materials, topological chiral edge states, and two-dimensional superconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference focuses on addressing the shift in science towards big data and how Native American perspectives can be incorporated in the collection and analysis of the Earth system. Because the geosciences have some of the lowest rates of ethnic and racial diversity, crucial voices are often lost in the discussion of data-rich complex problems that impact human societies (for example, resource management and environmental stewardship). Data that is stripped of cultural identity produces results that are incomplete. The GA-5 conference is designed to be transformative by facilitating critical discussions regarding data science centered on Indigenous perspectives. Results from discussions and the dissemination of findings will initiate a critical dialog about open data practices and the rights of Native Americans to have control over how data collected on their land is handled and interpreted. Such discussions will result in changes reflective of the values of, and sensitivity to, Native American perspectives.

The first part of the project concerns basic questions in the analysis of partial differential equations in Mathematical Biology. The second part of this project concerns the study of partial differential equations from kinetic theory in the presence of the physical kinetic boundary conditions. This project will involve training in research and teaching of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students from the University of Pennsylvania and other Universities. The project will also involve outreach to undergraduate students through the University of Pennsylvania Center for Undergraduate Research & Fellowships program. The principal investigator (PI) is fully committed to facilitating the training and education of these students through teaching courses, regular direct mentoring, and running regular research seminars. The PI is actively working to develop new innovative mathematics courses at the University of Pennsylvania in order to further the goal of developing a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce and to improve STEM education at the collegiate level. The PI is engaging in outreach activities to groups that are traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, and these activities will continue over the course of this project. The PI is further consistently working to increase the scientific knowledge of the community by giving national and international research presentations. The results of this project will be further disseminated through publication in journal articles and they will be posted on the PI's website. <br/> <br/>Problems in which an elastic structure interacts with the surrounding fluid, called Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems, are plentiful in science and engineering. These problems have many applications in Physics, Biology, and the Medical Sciences. Such FSI problems include the mathematical modeling of the flying of birds, the swimming of fish, and blood flow through the heart and blood vessels. FSI models have been intensively studied using computational methods. Many numerical algorithms have been developed for such problems, and the scientific computing of FSI problems continues to be a very active area of research. Despite their importance, these computational methods are poorly understood from an analytical standpoint. A major impediment for numerical analysis has been the lack of analytical understanding of the underlying nonlinear partial differential equations. A better theoretical understanding of the analytical aspects of these PDE should lead to improved computational algorithms for FSI problems. The PI seeks to address these issues by focusing on a set of canonical analytical FSI problems in the Stokes flow. The second part of this project is in kinetic theory. The Landau equation with Coulomb potential and the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation for the long-range interaction potentials are two fundamental mathematical models in collisional kinetic theory which describe the dynamics of a non-equilibrium rarefied gas and a dilute hot plasma. Plasmas appear in fundamental physical problems from Astrophysics, Nuclear fusion, and Tokamaks. The Boltzmann equation has been used as a mathematical model in a wide variety of places, for instance in high atmosphere aerodynamics, where the air is a very rarefied gas and fluid equations are probably not sufficient. Further, the study of boundary effects for these kinetic equations is physically very important because they describe the interaction, in the form of drag and heat transfer, between gas or plasma and a solid body. The objective of this research in both parts of the project is to fully understand the local-in-time well-posedness for large initial data, and the global-in-time well-posedness in a close to equilibrium setting, for several different fundamental physical models in nonlinear PDE. We expect that the techniques developed as part of this project will be useful for future mathematical and physical developments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While providing more detailed information about the associated physical phenomena occurring around us, they also pose statistical challenges related to interpretable modeling and feasible computation for such data.  Data measured over space, time, or some other continuum, are fittingly termed functional data, and constitute an important subfield of modern statistics.  This project will develop important methodology for the analysis of two types of functional data.  The first set of projects aim at the estimation of dependency patterns between components of so-called multivariate functional data, where a common set of features is measured over time for each subject in a study, such as neuroimaging scans where signals are recorded over time at a variety of spatial locations.  Another important class of functional data are samples of distributions or histograms, which regularly arise in the analysis of demographic data as mortality distributions, for example, but also in other important fields such as neuroscience and finance.  This project outlines methods for dimension reduction and regression that respect the well-known positivity and area-under-the-curve constraints for distributions, yielding interpretable data summaries and model fits that provide the practitioner with a clearer understanding of the information contained in their data.<br/><br/>Both fMRI and EEG yield time-dependent signals at multiple brain locations, resulting in multivariate functional data.  Quantifying connectivity patterns to define brain networks, for example in order to identify normal and pathological characteristics, is an important neuroscientific problem that can be addressed using multivariate functional data techniques.  This project seeks to advance the use of functional graphical models to estimate underlying brain dependency networks, including improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods. These methods are equally applicable in other domains that produce data of similar structure, such as longitudinal medical studies, where a common set of measurements is recorded repeatedly over time.  Also considered in this proposal are methods for distributional data, which can be thought of as collections of curves or surfaces, each corresponding to a probability distribution.  For example, neuroimaging data naturally provide such distributional samples, as levels of myelination or signal correlations within brain regions are high-dimensional data that can be effectively summarized at the subject level by a histogram or distribution.  Given a sample of such distributional data, this project investigates statistical methods of interpretable dimension reduction and dependency of distributional response functions on relevant covariates through distributional regression.  A key tool is the Wasserstein metric for distributions, which has been widely successful in applied settings, but has not been utilized to its full extent in statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concerns over the impact of misinformation have grown considerably as the internet and social media provide a conduit for spreading information widely and rapidly, regardless of its veracity. The current project aims to investigate how people determine whether new information they encounter is correct or incorrect, and how people decide whether to share this information on social media. Using a formal modeling approach called Signal Detection Theory, the research focuses on three aspects of such judgments: (a) the ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect information, (b) general tendencies to treat information as correct vs. incorrect regardless of veracity, and (c) partisan bias involving a tendency to accept information that is consistent with one's personal beliefs and dismiss information that is inconsistent with one's personal beliefs. The findings are expected to provide valuable insights into why people might be susceptible to misinformation and how it might be possible to reduce the spread of misinformation.<br/><br/>Toward this end, the current project investigates how cognitive and motivational factors jointly influence responses to correct and incorrect information. Across a series of 16 studies, the project addresses the following questions: How well can people distinguish between correct and incorrect information? When are decisions to share information on social media influenced by people's perceptions of accuracy? Does more elaborate thinking increase people's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect information? How does elaborate thinking influence partisan bias in responses to belief-congruent and belief-incongruent information? How does greater confidence about one's personal values influence accuracy and partisan bias? How do echo chambers and prior exposure to information influence people's susceptibility to misinformation? How effective is debunking in reducing susceptibility to misinformation? How does the source of information influence responses to correct and incorrect information? How can partisan bias in responses to correct and incorrect information be reduced? Project activities also involve training students on using signal detection methods to investigate how people judge information. The project helps to address societal problems that stem from misinformation by investigating the psychological processes that make people susceptible to misinformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, adverse quantum effects at extremely small length scales present an impending limit to shrinking of these circuits, and many researchers have looked to biological systems for inspiration for further improvement.  Neuromorphic, or brain-inspired, computing has the potential to enhance performance and computational speed while reducing power consumption by mimicking the biological function of neurons.  The research team from the undergraduate-only physics departments at SUNY Brockport and Ithaca College, along with collaborators from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, are studying thin films of niobium oxide for use in neuromorphic circuits.  Thin-film niobium oxide is an ideal candidate for neuromorphic circuits, as it is plentiful, inexpensive, non-toxic, and can mimic both the brain?s neuronal and synaptic behaviors.  This project focuses on the growth of the thin films, incorporation of other elements (such as zinc and aluminum) in the films, post-growth thermal annealing, and fabrication into electronic circuit components.  The research team is focusing their effort on correlating the various material changes (e.g., oxide composition, thickness, growth parameters) with the device?s resulting electronic behavior.  Ultimately, the project?s goal is to develop niobium oxide based electronic components that can seamlessly integrate with the current state-of-the-art silicon-based electronics.  Undergraduate students are integral members of the research team, and participation in this research is often attractive to members of groups underrepresented in physics.  Undergraduate student members of the research team participate in all aspects of the research project during both the summer and during the academic year, and present their work at regional and national conferences.  The PIs regularly present at local schools in areas with students from underrepresented groups and include information on successes, challenges, and opportunities in materials science and computer science to ignite interest in science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>Niobium oxide is a polymorphic material that, depending on stoichiometry, has a number of interesting and potentially useful electrical and optical properties. Crystalline niobium dioxide (NbO2), in particular, displays volatile memristive behavior, and is a leading candidate for architectures that merge traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor components with brain-inspired neuromorphic circuit elements, which are generally required to have both synapse-like and neuron-like components. This project focuses on developing a better understanding of NbO2, which undergoes a volatile phase transition from high to low resistance around 800 degrees Celsius. This transition mimics the spiking electrical behavior of neurons by abruptly changing resistance once a temperature threshold is achieved. The research team ? which consists of two principal investigators, with specialties of materials development and electric transport, their undergraduate research students, and collaborators from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory ? is studying both the material deposition and post-deposition treatment processes, as well as the optical and electrical behavior of the resulting films. On the materials side, the research team uses atomic layer deposition (ALD), doping, and post-growth crystallization techniques to fabricate high-quality NbO2 in a way that is fully compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes. Specifically, the project examines the addition of dopants during ALD to encourage crystallization with a thermal budget compatible with low-power device operation.  Following crystallization, an ultra-high vacuum system is used to thermally cycle the material through its phase transition while observing reflected and transmitted optical signals to quickly establish the effect of growth conditions or dopants on the phase transition temperature. On the device side, electrical measurements are performed to establish the effect that material preparation and properties have on key device operation parameters, such as the number of transitions that can be performed before failure, the device yield, and the switching power requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Regenerative medicine is a cross-disciplinary field of biotechnology and bioengineering that includes convergent technologies such as nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, mechanical engineering technologies, data science, and cyberbiosecurity. Regenerative medicine is rapidly evolving from basic research and development stages, through clinical translation and into biomanufacturing.  A significant gap in availability of skilled technicians in regenerative medicine biomanufacturing has been defined by identifying the required skills and the extent of the skills gap. To help fill this need, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine is partnering with Forsyth Technical Community College, Simon G. Atkins High School, regional Historically Black Colleges and Universities, employers, and professional and trades organizations.  This partnership intends to bring the new science and technology of regenerative medicine into the community college sector to ensure the nation prepares the needed regenerative medicine technicians.  <br/><br/>The project intends to meet this goal by developing a regional model for education of skilled technicians in regenerative medicine biomanufacturing.  Specifically, it will develop and deliver faculty professional development in regenerative medicine, from the high school level through community college and university levels (through articulated programs).

By capturing quantum effects with good quantitative accuracy, ab initio semiclassical molecular dynamics simulation is a generally applicable investigation tool for a broad range of chemical and material science studies, including studies on pollutant effects on lung health, enzyme catalysis, ozone depletion, space craft surface coating, solar cells, and a lot more studies that promise to advance national health and pharmaceutical sciences, material design investigations for national defense, energy and environmental protection researches, etc. But the computation cost of semiclassical dynamics simulations is enormously high, making semiclassical dynamics highly challenging, and even infeasible in many cases, for large molecular systems. This project proposed methods for reducing computation cost while maintaining simulation accuracy, which will expand the reach of semiclassical dynamics study to a broader range of studies of national and scientific importance. <br/><br/>Ab initio semiclassical molecular dynamics simulation has enormous computation cost in calculating ab initio Hessians from quantum mechanical electronic structure theories. Hessian modeling using training data in the closest time distances from a set of saved ab initio data has been successful in reducing the cost of Hessian calculations while maintaining simulation accuracy. It was observed that opportunities exist for further reduction of computation cost by using training data in the closest spatial distances, which offers more chances for Hessian modeling to replace ab initio Hessian. Due to the frequent incoming of new ab initio data, the ab initio data set is constantly growing.  To search frequently updated growing datasets, a challenge is that the algorithms not only need to achieve high search efficiency but also have to be efficient for re-organizing the dataset with frequent insertions of new data. Existing searching algorithms are good in search efficiency but not so good in data-organizing efficiency since they were designed for static or infrequently updated datasets. This project develops search algorithms that will be the first to leverage the growing process of datasets to deliver high efficiency in both searching and data organizing. Hessian modeling using training data of closest spatial distance returned by the new search algorithms has the potential for further reduction of computation cost, promising to speed up dynamics simulations and enable simulations of larger molecular systems and/or the use of higher-accuracy electronic structure theories to capture better details of the molecular systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their properties are determined by a perfect arrangement of their atoms in their structure and in their complex assemblies. Even though they are pervasively used in our daily lives and in many health, defense and other technological applications, synthetic polymers are not able to match the properties of metals and biological macromolecules.  This research program aims to use biological principles in the construction of polymers and their complex assemblies to increase the level of structural precision of synthetic polymers to that of metals and natural macromolecules and expand their applications in daily life to the precision and sophistication encountered in biological systems.   The project involves design, synthesis, and characterization of macromolecules to a variety of complex assemblies, followed by study of their structure and properties.  This project will provide interdisciplinary education for high school, undergraduate, graduate students and postdocs, including minorities, at the interface of disciplines including organic, polymer, supramolecular synthesis, catalysis, physics, biology, synthetic biology, nanoscience, nanomedicine, and supercomputing. Group members will work in the laboratories of the PI and colleagues at Penn, collaborated with scientists in the US and abroad, and interact with industry. The principles and lessons learned from this project will be applicable to scientific, industrial and societal complex systems.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>Complex assemblies generated from metal atoms and from large biological macromolecules are strikingly dissimilar as concepts but identical in their extraordinary level of structural perfection and functions.  Synthetic covalent and supramolecular polymers have statistical chain length distribution, chirality, composition and sequence. Therefore, they cannot provide the level of structural perfection and properties of inorganic and biological assemblies. This project will use monodisperse, homochiral and sequence-defined components to elucidate principles required to produce noncovalent-supramolecular and covalent polymers that will self-organize into complex assemblies exhibiting the precision of inorganic and biological assemblies. The following topics will be investigated: (1) The principles of self-organization of Frank-Kasper phases will be elucidated; these are seen in metals, metal alloys, some gases, lipids and even in some viruses and recently also in narrow molecular-weight-distribution polymers, monodisperse polymer components, and supramolecular polymers.  Together with their supramolecular orientational memory Frank-Kasper phases will provide a first access to biological precision. (2) The generality of the cogwheel double-helix, hat-shape deracemizing and ?rigid? solid-angle tobacco mosaic virus-like supramolecular helical polymerizations accompanied by deracemization will be investigated and elucidated. They will provide homochiral assemblies, of biological precision and even higher, containing sequence-defined and monodisperse components obtained by deracemization. (3) The scope and limitations of self-interrupted living polymerization for the synthesis of monodisperse biological-like polymers by non-iterative methods will be investigated and elucidated. Alternative methodologies for the synthesis of monodisperse polymers will also be explored.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work seeks specifically to understand what order genetic alterations occur, and what alterations occur together or in separate cell lineages. Such knowledge will be fundamental towards lessening the impact of this disease on those affected. For example, treatment plans designed to target genetic alterations occurring in separate cell lineages may be more effective in preventing disease relapse. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and methods designed to analyze the data produced by these technologies has enabled glimpses into the mutational processes underlying cancers. Researchers are now better equipped to infer information about the history of a recently diagnosed tumor, including the order that events took place during its development over months or even years prior to diagnosis. However, there is still much uncertainty and variation in the tumor histories inferred using these methods. This project will address these issues through the development of critically needed approaches that enable comparison, summarization, and visualization of tumor histories inferred from sequencing data. Numerous opportunities will be provided for undergraduate students and recent graduates, especially those from underrepresented groups, to gain hands-on research experience. This will be combined with several educational activities that enable undergraduate students with a minimal computer science background to learn about real world applications of how their skills can be applied to important biological problems - an area that is likely to need a growing workforce in the coming years.<br/><br/>The phylogenetic history of how a tumor developed is typically described using a labeled, rooted tree called a clonal tree.

Light is an advantageous choice for building quantum technology, as it is easy to control and detect single packets of light, also known as photons. Unfortunately, photons do not easily interact with each other, which poses a serious bottleneck for controlling one stream of photons with another. The ability to control a signal is at the heart of any computing technology. Hence, current attempts to build quantum computer using light is limited to only simple operation. Developing more complex interaction between photons can dramatically enhance the computer?s capability. This project aims to demonstrate precisely such interactions between photons mediated by electrons. The key technology has two components: a device to store light in a small volume for a long time, and an artificial atom-like medium, also known as an exciton. Such medium is already at the heart of many day-to-day technologies, including solar cells, and light emitting diodes. Integrating such atom-like medium with light-storing devices leads to strong interaction between photons. On the nanometer scale, this effect can happen at the single photon level, which is needed for quantum computing. Moreover, the large size reduction of the light-storing devices allows hundreds of them to be made on a single square-millimeter chip, allowing integrated circuits for light, akin to integrated circuits that are at the heart of today?s electronics. This project will develop a platform to help scientists better understand effects like high-temperature superconductivity. Furthermore, this project will improve the training and education of undergraduate and high school students, with a strong emphasis on including women and minority communities, in scientific research in quantum technologies. Through the PI?s active involvement with the Optical Society of America and industrial laboratories, the scientific results will be disseminated to a wider scientific audience via seminars, workshops, peer-reviewed publications, and conferences.  <br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>The research aims to develop a quantum optical platform to understand and engineer light matter interaction at the most fundamental level, where single photons start interacting with each other via single quanta of materials known as excitons. This platform is made of strongly coupled hybrid particles called exciton-polaritons, which are part-matter and part-light, and thus inherit the best of both worlds. While photons provide the ability to couple spatially separated nodes, the excitons provide the ability for the polaritons to interact with each other. The key to creating this strongly interacting exciton-polariton system is the merging of atomically thin van der Waals materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides with an extremely large exciton binding energy, and ultra-small mode-volume nanophotonic resonators and resonator arrays. Combining optical and electrical techniques as well as quantum optical modelling, the project probes coherent light matter interaction in van der Waals materials to provide deep insights into the nature of atomically thin exciton-polaritons, and polariton condensates. The ability to control polaritons provides an excellent opportunity to synthesize complex quantum Hamiltonians, which are impossible to solve using classical computers. The resulting strongly correlated two-dimensional polariton may prove critical for new capabilities in quantum nanophotonic technologies that exploit the spin-valley physics or generate new physics, such as exciton-mediated superconductivity. Combining numerical simulation, device fabrication, and optical characterization, three research aims are pursued: (1) develop a robust exciton-polariton platform; (2) realize single photon nonlinear optics for quantum many-body simulations; and (3) explore new states of quantum materials using exciton-polaritons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A chiral object is something that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, like a left and a right hand. Amino acids are well-known chiral materials. Topological materials have interesting properties that make them useful for developing advanced electronic and photonic devices. For example, a topological insulator is a state of quantum matter that behaves as an insulator in its interior but as a conductor on its surface. Chiral and topological materials are found throughout nature, and these phenomena are often coupled. Understanding the mechanism of generating chiral charge carriers with light is important for optoelectronic applications such as low-loss and polarization-selective light detectors. The project aims to advance the understanding of chiral topological materials through study of the intrinsic light-matter interaction in the under conditions with controlled temperature, strain, and magnetic-fields. Spectroscopy at terahertz (THz) and far infrared (IR) frequencies will be performed with nanoscale spatial resolution and femtosecond time resolution. This research effort offers fascinating opportunities for detection and sensing of IR and THz light and ultrafast switching at close to room temperature. The activities enabled by this research can open new routes to study novel topologies and photonic devices. These studies will provide sophisticated training to young researchers in a broad range of subjects including THz nanoscopy and spectroscopy.<br/> <br/>Technical:<br/><br/>In three dimensional chiral materials, chiral charge current can be generated via the chirality imbalance induced by external gauge fields with non-trivial topology such as parallel electric and magnetic fields or circularly polarized light. This so-called ?chiral magnetic effect? yields interesting chiral anomaly phenomenon such as nearly non-dissipative transport and large negative magnetoresistance. The chiral anomalies will likely emerge in a wide class of materials that are near the transition between trivial and topological insulators, e.g. ZrTe5, TaAs, HfTe5, etc. In this project, the research team investigate photoelectronic properties of chiral microcrystals and photonic devices with lateral sizes below and above the valley relaxation length of chiral carriers. The team plans to characterize the low energy excitation spectrum (0.1-15 THz) of chiral materials and exploit their ability to generate ultrafast photocurrent using circularly polarized light. Ultrafast photocurrent generation and its resultant THz emission in crystals can be systematically studied with magnetic field or strain induced effect. The research also determines how much the chiral band is involved in the light conversion between the far-IR and near-IR frequency ranges and its capability to turn IR light to THz emission or vice versa. All the experimental schemes can be extended to other photonic microcrystals or devices with broken time or spatial inversion symmetries. Research in this area can profoundly broaden the fundamental knowledge of physics in chirality-sensitive optoelectronics and open new routes to achieve non-trivial photosensing and photovoltaic effects. The team will work closely with a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented minorities, to develop novel research activities such as educational 3D printing for reconfigurable optical components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work seeks to understand the propagation of non-linear waves in mechanical metamaterials with application toward control of mechanical signals in larger-amplitude loading (for example, to provide protection during impact events) and toward reconfigurable soft structures (for example, locomotion of soft robots).

Current methods to analyze biodiversity and ecosystem services use costly remotely sensed data at the spatial resolution of cities and urban centers that are not sufficient for analysis at a local scale. Working with Indigenous communities, this project develops novel remote sensing methods using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect data at finer spatial and temporal resolutions that enable the analysis of local land change processes while the changes are occurring. This project's use of co-production of knowledge of land-use and land-cover change identifies the processes that trigger land-use change and thereby makes a significant contribution to research on scaling up methods that inform sustainable global economic processes. The tightly integrated research and education plans coupled with a summer institute broaden participation of underrepresented students and provides exceptional training in STEM research methods. <br/><br/>As land change scientists extend models for understanding the implications of change processes, it is essential to know how, when, and where the impacts of global level processes are manifested at local scales. To address these needs, this project catalogs change occurring at the local level using geospatial information technologies, including drones, and evaluates what forces drive change at the local level. Evaluation of local change processes will be completed in five different physical environments to determine whether and how policymakers respond to global-level drivers of change. This research fills a gap in the understanding of how local-level biodiversity, ecosystem services availability, and indigenous peoples' livelihood practices are shaped by forces located far from urban centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fiber networks are the main structural component of many synthetic and natural materials: polymeric or biological fibers and nanofibers with rigid inclusions are omnipresent in biological tissues, tissue scaffolds, biomedical implants, electrospun air filtration systems, cellulose products, etc. Most of these fibrous systems form composites with embedded non-fibrous entities. While continuum matrix composites have been studied extensively, the mechanics of hybrid networks with a discrete matrix has received no attention to date, despite the plethora of applications. The results of this research will influence the design of a wide range of applications of fibrous networks, such as non-wovens, gels, rubber, tissue scaffolds, cellulose products, etc. as well as our understanding of the mechanical behavior of a wealth of biological systems which are comprised of heterogeneous random networks. On the educational front, a program geared towards high school, undergraduate and graduate students with computational activities and hands on laboratory experiments will include several aspects of this research.<br/><br/>This research will (i) establish structure-property relations of hybrid fiber networks, (ii) extend the theory of composites with continuum matrices to composites in which the matrix is a discrete fiber network, (iii) establish new methods to experimentally investigate fibrous materials and their composites. The theory of continuum matrix composites will be extended to hybrid materials in which the matrix is a fiber network reinforced with particles or fibers of different properties from those of the main network (matrix). Thereby, effective ways will be identified to reinforce networks with small volume fractions of fillers, and concomitantly improve dramatically on the composite stiffness and strength. First, experiments and computational modeling will evaluate the perturbation introduced by an isolated filler to the deformation fields of stochastic networks in order to establish an equivalent Eshelby solution for networks. Then, the effect of filler concentration on the small and large strain mechanical response and network strength will be explored to establish effective homogenization methods for hybrid networks. Data from controlled experiments performed with the aforementioned systems will be used to validate the numerical models, which will be then used to broadly explore the design space defined by the network and filler parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These rearrangements require the birth and death of extensive plate boundaries across which continents separate or come together (converge). Convergent margins are established in the oceans following initiation of a process of descent and recycling of oceanic crust back into the Earth?s interior (subduction). The proposed work will focus on oceanic rocks that are preserved along the Appalachian mountain system and its European continuation (the Caledonides), and record subduction initiation in an ancient ocean (the Iapetus). It will use fieldwork and modern laboratory techniques to address key unknowns in plate tectonics, including how subduction initiates and how quickly it propagates throughout an ocean. Research activities associated with this proposal include work in remote areas of central Norway, the Shetlands, Newfoundland and Quebec, but also in urbanized parts of Baltimore, Maryland. The proposed research is partnered with educational outreach activities involving the Center for Educational Outreach, Johns Hopkins University, and the Y in Central Maryland?s summer education programming. These activities are aimed at establishing a long-term program of field- and laboratory-based community education centered around the outstanding urban geology of Baltimore. The outreach activities seek to enrich the educational experience by focusing on accessibility and the local cultural/environmental significance of concepts being taught, and have an ultimate goal of increasing participation in geology of underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>A central postulate of the theory of plate tectonics is that tectonic convergence is seeded in oceanic basins. However, details of the process remain unknown. How exactly does subduction initiate? How quickly do convergent plate boundaries emerge? How does their development relate to global-scale tectonic reorganizations? Constraints on the kinematics of subduction initiation and propagation are required to address these questions, but practical research targets in the modern oceanic record are limited; key to answering these questions are ophiolites. To track subduction initiation and propagation over 1000s of km within the Iapetus Ocean, a program of fieldwork, geochemistry and high-precision geochronology will focus on six Cambro?Ordovician ?ophiolites? distributed along ~4800 km of the Appalachian?Caledonian system, from Baltimore, Maryland to Leka, Norway. Extensive work on the Izu?Bonin?Marianas system has demonstrated that products of suprasubduction-zone (SSZ) spreading v. (nascent) arc activity can be distinguished on the basis of geochemistry. The proposed research is centered around high-precision U?Pb dating to assess the timing of units whose whole-rock geochemistry constrains geodynamic context. It will test two hypotheses: (1) SSZ spreading preceded (nascent) arc activity in each of the six ophiolites, and (2) propagation of subduction initiation throughout the Iapetus occurred at ?plate rates? (? 25 cm y-1). Testing of Hypothesis 1 will reveal mode of subduction initiation??spontaneous? (density-driven) v. ?induced? (lateral stress-driven)?for the six ophiolites. Testing of Hypothesis 2 will constrain rates of emergence of a new convergent plate boundary.<br/><br/>Funding for this project is provided by NSF EAR Tectonics and Petrology & Geochemistry Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of us use it daily -- to dictate text messages on smart phones or to navigate automated phone systems. As good as these systems are, humans still outperform them in complex, crowded, and noisy acoustic environments. If more were known concerning how humans adapt to these challenging situations, speech technology might be made more adaptive and robust. For example, computer systems for speech recognition use complex ""deep learning"" networks that often need to be trained in ways that are very different from how humans learn language. Although neural network models aimed at simulating human language processing are much simpler, which allows scientists to develop hypotheses about how human language processing works, they don't use real speech as input. Instead, they use phonetic features that are more like text than speech and so fail to address the core problem of how humans map the acoustics of speech to words. This research program focuses on bridging the gap between the complex artificial neural network models used in current technologies for speech recognition and the simpler neural network models used to investigate how humans actually perceive speech.<br/><br/>This research program builds on a new neural network model for speech that aims to achieve high recognition accuracy on many words produced by several speakers. Crucially, the model can do this with minimal complexity (using many fewer layers than commercial speech recognition systems), which allows researchers to understand the computations it performs. The research plans include extending the model to a large vocabulary, training on naturalistic speech, and adding biologically plausible preprocessing modeled on the human auditory pathways. The model will be compared with key aspects of human spoken word recognition behavior as well as with human neural responses to spoken speech. The work has the potential to generate new insights to advance speech technology by making it more robust in challenging environments, with potential impact on speech technology used for health, law, education, and the automatic captioning that makes speech accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing.

This project will provide a new class of control and planning algorithms capable of adjusting performance as computing resources are continually reallocated, such as when transitioning from waypoint navigation to environmental sample collection. A computing framework to make use of freed resources will be developed allowing autonomous agents to focus attention where it is needed, for example, away from navigation and to perception.

Dense packs of icebergs and sea ice, known as ice mlange, occur in many Greenland fjords, and may occur near many Antarctic glaciers in the future. Observations suggest that ice mlange may directly affect iceberg calving by pressing against the glacier front and indirectly affect glacier melting by controlling where and when icebergs melt which can impact ocean circulation and ocean heat transport towards glaciers. However, the interactions between ice mlange, ocean circulation, and iceberg calving have not been systematically investigated due to the difficulty of conducting field work in Greenland fjords. The GLACIOME project will investigate the complex interactions between glaciers, ice mlange and the ocean using laboratory experiments and models to provide the first comprehensive model of the co-evolution of these systems.<br/><br/>The GLACIOME project will use detailed process models and laboratory experiments to investigate thermodynamic and mechanical couplings between ice mlange and fjord waters.

The project's novelties are developing tools that play an integral role in the design of privacy-preserving protocols. Such protocols have societal benefits, enabling computation on sensitive data while keeping the data private. The project's impacts include achieving more efficient protocols for many important real-world applications and deepening our understanding of efficient constructions and fundamental limits in many areas in cryptography that are related to OT, such as secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs, advanced types of encryption and more.

First, the investigators design efficient constructions of OT with advanced functionality and strengthened security, which can be better leveraged in cryptographic systems. These OT notions provide features for reducing communication and computation costs in various settings, making them indispensable tools in big-data applications. Second, the project investigates a specific MPC problem that has close connections to OT. In particular, using advanced OT tools, the investigators improve the efficiency and enrich the functionality of private set intersection (PSI) protocols, which have wide applications in practice.

The study of the geometric properties of such maps has led to the development of Geometric Function Theory and has proven over the years to be of fundamental importance to a wide variety of problems in analysis, geometry, probability, physics, and engineering. More recently, much attention has been devoted to the study of maps, or functions, that are a generalization of conformal maps, called of quasiconformal maps, where a controlled amount of angle distortion is allowed. Quasiconformal mappings possess subtle properties, making them very useful in a wide variety of settings. In many of these applications, one must deal with maps that are (quasi)conformal in a given planar region except possibly for some ?exceptional set? of points inside the region. The question whether the exceptional set is negligible and small enough to be ignored leads to the notion of conformal removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex analysis and other areas. The principal investigator has no doubt that many more fruitful connections should come to light as progress is made toward a better understanding of removability. This project will also consider several other problems in Geometric Function Theory, some with applications in the field of numerical vision. An important portion of the proposed research involves numerical computations and constructive methods.

Sunlight is a free and essentially limitless source of energy. To exploit this energy source, economical solar cells that can convert sunlight into electrical current and voltage are needed. Existing silicon solar cells are too expensive to create, pattern, and install on a massive scale. Solar cells made from plastics and small molecules, on the other hand, can potentially be as inexpensive as paint to create and as easy as newsprint to pattern at high speed. Plastic/molecular solar cells are being intensely studied worldwide, but how these complex materials convert light to electricity remains a puzzle. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor John Marohn and his research group at Cornell University will develop methods for watching how electrical charges in a film activated by sunlight move and relax. The research team will utlizie a specialized microscope which enables the observation of charges moving distances of nanometers (one billionth of a meter) on the timescale of nanoseconds (one billionth of a second). By allowing the observation of charge motion at the molecular level, it is expected that these measurements will significantly advance our understanding of how plastic/molecular solar cell materials convert light into electricity. This research will open new ways to study semiconductor chips and batteries, two growth technologies central to our economy. Researchers funded by this project will develop virtual high-school science experiments on the physics of waves suitable for both in-person and remote learning.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>In the best organic photovoltaic materials, the photocarrier recombination time is anomalously long. If this anomalous behavior could be understood then it could be exploited to improve the open-circuit voltage and current of organic solar cells. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, will study charge generation and recombination in organic donor/acceptor (D/A) blends at nanoscale spatial resolution and nanosecond temporal resolution. Proposed experiments include scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy, measuring local electrostatic potential and electric field; broadband local dielectric spectroscopy, measuring local steady-state conductivity and energetic disorder; and ""phase-kick"" electric force microscopy (pk-EFM), measuring transient conductivity. Charge mobility will be studied in single-component films by simultaneously measuring device current and local electric field. Charge recombination transients in D/A blends prepared on both insulating and metallic substrates will be recorded using pk-EFM and compared to bulk time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements. The drift and diffusion of photogenerated charges in inhomogeneous D/A blends will be observed stroboscopically via pk-EFM. Films comprised of polymer donors with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors will be examined. It is expected that the microscopic material parameters gleaned from these measurements will enable the rigorous testing of charge-recombination hypotheses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop new algorithms within the subclass called Langevin MCMC methods. These new algorithms will be scalable to high dimensions and large datasets and will be faster than traditional ones. The features of scalability and fast convergence are important for use in Bayesian statistical inference as well as in non-convex stochastic optimization methods for machine learning. The algorithms will allow efficient training and calibration of predictive machine learning models from large-scale data and have a direct impact on a broad range of data-driven application areas from information technology to computer vision.  Graduate students will be trained and involved in research.<br/> <br/>In this project, the PIs investigate a new class of algorithms within the class of Langevin MCMC methods.  These algorithms can be applied in three contexts of machine learning and data science. First, they can be used for Bayesian (learning) inference problems with high-dimensional models, where the objective is to sample from a posterior distribution given a prior distribution on the parameter space and the likelihood of the observed data. Second, they can be used for solving stochastic non-convex optimization problems including the challenging problems arising in deep learning. Third, they arise in modeling and approximating workhorse algorithms in data science such as stochastic gradient descent methods. By leveraging out the connections between stochastic gradient algorithms and MCMC algorithms, the proposed approach results in a new class of stochastic gradient algorithms called Hamiltonian Accelerated Stochastic Gradient that can outperform existing methods in deep learning practice. A first goal of the project is to study theoretical convergence properties of the proposed algorithms further to fill out the current gap between theory and practice, as well as to develop new scalable algorithms that can extend the existing framework.

They use state-of-the-art facilities to grow novel crystals and study their physical properties. Students involved in this research perform hands-on experiments, present results at international conferences, and meet with startup companies to discuss potential applications. In conjunction with the optical theme of the research, lessons are developed for a required course for elementary education students seeking the middle science credential. These lessons on waves and light target the K?12 learning goals defined by the Next Generation Science Standards and Washington State Professional Educator Standards Board, Middle Level Science Endorsement Competencies.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The project aims to achieve large, room-temperature persistent photoconductivity in oxide semiconductors and exploit the phenomenon to advance knowledge about fundamental processes such as electronic transport. Kinetics, energy-barrier heights, and fundamental defect properties are investigated. These studies also elucidate the structure of hydrogen-related complexes in oxides. The research team is attempting to achieve large, room temperature persistent photoconductivity in barium titanate, a ferroelectric material that could exhibit larger conductivity changes than those previously discovered in strontium titanate. This unique phenomenon is exploited to investigate electrical properties, over a well-defined range of carrier concentrations, to provide insight into scattering mechanisms and small-polaron versus free-electron transport. Using unique facilities at Washington State University, crystals are grown with high purity and controlled defect populations. These crystals include solid solutions (alloys) that are designed to have optimal properties. A variety of experimental methods, including Hall effect, infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence, are used to study the persistent photoconductivity and the defects responsible for it. Besides providing fundamental insight, establishing defect and transport properties is important because it will allow researchers to control (i.e., induce and erase) and optimize the effect. The fundamental knowledge gained in this study could provide the basis for holographic storage, optically defined electronics, and selective electroplating.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The answers to such questions as ""How fast can this process go?"" and ""How rapidly can information be communicated through this channel?"" often turn on the discovery of new mathematical inequalities, which are the central theme of much of the project. The problems to be investigated are of significant interest within pure mathematics as well. But because they are motivated by problems arising in other fields, especially physics and quantum information theory, their solution will have impact and applications outside of pure mathematics. Students will be involved in the project, contributing to training of the next generation of researchers.<br/><br/>The connection between mathematical inequalities and physical processes runs both ways. So, in trying to prove a particular inequality, one may try to relate it to a simple and well understood evolution equation. This area of research has been fruitful not only in producing results that are of interest to a wider scientific community, but also in engaging the interest of Ph.D. students. The project places particular emphasis on proving functional inequalities in sharp form. This means to completely solve the following variational problem: find the minimum value of some functional and determine the full set of equality cases. Some of the questions go further and seek stability results for such sharp inequalities, i.e., theorems that assert that when a certain function almost yields equality in a functional inequality, then that function is close in some metric to one of the cases of equality. Such stability results have many important implications. Both their proofs and applications will be worked on by the PI and his collaborators. This research will produce not only significant new mathematics, but results that are relevant to the physical sciences and even engineering as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the investigators consider the large class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which arise in several contexts in machine learning and data science. The project will develop new algorithms within the subclass called Langevin MCMC methods. These new algorithms will be scalable to high dimensions and large datasets and will be faster than traditional ones. The features of scalability and fast convergence are important for use in Bayesian statistical inference as well as in non-convex stochastic optimization methods for machine learning. The algorithms will allow efficient training and calibration of predictive machine learning models from large-scale data and have a direct impact on a broad range of data-driven application areas from information technology to computer vision.  Graduate students will be trained and involved in research.<br/> <br/>In this project, the PIs investigate a new class of algorithms within the class of Langevin MCMC methods.  These algorithms can be applied in three contexts of machine learning and data science. First, they can be used for Bayesian (learning) inference problems with high-dimensional models, where the objective is to sample from a posterior distribution given a prior distribution on the parameter space and the likelihood of the observed data. Second, they can be used for solving stochastic non-convex optimization problems including the challenging problems arising in deep learning. Third, they arise in modeling and approximating workhorse algorithms in data science such as stochastic gradient descent methods. By leveraging out the connections between stochastic gradient algorithms and MCMC algorithms, the proposed approach results in a new class of stochastic gradient algorithms called Hamiltonian Accelerated Stochastic Gradient that can outperform existing methods in deep learning practice. A first goal of the project is to study theoretical convergence properties of the proposed algorithms further to fill out the current gap between theory and practice, as well as to develop new scalable algorithms that can extend the existing framework. A second goal is to investigate existing Langevin algorithms further to provide non-asymptotic rigorous performance guarantees relevant to machine learning and data science practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A natural way to study dynamical systems is via a coding mechanism, creating a simplified model for a potentially complicated system.  The principal investigator will study a series of related problems aimed at understanding how various measurements of complexity of the system relate to its dynamical properties, combining dynamical methods with algebraic and combinatorial, or counting, techniques to study these questions.  Along with the research goals of obtaining a deeper understanding of the connections among these fields, the principal investigator will continue work on broadening the cohort of researchers working in these areas.

One series of questions is on their automorphism groups, a way to capture the symmetries of the system, exploring the complicated group structure that arises for more complicated systems and the constraints on the group structure that arise in simpler systems.  A second area of focus is on the measurable properties of symbolic systems, studying how the simplex of invariant measures depends on various notions of complexity.

Dense packs of icebergs and sea ice, known as ice mlange, occur in many Greenland fjords, and may occur near many Antarctic glaciers in the future. Observations suggest that ice mlange may directly affect iceberg calving by pressing against the glacier front and indirectly affect glacier melting by controlling where and when icebergs melt which can impact ocean circulation and ocean heat transport towards glaciers. However, the interactions between ice mlange, ocean circulation, and iceberg calving have not been systematically investigated due to the difficulty of conducting field work in Greenland fjords. The GLACIOME project will investigate the complex interactions between glaciers, ice mlange and the ocean using laboratory experiments and models to provide the first comprehensive model of the co-evolution of these systems.<br/><br/>The GLACIOME project will use detailed process models and laboratory experiments to investigate thermodynamic and mechanical couplings between ice mlange and fjord waters. A stand-alone, numerical model of ice mlange granular flow will be developed using state-of-the-art continuum approaches from granular physics. This standalone model will be used to test the sensitivity of ice mlange flow and stress to external forcings. Results from experiments and simulations will be used in the development of a fully coupled glacier-ocean-mlange model (GLACIOME), which includes the new standalone mlange model, the Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System Model (ISSM) and the MITgcm ocean model. The coupled GLACIOME model will be used to test the impact of ice mlange on glacier stability over decadal time scales. In addition to the scientific advances, the GLACIOME project will provide opportunities for career development and outreach.

It develops and tests a sophisticated theory of parental leave policy that accounts for how households and businesses make decisions about labor supply and demand as well as whether and how many children to have, taking into consideration government parental leave policies. This model provides a formal economic framework for analyzing arguments on several sides of the debate.  Rising female workforce participation and reduction in gender gaps in schooling and earnings are some of the most important changes in labor markets over the past few decades in high income countries.  While several competing parental leave policies have been proposed for the United States, there is not much research to guide which of the competing proposals will be best for the United States. In addition to studying the best parental policy for the US, the project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge economic research.  The results of this research project will provide guidance on how best to establish efficient parental leave policies for the US, thus improving the operations of the labor market.  It will also help to establish the US as a global leader in parental leave policies.<br/><br/>There is a large empirical literature on parental leave policies; however the evidence does not provide a unique verdict on the efficacy of these policies. On the one hand, these policies may foster gender equity and child development by enabling working mothers to combine careers and motherhood. On the other hand, these policies may have long-term negative consequences for women as they may inhibit women from building up their careers due to losses in work experience.   This project addresses the optimal design of parental leave policies and various ways of funding them by presenting a theory of how households make decisions regarding fertility, labor participation and the allocation of resources, how leave policies affect these decisions, and how profit-maximizing firms respond to these policies. The project provides a framework for the assessment of the optimality of paid family leave policies combining quasi-experimental policy variation with an explicit, structural modeling of the mechanisms through which female employees and their employers may respond to these interventions.  Unlike earlier research, this research considers statistical discrimination, household bargaining, and child development together in a general equilibrium model of the labor market. The semi-parametric, structural difference-in-difference approach of the project facilitates rigorous testing of the various mechanisms through which both sides of the market respond.

Understanding the interplay between alarm signals and cues of safety within the public information landscape is essential to understand the role of communication in shaping species interactions within groups and how this influences the larger community.

Its complex folding patterns create more space for neural connections and subdivide the brain?s circuitry. Yet little is known about how these folds are created or how they shape brain function. This project examines growth rates, tensile forces, and material properties of the developing brain tissue that interact to induce and shape the patterns of brain folding. The folded mouse cerebellum will be used as the experimental system for studying these mechanical aspects of brain folding. Mouse strains with different patterns of cerebellar folding will be compared to determine how the tissue mechanics of folding are regulated differently during development. Comparison with rat cerebellar folding will additionally reveal how the mechanics are adjusted to regulate folding pattern changes between species. The project will advance the developmental and regulatory understanding of brain folding, and make fundamental contributions toward understanding neural development, improving tissue engineering, and elucidating the mechanisms underlying evolutionary brain changes. This project includes a research-based course for undergraduate students who will directly participate in the acquisition and analysis of the proposed experiments and develop their public-facing communication skills. Through a partnership with the local school district, this project will also support junior high science educators and their students by refreshing teacher science experience through hands-on participation, and the collaborative development of supplemental curricula for junior high science classes.<br/> <br/>Research into the morphogenesis of the brain has been limited due to an almost exclusive focus on the cerebral cortex, as well as the difficulty of acquiring developmental data. This proposal will meet these challenges by developing the murine cerebellum as a tractable model of brain folding. Previously, the cerebellum has been shown to undergo differential expansion at the time of folding initiation. Additionally, the cerebellum is under tension and has an outer fluid-like layer. These tissue properties are predicted to regulate folding as well as the partitioning of functional brain circuitry. Differential expansion, the predicted tunable driver of folding amount, will be analyzed in two- and three-dimensions in both wild-type and mutant strains of mice, as well as in rats. Cerebellar tension (predicted to decrease during folding progression)  will be investigated with mechanical assays that examine folding amount as well as the fibrous axonal and dendritic components potentially mediating tension. The fluidity of cerebellar tissue will be analyzed using live ex vivo imaging and pharmacological perturbations. These experiments will demonstrate how tissue-specific forces are created and regulated during development to shape the folding brain and produce the variation seen within species, and how tissue mechanics are evolutionarily modulated to set up the folding variation seen between species. More broadly, the results of this proposal will provide insight into how emergent mechanisms arise during development to impact neural tissue form and function.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Organization Program in the Neural Systems Cluster, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will focus on fabrication technologies based on material extrusion-type Additive Manufacturing (AM), which is used in a wide range of 3D printing technologies at various scales. Topology optimization is a freeform design technique that generates new, high-performing design solutions. Topology optimization is often suggested as a powerful design-for-AM approach because it does not require a pre-conceived idea of the final design layout. However, most topology-optimized designs must be ?interpreted? or prepared by the design engineer to facilitate manufacture, a process that may result in performance loss of the final product. This research will develop original topology optimization frameworks that leverage the possibilities and constraints offered by extrusion-type AM processes. The integration of design and manufacture investigated in this project will ease the process used by design engineers and improve the performance of the final fabricated product. Equally important for the project is the integrated educational program that will inspire and train the next generations of design engineers to creatively approach design problems while considering manufacturing aspects. The educational program will stimulate interest in futures in engineering design, especially among students who do not typically engage with the topic. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is the discovery of a new design-fabrication paradigm that shifts design and manufacture from being two separate entities into a single unified process, where the preparation for fabrication step is eliminated. This objective will be achieved through the formulation of novel topology optimization algorithms that leverage the possibilities and constraints associated with extrusion-type AM. The constraints will be formulated implicitly as new manufacturing primitives that mimic the manufacturing process. The design algorithms will consider the fundamental extrusion characteristics and constraints, including: (i) discrete size of the extruding nozzle, (ii) bond quality between adjacent extrusions, (iii) support in the third dimension, and (iv) effects on the extruded sections of the unsteady processing controls. The new design frameworks will be validated against benchmark problems, and experimental testing will be performed to investigate performance. The research has broad societal impacts, as it will enable many applications in diverse fields, including (but not limited to) design of civil structures, aerospace and automotive components, sports and other protective equipment, novel lightweight materials, and biomedical implants.

As a premier citizen science computer game, Foldit has already been played by over 600,000 people since its inception. This project aims to improve the capabilities of Foldit to enable scientists and citizen scientists alike to accurately build biological structures of varying types and sizes. This capability could strongly improve science?s ability to understand the basis of many biological phenomena. In addition to these scientific benefits, this project benefits both science education and society as a whole. This new capability will enhance the variety and quality of educational options using Foldit, improving it as a major interface between the scientific community and society.<br/><br/>There is an ongoing need for improvements for methods to solve crystal and cryo-EM structures. Foldit is a citizen science project in which users aid in many biochemistry problems, including model building and real space refinement in protein structure solving projects. Early tests suggest that these ventures produce high quality crystal and cryo-EM structures, but many improvements are needed to make Foldit a go-to option for structure solving problems. Recently, new versions of Foldit have been introduced that can be used by single scientists or lab groups, in addition to standard citizen science Foldit puzzles. These options will be leveraged to create a multi-scale modeling toolbox for structural biology problems. The additions proposed in this grant include integrating new crystallography refinement capabilities within Foldit, and adding new modes that allow much larger proteins to be handled in Foldit for cryo-EM. Together, these improvements will make Foldit a state-of-the-art structure solving suite for crystallography and cryo-EM.

The research goal is to create and curate a unified set of critical tools in open-source environments that will provide the necessary baseline for researchers using tree-ring data to adopt open-science practices and increase both rigor and transparency in dendrochronology.<br/><br/>Much of the software used in dendrochronology are in legacy programming languages and have been maintained by a small number of volunteers for decades.  The codes are at risk of becoming inoperable or incompatible as advances in computing architecture accelerate. The techniques and tools adversely impacted include specialized data input and output, detrending, cross-dating, chronology building, spectral modeling, descriptive statistics, and other common data-handling and data-processing tasks. <br/><br/>The research team argues that this situation could be addressed by incorporating these legacy programs into a modern open-source and open-science framework.  While some of this work has been completed in the R package dplR, many of the tools most needed by the broader research community are still not widely available in R (including signal free standardization) and virtually none are implemented in the Python ecosystem. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include creating a modern open-source software base that will be immediately usable by paleoclimatologists using tree-ring data for paleoclimate research.  Modernizing and enhancing this software will also extend both their reach and utility beyond the dendrochronology community and allow integration into related initiatives in the atmospheric and earth sciences including LinkedEarth and Pangeo.  Making these tools open source will also facilitate further collaborative development, broaden the responsibility for collective maintenance and enhancement of this software, and ensure the persistence of these unique tools.

They overcome the limitations of human reasoning with greater capacity, rigor, and reliability.  Unfortunately, like all complex software systems, these programs may contain errors in the core algorithms or their implementations, causing them to produce incorrect results.  This risk can be eliminated by having the program generate a checkable proof: a detailed account of its reasoning process in a formal, logical notation.  This proof can then be checked by a much simpler checking program, quickly detecting any erroneous steps.  This project extends the scope of automated reasoning programs for which checkable proofs can be generated, enabling more advanced forms of analysis to be performed in a trustworthy manner. <br/><br/>Proof generation has become a common feature of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers, greatly improving their reliability and trustworthiness.  This project aims to improve the ability of other automated reasoning programs to generate checkable proofs of their results.  It extends the proof rules used by existing logical frameworks to enable additional reasoning capabilities.  Formally verified checkers that support these rules are implemented and made available.  In terms of automated reasoning, the project devises new formulations of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), dependency QBF (DQBF), model counting, and model checking that can generate proofs in existing and new logical frameworks.  Reduced Ordered Binary Decisions Diagrams (BDDs) are used as the underlying mechanism for implementing the reasoning programs.  BDDs have a proven track record for solving the problems of interest, and the reasoning behind many underlying algorithms can readily be expressed in simple logical frameworks.  Preliminary work on proof generation by a BDD-based SAT solver demonstrate that other automated reasoning tasks are amenable to this approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their original motivation came from representation theory, a branch of modern algebra, which examines the symmetries of an algebraic structure rather than examining the structure directly. Representation theory has numerous applications in physics and chemistry as well as other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns that occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This project will enhance the understanding of cluster algebras and provide new research directions in an already highly active research area. The investigator will establish and develop relations between cluster algebras and other areas of mathematics. These new connections will allow explicit computational results as well as structural development. The project will also investigate longstanding open questions. The project will involve graduate students in the proposed research.<br/><br/>The research project focuses on cluster algebras and their relation to combinatorics, knot theory, number theory, and representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras. The investigator will pursue several objectives. He will work on establishing explicit formulas for the generators of a cluster algebra of arbitrary type. He will also develop a fundamental connection between cluster algebras and knot theory which will realize important knot invariants as specialized cluster variables. Furthermore, he will create a combinatorial model for the category of maximal Cohen-Macauley modules over a class of finite-dimensional algebras that arise naturally in additive categorifications of cluster algebras as the endomorphism algebras of clusters.

The interactions between climate change, wildfire, and water cycles are well-studied in many mountain regions, such as the western United States, where forest fires are very frequent. Recent events suggest that wildfire may also be an emerging threat to tropical mountain environments, where natural fires are thought to be rare. The effects of wildfires on forest composition and water resources in tropical mountain regions are poorly known. The goal of this project is to investigate the causes of changes in fire, vegetation, and flooding in tropical mountains, specifically in the Rwenzori Mountains National Park, Uganda. This research will improve our ability to predict the responses of tropical mountain systems to future climate change and establish a basis for management strategies related to fire in these ecosystems. The project will provide opportunities for many graduate and undergraduate students to conduct research, will deliver a short course on climate and vegetation modeling, and will develop new classroom modules to be used in the Providence Public School System.<br/> <br/>This research will investigate the interactions between climate, fire regimes, vegetation composition, and flooding through analysis of lake sediment cores recovered from alpine environments in the Rwenzori Mountains, a site famous for its biodiversity. The project will test the hypothesis that changes in fire regimes in tropical mountain environments are influenced by temperature change. The role of changing fire regimes in influencing vegetation assemblages and catalyzing flood events will also be examined. The project will generate new paleoecological and paleoclimatological records based on several aspects of the sediment cores: fossil charcoal and pollen composition, organic geochemical data, and sediment composition.  These analyses will focus on time intervals such as the mid-Holocene, when temperatures were warmer than the present day, to investigate how warm temperatures influenced ecosystem dynamics. The results are expected to contribute to the understanding of ecosystem dynamics and resilience in poorly-studied Afroalpine environments.

Moisture delivered to soil irrigates the crops we grow and sustains natural ecosystems. Water that reaches further into the subsurface recharges aquifers and supplies the baseflow to streams and rivers. This transit through the shallow Earth also introduces water as a reactive agent capable of weathering the minerals that compose the crust, allowing chemical transformations that convert rock to soil and set the chemical signature of water resources. Thus, water is an integrator of this ?critical zone?, i.e., the surface of the Earth where we live and draw resources. Such vital transformations are largely hidden from direct study because they occur below our feet in the near surface. Thus, we rely upon models that describe the rates and pathways of fluid drainage through the critical zone, coupled to the chemical reactions that occur between water, minerals and life, to predict what takes place where we cannot make direct observations. These models are then checked against more accessible samples often using the chemistry of streams and rivers which drain watersheds. Using novel instrumentation and model development, this project will offer the first direct validation of these reactive transport models based on fluids and solids collected within the transition from soil to stream. The broader impacts of this study include the improvement of predictive models for the chemical signatures of water quality and critical zone functioning. The capability to develop and deploy such models is vital to the advancement of watershed management and critical zone science. In pursuit of this goal, the project will create an open access online training platform designed to educate the next generation of Earth scientists in the development of state-of-the-art reactive transport models. The teaching modules will be deployed as part of an NSF-RCN award and will feature ADA-compliant web design with both self-guided and classroom integration options. This resource will foster the expanded use and equitable availability of next generation quantitative models and promote international collaborations across the global critical zone community.<br/><br/>Predictive models for the tight coupling between fluid transport and chemical reactivity in critical zone weathering profiles remain largely validated against easily accessible observations such as the fluids that emerge as spring water and baseflow to streams and rivers. These integrated signatures of fluid draining landscapes offer a vital means of testing forward models and an increasing emphasis is now being placed on the use of riverine stable isotope ratios (e.g., ?7Li, ?30Si, ?27Mg, ?44Ca) for their exquisite sensitivity to specific components of chemical weathering. Integration of these promising tools into reactive transport simulations could hold the key to high fidelity predictive models for the coupling of chemistry and fluid flow draining intact weathering profiles. This proposal will generate three major advancements towards this goal: (1) quantitative interpretation of solute isotope signatures as a function of fluid travel time; (2) validation of isotope signatures in the zone of weathering between infiltration and discharge; and (3) predictive models for the weathering processes recorded by the isotope ratios of rivers draining watersheds. This will be accomplished through leveraging of a series of laboratory column experiments designed to support model development and in turn application to a novel field-scale instrumentation capability which allows direct collection of fluid samples in the partially saturated section of the critical zone where fluid drains through regolith before emerging as the baseflow to streams. The results of this work will test a set of hypotheses that link theory to observations of isotope ratios in the solutes derived from chemical weathering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With heterogeneous integration, each IP block can be implemented using the optimum technology node, maximizing design flexibility and performance. However, a drawback compared with a monolithic 2D chip is the large overhead introduced by inter-chiplet communication. On-package wires have much larger parasitics compared with on-chip interconnects. Thus, they may reduce the performance and energy-efficiency of 2.5D systems. Designing these physical IOs are expensive and time-consuming. Heterogeneous components cannot be easily integrated without a commonly used standard, and designers need to conservatively reserve a large design margin, which inevitably results in non-optimum designs and increased costs. The timing, power, and signal integrity properties between chiplets and the package are also not captured by the traditional design flow and CAD tools. The missing low-overhead, low-cost, and customizable IOs and design tools significantly slow down the adoption of these advanced packaging techniques. This project uses a chiplet-package co-design methodology to combine IC and package designs and provide a seamless environment for heterogeneous development. The goal is to minimize inter-chiplet performance overhead, reduce design costs, explore the full potential of 2.5D systems, and demonstrate the highest integration density and energy efficiency. The proposed chip design efforts and CAD tools will be used to provide educational materials, hands-on experience, and guest lectures to students. The project will contribute to the development of much needed US workforce in the area of research and development of semiconductors via a diverse set of plans for industry collaboration, pre-college education, and college and graduate-level education at the PI's institution, and in the state of Arkansas. The design tools resulting from the project will be open-sourced and packaged with design examples and documentation. <br/><br/>This 2.5D chiplet-package co-design flow will eliminate the boundary between chiplets and the package and combine additional design synthesis, extraction, and optimization steps to minimize overhead and costs. The IO synthesis will create and place small IO cells with just-enough sizing based on detailed extraction results. The active package synthesis will generate on-package buffers and re-timers to optimize area, wirelength, and performance. Holistic and In-Context extraction for chiplet-to-package coupling will provide the highest accuracy for both homogeneous and heterogeneous designs. The fabrication and testing of 2.5D systems is intended to ensure realistic validation with measured data. This CAD flow will further break the boundary between low-voltage and high-power engineering and enable computer-on-package with heterogeneous integration of Si logic and GaN/SiC power conversion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It develops and tests a sophisticated theory of parental leave policy that accounts for how households and businesses make decisions about labor supply and demand as well as whether and how many children to have, taking into consideration government parental leave policies. This model provides a formal economic framework for analyzing arguments on several sides of the debate.  Rising female workforce participation and reduction in gender gaps in schooling and earnings are some of the most important changes in labor markets over the past few decades in high income countries.  While several competing parental leave policies have been proposed for the United States, there is not much research to guide which of the competing proposals will be best for the United States. In addition to studying the best parental policy for the US, the project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge economic research.  The results of this research project will provide guidance on how best to establish efficient parental leave policies for the US, thus improving the operations of the labor market.  It will also help to establish the US as a global leader in parental leave policies.<br/><br/>There is a large empirical literature on parental leave policies; however the evidence does not provide a unique verdict on the efficacy of these policies. On the one hand, these policies may foster gender equity and child development by enabling working mothers to combine careers and motherhood. On the other hand, these policies may have long-term negative consequences for women as they may inhibit women from building up their careers due to losses in work experience.   This project addresses the optimal design of parental leave policies and various ways of funding them by presenting a theory of how households make decisions regarding fertility, labor participation and the allocation of resources, how leave policies affect these decisions, and how profit-maximizing firms respond to these policies. The project provides a framework for the assessment of the optimality of paid family leave policies combining quasi-experimental policy variation with an explicit, structural modeling of the mechanisms through which female employees and their employers may respond to these interventions.  Unlike earlier research, this research considers statistical discrimination, household bargaining, and child development together in a general equilibrium model of the labor market. The semi-parametric, structural difference-in-difference approach of the project facilitates rigorous testing of the various mechanisms through which both sides of the market respond. The results of this research project will provide guidance on how best to establish parental leave policies, thus improving the operations of the labor market.

These therapies include medical treatments with bioengineered cells (cell therapy) and medical treatments with drugs or other molecules that alter immune system function (immunotherapy).  With the rapid development of these therapies, the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry has made major advancements toward curing some of society?s most devastating cancers and diseases. Manufacture of these therapies requires large numbers of skilled biomanufacturing technicians. Yet, due to the relative novelty of the relevant manufacturing processes, there are few community college training programs that focus on biomanufacturing of cell/immunotherapies.

This workforce is essential for maintaining national health, security, and economic growth.<br/><br/>The project team will build on knowledge generated from its past initiatives to advance the groundbreaking innovations in cell and immunotherapies. The project has three goals: 1) develop comprehensive labor market and skills-gap analysis of cell/immunotherapy technicians on a national level; 2) develop best-practices for outreach and pipeline development to include people from underrepresented groups and high school students in these careers; and 3) become a knowledge-source and catalyst for other community colleges to develop cell/immunotherapy technician education programs and curriculum. These efforts will contribute to a diverse biomanufacturing workforce equipped with the knowledge and expertise to meet the demands of the cell/immunotherapy biomanufacturing industry.

Among the statistical factors contributing to the replication crisis is the lack of a solid foundation of statistics.  The two dominant schools of thought, frequentist and Bayesian, are very different, but both rely on precise probabilities. The use of precise probabilities for drawing inference about unknowns based on data, however, has been shown to be invalid in a specific sense that threatens replicability.  The shift from precise to imprecise probabilities for statistical inference will have broad positive impacts and create new research opportunities in fields beyond statistics and the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.  The project will use the online Researchers.One platform for dissemination of results.  Publicly available software will be created. The project also will provide valuable training and experience to graduate students and an early-career researcher.<br/><br/>A high-level goal of this research project is to create a single theory of statistical inference based on imprecise probabilities. This research project will focus on a framework that uses provably valid, data-dependent, imprecise (or non-additive) probabilities to quantify uncertainty and draw inferences about unknowns.  The investigator will demonstrate that this entire framework can be cast in terms of one of the simplest imprecise probability models, namely, possibility measures, and this simplicity benefits practitioners in various ways.  The investigator will prove that, roughly, every exact or conservative frequentist procedure corresponds to a valid imprecise probability, fully establishing the fundamental nature of imprecise probabilities in statistical inference.  The investigator also will develop new and powerful imprecise probability-based methods for two general and challenging statistical problems: structure learning in high dimensions and inference without a statistical model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researcher will focus on U.S. ranches that have adopted blockchain, the record-keeping mechanism underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Agriculture is among the first sectors of the U.S. economy to implement blockchain in real-world cases unrelated to cryptocurrency. Historically, ranchers have proven ownership and controlled movement of cattle through a combination of branding and barbed wire, both of which had significant social impacts beyond cattle husbandry. Beef producers are now testing blockchain?s promise of making detailed transactional information publicly available, aiming to enable consumers to self-verify the provenance and quality of their food rather than placing trust in often opaque supply chains. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis, explores the motivations and potential social ramifications of cutting-edge technology adoption. <br/><br/>The project tests the hypothesis that the infrastructure of meat production is primarily organized around notions of risk. Some uncertainties inherent to food production, such as weather, are practically impossible to predict; others, such as predation loss or negligence liability, are to a greater extent predictable. Predictable losses can be quantified as risk and thus managed through insurance or other means of transfer. The investigator will perform observational research among cowhands, conduct interviews with lawmakers and technology promoters, and undertake archival research, inquiring into the context and motivation for the use of branding, barbed wire, and blockchain as provenance technologies that increase certainty of ownership. This inquiry will reveal the distribution of risk across the beef supply chain, including who bears the burdens of risk and who is able to leverage it to generate value. The research will contribute to a greater understanding of how risk is conceived of and commodified. The far-reaching impacts of such an understanding include the safety of the US meat supply, the general configuration of supply chains, and the relationship between agricultural innovation and notions of ownership and responsibility with respect to property.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are also used for medical and other purposes.  For example, nearly 300 employers across the United States develop antibody-based drugs or diagnostic tests, sell antibodies as bioreagents, or provide antibody-related laboratory services. Not surprisingly, antibodies are an important front-line tool for diagnosing and treating COVID-19 infections.  Bioengineering antibodies is an active area of applied biotechnology research.  Bioengineered antibodies have the potential to reduce the costs of antibody manufacturing and storage, as well as to improve antibody-based drug delivery. This project will enlist faculty, industry-representatives, and two-year college students from across the United States to participate in developing and implementing research projects in antibody bioengineering. The research projects and laboratory protocols that derive from this work will help two-year colleges incorporate high-impact and relevant technologies into new or existing courses, thus providing a mechanism to engage students while preparing them to work in fulfilling careers.  In addition, the project will provide expert information about COVID-19 vaccine development and testing, thus benefitting students, instructors, and the public.<br/><br/>The specific aims of the project include 1) developing laboratory modules to support course-based undergraduate research experiences related to antibody bioengineering, and 2) investigating the feasibility of using hackathons as a novel strategy for engaging participants in collaborative curriculum development.  The project will develop learning modules that each address computational skills (e.g., data science, structural biology, bioinformatics), technical skills (e.g., mutagenesis, protein purification, assays, staining), and employability skills (e.g., poster presentations, communication, leadership). The modules will list related skill standards and learning outcomes, making it easy for instructors to incorporate the modules in their courses and for employers to evaluate portfolios of students participating in the research. The project team has assembled a national advisory board comprised of individuals with expertise in antibody technologies from biotechnology companies, research institutions, and core laboratories. Board members have agreed to provide guidance concerning project ideas and industry needs, as well as to evaluate modules. An annual hackathon will be held where the participants will organize in teams around one of the industry-suggested projects or other new project ideas. During the hackathon, the teams will work to refine the ideas, and to identify the modules and materials needed for each project. Project pitches at the end of the hackathon will be used to determine which projects will be selected for development and implementation. The project team and faculty collaborators will continue to develop the selected modules, implement the projects with students, and share findings. The ubiquitous presence of antibodies in industry and research labs ensures that students who learn antibody-related workforce-skills will be employable in nearly any locale. The project can, thus, contribute to mitigation of COVID-19 impacts on individuals who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

In order to analyze, use and store them it is necessary to understand their ?Structure?, in mathematical language this means to understand their ?Geometry?. For example this means, to embed them into  better structured spaces with a coordinate system. Banach spaces, are the conceptual  framework to accomplish that. A main focus of this project is finding embeddings of  metric spaces, used in Computer Science, into certain Banach spaces. Examples for such metric spaces are Lamplighter Graphs, which model the traveling salesman problem, and the Transportation Cost Metric Space, which models the optimal distribution of  products. On the other hand, from the embeddability, or non-embeddability of certain metric spaces into a given Banach space, one can deduce important geometric properties of that Banach space. This award will support the principal investigator's research on these topics and also contribute to US workforce development through the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the project is concerned with the question whether or not certain metric spaces, like the Lamplighter space and Transportation Cost space, can be  coarsely, uniform or bi-Lipschitzly embedded in the Banach space of integrable functions, and estimate the distortion of these embeddings. In the second part, the investigator seeks to find metric characterizations of several isomorphic properties of Banach spaces via the embeddabilty, or non embeddability, of certain metric graphs. The research will concentrate on finite asymptotic properties with the goal of establishing an asymptotic version of the in recent years successful Ribe Program on metric characterizations of local properties. The investigator will also continue his investigation on the metric interpretations of reflexivity, with the hope of finding metric test spaces which characterize  reflexivity. A central part of studying Banach spaces and their geometry is the study of (linear and bounded) operators on them. Very recently it was discovered that for a large class of separable  Banach spaces, the cardinality of closed subideals of the space of operators is the cardinality of the collection of subsets of the continuum. This is, by simple set theoretic considerations, the maximal possible. The PI will investigate the closed ideals of spaces of operators of more classes of Banach spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) supports research in industrial engineering.  More specifically, it supports research that contributes to research questions pertaining to the distribution of autonomous vehicles.  Furthermore, the project engages undergraduate engineering students in the research activities.<br/><br/>The overall project goal is to develop and evaluate a novel scheme for distributing finished vehicles from automobile manufacturers to dealers, assuming that self-driving technology is market ready. This project is motivated by a substantial literature gap: the implications of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies for the distribution of AVs themselves are not yet understood. This novel distribution scheme requires the collaboration of larger AVs (i.e., auto-carriers) and smaller AVs (i.e., finished automobiles), which can bring significant benefits through the routing cost tradeoff between heterogeneous AVs. The project team proposes a space-state network flow formulation and algorithm for the auto-carrier loading and unloading problem; develop learning-based algorithms to predict the loading feasibility and the loading/unloading cost for a given auto-carrier route; design a fully integrated auto-carrier loading and routing optimization algorithm, with and without AV technologies. Managerial insights will be generated through extensive computational experiments, which can inform automobile manufacturers in making cost-effective automobile distribution plans.  The project facilitates the preparation of engineering students at FAMU for academic pursuits in operations research and machine learning by engaging undergraduates as student researchers, and through the integration of research findings from this project with two courses taught by the PI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach can be applied across of a range of data types and domains. The resulting cyberinfrastructure provides tuning-free anomaly detection capabilities while making it easy to incorporate domain-specific requirements. It enables scientists and engineers having little experience with anomaly detection techniques to steer the anomaly detection process with domain expertise.

This is especially evident in select proteins that phase separate into protein-rich and protein-dilute liquid phases, much as oil added to water will separate into an oil-rich liquid phase. This phase separation has been shown to be controlled by phosphorylation, or the addition of a charged phosphate group to the protein. Not all phosphorylations are created equal; phosphorylation at certain sites within the protein will eliminate the ability to phase separate while others still can control the transport of molecules in-and-out of the protein-rich liquid phase. However, the inability to simultaneously assess the sequence of phosphorylation (or ?phosphorylation code?) and the corresponding materials properties of the protein-rich liquid phase in the cell has made it difficult to design synthetic materials that offer similar reprogramming capability. <br/><br/>This project seeks to overcome this obstacle by using novel biochemical engineering techniques to manufacture proteins with specific phosphorylation codes and subsequently measure the materials properties of these phase separating-proteins. In doing so, a framework will be created to design other materials with similar reprogramming capabilities and potentially generate a new class of biomimetic materials for therapeutic and consumer use. Beyond that, given the multidisciplinary scientific and engineering requirements, this project will not only provide training opportunities for the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists but seek to expand that pipeline by providing research opportunities for students at local community colleges in the greater Los Angeles area. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) persist as biopolymers in solution and can undergo phase separation into protein-rich liquid droplets, akin to polymer coacervation. These subcellular structures serve unique purposes, ranging from organelle sequestration to potentially behaving as bio-reactors within the cell. However, biology has built in an additional layer of sophistication; IDPs can be ?reprogrammed? via post-translational modifications to alter the materials properties, enabling a range of dynamic properties that would be impractical with well-folded proteins.<br/><br/>One particular modification, phosphorylation (or the addition of a divalently-charged phosphate group), has been shown to independently control the phase behavior and biomacromolecule transport properties of synapsin, an IDP that forms synapsin-rich liquid droplets within the neuron. While control of these properties is an inviting target for biomaterials investigation, deciphering the ?phosphorylation code? of modifications that can occur at multiple, distinct sites and correlating these codes to their resultant biological function remains a challenging obstacle. To overcome this barrier, insights from polymer science and physical chemistry will be used to target specific phosphorylation codes most likely to alter materials properties. Then, cell-free protein synthesis strategies will be used to express and purify synapsin with specific phosphorylation codes and measure their resultant biomaterials properties. Ultimately, this data will form the basis of a design framework that has explanatory and predictive power for reprogramming other IDP-based biomaterials and even synthetic polymer systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced technologies such as autonomous vehicles and collaborative robots are entering every sector of the economy and will fundamentally alter the way people live and work. However, realizing the full economic, safety, and health potential of these technologies is only possible if people establish appropriate trust in them. This project aims to understand and model the formation and evolution of trust, and to develop adaptive autonomy that facilitates the establishment of appropriate trust. The project advances STEM education and workforce development by nurturing the next generation of scientists in human-autonomy interaction, and by developing outreach activities for K-12 students with an emphasis on increasing participation of women and underrepresented minorities, and for working professionals aimed at helping them adapt to the future workplace wherein humans and autonomous agents will increasingly work as a team. <br/><br/>The research work has three main thrusts: (1) modeling temporal dynamics of trust formation and evolution; (2) estimating a person's trust in autonomy from behavioral and physiological information; and (3) developing methods that enable the autonomous agent to adapt its behavior and guide a person toward a more desired level of trust required for successful operation. The project will conduct multiple human-in-the-loop studies on a platform with humans interacting with autonomous drones in several situations, including search and rescue where a sequence of tasks and decisions are required.

Larger amphiphiles known as block copolymers (BCPs) adopt analogous structures, but typically are much more robust against mechanical forces or changes in chemical environment. For these reasons, BCP micelles are of growing importance in a variety of emerging technologies, including as viscosity modifiers in synthetic motor oils to boost fuel economy, and as vehicles for delivery of therapeutic agents to specific target cells, such as cancers. In these applications, and many more, the nanostructure is created through the ?bottom-up? process of self-assembly, whereby the molecules are carefully designed to produce the intended structure. However, a fundamental problem is to understand the mechanism of self-assembly itself. In particular, it is important to know whether the resulting nanostructure is the most favorable, equilibrium one, or whether the system has become trapped in a non-optimal so-called ?metastable? state. In the latter case, which is quite common, by what mechanisms do micelles evolve toward a more favorable state?  With this knowledge, it will be possible to tailor a given commercial process to produce the most useful nanostructure, reliably and reproducibly, in the shortest possible time. Graduate students will acquire a broad suite of skills in polymer synthesis and characterization, light, X-ray and neutron scattering, and electron microscopy. They will also have extensive opportunities to present technical talks and posters to external audiences, as well as to mentor talented undergraduates. High school students from the greater Twin Cities, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, will be exposed to polymer science through ""Polymer Day: You Make It, You Break It"", a hands-on component of a broader ""Discover STEM: Materials Week"" summer camp. A diverse cohort of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from across the country will participate in Future Faculty Workshops, to enhance skills in acquiring and succeeding in academic positions.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>	While the equilibrium structure of block copolymer (BCP) micelles is relatively well understood, the dynamic processes by which such structures evolve are not. Furthermore, BCP micelles formed by solution self-assembly are often trapped in metastable, non-equilibrium states. A comprehensive experimental program is described, aimed at developing a quantitative understanding of the five molecular-level processes believed to control block copolymer micellar self-assembly. These processes include micellar fragmentation and fusion, for which prior studies are very scarce. Recalcitrant problems in understanding single chain exchange will be attacked with computer simulations, and unresolved issues in understanding the effect of energetic barriers to micelle creation and annihilation will be addressed using the same model polymer systems. A suite of powerful experimental tools will be employed, especially dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, and liquid-phase transmission electronic microscopy. The results will provide critical tests of existing models, or will provide benchmark data sets to inform future theoretical developments.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generally, most plastics in everyday use are passive, that is, designed for a single purpose (e.g., food containers, plastic bags, or adhesives) and once used these plastics are thrown away and impact the environment. This project is focused on developing a class of adaptive polymers that have the ability to heal or change shape on demand. In addition, these materials have the ability to be reprocessed after use, and by controlling the temperature and time employed during reprocessing it is possible to tailor their physical properties (e.g., stiffness, elasticity, temperature response). The ability to precisely retool the material properties opens the door to targeting materials that can be easily and systematically changed by processing, which in turn expands the potential applications areas that they can be used for. The research is a mix of different disciplines within the polymer area, from chemistry to polymer processing and mechanical characterization. Importantly, this broad research approach provides students (at all levels) with wide-ranging educational experiences covering this swath of topics. Graduate students will participate in a two-year outreach training program to develop and refine their abilities to engage and effectively communicate with the general public. Using this training they will participate in a series of outreach events, including Junior Science Cafs, the No Small Matter Molecular Engineering Fair, as well as a number of programs aimed at outreach to students from local Chicago public schools. These outreach activities, in conjunction with additional integrated high-school and undergraduate research opportunities, are designed to increase the fraction of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>Recent work by the Rowan group has shown that room temperature dynamic thia-Michael (tM) chemistry (based on benzalcyanoacetate/amide Michael acceptors) can be used to access mechanically robust polymer networks through a process coined dynamic reaction-induced phase separation (DRIPS). These phase separated dynamic materials exhibit properties such as healing, shape memory, and reversible adhesion. Furthermore, the exchange kinetics and thermodynamics of tM reactions can be systematically altered by the electronic nature of the tM acceptor, allowing an investigation of how the dynamic exchange properties impact both the phase-separated morphology and the overall materials properties of the network. The planned research investigates the manipulation of dynamic tM materials through annealing conditions, light exposure, and cross-reactivity with additional dynamic bonding systems. In addition, the phase separated morphology (and therefore mechanical properties) of these materials can be directly manipulated through thermal processing conditions (cooling rates, annealing steps, etc.).  As such, the first goal of this work is aimed at developing fundamental structure / processing / morphology / property relationships in this class of adaptive materials. The second goal of this work is to develop photo-responsive dynamic tM bonds by taking advantage of the inherent E/Z isomerism of the benzalcyanoacetate/amide Michael acceptor structure, to give access to a new class of photo-activated dynamic materials. Finally, a new program will be initiated aimed at using a Systems Polymer Science approach (inspired by systems chemistry) to functional polymer design with the goal of accessing pluripotent polymers, namely polymer systems whose properties can be significantly altered upon exposure to chemical or environmental cues allowing them to be used in a wide variety of applications. To do this, the PI will investigate the potential of incorporating multiple communicating dynamic reaction cycles into polymer networks.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even in the unlikely event of pandemic eradication, new work patterns may replace pre-pandemic norms and practices of international collaboration. While technological solutions matter for facilitating adaptation to the pandemic, social innovations at the individual and team levels are equally or more important for generating resilience within scientific teams during the protracted crisis. The future of international collaborative work can benefit from an understanding of how scientists have shown team resilience during this time, strengthening teams, and meaningfully transferring knowledge. In an increasingly globalized scientific landscape the grand policy question is how to internationalize scientific teams while, at the same time, responding to local demands. Our goal is to characterize different forms of social innovation in international collaborative work during the pandemic, while taking into account local contexts, opportunities, and institutional factors.<br/><br/>Part 2.<br/>This project addresses the topic of global social innovation in science capacity in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining three intertwining features of the social dynamics of international collaborative teams: Social innovation, Adaptation and Resilience, and Learning and Transferability. Social innovation refers to new and different ways of modifying individual and group behavior within the context of team science. The research design builds on interdisciplinary knowledge about individual conduct and group dynamics within the context of teams. The project involves a series of case studies focused around distinct internationally collaborative teams across four countries: Austria, Latvia, Spain and the United States. Data are drawn from bibliometric data sources, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a survey of researchers. Teams include new emergent collaborations that establish norms for interaction during the pandemic, or adaptive collaborations that adjust to the barriers and constraints of the pandemic. A novel methodological approach to identifying teams for case study is employed by implementing advanced computing techniques in a new and robust bibliometric dataset, complemented by other snowball sampling techniques. The project will conclude with an international workshop to share and disseminate findings that further international collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support to foster global transdisciplinary research teams to address critical issues in ocean sustainability including, conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.  This complex challenge required that the projects utilized integrated, transdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches and bring together natural and social sciences as well as policymakers, resource managers, industries, citizens and other societal partners.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries to increase our knowledge of the complex linkages and pathways needed to accelerate sustainable use of oceans and minimize the effects from global change.  <br/><br/>The project aims to investigate how existing conflict resolution practices impact ocean sustainability by examining how formal interventions (law) and informal practices (negotiation) can be harnessed toward conflict resolution. These studies are based on the idea that ocean sustainability prospects depend on building tailor-made capabilities to analyze, productively manage, and transform ocean conflicts. Since ocean conflict resolution is an under-developed field of scholarship and practice, the team aims to use comparative analysis to study conflicts that traverse the Global North and South, in South Africa, India, Brazil, Norway/Barents Sea, Baltic Sea and United States. The project is projected to help develop insight into diverse ocean conflicts through real-world collaboration of context-specific research teams that include stakeholder partners, social and natural scientists, and conflict resolution experts. The new knowledge gained will be used to develop and test ocean conflict resolution tools and practices. The Oceans PACT project will generate significant scientific and socio-political benefits in the case studies that result from this proposal, ideally forming conflict resolution practices that foster global ocean sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecologists strive to monitor, understand, and model the effects of excess nutrients, including phosphates and nitrates, in combination with other human threats. Understanding dynamic spaces with complex and interdependent factors will require a new generation of sensors. Biology-enabled sensors have significant advantages with respect to sensitivity, error-tolerance, scalability, selectivity, and versatility. However, readout and long-range interconnectivity are currently problematic, if not impossible, with biology alone. Biohybrid devices can exploit and tune the strengths of both electronic and biological sensing through a dynamic bioelectronic interface. To achieve it, electroactive bacteria (dissimilatory metal/sulfate reducing bacteria) and their extracellular electron transport mechanisms are employed to transduce their environmental response to measurable biocurrent. A three- dimensional nanofabricated electrode can collect a bacterially derived current for signal processing. The response to a target in the environment is more precisely selected and intensified by the collective response of engineered and highly versatile Escherichia coli. By distributing the sensing and actuation roles between synthetic E. coli and the dissimilatory reducing powerhouse Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, confidence in the presence of a select target is enhanced with the aggregation of individual responses from large number of E. coli bacteria to the community of electroactive bacteria. The bioelectronic interface design is a foundational step toward a new generation of sensing hardware that can meet the vast and expanding promise of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Cross-disciplinary training modules will be developed to designed by the on-campus community of researchers including graduate and undergraduate students. By including new researchers, accessible content is created for the local and international GK-12 community. Local students from the Independent Sanctuary for Independent Media Nature Lab will create informative and creative content for the international cohort starting with the H20 Virtual Academy at the Karada Mixed Secondary School in Kisumu, Kenya. The international connection of gifted local and international students, a flow of stimuli, to convey state-of- the-art knowledge about the environment around them reflect the goals of research.<br/><br/>In the proposed work, a mechanism for the detection of phosphate will be investigated using an interconnected network of E. coli and S. oneidensis MR-1. Phosphate detection is essential to understanding ecological dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. A dynamic bioelectronic interface will be created for its potential use in the detection of multiple small molecule targets by engineered bacteria. The system design is inherently modular where electroactive S. oneidensis serves as the bioelectronic interface while E.coli is the easily engineered front end. Electroactive bacteria (dissimilatory metal/sulfate reducing bacteria) and their extracellular electron transport mechanisms will be employed to transduce their environmental response to achieve a measurable biocurrent. A three-dimensional nanofabricated electrode, consisting of a nanomaterial-decorated graphene foam and the two bacteria will generate and transduce the biocurrent for signal processing. The response to a target in the environment is more precisely selected and intensified by the collective response of engineered E. coli. Modules will be linked via chemical quorum sensing and tuned with respect to transfer function and signal amplification using synthetic biology approaches. The co-cultured bacteria configuration will be optimized for cell-viability and signal transport. The research is accomplished through the following objectives: Objective 1: Design and fabricate a bioelectronic backend interface from quorum sensing signal to S. oneidensis biocurrent for signal transduction; Objective 2: Design and fabricate a bioelectronic frontend interface from target (phosphate) to E. coli quorum sensing signal; Objective 3: Integrate objectives 1 and 2, and fabricate, test, and validate bioelectronic sensor from target (phosphate) to biocurrent signal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Few people know that they were once abundant and are now rare. They feed by filtering algae and other material from the water. This ?biofiltration? helps with nutrient cycling and provides ecosystem services such as improved water quality for humans.

Emerging research suggests that high temperatures can affect behaviors critical to reproduction and survival, such as choosing a mate and foraging, and that these effects occur at temperatures well below those that cause death. The core aim of this study is to generate understanding of how such behaviors are affected by elevated temperatures. The study combines mechanistic and functional approaches to provide new insights into individual-level variation in behavioral performance in heat using zebra finches as the study organism. As an arid-zone bird, zebra finches are a sentinel species for behavioral responses to the ever-increasing threat of heat. The core research aim will also be woven into inter-related educational and outreach activities. The centerpiece of these efforts is a new collaboration between Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and outreach groups at the University of Tennessee to develop, implement and assess new K12 curricular materials at the intersection of behavioral and thermal ecology, in the process supporting K12 classrooms and a STEM teacher pipeline in the economically disadvantaged Appalachian region of East Tennessee.<br/><br/>The sub-lethal effects of acute thermal challenges on animal behavior are not well-studied, particularly for mating-related behaviors such as advertisement and mate choice. This gap in knowledge is especially marked for endotherms, which are capable of thermoregulation but nevertheless face increasingly common and increasingly severe heat exposure. There is an urgent need to identify the scope of these behavioral effects of heat and the key drivers of behavioral thermal tolerance. To meet this need, the proposed research uses controlled experiments with a well-studied avian species, zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), to address two aims: (1) experimentally generate behavioral thermal response curves, focused on male song and female preferences and (2) test how pre-exposure to heat alters behavioral performance under thermally challenging conditions. By addressing these aims, this research achieves the overall goal of identifying the mechanisms and consequences of heat exposure on behavior. Meeting the study's research objectives will build robust theory on functional, behavioral responses to the ever-increasing threat of heat. In doing so, this proposal will evaluate the critical role of behavior in one of today's most pressing global challenges.

The classic example is detonations of nuclear weapons which would result in massive fires, sending soot and ash far up into the atmosphere.  As has been documented with volcanoes, if the materials reach a certain level in the atmosphere they can stay suspended for a long time and cool the surface of the Earth.  This project will revisit the concept of plumes originating from large fires using modern computational tools.  The research may have policy implications and will contribute to the education and training of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this EAGER award is to develop a general theory for the flow above very large fires, such as those initiated by the detonation of a nuclear weapon.  The lead scientist for this project makes the case that given the basic characteristics of a fire, we are unable to predict the buoyancy of the resultant plume. And without a buoyancy estimate, we cannot predict the plume's level of neutral buoyancy or the height at which aerosols will ultimately reside in the atmosphere.  The research team will formulate a theory that provides estimates of the initial height, horizontal width, and characteristic buoyancy of the fluid emerging from the spin-up layer. With this theory in hand, the researchers will initialize the vertical plume and study the fate of the air launched upwards in the vertical plume.  The aim is to formulate a theory for the plume's level of neutral buoyancy.  The approach will be to climb up the hierarchy from 2D dry unstratified initial results to a comprehensive theory for realistic plumes in a 3D moist stratified atmosphere.  The results of this theory will be validated against high-resolution simulations from Large Eddy and Direct Numerical Simulations (LES and DNS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project intends to increase the pool of qualified candidates for these and related positions.  To do so, Elizabethtown Community and Technical College will partner with the U.S. Army Garrison - Fort Knox to provide educational opportunities in Advanced Manufacturing to soldiers transitioning to civilian life.  These opportunities will include the high-demand areas of Automation, Robotics, Industrial Maintenance, and Electrical Technology.  The college will use flexible course options to meet the needs of transitioning soldiers so that they can use their post-service time to obtain industry-recognized, stackable credentials, including academic certificates and associate degrees.  The result is expected to be a new career pathway that will expand advanced manufacturing education to more students.  In addition, by redesigning their Advanced Manufacturing courses to closely align with the skills needed in high-demand industries in the region, the project can benefit soldiers reentering civilian life.<br/><br/>This project at Elizabethtown Community and Technical College will focus on serving transitioning military personnel and will gain a better understanding of veteran culture and the necessary services needed to promote student success.

It will do so by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students at Louisiana State University at Alexandria, the only state-supported undergraduate institution in Central Louisiana. Over its five-year duration, the project will provide scholarships to 18 full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, chemistry, and mathematics. These Scholars will be admitted in two cohorts and receive four-year scholarships. The project aims to increase persistence of the Scholars in STEM fields by linking scholarships with both proven and innovative supporting activities, including near-peer, faculty, and professional mentoring, supplemental instruction, early alert intervention pathways, monthly workshops focusing on career and interpersonal skills, a living/learning community, early undergraduate research exposure, cohort common coursework and specialized computational and writing courses, and participation in research conferences. With assistance of faculty mentors, the Scholars will identify specific challenges, motivations, and successes in their STEM education journey. The introduction of advanced computational courses such as bioinformatics, chemometrics, and multivariate statistical analysis will enable Scholars to gain a deeper understanding of STEM content. The University is one of the most racially diverse institutions in the state: about 30% of the student population are first-generation college students and 65% requiring federal, state, and/or institutional aid.  As a result, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM fields and to increase knowledge about how to improve educational outcomes for low-income, high-achieving STEM students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The specific aims include: 1) strengthening student support services to increase retention and four-year graduation rates; 2) establishing and administering tier-level mentorships, research opportunities, and enhanced career services to increase STEM career readiness; and 3) establishing a data monitoring system to analyze student information in order to identify STEM student needs and determine the impact of various activities on their success. The project will implement evidence-based practices for increasing undergraduate graduation in STEM, including academic support in introductory STEM courses, financial assistance, faculty mentorship, and innovative curriculum. This project aims to provide the Scholars with a holistic program of support services and opportunities for engagement in STEM. In addition to advancing understanding of challenges and motivations affecting students? retention and graduation in STEM fields, this project has the potential to create future STEM leaders who can contribute to the economy of the underserved rural areas of Central Louisiana. The project will be evaluated using data from formative and summative assessments.  Comparative techniques will be used to analyze qualitative data and parametric tests will be used to analyze quantitative data. The results of these efforts will be disseminated locally and nationally for the benefit of other institutions with similar goals. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigation focuses on how global and local fluctuation in sugar markets, political shifts, demographic decline, and environmental change, have affected the households and communities of field and mill workers, beginning with conscripted indigenous as well as enslaved and mestizo communities of the colonial era. Archaeological reconstructions situate present and past stressors, evaluations of risk, and responses within their historical context, a perspective that is not accessible through a focus on any single point of time, or through documents alone. This project contributes to the comparative assessment of economic trends, human-environmental interactions, resilience, and identity during periods of profound cultural change, and facilitate nuanced approaches to community development. It includes collaboration and education opportunities for multiple participants. The researchers engage local communities to determine what components of the study they find most useful in terms of application to policy and community resilience. The diachronic nature of the project means that it examines how past processes, revealed archaeologically, have influenced contemporary livelihoods and their diversification in the face of rapid economic change. <br/><br/>Global economic integration, agricultural intensification, and the expansion of cash crop production has transformed and continues to affect communities that were once subjected to colonial domination. The researchers are specifically interested in how global economic integration has affected resilience strategies of local communities and households. How have people evaluated and responded to risk? What alternatives to market participation have they adopted? The study region hosted complex indigenous agricultural communities, which colonists conscripted to work in local sugar mills. An archaeological approach to the resilience of household adaptive strategies will enable global economic factors to be examined within the context of historical sugar communities. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions, geomorphological assessments of the impact of intensive agriculture on area soils and waterways, and archival analysis will complement and contextualize the archaeological study of these sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet migratory species are also declining worldwide because of human disturbance, habitat loss, and environmental variability.  In particular, large ungulates (e.g., deer, elk) are both ecologically and economically important (e.g., hunting), and yet their migrations are also in decline.  Understanding the causes of declining migratory ungulates has important implications for their conservation and management.  However, across migratory species, there are usually individuals who migrate and individuals who do not migrate within a single population.  Previous research also showed individual ungulates can be flexible in their migratory behavior, deciding whether to migrate or not, or where to migrate, based on changes in their environment. This research will take advantage of a 19-year, long-term study of migratory elk in a western North American montane landscape to understand both the causes of migratory decision-making in elk, as well as the population consequences of changes in migratory behavior to the management of elk. This research will have broad implications for population and habitat management for a wide range of economically-important migratory ungulate species such as deer and elk across western North America. <br/><br/>This research will extend our long-term 19-year demographic study of a partially migratory elk population on the border of Banff National Park, Alberta, to address the mechanisms driving partial migration.  The core data for this research is understanding the demography of over 400 individually marked female elk of known ages, their reproductive rates, and juvenile survival, combined with spatial analyses of their migratory behavior measured by Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. We will test whether elk switch between migratory strategies in a manner consistent with intrinsic factors (e.g. age, body condition), extrinsic factors (e.g, climate), or density-dependent mechanisms. By monitoring intrinsic factors such as age and reproductive history, as well as extrinsic variation in forage and predation risk, we will test amongst competing and interacting hypotheses to understand why a long-lived mammal switches between migratory strategies in the face of environmental change. We will then develop a flexible Bayesian integrated population model to test the consequences of migratory switching on population dynamics.

Wild Asparagus species range from the southern tip of South Africa, throughout Europe to the eastern reaches of Asia, and exhibit remarkable variation in growth forms and modes of reproduction. Whereas garden asparagus is a non-woody species with fleshy roots, many other species produce woody stems as bushes or persistent vines, and still other species produce potato-like tuberous root. The familiar garden asparagus has separate pollen-producing male and fruit-bearing female plants, whereas most of its relatives are hermaphroditic - meaning the flower has both male and female parts combined. Previous hypotheses suggest that this high level of diversity is the result of adaptation to geographic spread due to changing environmental conditions. The objective of this research is to determine when, where and under what environmental conditions this diversity of growth and reproduction strategies arose within Asparagus. The researchers will use genomic methods to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among all described Asparagus species and then determine how changes in growth form and mode of reproduction correlate with environmental changes and biogeographic spread. The findings will allow generalizations for modeling how plants may adapt to changing environments in the future. This, in turn, will be significant to cultivation and production of domestic Asparagus. For example, the results will provide asparagus breeders information to help develop new varieties that can thrive in the face of increasing droughts in Southern California or fungal pathogens in the moist environments of the Midwest and Northeastern U.S.<br/><br/>State-of-the-art genomic, phenotyping and modeling approaches will be utilized to develop a robust, comprehensive phylogeny for the genus Asparagus, and to elucidate its dynamic biogeographic history and adaptations to varied environmental conditions. Garden asparagus (A. officinalis) is already a model for the evolution of dioecy. This project will expand our understanding of the evolution of trait diversity in Asparagus to include storage root form, shoot architecture and deciduousness, the development of photosynthetic stems in place of leaves, and the transformation of leaves into reduced, non-photosynthetic scales and thorns with diverse forms and functions. Integrating species-level phylogenomics, environmental data, and phenomics, we will test for interactions among the genetic, ecological and evolutionary processes that have been driving diversification within Asparagus over the last 5-10 million years. Novel methods of image analysis that have been developed for intraspecific high-throughput phenotyping will be expanded to model macroevolutionary changes in shoot and root architecture. These developments will propel new lines of research on both within species and interspecific biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This mismatch is ever more present in emerging technologies such as blockchain and decentralized ledgers (DLT). The project?s novelties are: (1) a common blockchain-focused language for cryptography and distributed computing and translations of results to this common language; and (2) the study of feasibility, scalability, and efficiency of both classical distributed-cryptography primitives and blockchain-inspired ones, in models that better capture the challenges and idiosyncrasies of the latter.

Project leadership will engage with schools and community partners in southwest Georgia, where regional challenges caused by poverty and inequity contribute to minimal production of STEM teachers from the local communities. There is a need to both grow and diversify the STEM teacher pipeline to meet future staffing demands and to improve STEM learning outcomes for underrepresented students. The project addresses this need by developing 12 new STEM teachers and training them to implement an innovative STEM curriculum based on Citizen Science. Such a curriculum involves collecting scientific information from nearby areas and attempting to solve problems that are relevant to the lives of the students and other citizens in those local communities.  The new STEM teachers' training in Citizen Science will link three key teaching skills: (1) use of culturally responsive instruction, (2) connecting new understanding and knowledge to what students already know, and (3) creation of teaching exercises and lessons that interweave concepts from multiple STEM areas during the problem-solving process. Project outcomes will help to identify solutions to one of the most challenging issues facing rural education in America: how to produce adequate numbers of STEM-certified minority teachers who are exceptionally qualified and willing to stay in high-need schools.  The student population at Albany State University is more that 70% African American, resulting in a strong potential for increasing the number of African American STEM teachers in local schools.<br/><br/>This project at Albany State University includes partnerships with: 1) school districts in Southwest Georgia, specifically Dougherty, Randolph and Terrell; 2) the USDA Research Station (Peanut Lab) in Dawson, GA; and 3) a consortium of non-profit partners including The Albany Civil Rights Institute, Thronateeska Heritage Center, The Flint RiverQuarium, and Chehaw Park. The primary goal of the project is to increase and diversify the STEM teacher pipeline in southwest Georgia school districts. Specific objectives include: (1) train a cohort of diverse STEM teachers to use culturally relevant pedagogy; (2) design curricular modules that are problem based and focus on Citizen Science; (3) provide systematic and ongoing induction support; and (4) develop STEM teacher leaders. During the 5-year project, the project will produce 12 STEM teachers in multiple STEM disciplines (e.g., mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry), and support their transition from STEM post-baccalaureates to highly qualified teachers, and to teacher leaders. Intellectual merit of the project includes contributions to research and practice for building a diverse STEM teacher pipeline and a more STEM literate public. By engaging higher education and its school system partners in Citizen Science, this project intends to encourage teacher education programs to redesign instructional practices and curricula to draw upon the cultural assets of teacher candidates and students they will serve. The project's focus on Citizen Science will link the learning principles of culturally responsive pedagogy, constructivism, and integrative learning.

Archaeological research at two villages abandoned after the massive Novarupta eruption of 1912 will quantify how investments in human, natural, social, economic and built capital affected communities. In a region where the rate of volcanic eruptions in the archaeological record appears to far outpace cultural change, persistent community investments across repeated volcanic events are anticipated to reveal both local and regional strategies for mitigating disaster. Identifying community characteristics that contribute to resiliency has potential to inform planning around current and future hazards. Understanding these past interactions is critical, as climate change and rising sea levels continue to alter lifeways, affect resource access and destroy cultural heritage across the Arctic and Subarctic.<br/><br/>The holistic community capitals framework will be applied to two multicomponent village sites on the Alaska Peninsula. Katmai Village and Savonoski, situated in different environmental zones on either side of a major volcanic epicenter, were occupied until 1912 when they were buried by approximately 60 cm of volcanic ash. Archaeological features at the sites will be identified and mapped using magnetometry, while targeted excavations will recover radiocarbon samples and diagnostic artifacts to produce absolute chronologies. Analysis of lithic and ceramic artifacts, including X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation, will contribute to reconstruction of regional exchange networks. Because Katmai Village and Savonoski continue to hold significant meaning for Alutiit/Sugpiat communities living on the Alaska Peninsula today, project participants will co-design an educational curriculum and experiential program that engages local K-12 students and culture bearers with the archaeological study of their history and heritage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these early days of K-12 AI education, little is known about how diverse student populations relate to AI and which instructional strategies are most likely to engage them. Since most K-12 teachers are not yet familiar with AI, research is also needed on how to develop their AI fluency and confidence. This project, a collaboration between researchers in AI and education and the Georgia Department of Education, will investigate these questions by developing and testing a nine-week elective course for Georgia middle school students called Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence, and an accompanying online teacher professional development course. The student course will offer a mixture of activities including hands-on demonstrations, guided experimentation, online research, project-based learning, and exploration of AI-enabled careers. Teachers will also have the option of including computer programming activities. To ensure that the curriculum is adaptable to the needs of different populations and cultures, researchers will partner with school districts serving three ethnically and geographically diverse populations in Georgia: rural, suburban, and urban areas, and with large populations of white, Latinx, or Black students respectively. Both courses will be developed in collaboration with a team of middle school teachers from these districts who will first receive training from the investigators in the basics of AI and in culturally responsive teaching. Working with these teachers as they pilot the course will provide an understanding of the challenges in teaching/learning the content and the types of support needed for diverse teachers and learners to succeed. The project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>Over the three year project duration, 18 teachers drawn from 6 school districts will receive training in AI and culturally responsive instruction, and 1800 students will take the Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence course. The project will investigate four research questions: (1) What are middle school students' and teachers' knowledge of, interest in, comfort with, and attitudes towards AI technology and AI careers? (2) What types of technology-driven and innovative learning experiences are effective in increasing rural, Black, and Latinx/Hispanic middle school students' AI interest, knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and interest in AI careers? (3) What AI knowledge and skills are developmentally appropriate for middle school students? and (4) What institutional or cultural barriers/accelerators prevent/promote course implementation? The research will use a mixed-methods design combining attitudinal surveys, in-class observations, subject interviews, student reflections, and examination of student artifacts. At the conclusion of the project, the professional development course will be made publicly available through the Georgia Department of Education web portal. Additional project deliverables include the middle school course materials, AI demonstration software developed to support the middle school course, the research findings, and measurements of the effectiveness of the curriculum for diverse learner populations when implemented by middle school teachers in their classrooms. The results will also be disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly publications, and social media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecologists frequently ask how so many species can coexist in a community?  Multiple limiting resources can increase species diversity; for example, if one plant species is more competitive for nitrogen and another is more competitive for water, limitation in both resources can help both species persist in the system without one outcompeting the other. Temporal variability in resources can also increase diversity; for example, if some plant species grow fast under wet conditions, but others better tolerate dry conditions, rainfall variability over time can help to maintain more plant species in a site.  At present, the temporal dynamics of resources that limit plant growth are changing ? the amount of available nitrogen has doubled due to atmospheric inputs from human-related sources, and the climate is shifting ? with potentially profound consequences for plant biodiversity. Top-down processes like grazing animals or insect herbivores, may moderate the effect of these resource changes, however; for example, an increase in the growth of species favored by nitrogen enrichment may be offset by animals favoring those N loving plants. This CAREER project first experimentally disentangles the effect of shifting bottom-up and top-down processes in a highly diverse California grassland. Second, it assesses how these patterns shift along climate gradients by capitalizing on data from the a globally distributed experiment called NutNet, that has been manipulating nutrients and grazing animals in grasslands around the world for 10+ years. The overall goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the processes that maintain plant biodiversity and to further the capacity to predict how biodiversity will respond to global change. The project integrates research and educational aims throughout by involving undergraduate and graduate students in data collection, management, and synthesis.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2. <br/>Modern coexistence theory has emerged as a tool to partition the mechanisms of coexistence among species, providing a potential framework to predict how diversity will respond to on-going global environmental change. However, modern coexistence theory has been notoriously difficult to test empirically in field settings, reducing its applicability to natural systems. This CAREER project extends empirical tests of modern coexistence theory to quantify how bottom-up nutrient addition and top-down consumer pressure alter coexistence in environments varying in rainfall both across years, and over space. First, in an annual grassland system characterized by high climate variability, the project experimentally targets key resource-consumer-competitor interactions and interprets them using quantitative methods that partition coexistence mechanisms in an empirically tractable way. In addition, it parameterizes the range of conditions that support multi-species coexistence, better reflecting community dynamics than the pairwise species comparisons frequently employed in coexistence models. Second, the project assesses the generalizability of these patterns by synthesizing Nutrient Network data within a graduate seminar that trains students in team science, data analysis and data visualization. In addition, local Nutrient Network data is collected in conjunction with an undergraduate course sequence that pairs a summer field methods class with a data science class that uses the field-collected data. Finally, the project incorporates an independent undergraduate research program to support thesis students to test additional top-down and bottom-up dynamics at a local Nutrient Network site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Translating catalysts from the research laboratory to industry is a huge challenge. Not only do catalysts often have to be immobilized onto a solid support, but the material needs to be robust and retain the desired properties. By using state-of-the-art methods to study how these catalysts work at the molecular level, Dr. Montiel-Palma and her research group are applying this fundamental insight to design new improved catalysts that are more active and cost-efficient. Specific molecular changes are also being made to the catalysts to determine their effect on their reactivity and stability. In partnership with the Mississippi Migrant Education Center, Dr. Montiel-Palma is also giving a series of informal STEM lessons and activities for students K-12. These students are children of migratory workers with income sources in agriculture, fisheries, and other primary activities. They constitute one of the most vulnerable sectors of our society. Dr. Montiel-Palma is using this activity to address scientific topics aimed at motivating these students to finish secondary education and enrich their educational pathways.<br/><br/>Dr. Virginia Montiel-Palma and her research group will conduct a systematic study of dehydrosilylation catalysts grafted to metal-organic framework (MOF) supports. The catalysts are being tuned at both their pincer-like ligand sites as well as in the pore size, chemical properties, and structural stability of the MOF. A multifaceted characterization plan is being used to interrogate the catalytic materials and the mechanism of dehydrosilylation using these materials. The insights gained from these investigations are to be used to further inform structural changes in an iterative catalyst development process. Taken together, these activities are expected to provide a foundational profile of the catalyst system and help design more efficient and robust dehydrosilylation systems. These studies will be conducted with a team of graduate and undergraduate students carrying out the synthetic, mechanistic, and computational aspects of this project utilizing state-of-the-art technologies. These experiences will provide multi-faceted training in support of a diverse workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project, conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan, will map out what children at different ages and their guardians understand about viral contagion, such as the transmission of COVID-19, and, based on the findings, will develop and test the effectiveness of a home-based educational intervention delivered by means of a picture book. Building on pilot research, three studies will provide a rigorous, cross-age assessment with US children in grades K-5 in three distinct community contexts. Research questions include: At what ages do children understand aspects of viral transmission that are non-obvious or invisible, such as asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers, or the potential for objects and surfaces to carry infection? At what ages can children go beyond isolated facts they have learned and figure out what to do in new situations? How is children's biological reasoning influenced by non-biological factors, such whether a potential carrier is a friend or a stranger? How does children's reasoning about a global pandemic that has already massively disrupted their daily lives (COVID-19) compare with more ordinary and innocuous illness (the common cold)? Can young children successfully learn about core aspects of disease transmission by means of an illustrated storybook? Targeting children's beliefs and misconceptions of COVID-19 provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine effective ways of teaching core biological concepts in the elementary-school years. Findings from the project will inform parents, educators, and public health professionals regarding gaps and misconceptions in children's understanding of the transmission of viral disease in general, and COVID-19 in particular, as well as evidence-based scientific data on how most effectively to target educational efforts with children to improve both scientific literacy and adherence to public health guidelines. It will also be a source of theoretically significant data of central interest to STEM education, regarding how to teach children about vital scientific processes that they cannot see, how non-biological concepts influence children?s biological reasoning, and the role of community context in biological understandings. This award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>The team of researchers will individually interview 1,440 children ages 5-12 years and their parents to assess children's understanding of the biological processes of viral transmission, comparing COVID-19 with the common cold. Building on preliminary work by the investigators, the project will advance foundational knowledge on children?s intuitive understanding of biological mechanisms and on the use of picture books in educational interventions. Study 1 will address children's understanding of how and why viruses work and spread, with a battery of child-friendly tasks that assess: incubation periods (lag between infection and disease onset), asymptomatic hosts, that viruses can survive on a surface or object (such as a doorknob), and that viruses can gain access to the body through the eyes, nose, and mouth. Study 2 will focus on who may contract, transmit, or suffer the consequences of viral disease, and the role of both biological and non-biological factors (such as a person's nationality, language, or familiarity) in these judgments. Study 3 will assess a home-based educational intervention that targets key misconceptions regarding viral transmission, with the core notion of making invisible concepts visible. This intervention will systematically manipulate the role of anthropomorphic language and imagery (treating the virus as if it were a tiny creature) to determine the effects of these commonly employed choices on children's learning. Finally, the project team will partner with a natural history museum to design, mount, and test the effectiveness of an exhibit regarding viral transmission, including a media component (an interactive game) that will be portable to other users beyond the museum itself. This exhibit will be directly informed by the proposed research, with the aim of improving the public's knowledge of COVID transmission, and viral disease transmission more generally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lightnings most commonly occur during thunderstorms as electrostatic charges accumulate in clouds.  Lightnings have also been found to occur on Mars, believed to be created by dust storms.  Though not as common as on Earth because of low atmosphere pressure, such lightnings can be a hazard to instruments on Mars with metal objects acting like a lightning rod.  The multiplication of robotic explorers at the surface of the planet has increased the chances of such electric discharges, increasing risks for instruments and an ever-more likely human-exploration.<br/><br/>This CAREER research outlines a five-year effort to study the physics and observability of electrical discharges in atmospheric conditions representative of Earth and Mars. The investigators suggest a comprehensive study combining theory and experiments centered on discharges produced in air at pressures ranging from 6 to 1013 mbar, to examine the differences between discharges started from a hot, cylindrical or spherical electrode, and the electrification observed in the tribocharging of regoliths and sand grains.  The principal objective is to further our understanding of the physics of electrical discharge in diverse environments. In particular, this research seeks to resolve the following outstanding issues in planetary electricity: (1) Can geometric factors adequately explain the difference between theoretical and observed lightning initiation thresholds? (2) Can modeling help assess the nature (glow, streamer, leader) of atmospheric breakdown occurring in the form of Transient Luminous Events or putative Martian lightning? (3) Can tribocharging lead to the initiation of such non-conventional discharges?<br/><br/>The research plan aims to: <br/>?	produce the formulation of a new, generalized model of electron avalanche initiated from a hot cylindrical or spherical electrode,<br/>?	create a 3-D fractal models of extraterrestrial discharges and estimates of their electric charges and dipole moments,<br/>?	make quantitative measurements of the electrification in a scaled Martian dust event,<br/>?	disseminate of academic research outside academia through Astronomy on Tap talks, and<br/>?	create a summer camp using LEGO Mindstorms to introduce middle-schoolers to programing and space science through an innovative and engaging approach.<br/><br/>The success of this project will directly impact the design of future instruments for the detection of extraterrestrial atmospheric electricity by identifying the most measurable changes due to non-conventional lightning. It will also help to assess the risk of initiating discharges from surface objects in particular in the framework of Martian exploration. It will strengthen the relationship between academic research and the local community, through the 5-day summer camp, public lectures, and talks at informal venues.

The main characteristic that defines turbulent flows is a strong coupling between large-scale structural flow features and fluctuations at extremely small length and time scales. A better understanding of this link across disparate scales is essential for modulating flow characteristics to improve the optimize efficiency of engineering designs and to reduce noise generation. Therefore, the primary aim of this project is to use experiments and computations to leverage novel control and analysis techniques to modulate turbulent flows with the aim of reducing unsteadiness in bluff-body wakes. The project will also provide an invaluable opportunity to promote early enthusiasm for science and engineering among high school students from underrepresented backgrounds, who will be hosted at a week-long engineering summer camp where they will be introduced to various aspects of fluid mechanics that permeate our day-to-day lives.<br/><br/>The proposed research will investigate unsteady interactions between large- and small-scale turbulent coherent structures around a cylindrical bluff body by combining distributed surface actuation with deep-learning techniques. The study will help address fundamental gaps in current knowledge regarding non-linear interactions that regulate the spatiotemporal evolution of coherent structures in separated turbulent flows. Prior attempts at building a general understanding of coherent structure interactions have primarily on linear analysis techniques suitable mostly for canonical, equilibrium flows. The proposed research will also develop a better understanding of the suppression of wake unsteadiness. Deep-learning algorithms will be leveraged both to facilitate the coordinated perturbation of the flow via a distributed array of moving surfaces on the cylindrical body and to extract the localized behavior of dynamically important coherent structures from the non-equilibrium system. The unique combination of unsteady flow forcing, distributed adaptive wall response, and deep-learning based control and analysis will offer a broad perspective on the dynamics of turbulent coherent motions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 1 project will increase the number of published open educational resources (OERs) for a variety of undergraduate online classrooms (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous online classes, hybrid classrooms that combine in-person and online teaching). OERs are educational materials that are available in the public domain. CourseSource publishes peer-reviewed OERs that implement research-based, effective pedagogical techniques. Increasing the number of freely-available online OERs addresses an immediate need by providing lessons and professional development to instructors. It also addresses a long-term need by assembling an extensive set of resources that meet the growing demand for online education. Because CourseSource has built a diverse and large community who uses its materials, this project will directly improve instruction for hundreds of instructors and thousands of undergraduate biology students.<br/><br/>The unifying goal of this project will be to share effective online lessons and help biology instructors implement them to benefit their students. Furthermore, advancing the progress and development of peer-reviewed, pedagogically sound OER materials can benefit the larger academic landscape as it moves towards providing low- or no-cost access to high-quality resources for instructors and students. This project will: 1) Use information from the OERs published in CourseSource to determine how instructors implement active-learning instructional strategies online, 2) Evaluate short- and long-term online professional development programs designed to help instructors find, adapt, implement, and share online lessons, and 3) Explore how OERs can support instructors in using online lessons that include active-learning pedagogies. Since CourseSource publications include a section in which authors delineate their instructional approaches, they can be mined to determine the type and frequency of active-learning practices as well as alignment with instructional design practices, the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, and evidence-based strategies for online instruction. The results will identify strategies that will easily transfer across contexts, situations where instructors need greater support to initiate and maintain these practices in online environments, and ways active-learning can be enhanced by the online format. This project will also create multiple professional development programs for instructors in which they learn to write about and publish their online lessons and implement previously published OERs. These programs will be assessed through surveys and a Social Network Analysis. The results will allow the exploration of whether and how instructor beliefs about online teaching change, and if professional development programs can create and sustain instructor support networks. Finally, interviews with instructors who are implementing OERs in their classroom will be used to determine how the availability of instructional materials influences instructor pedagogical decisions.

Humans frequently take for granted and exploit these ecosystem services without fully understanding the ecological feedbacks, linkages, and interdependencies of these processes to the wider ecosystem. As demands on coastal ecosystem services have risen, marshes have experienced substantial loss due to direct and indirect impacts from human activity. The rapidly changing coastal ecosystems of Louisiana provide a natural experiment for understanding how coastal change alters ecosystem function. This project is developing new metrics and tools to assess food web variability and test hypotheses on biodiversity and ecosystem function in coastal Louisiana.  The research is determining how changing habitat configuration alters the distribution of energy across the seascape in a multitrophic system. This work is engaging students from the University of Louisiana Lafayette and Dillard University in placed-based learning by immersing them in the research and local restoration efforts to address land loss and preserve critical ecosystem services. Students are developing a deeper understanding of the complex issues facing coastal regions through formal course work, directed field work, and outreach. Students are interacting with stakeholders and managers who are currently battling coastal change. Their directed research projects are documenting changes in coastal habitat and coupling this knowledge with the consequences to ecosystems and the people who depend on them. By participating in the project students are emerging with knowledge and training that is making them into informed citizens and capable stewards of the future of our coastal ecosystems, while also preparing them for careers in STEM. The project is supporting two graduate students and a post-doc.<br/><br/>The transformation and movement of energy through a food web are key links between biodiversity and ecosystem function. A major hurdle to testing biodiversity ecosystem function theory is a limited ability to assess food web variability in space and time. This research is quantifying changing seascape structure, species diversity, and food web structure to better understand the relationship between biodiversity and energy flow through ecosystems. The project uses cutting edge tools and metrics to test hypotheses on how the distribution, abundance, and diversity of key species are altered by ecosystem change and how this affects function. The hypotheses driving the research are: 1) habitat is a more important indirect driver of trophic structure than a direct change to primary trophic pathways; and 2) horizontal and vertical diversity increases with habitat resource index. Stable isotope analysis is characterizing energy flow through the food web. Changes in horizontal and vertical diversity in a multitrophic system are being quantified using aerial surveys and field sampling. To assess the spatial and temporal change in food web resources, the project is combining results from stable isotope analysis and drone-based remote sensing technology to generate consumer specific energetic seascape maps (E-scapes) and trophic niche metrics. In combination these new metrics are providing insight into species? responses to changing food web function across the seascape and through time.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Biological Oceanography and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large-scale industrial agriculture has led to significant socio-economic gains, but at environmental costs (soil erosion, nutrient pollution, and aquatic acidification) in this region. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices have been proposed as solutions to these costs, as they not only increase crop yield, but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and sustain soil and water quality. However, the effectiveness of CSA practices varies under diverse climate and land use conditions and involves tightly coupled carbon, water, and nutrient cycles. These interactions have not been well studied, and this knowledge gap has hindered understanding and efficient application of CSA practices to achieve the benefits of enhancing food production, climate mitigation, and environmental sustainability. The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated ecosystem monitoring, modeling, and machine learning framework (EcoM3) that incorporates field observations, satellite remote sensing data, process-based modeling, and a deep-learning approach to systematically investigate specific effects of CSA practice (no-tillage and cover crops) on key agroecosystem indicators (crop yield, soil carbon storage, greenhouse gases, and carbon/nitrogen leaching) at multiple scales. This project will use a long-term field site in Kentucky (continuous observations over 50 years) as one testing site to investigate CSA practice effects from daily to seasonal, annual, decadal scales; examine varied CSA effects at multiple sites with diverse climate and soil conditions across the Mississippi River basin; and predict the potential impacts of CSA practices at the entire river basin scale. Multi-scale data and model results will be integrated into the learning platform of the EcoM3 framework to communicate temporal and spatial CSA effectiveness with diverse stakeholders and policy-makers.<br/><br/>This study addresses a challenging question: Will an enhanced systems approach advance our understanding of the interconnected relationships among agroecosystems, climate, and environment systems sufficiently to allow us to simultaneously manage multiple goals (food security, carbon sequestration, and environmental sustainability)? This study represents a systematic method to investigate the comprehensive effects of CSA practices in agricultural systems at both site and regional scales under heterogeneous climate and soil conditions. The proposed EcoM3 framework incorporates CSA management that is targeted to advance conceptual and operational understanding of interactions and feedback loops among climate, land use/management, and ecosystems. Products derived from this study will improve the mechanistic representation of the agroecosystem in Environmental System Models toward a more accurate prediction of biogeochemical cycles and future climate change and will provide viable recommendations for farmers and a scientific basis for making evidence-informed policy about building sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture. Research findings will be communicated with farmers through local extension meetings and the Multi-state Farmer Summit (representatives across regions in Mississippi River basin). Project products will enhance awareness about the importance of CSA management in building climate-resilient agroecosystems and preserving soil and water health. Multi-scale datasets will be made publicly available for research and education.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each student will work closely with one of the participating faculty mentors who have been carefully selected for their research accomplishments and successful mentoring records with undergraduate researchers. This hands-on research experience also includes a variety of activities (seminars, mini-courses on ethics and writing, and energy-related field trips) to educate and train students for their future careers as scientists.<br/><br/>The higher education system in Wyoming is comprised of a single 4-year/graduate level university along with seven community colleges. This REU site emphasizes serving students and faculty from regional CCs to positively impact students and science in WY and surrounding states. This program will engage first and second-year undergraduates, who are early in their college career, and expose them to graduate level chemistry research. The wide range of projects offered includes the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticule-based catalysts; site-selective photochemical protein modification; and the chemistry of molecular hydrogen quantum crystals. On this latter project, it is worthy of note that cryogenic solid molecular hydrogen is a unique condensed phase environment due to a variety of quantum mechanical effects such as large amplitude translational zero point motion of the individual H molecules and the presence of ortho and para nuclear spin manifolds.  A variety of non-classical dynamics occur within such crystals at liquid helium temperatures.

Metal nanoclusters have the potential to revolutionize solar energy technologies by harnessing light to produce chemical fuels because they support plasmons, which are collective oscillations of the electrons that enable the nanoclusters to strongly absorb light. Understanding, controlling, and manipulating the plasmon properties is key to improving the efficiency of solar energy storage. Dr. Gieseking and her research group are developing accurate models with low computational costs to understand the decay processes after metal nanoclusters absorb light. They are using these models to understand how these decay processes change as a function of nanocluster size, shape, and composition to design metal nanoclusters with controllable decay time scales for efficient solar energy storage. Dr. Gieseking is also developing new computational chemistry laboratory exercises throughout the chemistry curriculum to introduce undergraduates to the field and deepen their understanding of important chemical properties. Beyond her research contribution, Dr. Gieseking is engaged in promoting the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in chemistry through recruiting research students, mentoring through ChemWMN (Chemistry Women Mentoring Network), and participating in Brandeis?s outreach to local schools.<br/><br/>Dr. Rebecca Gieseking and her research group are developing nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) models based on semi-empirical methods to understand the photoexcited dynamics of metal nanoclusters (NCs). Atomically precise noble metal NCs are strong absorbers that can be tuned by changing the NC size and shape, and the excited-state dynamics vary from excitonic (indicating discrete excited states) to plasmonic (reflecting a near-continuum of states). Dr. Gieseking is parametrizing semi-empirical quantum mechanical (SEQM) methods in an effort to accurately reproduce the excited-state potential energy surfaces of Ag and Au NCs and  utilizing NAMD codes for surface-hopping simulations of the dynamics. This project aims to advance the state of knowledge in plasmon-enhanced hot-electron chemistry by (i) providing a novel low-cost computational model for the atomistic excited-state dynamics of noble metal NCs and (ii) revealing structure-property relationships that affect the excited-state dynamics, which can be used to tailor NCs for applications in photocatalysis and other solar energy technologies. These methods aim to provide fundamental insight into the transition from excitonic to plasmonic behavior and refine existing quantum mechanical definitions of plasmons by using dynamics. If successful, these studies will make important strides toward the vision of using SEQM methods to harness plasmonic hot electrons for photocatalysis of industrially important reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these early days of K-12 AI education, little is known about how diverse student populations relate to AI and which instructional strategies are most likely to engage them. Since most K-12 teachers are not yet familiar with AI, research is also needed on how to develop their AI fluency and confidence. This project, a collaboration between researchers in AI and education and the Georgia Department of Education, will investigate these questions by developing and testing a nine-week elective course for Georgia middle school students called Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence, and an accompanying online teacher professional development course. The student course will offer a mixture of activities including hands-on demonstrations, guided experimentation, online research, project-based learning, and exploration of AI-enabled careers. Teachers will also have the option of including computer programming activities. To ensure that the curriculum is adaptable to the needs of different populations and cultures, researchers will partner with school districts serving three ethnically and geographically diverse populations in Georgia: rural, suburban, and urban areas, and with large populations of white, Latinx, or Black students respectively. Both courses will be developed in collaboration with a team of middle school teachers from these districts who will first receive training from the investigators in the basics of AI and in culturally responsive teaching. Working with these teachers as they pilot the course will provide an understanding of the challenges in teaching/learning the content and the types of support needed for diverse teachers and learners to succeed. The project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>Over the three year project duration, 18 teachers drawn from 6 school districts will receive training in AI and culturally responsive instruction, and 1800 students will take the Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence course. The project will investigate four research questions: (1) What are middle school students' and teachers' knowledge of, interest in, comfort with, and attitudes towards AI technology and AI careers? (2) What types of technology-driven and innovative learning experiences are effective in increasing rural, Black, and Latinx/Hispanic middle school students' AI interest, knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and interest in AI careers? (3) What AI knowledge and skills are developmentally appropriate for middle school students? and (4) What institutional or cultural barriers/accelerators prevent/promote course implementation? The research will use a mixed-methods design combining attitudinal surveys, in-class observations, subject interviews, student reflections, and examination of student artifacts. At the conclusion of the project, the professional development course will be made publicly available through the Georgia Department of Education web portal. Additional project deliverables include the middle school course materials, AI demonstration software developed to support the middle school course, the research findings, and measurements of the effectiveness of the curriculum for diverse learner populations when implemented by middle school teachers in their classrooms. The results will also be disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly publications, and social media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a critical need to understand the myriad of mental health disorders and implement public health interventions at multiple levels. This study examines mental health across contexts using a geographic lens to describe a complex set of interacting factors that produce adverse outcomes.  More specifically, this project will address the following research questions: (1) What are the spatial and temporal patterns of mental health outcomes (e.g., suicide, self-harm, depression, anxiety, etc.)? (2) What are the underlying contextual factors (e.g., community-level poverty, racial segregation) and compositional (e.g., gender, age, veteran status, lethal means) that influence these outcomes? (3) What are external stressors (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters) that lead to increased mental health outcomes?

The observed electronic recoil (ER) excess is the first result of this type produced by the liquid-xenon community. The award will improve the energy resolution and its robustness by leveraging the group's reconstruction work to capture the microphysical details and by exploiting their machine-learning R&D activities.

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This summer internship program aims to educate undergraduate students by giving them first-hand experience in how psychological research is conducted and help them develop professional skills in science. Developmental science is a field of psychology concerned with the development of children who are facing a dynamically changing reality while teachers, parents, and policy makers are experiencing heightened demand for making rapid decisions affecting children world-wide. To support them, developmental science advances evidence-based theory and practice of promoting child development and well-being. Therefore, it is critical for individuals of many professions to gain the skill-sets for using and interpreting scientific findings through active participation in state-of-the-art developmental science research. To help with these educational goals, each year 7 undergraduate interns will participate in a 10-week summer internship program that includes (1) hands-on research-participation in active empirical research projects, directly supervised by faculty with a strong track-record of involving undergraduates in their research, (2) teaching modules to offer training in advanced behavioral and neuroscience methods and develop programming skills for using state-of-the-art statistics software, and (3) professional development training to tutor academic writing, science communication to the public, and how to write strong graduate school applications for a career in science. Recruitment is focused on a diverse group of undergraduates, including those from smaller universities and colleges that do not have the opportunity to be involved in active psychological research at their home institutions. Therefore, priority is given to under-represented minority students and first-generation college students through several recruitment mechanisms with organizations and databases that reach these target populations. <br/><br/>By working collaboratively with faculty members and graduate students at the University of Michigan, summer interns become actively involved in pursuing specific projects in developmental science focused on the cognitive development of young children. The interns collect and analyze scientific data as part of behavioral and neuroscience studies. They learn how to write and present scientific research, including academic writing and statistical data analysis, as well as poster presentations at the Department of Psychology and scientific conferences. Moreover, through collaborations with local museums in Ann Arbor, Michigan, interns will learn about science communication with the greater public. The broader impact of this is to break down boundaries and strengthen their resolve in becoming scientists themselves. In addition to their primary research project, interns participate in weekly meetings and formal training sessions introducing them to core tenets of developmental science and career paths in the discipline. Professional training modules, a mentoring agreement, assessment tools for the interns? short-term and long-term professional goals, and an alumni network to help with further career steps all aim to promote diversity and inclusion not only in recruitment, but in fostering long-term success of the interns of this REU site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new catalysts are engineered to provide more energy-efficient reaction conditions than traditional approaches. Professor Conley and his research team are invested in developing specialized high surface area materials that can react with metal reagents to form surface-supported metal sites with understandable structures and tunable catalytic activity. This flexible system will be employed to investigate a variety of important processes to generate commodity and specialty chemicals that are important to everyday life. Dr. Conley will be involving students from a Moreno Valley high school in this research program to help foster interest in STEM disciplines and encourage interest in STEM career paths. <br/><br/>Single atom catalysts (SACs) provide a more atom-efficient strategy for heterogeneous catalysis than noble metal nanoparticles where only surface atoms are exposed to reagents. The generation of SACs involves the dispersion of very small quantities of noble metal atoms onto a redox active oxide support. Dr. Conley and his research team are developing a new approach to preparing single cation site catalysts (SCSs) and studying the catalytic reactivity of these new materials towards transformations that are important to both the fine and commodity chemical industries. The team will be using this synthetic technology to access high surface area oxides that support very strong silylium Lewis acids as precursors for the targeted SCSs. The silylium-coated oxides will be treated with metal-halide bonds in organometallic complexes to form single cation sites (SCSs) in well-defined coordination environments. This methodology is being used to install single transition metal cations uniformly dispersed on oxide surfaces doped with weakly coordinating anions and is complementary to known methods that generate SACs. Because this approach to generating SCSs can be paired with a variety of organometallic reagents, the Conley group is investigating a range of catalytic activity supported by these materials including olefin polymerization, hydroamination, and hydrosilylation chemistry, as well as the partial oxidation of methane. These efforts to develop SCSs for heterogeneous catalysis also will serve as a strong training environment for a diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Terrestrial limbless locomotion, despite being used by almost 20% of terrestrial vertebrates, remains understudied. In lateral undulation, the most widespread and common mode of limbless locomotion, waves of bending pass down the body, pressing against structures in the environment (e.g. plants, rocks) to propel the snake forward. Lateral undulation poses several simultaneous challenges, including meeting mechanical power demands, overcoming the force of friction, and controlling forces at multiple, constantly shifting contact points. These demands may conflict; for example, the body posture that generates the most effective propulsive force from a contact point might reduce muscular force or power output. This project addresses how snakes handle this conflict and investigates whether mechanisms exist to mitigate or avoid potential tradeoffs, by testing animals in environments that impose different mechanical and control demands. This research will provide general insights into how animals manage competing demands during locomotion, particularly the need to simultaneously meet mechanical and control demands. Understanding limbless locomotion can also benefit snake-inspired robots, a target of bio-inspired robotics due to the exceptional ability of snakes to move through complex, cluttered, and confined spaces. In partnership with the University of Akron field station, the project also provides a unique outreach opportunity in bio-inspired robotics to nearby high schools serving economically disadvantaged youth, by leveraging a new type of feedback-based robotic programming based on stop-motion animation to eliminate the need for students to learn how to write code.<br/><br/>A central challenge of biomechanics is understanding how the physiological properties of muscle influence the movements of animals, often examined in specialized systems adapted to maximize a particular metric (e.g., power or cycle frequency). However, most animals must meet numerous independent mechanical and control demands simultaneously and can modulate their movements in a wide variety of ways to accomplish this. This project uses terrestrial lateral undulation in snakes as a model system to understand how animals meet these demands, particularly when the demands conflict. The friction-dominated mechanics of terrestrial limbless locomotion impose straightforward demands on mechanical force and power output, which will be directly measured from instrumented test arenas. The highly variable patterns of midline bending in snake locomotion suggest correspondingly variable muscle strain trajectories, which will be measured via fluoromicrometry. The multiple propulsive reaction forces depend upon local posture at each contact location. If both muscle mechanical output and control are determined by body kinematics, there is potential for conflict between these goals: control of reaction force orientation may compromise muscle mechanical outputs, and vice versa. This project involves a novel outreach program using a combination of live-animal demonstrations and robotics to provide students with a bio-inspired robotics design experience in which they observe a snake?s movements, hypothesize mechanisms, and test those mechanisms using snake-inspired robots. Two post-doctoral fellows and a graduate student will contribute to the research, thereby benefitting from interdisciplinary training and mentoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also make mistakes in placing virtual objects within the real world, making them appear as shifting, oscillating, or jumping around. This project will address such environmental awareness limitations by taking advantage of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and controllers located in the vicinity of mobile augmented reality devices. Many IoT devices, such as smart lights, cameras, and displays, are already pervasive in smart homes, offices, and other environments. This project will improve mobile augmented reality environmental awareness by using these IoT devices as sources of additional information about the real world, and as means for partially controlling the state of the world. The project will make mobile augmented reality more reliable, paving way for its applications in health-critical and safety-critical domains, such as medicine and transportation. The project will develop multi-disciplinary research skills in a diverse cohort of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The findings of this project will be showcased as interactive demonstrations at K-12-oriented events, with the particular aim of attracting women and underrepresented minorities to science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will lay the foundations for studies of IoT-supported mobile augmented reality by developing techniques for designing, implementing, and evaluating it, and by demonstrating IoT-supported methods that improve the performance of core mobile augmented reality algorithms.

In particular, biomaterials that enable perfusion, the transport of oxygen, nutrients, and other life-sustaining components, is critically lacking. The need for perfusable structures is perhaps best demonstrated through blood vessel networks, which are required to deliver oxygen and nutrients to living tissue. Perfusable structures are critically important for many other tissues throughout the body including the lymphatic system, airways, and the gastrointestinal tract. To achieve the next generation of printed tissue, this project will develop a family of biomaterials that enable a new biofabrication strategy termed Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing (GUIDE-3DP). The GUIDE-3DP materials will allow rapid fabrication of perfusable networks of interconnected channels with precise control over their shapes and sizes. In Aim 1, fluid-perfusable structures with complex branch points, such as mimics of branched blood vessels will be printed. In Aim 2, materials for gas-perfusable structures will be developed. As a case study, a human intestinal tissue will be printed and evaluated for the transport of oxygen through the printed living material. In Aim 3, materials that enable fabrication of continuous vessels with precise variation of the internal diameters will be developed. As case studies, printed models of (1) vascular stenosis (in which a region of the blood vessel is constricted) and (2) the large intestine (which has a repetitive, pouch-like structure) will be printed. These biomaterials will enable the future fabrication of living tissue mimics for a variety of applications that advance, biomaterials, biotechnology, national health and will further position the US to have global leadership in the emerging field of biomanufacturing. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/><br/>Perfusion, and specifically perfusion-enabling biomaterials, remains one of the most critical challenges in the formation of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures, whether for the purposes of tissue engineering, in vitro models of organ development and disease, or fundamental studies of cell behavior. The challenge of fabricating channels with specified geometry are important for multiple tissues throughout the body, including blood vessels, lymphatics, airways, and the gastrointestinal tract. To address this challenge, this project will develop a family of biomaterials that enable a new biofabrication strategy termed Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing (GUIDE-3DP). Embedded 3D printing involves the fabrication of desired structures within a support material, reducing deformation and buckling due to gravity and enabling the printing of complex structures. The GUIDE-3DP method builds upon this approach by developing an interfacial diffusant strategy to rapidly fabricate perfusable networks of interconnected channels with precise control over the branching geometry and vessel diameters. In Aim 1, fluid-perfusable structures with complex branch points are fabricated. As a biological case study, endothelial cell morphology and phenotype in the bioprinted branch structures will be characterized, with a focus on how matrix mechanics alters cellular response to fluid shear stress. In Aim 2, gas-perfusable structures for controlled oxygen concentration will be fabricated. As a case study, a 3D human intestinal organoid culture model will be printed and evaluated for the role of oxygenation in regulating intestinal stem cell fate. In Aim 3, continuous vessels with precise variation of luminal diameters will be fabricated, as this geometry commonly occurs in many structures in vivo.

Salt water is ubiquitous on earth, and it plays important roles in many physiological and biological processes, such as signal transduction in living cells as well as protein solubility and folding. The precise picture of how water molecules arrange themselves and move around salt ions is prerequisite to understanding the properties of salt water. This requires a quantum mechanical modeling for both the electrons and nuclei of water and salt molecules. However, due to the high computational cost, current computational studies can only model salt water in small simulation boxes for short time periods, which makes it difficult to extract accurate information about the long-range effects of salt molecules on the molecular and electronic structures of water. <br/><br/>This project seeks to build theoretical tools and a computational framework to solve this problem by using machine learning methods. Utilizing computationally intensive calculations for only a few configurations of salt water, the PI and his team will build efficient deep learning models that can model salt water in simulation boxes containing thousands of water molecules for long time scales. The resulting deep learning models will not only be computationally efficient, but they will also be able to yield accurate predictions with comparable accuracy to advanced, fully quantum mechanical calculations.

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory provide an ideal framework to study salt water from first principles. However, accurate predictions of salt water properties require a high-level functional approximation, and nuclear quantum effect should be taken into account due to the small mass of the proton. Accordingly, accurate first-principles calculations of salt water are computationally very expensive and cannot be applied to study the long-range effect of hydrated ions on the water structure. <br/><br/>This PI and his team will overcome these computational challenges by combined deep learning techniques and advanced density functional theory calculations. Efficient deep molecular dynamics models of salt solutions will be built on Feynman path integral ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on the hybrid meta-GGA SCAN0 density functional. Using deep learning models, molecular dynamics simulations of salt water can be performed in a simulation box containing thousands of water molecules at the nanosecond time scale, with a level of accuracy comparable to direct density functional theory calculations. With this powerful approach, the converged thermodynamic properties such as diffusivities and molecular structure in salt water can be accurately predicted and studied. Using the molecular trajectories of salt water, the electronic properties will also be modeled by deep learning techniques and compared to available experimental results.<br/><br/>The participating postdocs and graduate students will carry out cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research based on advanced ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning techniques in the fields of condensed matter theory and quantum chemistry.

For example, adults who are deaf or hard-of-hearing (deaf/hh) often experience frustration and struggle with comprehending technical content when attending traditional professional development supported by sign language interpreters. These learners reported difficulties with the pace of instruction and communication with their instructors and peers. Out of class situations, such as breaks or lunch time, were described as awkward because they needed an interpreter to socialize. This indirect communication environment often left these learners feeling isolated, like ?second class citizens,? and questioning their own competence and ability to learn technical content. There are extremely limited opportunities for technical professional development for deaf adults that are delivered by experienced instructors using American Sign Language (ASL). The goal of this project is to provide professional development that will improve the employment of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community as Information Technology support technicians. This project will be carried out by a partnership that includes CompTIA, the world?s leading provider of vendor-neutral IT certifications and the DeafTEC Resource Center, housed at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) within the Rochester Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>This professional development, referred to as the DeafTEC Ready program, will be offered in a direct communication environment in which all instructors and learners know ASL, allowing everyone to communicate freely. By participating in the DeafTEC Ready program, learners who are deaf/hh will learn technical skills such as repairing and maintaining computer equipment, networks, and operating systems, as well as key workplace skills such as professional communication and problem solving. After completing their training, the learners will sit for CompTIA A+ certification exams, the industry standard for launching a career in IT. Upon successful certification, these individuals will receive direct job placement assistance from CompTIA?s career services staff. Certified individuals will also receive credit for three courses in NTID?s Applied Computer Technology associate degree programs.  These courses can be used toward an associate degree at NTID or at other colleges across the country that accept the credit. The project will help meet industry?s need for computer support technicians and for a more diverse workforce by increasing participation of deaf/hh individuals in highly skilled technician careers.  This increased participation can also increase acceptance of deaf/hh individuals within these workplaces and beyond. The project will increase access to CompTIA training materials and exams by reducing language barriers that will not only help deaf/hh test-takers but other English language learners.  Thus, the project can help people from different communities obtain CompTIA A+ certification and enter the IT workforce. The DeafTEC Ready program will also help employers develop the sensitivity and skills to create an inclusive workplace where not only deaf/hh employees but all employees can succeed. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation?s economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, generic models of synchronous machines for power grid dynamic analysis are well developed and indispensable for power grid dynamic analysis. The current power grid is going through a significant transition. Penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR), e.g., wind, solar, and batteries, is going up. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration?s hourly electric grid monitor shows that on May 2, 2020, 59% of power was generated by wind energy in Electric Reliability Council of Texas.<br/> <br/>IBRs significantly change grid dynamic characteristics. Unprecedented dynamic phenomena appeared in power grids. Examples include subsynchronous oscillations that occurred in 2009 and 2017 in Texas wind farms, low-frequency oscillations in an offshore wind farm that caused Great Britain power disruption on 9 August 9 2019, subcycle overvoltage dynamics which triggered large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) tripping in California in 2017 and 2018, and instantaneous ac overcurrent dynamics which caused another large-scale PV tripping event in California in July 2020. <br/><br/>High penetration of IBRs leads to a significant change in the modeling practice of the bulk power system industry. It is expected that generic models with standard structures will be used for grid dynamic evaluation as a future trend. On the other hand, models provided by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are black boxes. Real-code models provided by OEMs are usually in dynamic-linked library format with input and output specified while internal details not released. Though these real-code models have been benchmarked by hardware experiments, detailed structures and parameters are unknown. Thus, there is an urgent need: How to find the generic model?s parameters based on what we have, which are essentially black boxes?<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to address the urgent need to design a gray-box model identification framework for IBRs. This project makes two significant innovations, including (i) first principle based IBR gray-box model structure design and linear time invariant model derivation; and (ii) measurement-based IBR model structure parameter estimation relying on black-box model identification and advanced computing algorithms. The notable innovation is the integration of the two core technologies from two different fields: Power Electronics and System Identification.  The two core technologies are: admittance-based black-box model measurement and identification and gray-box model identification through optimization problem formulation and solving. The project employs both computer simulation and hardware experiments for validation. <br/><br/>This project tackles real-world IBR modeling challenges and can generate significant impact to the current power grid industry. The tackled problem falls into the category of gray-box model identification and this research will also generate reference values to many other domains (e.g., automotive systems and airplane systems) that use gray-box model identification approaches for model building and control design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such decisions affect the health, safety, and prosperity of US citizens and the freight transportation industry.  Since the inception of nationwide shipment surveys in the 1990s, little has changed in how public agencies collect commodity flow data, despite the increasing complexity of freight operations and supply chains. With the 2017 federal mandates for electronic logbooks and widespread use of Global Positioning Systems, there is tremendous potential to reimagine how freight data is collected. The research objective of this grant is to derive unbiased spatial and temporally-continuous commodity and industry information from passively collected, anonymized freight movement data (specifically for truck and waterborne freight). The work will enable researchers and practitioners to advance 20-40 year forecast models of freight movement, as well as formulate solutions to critical industry issues such as driver shortages, Hours-of-Service regulations, and lack of safe and available parking. Additionally, diversity in the transportation workforce is critical for ensuring that investment and infrastructure decisions reflect the unique needs of diverse travelers. An innovative service-learning education plan is integrated into the project to improve job attraction and retention rates of female transportation professionals and students.<br/><br/>This research will yield positive societal impacts by enabling transportation agencies to leverage increasingly available samples of passively collected freight movement data for timely, unbiased decision-making regarding infrastructure investment, environmental policy, and economic development. The research will: 1) determine the extent to which activity patterns derived from passively collected mobile sensor data accurately predict commodity carried; 2) identify the extent to which vehicle body characteristics derived from roadway traffic sensors predict commodity carried; 3) establish and validate bias detection and quality measures for passively collected freight movement data. The project will promote women?s initial engagement and ongoing career satisfaction to help close the gender gap and ensure that diverse perspectives are routinely included in transportation planning processes.

In this way, NDT can be used to ensure the functionality of objects across their period of service. The NDT industry is expected to grow substantially over the next few years, driving an increasing industry demand for technicians with the knowledge and skills needed to perform NDT.  A need for more NDT technicians already exists within Northeast Florida?s aviation manufacturing industry.  However, local college education programs are not available to help meet this need. This project aims to establish a new career pathway in NDT for students and incumbent workers.  It will do so by developing a new NDT certificate program within the current Aviation Maintenance Technology associate degree program at Florida State College at Jacksonville.   To support the certificate program, the project will create a new NDT learning lab equipped with training equipment so that students can learn how to use different types of NDT methods. A set of NDT lab exercises will be developed for outreach activities, such as high school visits and summer camps, designed to increase the number of students in the certificate program.  These outreach efforts will focus on reaching students from communities that are underrepresented in the aviation maintenance workforce. The project is expected to provide the aviation industry with workforce-ready technicians while broadening participation in the technical workforce.<br/><br/>Based on recommendations from aviation industry partners, the college will develop a program to prepare students for American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) NDT Level I certification.  It will develop the NDT program with guidance from a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) that includes members from the aviation industry and academic institutions.  The project anticipates developing a set of five courses covering the common NDT techniques of magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, electromagnetic, ultrasonic, and visual inspection. The courses will use an inquiry-based learning model based on the 5E learning cycle, Engage, Explore, Explain, Evaluate, and Extend. A new NDT learning lab will serve as an educational training center for faculty and students and will include NDT equipment needed for inspection techniques covered in the ASNT Level I certification. Outreach activities will be conducted at participating high schools to introduce students to NDT technology, to describe career opportunities available in aviation technology, and to share profiles of high school and college students from diverse populations who are employed in the aviation technology industry.

However, overwhelming evidence suggests that most animal-pollinated crops are pollination limited in the US. The research component of this proposal will provide data on the ways that crop domestication results in changes in plant-pollinator interactions that may be linked to suboptimal pollination. Specifically, this project will combine experimental evolution, electrophysiology, genomics, and analyses of past evolution to understand how human-mediated selection affected traits of flowers, pollinator foraging preferences, and pollinator sensory systems. The education component of this project will (1) enhance research opportunities for undergraduate students, (2) offer a graduate course that facilitates an understanding and active engagement of students, and (3) create opportunities to engage the public in community science projects that build science literacy. <br/><br/>Artificial selection is the main evolutionary force shaping phenotypes and fitness of domesticated species. Despite the range expansion and dominance of domesticated plants and animals across the globe, the mechanisms by which human-mediated selection shapes, via its effects on plant traits, the ecological interactions and reciprocal evolutionary changes of wild species have not been systematically investigated. This project addresses fundamental questions about the direct and indirect role of artificial selection on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-pollinator systems in agricultural niches. Using the plant genus Cucurbita and their specialized pollinators, this project has three specific aims: (1) characterize the role of reciprocal artificial and pollinator-mediated selection on the evolution of floral functional traits through comparative phylogenetics and experimental evolution, (2) determine how shifts in floral signaling of domesticated plants drive changes in pollinator foraging behavior using geographically replicated field choice experiments, and (3) investigate the genetic underpinnings of changes in pollinator sensory systems that result from foraging on domesticated plants by integrating electrophysiology experiments with functional genomics. The education component of this project will provide research opportunities for students to engage in convergent research themes that can be applied to solutions to real-life problems of pollinators in agricultural systems. This project will also include the participation of the public to expand the geographic sampling and data collection for the above research aims. The integration of the proposed research and education activities will generate the foundation for the understanding of how selection influences the evolution of plants, pollinators, and their interactions while developing a framework to engage and retain students and engage the general public in scientific activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electronic performance of these materials is very sensitive to changes in how crystalline they are, and how organized the crystals are; however, there are currently only limited and general strategies to control this crystal organization. To develop new strategies for building this control, researchers at the University of Washington (UW) will produce a series of polymers with a highly controlled chemical structure that is specifically tuned to improve the crystal quality. These polymers will also help to build understanding of the connection between chemical structure and crystal quality, making it easier to predict and design better polymers in the future. Because of the importance of clean energy and interest in the community, this work will be broadly communicated in a number of different places. One major pathway will be through sharing the research lab?s work by demonstrating stretchable solar cells during visitations to classrooms, as well as participating in larger science events such as science and maker fairs, through the UW Materials Ambassadors program. The PI will also work with the UW College of Engineering Math Academy, working with underserved members of the community by providing opportunities for them to participate in research lab work before even graduating from high school. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Paracrystallinity in conjugated polymer backbones represents a critical limitation for conjugated polymer electronic conductivity, and current strategies to improve this parameter are currently extremely limited. To address this, researchers at the University of Washington seek to develop a new polymer backbone architecture, using an alternating pattern of polar and nonpolar side chains to improve polymer backbone paracrystallinity. Specifically, this work proposes to use the self-segregation of polar and nonpolar side chains to produce a polymer with high side-chain crystallinity. This polymer will then be processed using a variety of solvent and thermal processing conditions, to control the extent of side chain crystallinity. The effect on backbone paracrystallinity will be measured and correlated with the processing conditions and side-chain crystallinity. This correlation will build understanding of the interconnection between crystallizable side chains and the backbone paracrystallinity, and offer insight into the strategy of using side chain organization as a tool for improving the backbone paracrystallinity. The work will begin with polythiophene backbones but will be expanded to include fused rings and donor-acceptor copolymers. By delving into not just the side-chain self-segregation, but also the connection between processing conditions, side-chain crystallinity, and paracrystallinity, this research will provide a strategy to improving the performance of conjugated polymers. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, agencies cannot perform repairs of shallow slope failures due to limited budgets, which often leads to more expensive deep-seated failures. On the other hand, a slope showing early signs of failure, such as cracks, could be repaired and strengthened using low-cost, environment-friendly deep-rooted vetiver grass. This study will transform the slope repair paradigm from reactive to proactive enhancing safety and resiliency of infrastructure through a bio-inspired, sustainable approach. The project will be carried out at Jackson State University (JSU), one of the nation's leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), creating numerous opportunities for African American students to participate in research and explore careers in engineering. High school teachers and students will be involved in the project through a summer research program and workshops. Online educational resources and live events on social media will reach out to greater audiences around the country.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand the vetiver grass root-soil interaction as a bio-inspired and climate-resilient solution to stabilize shallow slope failures in expansive soils. The project investigates (i) interactions of the deep-rooted grass with highly plastic clay at the micro and macro levels to resist cracking behavior; (ii) the role of the deep-rooted grass in the soil water balance and enhancing matric suction during infiltration and evapotranspiration; and (iii) the strength of the grass root-soil system. Model tests and field studies will be performed under different rainfall conditions to investigate the water balance within a slope covered with deep-rooted vetiver grass. The understanding from the model tests and field studies will be extended through numerical analyses to evaluate the coupled action of vetiver grass as reinforcement and vertical path for evapo-transpiration under different rainfall and weather conditions. All the collected data will be analyzed in an Artificial Intelligence-based Deep Learning Platform to develop the next-generation climate-adaptive slope repair model, which will connect weather stressors, soil data, field monitoring data, and strength properties of vetiver grass.

Knee joint pain affects approximately 25 percent of adults, resulting in limited mobility and impaired life quality. Knee pain is often caused by the degeneration of two joint tissues, articular cartilage and meniscus. This degradation can be the result of disease and/or injury. Articular cartilage covers the ends of bones. Mechanically speaking, articular cartilage provides compressive load bearing and energy dissipation in the knee. The meniscus, another knee structure, increases join stability. Despite decades of efforts, there has been limited success in the regeneration of cartilage and meniscus. One major obstacle is that we do not understand how the two tissues are formed during embryonic development. This work will combine novel nanotechnology, microdissection and gene expression tools, to project will study the development of these two tissues from gestation to newborn ages in mouse knees. Outcomes will provide new insights about the initial molecular events that give rise to these two tissues. This will establish a new engineering benchmarks that can be used in regenerative medicine efforts to restore cartilage and meniscus biomechanical functions. Education and outreach activities will be integrated with the research goal to give trainees a better understanding of biomechanics. These activities will include senior design projects, science workshops, museum exhibitions and YouTube crash courses.<br/><br/>Articular cartilage and meniscus have distinct extracellular matrices (ECMs). Cartilage ECM is mainly composed of type II collagen fibrils and proteoglycans, while meniscus ECM is dominated by circumferential type I collagen fibers. Preliminary data show that at the embryonic stage, the primitive matrices of both tissues show ubiquitous presence of type VI collagen and perlecan, the biomarkers of pericellular matrix (PCM). This work will thus test the hypothesis that the embryonic primitive matrix resembles the PCM of mature tissues, and elucidate the roles of this PCM-like primitive matrix in cell mechanobiology and matrix development. This work will 1) identify the critical time point, at which the primitive matrix separates into the PCM and bulk of ECM, 2) elucidate the biomechanical evolvement of the primitive matrix via atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanomechanical tests, and 3) determine the contribution of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in the primitive matrix biomechanics and cell mechanotransduction. Studying cartilage and meniscus together, this work will identify the common and differentiated molecular events that contribute to the formation of the two tissues. In conclusion, this project will generate new knowledge on the molecular, structural and mechanical events during the initial formation of cartilage and meniscus, providing a new basis for guiding tissue regeneration and disease intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology can replace the need for expensive hardware used in hands-on training.  However, virtual reality applications are also expensive, creating a barrier to adoption by community and technical colleges. The potential impact of virtual reality on student learning in advanced manufacturing technician programs is noteworthy, given the wide variety of devices and information that technicians need to understand to perform their tasks. This project will develop, implement, and assess a low-cost platform for developing virtual reality modules that can be adopted and customized by community colleges, including those with limited resources. By removing the barrier to the widespread use of virtual reality in technician education, this project aims to improve student learning in technical education programs. The project intends to create a network of more than 30 community and technical colleges that will be capable of creating, collaborating on, and sharing effective and customizable low-cost virtual reality educational materials for advanced manufacturing technicians.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve student learning by increasing the accessibility of virtual reality training applications for students in advanced manufacturing technician programs. To test the effectiveness of the platform, the project will develop four virtual reality modules on blueprint reading, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, basic work area safety, and quality control. The effectiveness of the modules in improving student learning will be assessed using pre- and post-tests for incumbent manufacturing technicians and student technicians. The project team will then train faculty to develop and implement their own customized modules and contribute to an online library of all the resulting virtual reality modules. As a result of this project, a consortium of community and technical college educators will be trained to use the virtual reality applications in their classes. The resources and instructional materials produced during this project will be made available via the project?s website so that academic institutions and manufacturers can access and use the resources for training purposes. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many applications require precise placement and transport of particles (ranging from macromolecules to viruses and cells, from colloids to beads, etc.) in microchannels. The application of an electric field is the method of choice to control particle motions in microfluidic systems because of the ease, precision, autonomy of operation and integration with other components for analysis.  The electric field can induce motion of a charged particle (electrophoresis) or the motion of the surrounding fluid (electroosmosis).  This so-called electrokinetic particle motion has been extensively studied in simple liquids. However, it has not been studied extensively in complex fluids such as polymer solutions, colloidal solutions, biological fluids, which are examples of non-Newtonian fluids that exhibit unusual properties in flow.  The goal of this project is to develop a fundamental knowledge of electrokinetic particle motion in polymer solutions through microchannels. The research will delinate effects of fluid elasticity and shear-thinning effects on electrophoretic motion in the direction of the channel axis and lateral migration of particles toward the channel walls in order to find ways to control particle motions.  The experiments will be extended to large electric fields that have not yet been considered for non-Newtonian fluid systems.  The research will be intimately weaved into undergraduate and graduate curricula at Clemson University and will form the basis for activities developed for high school students in South Carolina. Undergraduate and high school students, especially those from underrepresented groups, will be actively involved in the project through various programs available in the department, university, and state.<br/><br/>This project will be the first comprehensive study of electrokinetic particle motion in non-Newtonian fluids through microchannels. A systematic experimental investigation of both the axial motion and lateral migration of particles will be performed in the flow of polymer solutions through straight rectangular microchannels under (1) pure DC electric field, (2) DC electric field imposed with a pressure gradient, and (3) pure AC electric field with a magnitude of up to 1 MV/m (one order of magnitude higher than in typical electrokinetic microfluidics) in each case. Five types of common polymer solutions with distinct rheological properties will be tested and compared against Newtonian fluids. The experiments will investigate effects of fluid elasticity and shear thinning, individually and in combination, on the linear and nonlinear electrophoretic particle motions as well as the accompanying lateral particle migration. The experimental data of particle mobility and migration will be compared with the predictions of theoretical formulae and numerical simulations, if available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social psychology helps to understand how biases such as stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination contribute to Native Americans? disparate outcomes. This research team has identified another distinct form of bias that undermines Native Americans? opportunities and wellbeing: biases of omission. Biases of omission refer to the ways in which Native Americans are written out of public consciousness. For example, research demonstrates that relative to other groups, mainstream television and news media rarely include Native People or discuss Native issues. Americans are also taught relatively little -- and largely inaccurate -- information about Native Americans. As one example, the majority of history curricula in American schools discuss Native Peoples only in pre-20th century contexts, rendering invisible the 5.2 million Native Americans currently living in the United States. The research in this project documents the scope and psychological impact of Native omissions, and explores how non-Native Americans justify those omissions. Studies also examine the motivational underpinnings of the relation between justifications of Native omissions and non-Natives? national esteem, and test the efficacy of interventions that offer potential for improving Native peoples? wellbeing.<br/> <br/>This project explores both the scope of biases of omissions of Native Americans and the psychological processes that perpetuate these biases. The research is based on the observation that a core cultural narrative of the United States is that of an exceptional, morally superior, equitable, and meritocratic society. Yet Native Peoples? historic and contemporary experiences in the United States, including state-sanctioned violence and discrimination arising from the country?s settler colonial origins, contradicts these core cultural narratives. It is therefore hypothesized that Native omissions arise from a desire among non-Native Americans to protect these core cultural narratives and to maintain national esteem -- a sense of attachment to and pride in one?s nation. Three lines of studies test the tenets of this theoretical framework using large samples of Native American participants coupled with samples of non-Native adults from across the United States. The first phase of research documents the scope and psychological impact of Native omissions, including assessments of how and in what domains Native People experience omissions in U.S. society and the effect of omissions on individual and community wellbeing. Additional studies explore how and to what extent non-Native Americans justify omissions documented by Native participants, and whether justifications of Native omissions play a culturally protective role for non-Natives. The final phase of research examines the efficacy of acknowledging Native omissions as a means of improving Native peoples? wellbeing by examining whether acknowledgements (vs. justifications) of Native omissions by mainstream U.S. institutions can enhance Native Americans? individual and collective wellbeing. The program of research aims to expand the psychological literature by laying the theoretical groundwork for understanding an understudied form of bias and by shedding light on the experiences of Native Americans -- people who are vastly underrepresented in psychological theory and research. The project also documents and helps to change the psychological processes that perpetuate social inequalities, particularly those experienced by Native Americans, thereby contributing to the science of broadening participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of developing new types of electronic materials that possess unique quantum properties can enable the revolution in quantum information long sought after by many scientists.  A unique aspect of the work is that the incorporation of metal sulfide layers invokes other physical properties such as magnetism that are enticing for quantum information applications. These layers, however, do not randomly stack on top of one another and instead molecules are inserted that guide the stacking sequence. Chemical control at the atomic level therefore allows these molecules to ?twist? or ?bend? the metal sulfide layers into producing attractive properties for quantum technologies. This precise control at the atomic scale allows the design of novel quantum materials.  These research activities also include outreach to the local community around College Park in education through the use of 3D printers. The PI and his students have taken close to 50 different molecules and materials from chemical databases and turned them into 3D printed structures. Their model kits called MolecularCraft serve as instructional tools in the chemistry classroom in local high schools. The PI collaborates with the faculty at the nearby International High School at Langley Park (IHSLP), which is a school that serves students underrepresented in STEM. The PI and students from the University of Maryland propose to engage with IHSLP students using their local 3D printers but also resources on the university campus. The aim is to teach the students about materials that make technologies possible and to inspire them to consider STEM careers.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, will examine how two or more disparate components can be formed to create new types of hybrid materials which can open new avenues towards emergent phenomena. In the proposed research activities, hybrid materials consist of metal-amine complexes inserted into two-dimensional (2D) metal chalcogenides. The metal-amine molecular units are chiral and serve as structure directing agents to form crystal structures that break inversion symmetry. The research activities also investigate how much hydrogen bonding between the ?NH2 groups of the metal amine complexes and the terminal Q2- anions (Q = S and Se) of the metal chalcogenides dictates crystal structure. To give rise to non-centrosymmetric quantum materials, such interactions should either twist or bend the 2D layers. The crystal growth of non-centrosymmetric quantum materials takes place under solvothermal conditions. The solvent for crystal growth is an amine bidendate ligand L that forms [ML3]n+ complexes, where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu.  The hosting MQ layers are classified as tetrahedral transition metal chalcogenides (TTMCs), which in contrast to the well-studied transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. MoS2, WTe2), have a square metal sublattice and accommodate smaller transition metals of the first row. The targeted phases include Fe- and Ni-based TTMCs for non-centrosymmetric superconductivity and Co- and Mn-based TTMCs for ?ferroelectric? itinerant magnetism. Outreach to the local school, IHSLP, uses 3D printing to teach students about inorganic molecules and inorganic materials. Students learn about structure-property relationships and about materials that play important roles in technology such as rechargeable batteries, solar cells, and superconductors. The 3D printing MolecularCraft kits start with Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, to teach students the basics of structure. IHSLP also has 3D printing capabilities, and the PI has a webpage where all the 3D printing files are currently hosted. Representation matters too, so another goal includes demonstrating to the students a more diverse representation in the sciences. The 3D printing project serves as a bridge to connect them with information on the pathways to different STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animals, including humans, rely on the dietary intake of essential chemical building blocks that they cannot synthesize. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a class of essential dietary lipids that are important for cell membrane structure at low temperatures and in the central nervous system. Cold temperature adaptation in poikilotherms (?cold blooded? animals that do not independently regulate their body temperature), and neurological function in animals more broadly, depends on an ability to forage for PUFA-enriched food sources.  The project?s research will use fruit flies and their dietary fungi as a model system to understand how animal feeding strategies and microbial lipid biosynthesis have co-evolved to meet physiological needs. Through its research aims, the project will 1) identify molecular mechanisms underlying the physiology of a pair of organisms whose interactions are important in agriculture and biotechnology 2) elucidate general principles of animal-microbial interactions based on diet and 3) increase functional understanding of a key lipid class in animal physiology and behavior. Through its education aim, the project will promote participation in the biological sciences by students in underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>To goal of this project is to explore the mechanisms and consequences of microbial-animal lipid exchange using a combination of behavioral, genetic, and biochemical approaches in both Drosophila melanogaster and multiple yeast species. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthetic genes have been lost in many fungal lineages, so flies must forage for specific yeast species to access these lipids. Yeast, in turn, are immobile and rely on attracting insects to colonize new environments. In preliminary work, the association between a natural fruit fly population and different yeast species has been found to be dependent on temperature and yeast PUFA metabolism. It has also been established that PUFA biosynthesis in a yeast-based laboratory diet dictates the activity of flies in the cold and other seasonally relevant behaviors. The project will first uncover the signaling pathways by which fatty acids dictate fly behavior in response to cold temperatures. It will then investigate how flies make foraging decisions to optimize their lipidome using olfaction-based communication that has co-evolved alongside yeast fermentation. Finally, the project will develop new experimental systems to dissect behavioral phenotypes and physiological functions dictated by PUFAs in specific tissue and cell types in the fly. In parallel, the project will support research through training programs that integrate concepts across animal physiology and biophysics.

Results from the study will provide important insights linking evolutionary strategies to search for foodstuffs to physiological outcomes in a social primate.

Additionally, the project will provide scientific training opportunities for diverse undergraduate students and a U.S.-based graduate student. <br/><br/>The research investigates how the distribution of key nutritional resources ? food and water ? affect how baboons move through their environments. Research suggests that consuming different dietary resources impacts primate gut microbiomes, the microorganisms inhabiting the gut, which, in turn affect primate biology and health. This research uses data drawn from individual baboons residing in natural settings to complement scholarship that is based on environmental and climate proxies rather than direct evidence of nutritional choices. It also adds an explicit focus on water - a critical resource in dry environments and a source of gut bacteria - to understand how diverse dietary choices among individual baboons relate to gut health. The investigators will follow a habituated troop of Kinda baboons to collect behavioral (e.g., diet and movement) and biological (e.g., baboon fecal and water sample) data. Next, they will employ cutting-edge movement ecology analyses (e.g., hidden Markov models) to test different hypotheses related to baboon movement strategies. They will then quantify baboon microbiome diversity and analyze its relationship to water microbiome diversity and pathogen levels (e.g., E. coli and Giardia abundance).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Anthropological theories about the work of soldiers often focus on the risk and uncertainty associated with conflicts affecting them and the related effects on the human experience and social lives. However, being a soldier also provides stable employment and provides new social relationships within communities that are offset from other aspects of daily life. How do these social relationships affect the experience of being a soldier? Does the everyday labor of being a soldier provide experiences that are distinct from those associated with active conflict? This doctoral dissertation project synthesizes theory from economic anthropology and the anthropology of social structure to investigate the tensions between stability and risk inherent to the military experience and its effects on livelihoods in conflict zones. It trains a U.S.-based graduate student in anthropological theory and methods and involves extensive dissemination of findings for scholarly and non-scholarly audiences. <br/><br/>Specifically, this doctoral dissertation project examines the lives and livelihoods of paid soldiers in militarized communities. Through ethnographic observation and life history interviews of soldiers where they reside and work, this project investigates how being a soldier contributes to household labor and the activities that soldiers pursue to enhance their job performance or retreat from daily stressors. It asks whether soldiers? social networks inside and outside of the military context affect their understandings of labor, for example, and how the labor of being a soldier in turn alters those networks. By considering the way militarized social and economic spaces provide possibilities for certain forms of work and social relationships to be pursued, this project not only provides a novel approach to the study of security, but also contributes to social scientific studies of political economy and gender.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even in the unlikely event of pandemic eradication, new work patterns may replace pre-pandemic norms and practices of international collaboration. While technological solutions matter for facilitating adaptation to the pandemic, social innovations at the individual and team levels are equally or more important for generating resilience within scientific teams during the protracted crisis. The future of international collaborative work can benefit from an understanding of how scientists have shown team resilience during this time, strengthening teams, and meaningfully transferring knowledge. In an increasingly globalized scientific landscape the grand policy question is how to internationalize scientific teams while, at the same time, responding to local demands. Our goal is to characterize different forms of social innovation in international collaborative work during the pandemic, while taking into account local contexts, opportunities, and institutional factors.<br/><br/>Part 2.<br/>This project addresses the topic of global social innovation in science capacity in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining three intertwining features of the social dynamics of international collaborative teams: Social innovation, Adaptation and Resilience, and Learning and Transferability. Social innovation refers to new and different ways of modifying individual and group behavior within the context of team science. The research design builds on interdisciplinary knowledge about individual conduct and group dynamics within the context of teams. The project involves a series of case studies focused around distinct internationally collaborative teams across four countries: Austria, Latvia, Spain and the United States. Data are drawn from bibliometric data sources, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a survey of researchers. Teams include new emergent collaborations that establish norms for interaction during the pandemic, or adaptive collaborations that adjust to the barriers and constraints of the pandemic. A novel methodological approach to identifying teams for case study is employed by implementing advanced computing techniques in a new and robust bibliometric dataset, complemented by other snowball sampling techniques. The project will conclude with an international workshop to share and disseminate findings that further international collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By studying these early complementary food producing communities, researchers seek to better understand how different food strategies coalesced to develop more complex and integrated societies. One of the most impacting events in world history?food production and its consequences?led to significant changes in landscapes and human populations, eventually supporting the spread of a settled lifeway and the rise of great civilizations in the ancient world. Yet, food production was more than just a matter of subsistence and landscape changes. It also led to dramatic shifts in social, ritual and symbolic practices, including challenges such as the maintenance of social cohesion in the face of variable community formations, increased social scale and differentiation, environmental changes, new technologies to meet new economic demands, and the need for different ways of developing new institutions to manage the changing nature of different risks. However, managing those challenges through growing collective action and new community norms and institutions may have been as problematical as arriving at successful food production, especially when societies combined different food strategies, which required different means of negotiation and organization to deal with new challenges beyond those of a single mode of production such as agriculture. Research at archaeological sites is best suited to study these changes and challenges through time because they retain the empirical evidence of past food technologies, people?s social and technological organization strategies, and the practices and institutions they formed to deal with those changes and challenges. <br/><br/>Archaeological knowledge of early food production, inter-community integration, technological exploration, innovation and development, and the antecedents and consequences of these activities remains unclear. The offshore coastal waters provide some of the most diverse and abundant marine resources and adjacent shorelines offer one of the most appropriate places to study the socio-economic challenges and interactions that developed between early fishing and farming communities. Such situations representing the evolution of a settled lifeway, population expansion, different labor demands, greater dependence on marine resources and terrestrial foods, major climate fluctuations provide opportunities to study social movements toward civilization. This research focuses on how these fishing and agriculture communities built social cohesion by non-violent means and how they symbolically expressed their changing social and cultural identities with new food production strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeological reconstructions situate present and past stressors, evaluations of risk, and responses within their historical context, a perspective that is not accessible through a focus on any single point of time, or through documents alone. This project contributes to the comparative assessment of economic trends, human-environmental interactions, resilience, and identity during periods of profound cultural change, and facilitate nuanced approaches to community development.

The researchers engage local communities to determine what components of the study they find most useful in terms of application to policy and community resilience. The diachronic nature of the project means that it examines how past processes, revealed archaeologically, have influenced contemporary livelihoods and their diversification in the face of rapid economic change. <br/><br/>Global economic integration, agricultural intensification, and the expansion of cash crop production has transformed and continues to affect communities that were once subjected to colonial domination. The researchers are specifically interested in how global economic integration has affected resilience strategies of local communities and households. How have people evaluated and responded to risk? What alternatives to market participation have they adopted? The study region hosted complex indigenous agricultural communities, which colonists conscripted to work in local sugar mills. An archaeological approach to the resilience of household adaptive strategies will enable global economic factors to be examined within the context of historical sugar communities. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions, geomorphological assessments of the impact of intensive agriculture on area soils and waterways, and archival analysis will complement and contextualize the archaeological study of these sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reintegration involves increased participation in traditional social, economic and political institutions aided by social support as people transition home from prison. Formerly incarcerated individuals encounter barriers to successful reentry and long-term reintegration due to criminal record (or ?CORI? in Massachusetts) exclusions. However, this population may also strategically avoid contact with mainstream or ?surveilling? institutions, and as a result, stand on the outskirts of society. As a reentry leader in Boston describes, the reason for an employment rejection ?may not be your CORI, it might be your credit [score].? Distrust of the law and those who enforce it can further negatively influence perceptions as negative sentiment travels swiftly through communities via social networks. However, little is known about how people make decisions about engaging in mainstream or alternative sources (such as banks compared to payday loans), perceived advantages or consequences of these choices, whether distrust of law enforcement and other factors shape these choices, and whether institutional engagement varies as people desist from crime or have fewer interactions with the criminal justice system. Understanding this (dis)engagement process is critical for promoting public safety and improving reintegration into society for the approximate 600,000 prisoners who return to their communities annually and begin navigating the unsteady reentry terrain.<br/> <br/>Through a partnership with the Office of Returning Citizens (ORC) in Boston, MA, the research project will interview three sets of adults. First, those who have visited the ORC and were last released from prison at least one year ago will be interviewed (Group 1). The researchers will ask each person from this group to identify individuals who are also formerly incarcerated but have not received any ORC services for the next set of interviews (Group 2). Then returning citizens who are within a year post-release will be interviewed through the ORC (Group 3). In-depth, one-on-one interviews with approximately 120 men and women will provide novel data on how people perceive, interact with, and avoid four non-criminal justice domains: medical, financial, political, and employment. The project will examine whether legal cynicism and broader systemic distrust influence choices to connect with such entities, and the potential implications of exclusion and avoidance in both the immediate reentry period and long-term integration process. Recognizing the roles race, gender and intersectionality play in reentry experiences, the project will examine similarities and differences across study participants. The policy recommendations derived from this study will not only have direct implications for Boston and the surrounding area, but will also be adaptable to other jurisdictions that release large portions of incarcerated adults back to marginalized communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People and ecosystems depend on these glaciers, but as the glaciers melt, natural resources (e.g., water and pastures, ecosystems services (e.g., carbon storage), cultural identities, and tourism decline. These new lands, however, offer opportunities to study social and ecological adaptations. This study will show how communities adapt to the loss of glaciers. One experiment will be to study the role of grazing animals in enhancing proglacial landscape formation. The project reinforces partnerships between local communities, governmental entities, NGOs, and researchers working across continents to promote scientific advancements of social and ecological adaptations in proglacial landscapes. <br/><br/>Melting mountain glaciers are exposing large new land areas and this project investigates how postglacial ecosystems could contribute to indispensable services for local and downstream populations in future glacier-free valleys. This doctoral dissertation project uses plot studies of plant species, soil fertility, and geomorphic surfaces across a range of alpine landscapes where glaciers have melted over the last hundred years. By studying the migration of alpine plant communities to higher elevations and ecosystem formation, the research characterizes the main processes occurring in these ice-free landscapes. The study also combines intensive sampling, UAV (drone) surveys, satellite imagery, and an experiment to test if introducing grazing animals can accelerate ecosystem formation.

Animals have various molecular mechanisms for detection and destruction of diverse viruses. Despite viruses exerting tremendous costs to all animals, how invertebrates, particularly marine species, respond and adapt to virus communities has received more limited research. The limitations for understanding the impact of viral communities on marine invertebrates results from an incomplete understanding of how viruses vary over different populations as well as the precise mechanisms of the immune system that the host utilizes in controlling their viral community. The research team will utilize a sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) to study host immunity in the laboratory and the field to characterize the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of this symbiosis. This project will provide a synergistic international collaboration with Dr. Yehu Moran (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel) to connect the ecology and symbioses of cnidarians with the molecular mechanisms of antiviral responses. This research will provide mentoring and training for a postdoctoral fellow as well as graduate and undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Additional research and educational opportunities will be provided through expansion of a SEA-PHAGES course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) and outreach through a new Center for Microbial Genomics at UNC Charlotte.  <br/><br/>Knowledge of the environmental, genetic, and molecular factors involved in modulating expression of antiviral pathways is essential to understand and predict how any host species will respond to diverse viral communities. The integrative research approach in this project will determine how shifts in the biotic and abiotic features of habitats correlate with changes in the expression of the antiviral response for a cnidarian host. The research team will use comparative genomics to detect signatures of positive selection by comparing the viromes and transcriptomes of populations of Nematostella vectensis across its native and introduced geographic range in North America. They will then use a combination of mesocosm and laboratory studies to quantify the extent of local adaptation of the anemone to specific viral communities through a combination of organismal and gene expression studies. They will employ a combination of transgenic approaches combined with laboratory and mesocosm studies to characterize how individual components of the antiviral response respond and mediate exposure to a diverse viral community.  Nematostella vectensis has been utilized as a model for the ecological and evolutionary genomics by the international research team to understand the genetic diversity of this invertebrate, the role for nucleotide variation in local adaptation, and the function of focal genes through transgenic approaches. This project is expected to have a significant impact by identifying the evolution of these antiviral mechanisms in populations with exposure to different viruses and the mechanisms for viral detection and destruction in heterogeneous habitats that are vulnerable to the ongoing climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social psychology helps to understand how biases such as stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination contribute to Native Americans? disparate outcomes. This research team has identified another distinct form of bias that undermines Native Americans? opportunities and wellbeing: biases of omission. Biases of omission refer to the ways in which Native Americans are written out of public consciousness. For example, research demonstrates that relative to other groups, mainstream television and news media rarely include Native People or discuss Native issues. Americans are also taught relatively little -- and largely inaccurate -- information about Native Americans. As one example, the majority of history curricula in American schools discuss Native Peoples only in pre-20th century contexts, rendering invisible the 5.2 million Native Americans currently living in the United States. The research in this project documents the scope and psychological impact of Native omissions, and explores how non-Native Americans justify those omissions. Studies also examine the motivational underpinnings of the relation between justifications of Native omissions and non-Natives? national esteem, and test the efficacy of interventions that offer potential for improving Native peoples? wellbeing.<br/> <br/>This project explores both the scope of biases of omissions of Native Americans and the psychological processes that perpetuate these biases. The research is based on the observation that a core cultural narrative of the United States is that of an exceptional, morally superior, equitable, and meritocratic society. Yet Native Peoples? historic and contemporary experiences in the United States, including state-sanctioned violence and discrimination arising from the country?s settler colonial origins, contradicts these core cultural narratives. It is therefore hypothesized that Native omissions arise from a desire among non-Native Americans to protect these core cultural narratives and to maintain national esteem -- a sense of attachment to and pride in one?s nation. Three lines of studies test the tenets of this theoretical framework using large samples of Native American participants coupled with samples of non-Native adults from across the United States. The first phase of research documents the scope and psychological impact of Native omissions, including assessments of how and in what domains Native People experience omissions in U.S. society and the effect of omissions on individual and community wellbeing. Additional studies explore how and to what extent non-Native Americans justify omissions documented by Native participants, and whether justifications of Native omissions play a culturally protective role for non-Natives. The final phase of research examines the efficacy of acknowledging Native omissions as a means of improving Native peoples? wellbeing by examining whether acknowledgements (vs. justifications) of Native omissions by mainstream U.S. institutions can enhance Native Americans? individual and collective wellbeing. The program of research aims to expand the psychological literature by laying the theoretical groundwork for understanding an understudied form of bias and by shedding light on the experiences of Native Americans -- people who are vastly underrepresented in psychological theory and research. The project also documents and helps to change the psychological processes that perpetuate social inequalities, particularly those experienced by Native Americans, thereby contributing to the science of broadening participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key regulators of plant development include a class of proteins called transcription factors, which coordinate the specificity and function of plant cells and tissues. The action of some transcription factors are limited to only a few cells or a subset of tissues, but there are other factors that play key roles in a large number of developing tissues. This raises an interesting biological question: how can the same transcription factor generate different developmental outcomes? This project answers the question by identifying how the same transcription factor can serve different functions in various cells and tissues. The project  combines techniques of genetics and biochemistry, including advances in high-resolution mapping of protein-protein interactions. Central to this proposal is the inclusion of students traditionally excluded from research-intensive insitituions. At The Ohio State University (OSU), this is manifested in Black students and students-of-color being overrepresented at OSU regional campuses, where research  opportunities are limited. To mitigate this problem, undergraduates will be brought to the OSU Columbus main campus, provided food and lodging, paid a stipend, and enrolled in a >100-student consortium consolidating the various concurrent summer research programs. This pipeline broadens participation of traditionally excluded groups by eliminating the unfair choice between working a summer job and exploring research as a career.<br/><br/>Biological development results from tightly controlled gene expression driven by the activity of transcription factors (TFs). TFs have been repeatedly coopted throughout evolution to regulate key developmental advances, in part because their outputs vary depending on developmental context. Mechanisms that generate these context-dependent readouts remain largely unknown, and this knowledge gap is particularly large in the plant kingdom. This gap will be addressed using CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) TFs as a model. HD-ZIPIII proteins are a particularly attractive model as they regulate a broad range of essential developmental processes, acting in tissues and organs ranging from meristems to roots to lateral organs. In addition, HD-ZIPIII protein architecture includes a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain. START domains are typically activated by lipophilic ligands and often mediate protein-protein interactions, presenting possible mechanisms to generate context-dependent activity. This proposal will test the genetic consequences and functional partnerships of the representative HD-ZIPIII PHABULOSA (PHB) in two functionally-distinct cell types: the indeterminate cells of the shoot apical meristem and the determinate cells of the adaxial side of leaves. Experiments including global genomic profiling and proximity labeling will identify meristem- and leaf-specific PHB gene regulatory networks and interactomes, and test whether the START domain plays a role in generating context-dependent activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 1 project will increase the number of published open educational resources (OERs) for a variety of undergraduate online classrooms (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous online classes, hybrid classrooms that combine in-person and online teaching). OERs are educational materials that are available in the public domain. CourseSource publishes peer-reviewed OERs that implement research-based, effective pedagogical techniques. Increasing the number of freely-available online OERs addresses an immediate need by providing lessons and professional development to instructors. It also addresses a long-term need by assembling an extensive set of resources that meet the growing demand for online education. Because CourseSource has built a diverse and large community who uses its materials, this project will directly improve instruction for hundreds of instructors and thousands of undergraduate biology students.<br/><br/>The unifying goal of this project will be to share effective online lessons and help biology instructors implement them to benefit their students. Furthermore, advancing the progress and development of peer-reviewed, pedagogically sound OER materials can benefit the larger academic landscape as it moves towards providing low- or no-cost access to high-quality resources for instructors and students. This project will: 1) Use information from the OERs published in CourseSource to determine how instructors implement active-learning instructional strategies online, 2) Evaluate short- and long-term online professional development programs designed to help instructors find, adapt, implement, and share online lessons, and 3) Explore how OERs can support instructors in using online lessons that include active-learning pedagogies. Since CourseSource publications include a section in which authors delineate their instructional approaches, they can be mined to determine the type and frequency of active-learning practices as well as alignment with instructional design practices, the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, and evidence-based strategies for online instruction. The results will identify strategies that will easily transfer across contexts, situations where instructors need greater support to initiate and maintain these practices in online environments, and ways active-learning can be enhanced by the online format. This project will also create multiple professional development programs for instructors in which they learn to write about and publish their online lessons and implement previously published OERs. These programs will be assessed through surveys and a Social Network Analysis. The results will allow the exploration of whether and how instructor beliefs about online teaching change, and if professional development programs can create and sustain instructor support networks. Finally, interviews with instructors who are implementing OERs in their classroom will be used to determine how the availability of instructional materials influences instructor pedagogical decisions.

Yet for all the development of theory and techniques in this area, the adoption of program synthesis by users has been limited. A key hurdle in expanding the impact of synthesis is that fully automated software synthesis does not match the iterative software design process that is used in practice. The majority of existing techniques strive to be fully automated, acting as black-boxes for users: the user provides a specification and the tool returns complete program code. The investigators propose to overcome this hurdle through human-in-the-loop synthesis which allows a user to incrementally refine specifications and code through interaction with the synthesis engine. <br/><br/>This project focuses on developing techniques and theories that increase the adoption of program synthesis in real-world systems. They use a performative practice from the computer-music community, called Live Coding, in which users write code that generates music (or other media) in real-time. This project formalizes human-in-the-loop Program Synthesis and its intersection with Live Coding, and develops new human-in-the-loop program-synthesis techniques. The investigators explore the use of these techniques in Live Coding and other settings. This project will also provide the opportunity for female undergraduates to participate in computer-science research - many for the first time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Healthcare providers? work requires frequent contact with patients within a hospital that is often rapidly changing.  Hospitals prioritize certain forms of expertise and render other knowledge and labor invisible. Nurses experience trauma and stress in their everyday work from the social structure of the hospital to the unique demands and risks of healthcare givers. Nurses are most likely to be diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This project examines nurses' experiences of trauma within the specific historical and cultural context of nurses' expertise, skills, and labor in healthcare. By focusing on nurses' often invisible skills and knowledge, this project will identify the implications of that invisibility for nurses' risk of exposure and well-being. This project carries key lessons and insights for healthcare workers, policy makers and administrative decision makers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on nurses' invisible knowledge and labor by doing ethnographic interviews with nurses, trauma experts, and workplace health and safety experts, as well as participant observation at a hospital. It asks the following research questions: 1) how does devaluing nurses' practices, skills, and knowledges also obscure the preventable exposures, risks, and trauma laden in the everyday work of nursing, and in what ways are they subverted or sustained? 2) how might centering nurses' experiences with PTSD also offer insight into the roots of nurses' working conditions during pandemics such as COVID-19? This project contributes to research discourses in STS and medical anthropology on the development of professional knowledge and techniques, where nurses' expertise and skills are often ignored in a replication of existing healthcare hierarchies. By beginning from nurses' knowledges the project will reveal how stress and trauma can become embedded within technical knowledges in high stress professions. By locating nurses' experiences of trauma and stress within the broader dynamics through which nurses develop, learn, and share skills and knowledge, this project will explore how essential and fragile their role is within healthcare.

This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 1 project will increase the number of published open educational resources (OERs) for a variety of undergraduate online classrooms (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous online classes, hybrid classrooms that combine in-person and online teaching). OERs are educational materials that are available in the public domain. CourseSource publishes peer-reviewed OERs that implement research-based, effective pedagogical techniques. Increasing the number of freely-available online OERs addresses an immediate need by providing lessons and professional development to instructors. It also addresses a long-term need by assembling an extensive set of resources that meet the growing demand for online education. Because CourseSource has built a diverse and large community who uses its materials, this project will directly improve instruction for hundreds of instructors and thousands of undergraduate biology students.<br/><br/>The unifying goal of this project will be to share effective online lessons and help biology instructors implement them to benefit their students. Furthermore, advancing the progress and development of peer-reviewed, pedagogically sound OER materials can benefit the larger academic landscape as it moves towards providing low- or no-cost access to high-quality resources for instructors and students. This project will: 1) Use information from the OERs published in CourseSource to determine how instructors implement active-learning instructional strategies online, 2) Evaluate short- and long-term online professional development programs designed to help instructors find, adapt, implement, and share online lessons, and 3) Explore how OERs can support instructors in using online lessons that include active-learning pedagogies. Since CourseSource publications include a section in which authors delineate their instructional approaches, they can be mined to determine the type and frequency of active-learning practices as well as alignment with instructional design practices, the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, and evidence-based strategies for online instruction. The results will identify strategies that will easily transfer across contexts, situations where instructors need greater support to initiate and maintain these practices in online environments, and ways active-learning can be enhanced by the online format. This project will also create multiple professional development programs for instructors in which they learn to write about and publish their online lessons and implement previously published OERs. These programs will be assessed through surveys and a Social Network Analysis. The results will allow the exploration of whether and how instructor beliefs about online teaching change, and if professional development programs can create and sustain instructor support networks. Finally, interviews with instructors who are implementing OERs in their classroom will be used to determine how the availability of instructional materials influences instructor pedagogical decisions. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, they inhabit shallow sea water, lakes, ponds, streams, irrigation ditches, ephemeral basins in deserts, meltwater puddles on glaciers, and thin layers of water on soils and plants. Rotifers play vital roles in ecological systems as both predators and prey, and the nutrients they contain are passed up the food chain to insects and fish. Scientists study rotifers to better understand aging, aquaculture, ecology, development, and the evolution of reproductive modes. A fascinating feature of rotifers are their complex life cycles: some alternate generations, whereas others primarily reproduce by creating clones of themselves. This work will use genetic analyses and comparisons of anatomy that rely on advanced microscopic imaging to determine the evolutionary history of a major group of rotifers and examine how life cycles and reproductive mode changed as the group evolved. Many species from diverse habitats will be considered, and the research will also result in better characterization of the life cycles of species that are poorly known. As part of the project, educational workshops and museum displays will be produced, contributions will be made to online databases, and a scientific symposium will be held at a national meeting. Further, a postdoctoral scientist, along with graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, will be trained to conduct studies of this diverse animal group. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive phylogeny of rotifers with a focus on the Class Monogononta, the most speciose and diverse lineage in the phylum. This research will provide a framework for testing how the diversification of the group is associated with the origins of different reproductive modes. The project has three aims. (1) It will produce a comprehensive phylogeny of rotifers using molecular sequence data and morphology; the morphological studies will utilize conventional electron microscopy, focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy; the morphology of at least 100 species representing nearly 90% of family diversity will be considered. (2) It will use the phylogeny and ancestral state reconstruction methods to investigate questions concerning the evolution of reproductive traits in rotifers. In particular, (a) how did the maternal provisioning of nutrients (i.e., matrotrophy) and internal brooding evolve from egg-laying species? (b) how did the ability to produce both mitotic and meiotic ova in a single animal evolve from cyclical parthenogenesis? (c) do eggshells produced by species with different reproductive modes show similarities in morphology, chemistry, and mechanical properties, and are these correlated with life history traits? And (d) has the small size of certain life cycle stages evolved more than once? (3) The phylogeny will also be used to identify monophyletic groups, present a predictive classification of rotifers, revise or produce new diagnoses for taxa above the genus level, and produce species keys. Additionally, because Rotifera is the most diverse clade (>2000 species) and the only gonochoristic group within the larger lineage Gnathifera (~3575 species from five higher taxa: Chaetognatha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Rotifera, Acanthocephala), rotifers are ideal candidates to provide insights into gnathiferan evolution and help answer questions about the evolution of reproductive diversity, jaws (e.g., Gnathifera), and parasitism (e.g., Acanthocephala).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, due to high equipment costs and other limitations, providing students with access to industrial equipment can be challenging for many community colleges. Even when such equipment is available, it is in lab facilities that have limited availability and little flexibility to accommodate students? work and family schedules. These limitations were spotlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced lab facilities to close altogether.  As a result, students had even less access to the lab equipment and training, preventing course completion for many students.  Although remote instruction and distance education are not new concepts, providing an authentic remote experience for equipment training remains an open problem. Computer simulations have been used to lower the costs for training using industrial equipment. However, these tools tend to oversimplify the equipment, with resulting limits in students? ability to gain skills in operating the equipment and troubleshooting problems. This project will develop and assess new remote access tools that allow students to control physical industrial equipment over the internet.  This approach will provide a new capability for sharing resources amongst colleges. In addition, these tools will give students experience with working on distributed teams, helping prepare them for the technical workforce. By expanding access to technical courses for students living in rural locations or in other situations that limit access to lab facilities, the project will help broaden participation in the technical workforce.<br/><br/>Lab facilities at the Community College of Allegheny County currently provide students with in-person training on industrial equipment including robots, programmable logic controllers, and mechatronic devices. The goal of this project is to create a new remote capability for controlling equipment in the lab facilities and evaluate the impact of this capability on student learning. Remote capability will enable students to access physical equipment and view the results of their control actions and control programs in an immersive environment on a computer at another location. Stereo cameras will transmit a three-dimensional view of a work cell in the lab facility.  Students will be able to remotely trigger actuators over the internet to achieve a desired behavior and view the results of their actions in near-real-time. This project will: (1) implement and test new hardware and software interfaces for lab equipment; (2) develop lab exercises using the remote capability, lesson plans for instructors, and instructional materials for students; (3) evaluate student learning in on-line courses and compare it to concurrent in-person courses; and (4) expand the implementation to multiple institutions and multiple course offerings. Using a mixed methods approach, the project evaluation will use focus groups, student surveys, and pre- and post-tests to assess the impact of the new remote capability on students? comprehension of the technologies and their confidence in their ability to use the equipment. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because agriculture is the largest contributor to this loss, a clear understanding of the relative importance of different agricultural practices to biodiversity loss is urgently needed. Fungi play essential roles as decomposers that speed the return of nutrients to forms that crops can use, as pathogens that cause plant disease, as beneficial endophytes that live within plants and protect them from pests and pathogens, and as mycoparasites, fungi that feed on other fungi and reduce their potential to harm crops. Currently little is known about the effects of agricultural practices on biodiversity in these different fungal groups and about how changes in fungal biodiversity may alter critical functions of fungi. This study will determine the relative importance of shade, nitrogen fertilizers, and fungicides for fungal biodiversity loss in coffee, a crop of critical importance to the global economy and to coffee producers, processors, purveyors, and consumers in the United States. It will examine the importance of fungal biodiversity for key functions of fungi in an agroecosystem, particularly the role of fungal diversity in reducing crop diseases and in improving crop nutrient cycling. This project will provide high impact, cross-cultural research opportunities for training both U.S. undergraduate and graduate students to work effectively as scientists in international settings, as well as disseminating two educational modules to improve specific learning outcomes in undergraduate biology courses.<br/><br/>Over the last 30 years, biodiversity ecosystem function (BEF) research has clearly demonstrated the importance of diversity for ecosystem function, yet critical gaps remain for fungi. Fungal communities are highly diverse, their abiotic and biotic interactions are often cryptic and complex, and the importance of fungal diversity for key ecosystem processes, such as decomposition and disease regulation, remains to be determined. Coffee represents an ideal ecosystem to study contributors to fungal biodiversity loss and their effects on ecosystem function, since resources vary with levels of shade and fertilization, and fungicides act to suppress fungal diversity. This project will 1) combine two manipulative field experiments with fungal metabarcoding to a) determine the relative importance of shade, inorganic nitrogen, fungicides and leaf litter diversity in structuring fungal communities and their functional diversity, and b) measure the effects of differences in functional diversity in fungal communities on ecosystem function; and 2) use culture-based techniques to identify currently undescribed fungi, link morphology to DNA barcode, and screen isolates for functional groups. This CAREER award will advance understanding of the role of fungal diversity in ecosystem function, particularly the effects of diversity on decomposition rates and plant disease incidence and severity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous scholarship has documented changes in human diet and settlement associated with the introduction of new fishing technologies. Less emphasis has been placed on understanding the circumstances that led people to shift strategies and develop the tools to access a greater number of marine resources. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate how indigenous people on the California Channel Islands adapted specialized fishing strategies that were supported by local marine ecosystems and how people innovated new technologies to target these resources. In doing so, they will address fundamental questions in anthropological archaeology such as why intensive subsistence economies emerge and how cultural innovations materialize in variable environments.This research is in collaboration with local indigenous stakeholders. An Advisory Board of Native community members was created to ensure that communication is transparent, research is ethical and to create opportunities for community input and participation at varying stages of the project. <br/><br/>This research will utilize existing, unanalyzed museum collections from three archaeological sites to address how environmental conditions influenced the emergence of intensive fishing practices and the evolution of fishing technologies, such as the single-piece shell fishhook and sewn-plank canoes.  The research focuses on indigenous populations from the California Channel Islands. Drawing from evolutionary theory, researchers will model human behavior and decision making based on habitat suitability. They use intertidal shellfish population density data and calculated area of wetlands as measures of habitat suitability. Researchers will analyze all faunal remains from the study sites. Additionally, they will submit select samples of artifacts and raw materials associated with the construction and maintenance of sewn-plank canoes for geochemical analysis. These data will determine the source of raw materials necessary for canoe construction and provide valuable insight to debates regarding the role of long-distance exchange and intensified resource acquisition in the development of sociopolitical complexity. Lastly, this study will demonstrate the tremendously valuable data available in unexplored museum collections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, they inhabit shallow sea water, lakes, ponds, streams, irrigation ditches, ephemeral basins in deserts, meltwater puddles on glaciers, and thin layers of water on soils and plants. Rotifers play vital roles in ecological systems as both predators and prey, and the nutrients they contain are passed up the food chain to insects and fish. Scientists study rotifers to better understand aging, aquaculture, ecology, development, and the evolution of reproductive modes. A fascinating feature of rotifers are their complex life cycles: some alternate generations, whereas others primarily reproduce by creating clones of themselves. This work will use genetic analyses and comparisons of anatomy that rely on advanced microscopic imaging to determine the evolutionary history of a major group of rotifers and examine how life cycles and reproductive mode changed as the group evolved. Many species from diverse habitats will be considered, and the research will also result in better characterization of the life cycles of species that are poorly known. As part of the project, educational workshops and museum displays will be produced, contributions will be made to online databases, and a scientific symposium will be held at a national meeting. Further, a postdoctoral scientist, along with graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, will be trained to conduct studies of this diverse animal group. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive phylogeny of rotifers with a focus on the Class Monogononta, the most speciose and diverse lineage in the phylum. This research will provide a framework for testing how the diversification of the group is associated with the origins of different reproductive modes. The project has three aims. (1) It will produce a comprehensive phylogeny of rotifers using molecular sequence data and morphology; the morphological studies will utilize conventional electron microscopy, focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy; the morphology of at least 100 species representing nearly 90% of family diversity will be considered. (2) It will use the phylogeny and ancestral state reconstruction methods to investigate questions concerning the evolution of reproductive traits in rotifers. In particular, (a) how did the maternal provisioning of nutrients (i.e., matrotrophy) and internal brooding evolve from egg-laying species? (b) how did the ability to produce both mitotic and meiotic ova in a single animal evolve from cyclical parthenogenesis? (c) do eggshells produced by species with different reproductive modes show similarities in morphology, chemistry, and mechanical properties, and are these correlated with life history traits? And (d) has the small size of certain life cycle stages evolved more than once? (3) The phylogeny will also be used to identify monophyletic groups, present a predictive classification of rotifers, revise or produce new diagnoses for taxa above the genus level, and produce species keys.

The kidney is a hotspot for birth defects that affect the size, number, and arrangement of filtration units, called nephrons, and the tubules that carry urine within the kidney and out to the bladder. This project seeks determine the engineering rules that guide tubules as they form in the kidney and then to mimic nephron fusion with the tubule network. Together, these activities will create more ""true-to-life"" kidney tissues in a dish that can be used to study the origin of kidney birth defects at a fundamental level and inform new intervention strategies for childhood and adult diseases that originate from such defects. Two integrated educational projects are designed to equip a new generation of young scientists with the quantitative skills needed to contribute to the emerging discipline of ?developmental engineering."" The first project is creating a summer research experience for undergraduate students in which participation will be broadened by focusing recruitment efforts on under-represented minority, women, and first-generation students through several partnerships based on the investigator?s commitment to removing barriers to the use and generation of technology by all people. The second project is creating free and publicly available lesson/lecture plan modules through a crowd science platform called quanti.us. These modules will serve high school and undergraduate sciences educators and aim to stoke student interest in cutting-edge scientific problems while equipping them with quantitative problem-solving approaches.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to develop advanced biomanufacturing strategies based on the control of tissue morphogenesis with expectations that efforts will lead to the creation of human tissues with sufficient complexity to be models for drug development or directly in regenerative medicine. Toward this goal, this CAREER project is focused on mimicking nephron differentiation and fusion with the ureteric tree in synthetic tissue models of the developing kidney, which will be accomplished by generating human kidney tubule networks with controlled size and connectivity and then directing nephron formation at many spatial sites within them to better capture kidney structure at cm-scale.  The project addresses the need for models of kidney development outside of the body with sufficient organization across length-scales to properly study common development diseases of the kidney such as CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract), which is marked by incomplete organization of epithelial networks necessary for kidney function. Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the mechanical microenvironment of kidney epithelial bud branching into the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) ""mesenchyme"" during development sculpts tubule elongation and geometric spacing.  The research plan is organized under two specific aims: (1) Determine the mechanical contribution of the tissue micro-environment to epithelial tubule guidance using tissue-engineered mimics of the mesenchyme and an existing FEM model and (2) Engineer nephron integration into dynamic tissue scaffolds through spatially guided differentiation, leveraging cell patterning, biochemical, and optogenetic approaches to direct the differentiation of early nephron lineages at many specific sites in tubule networks within dynamic scaffolds at once. The ability to mimic human kidney development beyond the level of a single nephron or tubule will finally create opportunities to study and develop therapies for congenital kidney diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The existing data infrastructure relies heavily upon statistics collected in surveys and censuses, yet the long-standing survey paradigm is under threat with declining participation rates. There are, however, many other sources of data that increasingly are available, including administrative data from states and local governments, public and private institutions, and businesses. Additional sources of data include 'big data' from the internet, connected devices, and sensors. This project will conduct three interrelated workshops on issues related to the development of a new national data infrastructure. A short consensus report will be written at the conclusion of each workshop. An improved data infrastructure is needed to address pressing social problems. Data and statistics from the federal government and academic researchers, including unemployment rates, crime rates, and people's perceptions of their society, provide the foundation for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to make informed decisions regarding the economy, society, and their lives. An improved national data infrastructure would provide many societal benefits, including improved decision making and more informed public policy.<br/><br/>The need for a new data infrastructure has been widely acknowledged as national governments around the world recognize the strategic importance of data. The barriers, challenges, and issues for a new data infrastructure are complex and will require innovative approaches, methods, and tools. It also will require the support and trust of multiple actors, including the public, academia; federal, state, and local governments, and the private sector. The workshops will address these issues by focusing on three specific areas and questions. The first workshop will focus on delineating the scope, components, and key characteristics of a 21st century data infrastructure, including topics such as governance, the technical skills needed, and data sharing. The second workshop will focus on identifying the technology, tools, and capabilities needed for data access, sharing, use, and analysis, while protecting privacy and confidentiality. The third workshop will explore the implications of using multiple data sources for major survey programs, including linking data to survey responses to make surveys less burdensome and more efficient.

A major limitation with current approaches towards deploying autonomous CPS is in ensuring that the system operates safely, and reliably in situations that do not happen very often under normal operating conditions and are therefore difficult to gather data on.  For instance, a self-driving car trained to follow the ?rules of the road? will perform well most of the time, but it is the unusual conditions, the edge cases, which pose the hardest safety challenges.   This project brings forward an innovative idea ? can increasing the agility of an autonomous vehicle improve its safety?  This notion is somewhat controversial since agility (like that of race cars) is more frequently associated with decreased safety margins.<br/><br/>Motivated by these challenges underlying real-world testing and safety for autonomous vehicles, the goal of this project is to develop the foundations for autonomous cyber-physical systems along two dimensions: agility, safety, and their interplay.  The project is centered on (1) increasing agility for AVs by developing new methods for agile motion planning, so they can maneuver at the limits of their handling and control when it matters most to escape potentially unsafe conditions, (2) automated reasoning about uncertain dynamic situations that may occur during autonomous CPS operation, and (3) developing novel methods for automatically generating testing and edge-case scenarios at design time, to explore scenarios under which the autonomous CPS would fail. The proposed methods will be evaluated on scaled autonomous vehicles testbeds, on photorealistic and high-fidelity simulation platforms, and on full scale AV prototypes.   The project will also consider not just safety of an unoccupied AV ? but one in which passengers may be present.  This CAREER project includes designing exciting new courses, and initiatives centered around autonomous racing to engage with research and mentoring for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. The project aims to ensure that students cultivate a holistic view of cyber-physical systems and autonomous systems by drawing stronger connections between theory, applications, and hands-on platform development. The project will help enhance the capabilities of autonomous cyber-physical systems and facilitate with their safe deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To maintain a competitive advantage, many manufacturers are implementing these new technologies to create Industry 4.0 smart factories. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) play a central role in this new automation architecture and require extensive training to implement and maintain. To meet industry needs in Northeastern Florida, Florida State College at Jacksonville will develop a new curriculum that focuses on PLCs and related automation technologies. To do so, the project will create a new track in an existing engineering technology program that will enable students to earn three national certifications in automation. Given regional demographics, this project also provides an opportunity to broaden participation of women and minorities in the advanced manufacturing workforce. For example, to increase participation in academic pathways leading to technical careers in advanced manufacturing, the project will develop a dual enrollment program in mechatronics at a local high school. In addition, it will offer hands-on learning experiences using advanced manufacturing technologies for high school students and provide professional development for high school teachers. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to increase the number of skilled technicians who can implement and maintain PLCs, robotics, and mechatronics systems. To achieve this goal, the project will:  1) implement a new, four-course PLC program track to enable students to earn national PLC industry credentials; 2) establish a new automation education lab for students including Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) learning software and PLC/automation hardware and software; 3) offer hands-on learning experiences using AR/VR software, robot literacy activities, and advanced manufacturing technologies for high school students; and 4) provide professional development for secondary and postsecondary instructors. The impact of the project on student demographics will be assessed by analyzing institutional data at the beginning and end of the project. Findings will be disseminated through national and regional venues such as the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center, the First Coast Manufacturing Association, the Florida College System, and the Northeast Florida STEM HUB.

Autonomous technologies require a variety of devices, including radar, lidar, video camera systems, communication systems, and differential global positioning systems. Truck service technicians need to be trained to troubleshoot, diagnose, repair, and calibrate these devices and vehicle control systems. However, technician training programs have not kept pace with the new technologies or the increasing demand for technicians with these skills. To address these needs, this project will offer training workshops for instructors in diesel and truck technician training programs. These workshops will help instructors enhance their training programs to include the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for maintaining autonomous technologies in vehicles.  The project is led by the Minnesota State Transportation Center of Excellence, a consortium of public post-secondary colleges with transportation programs.  The project will provide consortium members with shared access to vehicles with autonomous technologies.  These vehicles will be used for the new training programs, as well as outreach. This project intends to prepare students for technical careers in a growing field that requires new skills and understanding of autonomous technologies for vehicles.<br/><br/>The Minnesota State Transportation Center of Excellence serves as a resource hub for autonomous technologies in transportation, providing curriculum resources and subject matter experts for secondary and post-secondary educators. The goal of this project is to advance the knowledge of autonomous technologies in truck service technician programs and, thus, address the growing need for qualified, knowledgeable technicians with the ability to maintain and repair these technologies. To do so, the project will: (1) develop awareness of career opportunities and advances in autonomous technologies for secondary students, transitional workers, and veterans; (2) enhance existing technician programs through professional development for educators and curriculum development; and (3) support the technician training community with shared resources that will include a set of vehicles equipped with the latest autonomous technologies. Using faculty and student surveys, focus groups, and interviews, the project will assess the impact of career awareness activities on students, the impact of the professional development workshops on faculty, and the impact of the new training equipment on students and faculty. The project outcomes will be disseminated through national conferences and professional transportation-related associations.

Modern marine clams are economically very important not only as food for humans but also because they serve as food for other animals that humans depend on, like fish. In spite of this diversity and importance, the evolutionary history of the group is not well understood, and this project will develop a more detailed understanding of the 500-million-year evolutionary history of clams. This project will use information from DNA sequences as well as from the anatomy of modern and fossil species to reconstruct evolutionary patterns. Moreover, this information will be employed to consider various key questions such as how the pace of evolution in the group has varied through time, and further the extent to which information on rates of evolution derived from the study of DNA sequences differs from that information gathered from the study of fossils. The project will also consider why clam species in the tropics are more diverse than those found in polar regions, and how differences in ecology influence rates of evolution. This research will provide training for undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scholar, and the results will be used to develop high school lesson plans that focus on the causes and consequences of extinction. <br/><br/>This project aims to reconstruct evolutionary patterns in the highly diverse bivalve clade using information from the rich marine bivalve fossil record, along with genetic information from extant species. This group, since it evolved in the Cambrian period, has fluctuated significantly in species diversity and provides an exceptional opportunity to consider how information from fossil and extant taxa can be incorporated into phylogenetic studies. The project will also focus on how various ecological traits, including larval type, have influenced rates of speciation and extinction in the group through time. The project will first involve developing a hypothesis of relationship for all extant bivalve families using information on DNA sequences housed in GenBank, along with information from morphology. Then, building on the family-level phylogeny, a species-level phylogeny spanning all of Bivalvia will be developed with an especial focus on marine and fossil taxa. Tests will be conducted to ascertain differences in diversification rates under alternative evolutionary models applied to genetic and fossil-based phylogenies. An additional element will be to use these phylogenies to test hypotheses on why bivalves, like most other groups, show latitudinal diversity gradients. Previous studies of these diversity gradients have primarily focused on extant terrestrial taxa. This study will provide an opportunity to consider this issue in greater detail in marine organisms. Further, the study, through incorporation of fossil taxa, will consider how latitudinal diversity gradients have changed through time, adding an important temporal component not often considered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their responses to anticipated but uncertain disruptions exist on a continuum, from inaction to transformative change that fundamentally alters an urban system. We do not know enough about the factors leading cities to more or less transformative responses, inhibiting efforts to tackle such disturbances. To address this challenge, we propose the networked micro-decision context (NMDC), an arena where individuals involved in determining a policy response confer, negotiate, and act. This research assesses how two key dimensions of the NMDC?the composition of its actors and the flexibility of its structure?affect the transformative potential of governance. Via the administration and analysis of a nation-wide survey, qualitative cases studies, and social network analyses, this research yields insight into the potentially nuanced ways composition and structure affect the transformativeness of a city?s approach to disruptions linked to the climate crisis. Climate-induced disruptions share similarities with other mounting social challenges in that they are highly complex, affect multiple economic and governmental sectors, and are characterized by substantial resource interdependencies. As such, lessons this research produces can help understand and improve governance responses to other societal disruptions.<br/> <br/>This research examines and predicts when and how local governments pursue decision processes theoretically linked to a greater likelihood of transformative policy outcomes. In so doing, the research establishes the networked micro-decision context, which constitutes the micro-level, relational underpinnings of aggregate government behavior. The diversity of NMDC participants, the flexibility of its structure, and the presence of policy entrepreneurs are hypothesized as determinants of transformative governance, which is characterized by learning-focused, proactive, and risk-accepting processes. The research team leverages a mixed-methods approach to develop theory and test its generalizability, proceeding in three phases: (1) a large-n quantitative analysis, involving a nationwide survey and collection of secondary-source data; (2) in-depth case studies of 16 cities, employing interviews and archival analysis; and (3) a detailed social network analysis of the interactions that comprise the NMDC within those 16 cities. The network analysis is be coupled with the survey and interview-based findings to evaluate how a city?s likelihood of pursuing transformative governance processes around climate-related disruptions is affected by the NMDC?s balance between diversity and social cohesion; the position of climate policy entrepreneurs in the NMDC; and the NMDC?s diversity (organizationally and individually) and flexibility (operationalized as trust and fungibility).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within the drylands on Earth, the Antarctic deserts, represented in this study by the McMurdo Dry Valleys, exemplify life in extreme environments with scarce water, low temperatures and long periods of darkness during the polar winter. There is a scarcity of methods to determine water availability, data necessary to predict which species are successful in the drylands, unless measurements are done manually or with field instruments. This project aims to develop a new method of determining soil moisture and use the new data to identify locations suitable for life. Combining these habitats with known species distributions in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, results from this project will predict which species should be present, and also what is the expected species distribution in a changing environment. In this way the project takes advantage of a combination of methods, from recent remote sensing products, ecological models and 30 years of field collections to bring a prediction of how life might change in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in a warmer, and possibly, moister future climate.  This project benefits the National Science Foundation goals of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic biota and the processes that sustain life in extreme environments. The knowledge acquired in this project will be disseminated to other drylands through training of high-school curricular programming in Native American communities of the SouthWest. <br/>Part II: Technical description:                                                                                                                            <br/>Terrestrial environments in Antarctica are characterized by low liquid water supply, sub-zero temperatures and the polar night in winter months. During summer, melting of snow patches, seasonal steams from glacial melt and vicinity to lakes provide a variety of environments that maintain life, not yet studied at landscape-scale level for habitat suitability and the processes that drive them. This project proposes to integrate remote sensing, hydrological models and ecological models to establish habitat suitability for species in the McMurdo Dry Valleys based on water availability. The approach is at a landscape level in order to establish present-day and future scenarios of species distribution. There are four main objectives: remote sensing development of moisture levels in soils, combining biological and soil data, building and calibrating models of habitat suitability by combining species distribution and environmental variability and applying statistical species distribution model. The field data to develop habitat suitability and calibration of models will leverage a the 30-year dataset collected by the McMurdo Long-Term Ecological Research program. Mechanistic models developed will be essential to predict species distribution in future climate scenarios. Training of post-doctoral researchers and a graduate student will prepare for the next generation of Antarctic scientists. Results from this project will train high-school students from native American communities in the SouthWest where similar desert conditions exist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rhythmic movements are controlled by networks of nerve cells that interact with one another to produce patterns of nerve impulses that drive appropriate muscle movements. To alter movement patterns, these neural networks rely on the actions of chemical compounds called neuromodulators; these compounds alter (modulate) the properties and interactions of the cells in the network, thereby enabling them to alter the pattern of movements that are generated by the network. Such alterations include, for example, changes in the speed of the resulting behavior or the coordination of muscles that control different portions of the movement pattern. There is evidence, however, that the extent to which similar networks can be altered (""modulatory capacity"") varies among species. This project addresses two fundamental questions related to this variability in modulatory capacity: first, on an evolutionary timescale, what variables determine the extent to which networks can be modulated, and second, what factors/mechanisms underlie differences in modulatory capacity. In addition to addressing these questions using as exemplars the stomatogastric network and the cardiac network in a crab that eats only kelp versus a crab that eats many different kinds of food, the current project also prepares the next generation of scientists by (1) training high school students and undergraduates in a variety of research techniques, as well as in designing experiments and in analyzing and presenting data, and (2) providing continuity and potential expansion of the neuroscience component of a program that engages 7th grade Native Americans in Maine in science to enhance their educational aspirations and success in high school and beyond.<br/><br/>This project uses the stomatogastric and cardiac networks of closely related majoid crab species with vastly different dietary diversity to test the hypothesis that modulatory capacity is an important evolutionary substrate for diversity within any given behavior, and to ask what mechanisms underlie differences in modulatory capacity. Current data suggest that the stomatogastric network in Pugettia producta, a species that eats only kelp, is not responsive to many modulators that alter the network in another majoid, Libinia emarginata, which has a highly diverse diet. This project expands the number of neuromodulators tested, as well as examines and compares modulation of the cardiac network in the same species. The investigators use transcriptomics and mass spectrometry to identify native isoforms of peptide modulators in these majoids, then use physiological recordings to compare the modulatory capacities of the Pugettia and Libinia stomatogastric and cardiac neuromuscular systems. The prediction is that modulatory capacity in the Pugettia stomatogastric system is less than that of the opportunistic feeder, but that modulation in systems that are presumably subject to similar demands for flexibility, e.g., the cardiac neuromuscular system, is not markedly different. To examine the mechanisms that underlie changes in modulatory capacity, the investigators use transcriptomics, testing the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying decreased modulatory capacity of the Pugettia stomatogastric system is an absence or decreased abundance of receptors to those modulators. Transcriptomics results are confirmed using qRT-PCR and through expression of the receptors of the two species to compare relative binding affinities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such bias undermines science?s central means of advancing through the identification of high-quality science by peer review. It also threatens a core scientific value: that it is the science that matters, not the traits of the people involved. This project studies the fundamental process of peer review to identify how bias may be diminished and how peer review can be improved. Our findings will potentially inform journals across academic disciplines, as well as conferences, prestigious award-granting institutions, and grant-giving bodies. Bias can enter peer review at every decision juncture of a submitted manuscript: at its initial screening, when reviewers make their recommendations, and even when the final decision is made by the editor. Often, these instances of bias unfairly favor authors from majority groups by virtue of their status or self-similarity with reviewers. We propose to determine whether certain editorial and review practices could diminish such bias by investigating all aspects of peer review at an influential open access scientific journal for the biomedical and life sciences, eLife. There, we have unprecedented access to the content of all texts and discussions surrounding ~35K manuscript submissions. We propose developing a variety of measures reflective of social bias, manuscript quality, and the quality of reviews and consultations, and then using those in predictive modeling to identify qualities of scientific review that diminish bias.<br/><br/>The advance of science in the life sciences rests on a robust review process. The three projects we propose conceptualize and measure the substantive qualities of submitted manuscripts, reviews, and peer consultations using state-of-the-art techniques from natural language processing. A central task is to identify whether the substantive qualities of reviews and consultations ? particularly dialogue qualities ? can create conditions for a fairer scientific process by reducing the influence that social bias may have on decision outcomes. Our study of desk decisions will help us understand whether and how the first view of manuscripts can be fraught with problems and whether expanded consultation beyond the editor improves or worsens those problems. Our study of reviewer recommendations will help us understand the ways bias might creep into the review process and whether discussion among reviewers diminishes or amplifies such bias. Last, our study of the qualities of reviews and consultations will identify the sorts of reviews and discussions that science needs to prevent the intrusion of bias. By studying these features of scientific review, we will learn how scientific objectivity can be protected from the intrusion of implicit social bias as well as the best practices that may assist it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical component of these forecasts is understanding how variation in limiting environmental factors such as food, water, or shelter drive population fluctuations. In the absence of specific data on these factors, ecologists must use the properties of the observed variation in the data to make projections about future risk. In ecology, these forecasts often make simplifying assumptions about the underlying biology that may impact their accuracy. The project will integrate new mathematical ideas and models with empirical field observations to study the properties of populations that experience large fluctuations, allowing the PIs to test fundamental assumptions about how populations are structured. This work will focus on populations that experience regular cycles, a common phenomenon arising through factors such as competition for resources among individuals or predator-prey interactions. This work will improve both the tools used in the management and conservation of wildlife and the understanding of how external factors drive variation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The mathematical ideas and models developed in this project will use techniques similar to those that economists use to project stock market fluctuations or meteorologists use to predict paths of hurricanes; thus, the results may have important implications for many areas of general societal interest. <br/><br/>Emerging work has shown that universal laws describe the fluctuations of biological systems, regardless of the biological scale at which these processes operate. A key prediction of these laws is that the fluctuations of many biological systems will increase monotonically in response to increases in extrinsic variability, often termed ?environmental noise?. However, this scaling has only been studied in linearized models that are valid when fluctuations are small. When populations exhibit larger fluctuations, the assumptions underlying this theory break down. This project will develop the mathematics needed to study the variance scaling properties in nonlinear biological systems subject to increased environmental variation. In particular, the PIs will study the scaling properties of extrinsic noise in nonlinear biological systems focusing on how increases in the magnitude of external perturbations may drive declines in total system variance. The goal is to understand how nonlinearities in ecological systems may lead to robust or sublinear responses to environmental noise. The research scope includes developing mathematical theory to model how environmental variation interacts with highly nonlinear population dynamics, mainly for single species.  The PIs will also develop the statistical approaches to better detect the signal of the predicted variance scaling relationships from empirical population surveys. This work will be the first to determine how increases in external variability can drive increases in the stability of biological systems, an essential step in constructing a more nuanced description of how nonlinear biological systems interact with and respond to noisy environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These distributions are known to model the impact of highly consequential events that may be difficult to hedge against, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, wildfires, economic shocks, among many others.  In turn, Bayesian methods encompass the body of statistical theory that explains how to combine observed evidence with subjective beliefs. Despite the importance of the applications mentioned earlier, most of the computational methods for Bayesian inference are typically designed to efficiently study light-tailed distributions, which model events that are in some sense easier to hedge against. The project's goal is to study questions that lie at the heart of the convergence speed of computational methods for Bayesian inference with heavy-tailed target distributions. The methods studied in this project will provide the tools to design faster and more efficient algorithms to accurately predict high impact events such as those described above. Successfully enabling efficient and systematic Bayesian inference for heavy-tailed targets requires a breadth of expertise and research experience which would be very difficult to assemble within a single project without the DMS-EPSRC Lead Agency agreement. The results obtained in this proposal will be introduced in courses that will enhance broadening participation. The PI will attempt to recruit personnel from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is the study of the convergence analysis to equilibrium of Markov chains which exhibit heavy-tailed features. While this goal is theoretical in nature, its motivation comes from applications: the existing theory does not apply to randomized Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms with heavy-tailed targets, which nevertheless arise frequently in practice. Despite the fundamental importance of convergence to equilibrium analysis, there are important questions that have not been well studied in the literature. For instance, the presence of a spectral gap is known to be equivalent to the geometric convergence of a Markov chain. However, even under geometric convergence, ergodic estimators may still exhibit large deviation behavior of the heavy-tailed type for standard empirical means. Contributions in this direction will significantly extend the Donsker-Varadhan theory of large deviations (which is fundamental in probability). Conversely, Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures typically do not have a spectral gap but might nevertheless exhibit good convergence properties. Designing quickly convergence Markov chains requires dynamics that are completely different from the standard Langevin diffusion typically used in MCMC. The PI will investigate and build a systematic theoretical treatment of the convergence to equilibrium of Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures arising in randomized algorithms of computational statistics and machine learning (ML).  This project will involve students and a postdoctoral associates who will visit the research teams both in the US in the UK. This will further enhance the human resource development of these participants since they will be exposed to a broad network of collaborators and ideas. The scientific output will have a substantial impact beyond applied probability in a number of sub-areas of computational statistics and ML where such targets arise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The chemical composition of their shells varies as a function of the ocean conditions during growth. Fossil foraminifera, which are common on the seafloor, are used to reconstruct past ocean conditions and Earth?s climate history. New data show that the mix of foraminifera species present in the Northeast Pacific Ocean is changing rapidly in response to ocean warming events, commonly referred to as marine heat waves. This study will improve our ability to use temperate and high-latitude species in paleoclimate research. It will also help quantify how modern climate change is modifying the species present in this region. The study will include collecting specimens in plankton nets and sediment traps. It will quantify the species present during the sediment trap deployment and will compare the composition of their shells to ocean conditions when they grew. A small number of specimens will be grown in the laboratory and additional specimens will be used for genetic analyses.  This project will help show how modern ocean conditions impact the mix of species present in this region and how growth conditions influence the composition of their shells. This project will support two graduate students at Oregon State University (OSU) and multiple undergraduate students at OSU and at the University of South Carolina. Foraminifera shells from this research project will be imaged on a MicroCT scanner to generate 3D images. Those images will then be made available to the broader community for research and teaching purposes.  <br/><br/>The project will improve the utility of temperate and high-latitude planktic foraminifera in paleoclimate research and quantify the effects of modern climate change on foraminifera assemblages in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The main objectives are to expand our knowledge of the ecology and environmental controls on the geochemistry of temperate and higher-latitude foraminifera species, quantify their response to modern changes in oceanographic conditions (specifically marine heat waves), and constrain foraminiferal geochemical signatures as they sink to the seafloor. This will be achieved through a significant field-based and laboratory effort that includes newly collected plankton tows, short-duration ship-based culture experiments, assemblage data from archived plankton tow samples, and the deployment of two moored sediment traps. The proposed multi-pronged sampling strategy will provide critical samples needed to understand the biogeochemistry and ecology of foraminifera in this important ocean margin region, increase their utility in understanding past oceanographic conditions, and lay the groundwork for understanding how high-latitude species will respond to future climate change. Highly controlled culture experiments will quantify trace element incorporation dynamics and mechanisms responsible for intrashell trace element variability in temperate to polar species. The results of these experiments will offer important information that can be used to interpret the geochemistry of fossil foraminifera in temperate to high-latitude regions, broaden our understanding of the controls on trace element incorporation in high-latitude and temperate foraminifera species, and improve their utility in paleoceanographic reconstructions. Sediment trap, plankton tow, and cultured specimens will be analyzed for their trace element and isotopic composition. Live captured specimens will be analyzed to determine their genotype and microbiome. Foraminifera and sediment trap samples not used by the PIs in this project will be archived at the OSU Marine Geological Repository for future studies by the scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing efficient catalytic processes to transform methane, the primary component of shale and natural gas, to more valuable products is a grand challenge for the chemical industry and would have significant economic and environmental benefits. The availability of new and cost-effective methane-to-chemicals processes could incentivize the use of shale and natural gas as a chemical feedstock rather than a combustion fuel, thereby mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and facilitating a transition toward renewable energy. Currently, direct catalytic processes to convert methane to chemicals are scarce and unsuitable for commercial use. The major difficulty is that most catalytic materials must operate at high temperatures to initiate chemical conversions of methane, whereas milder conditions are needed to direct the subsequent chemistry toward desirable products. In this project, the investigators will develop a fundamental understanding of the selective conversions of methane to more valuable chemicals using well-defined oxide catalysts. Designing the catalyst structures with atomic-level precision is necessary for efficiently and selectively converting methane to chemicals. The investigators will provide opportunities for high school and undergraduate students to participate in their research, and focus on recruiting students from underrepresented groups to engage in these activities. These outreach activities seek to promote the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. <br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of how the local structure and composition of IrO2-based mixed metal oxides influence the oxidation chemistry of methane, and may be tailored to promote the selective oxidation of methane to value-added products, such as ethylene, formaldehyde or other organic oxygenates. The key idea is that atomically dispersed IrO2-sites in a less reactive oxide will induce initial methane activation at low temperature and that subsequent conversion to products will be mediated by the second, more chemically selective oxide. This research involves investigations of the structural and chemical properties of IrO2-modified TiO2 and RuO2 prepared as planar crystalline surfaces as well as nanocrystalline powders. Two general structural motifs are being investigated, namely, Ir atoms substituted into the surface lattice of the host oxide and nanoscopic IrO2 islands dispersed on the host oxide surface. These materials will be investigated using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods including ultrahigh vacuum surface science and catalyst characterization, reactor studies and density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo modeling. Key aims of the project are to systematically characterize the atomic-level structures of mixed metal-oxide surfaces of varying composition and morphology and determine how the methane oxidation chemistry is influenced by the local Ir-O structures. The project involves stringent comparisons of the results of first-principles modeling with experimental results obtained from planar crystalline surfaces and more complex nanoparticles to develop a robust understanding of the selective oxidation of methane on the mixed metal-oxides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Faults with faster loading are capable of more frequent earthquakes than faults with slower loading. When records of past earthquakes are used to estimate future fault activity, future loading on the fault is assumed to be the same as the past. However, in regions with closely spaced active faults, such as California, faults can interact so that the local loading is not constant through time. This project will use physical laboratory experiments to mimic the growth of faults in the Earth?s crust. While hundreds of thousands of years are typically required for new faults to develop and old faults to be abandoned, the same processes can be replicated within hours in an experimental apparatus. This enables direct observation and documentation of the variations in local loading on faults that happens as a system evolves. This research will produce numerical models that simulate laboratory experiments and use properties of the Earth?s crust in order to replicate the same processes acting within the Earth. Results from this study will show which regions along faults are more likely to experience changes in local loading. Information from this investigation can guide how we use records of past earthquakes to estimate hazards of future earthquakes. The project team includes women, first generation college students, and persons with disabilities. This team will strengthen the development of a diverse STEM workforce and increase scientific literacy and public engagement, through several mentoring, outreach and science communication efforts. These efforts include teaching outreach programs, developing instructional videos for the UMass Geomechanics YouTube channel and mentoring deaf and hard of hearing geoscientists and academic professionals.<br/><br/>Seismic hazards assessments of active faults rely on estimates of their long-term slip rates. These assessments presume that long-term slip rates determined from the geologic record can be reliably used to forecast future seismic hazards. However, this presumption is only valid if active faults have constant long-term slip rates. Where strike-slip fault systems host multiple active faults with irregular geometry, reorganization of the system, such as via the growth of new fault segments, may impact slip rates along nearby faults. Geologic slip records cannot always characterize slip behavior through time, nor can these records reveal the processes responsible for slip rate variations. Therefore, direct observations of fault system evolution from physical and numerical experiments are needed to characterize the processes that drive variations in long-term slip rates. In order to assess the role of fault reorganization on long-term slip rates, this project will use scaled physical experiments to directly observe fault system evolution and document slip behavior. Experiments with different fault configurations and different analog materials will be scaled to simulate a wide range of crustal faulting conditions and permit direct assessment of fault slip response to fault interaction and reorganization. Numerical models will be benchmarked and validated by comparisons to experimental data, and will utilize crustal rheology and scale to inform long-term slip rate behavior in response to strike-slip fault reorganization and interaction. The experiments will reveal the array of driving mechanisms intrinsic to a fault system that can contribute to temporal variations in fault slip rate and the time spans over which these mechanisms act. The findings from these physical and numerical experiments will help to evaluate the relative reliability of geologic slip rate records in order to estimate future slip rates at different structural locations along strike-slip faults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project examines how infant social networks and specific interactions between infants and their caregivers influence the diversity of microbes living on infants? skin. Results of this project shed light on the understudied relationship between social behaviors and the infant skin microbiome, as well as laying the foundation for future studies that connect early life microbial exposures to particular physiological outcomes. Study participants, including mothers and other caregivers, will receive personalized reports based on research results, including information about their social networks as well as the structure of their skin microbiome and how it compares to that of their infant. This project also contributes to enhancing diversity and inclusion by training undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM research in skin microbiome laboratory methods and statistical analyses. The project also has public health translational potential with respect to infant wellbeing.<br/><br/>Unlike other great apes, human mothers rely on additional caregivers, such as grandparents and older siblings, for long-term assistance with infant care. Common infant care practices, including holding and carrying, promote direct skin-to-skin contact between caregivers and infants, suggesting opportunities for skin microbes to be shared with infants. This project will investigate how social caregiving influences the infant skin microbiome, with an emphasis on the microbial similarity between the skin of infants and their caregivers. Researchers will collect skin swab samples from infants, mothers, and additional caregivers, and use microbial gene sequencing to characterize and compare the skin microbes present in the samples. Caregivers will complete questionnaires that ask about the frequency of specific practices that put them in physical contact with infants. The researchers will use these data to generate social networks that describe social relationships between infants and their caregivers, suggesting potential routes through which skin microbes are shared with infants.

In all these examples, the observable macroscale material behavior is affected by the underlying atomic or particle microstructure. The lack of understanding of the linkage between microstructure and macroscale mechanical response hinders high-fidelity predictive capacity critical to structural and industrial applications, e.g., in infrastructure, transportation, and manufacturing. To illustrate further, in manufacturing, it leads to economic losses and barriers to innovation in processing of particles, forming of metals, and additive manufacturing. Progress aimed at closing this gap is therefore important and needed to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare, as well as to secure the national defense. In addition, this grant will support an educational and outreach program to increase gender and racial equity in STEM fields, as well as to promote critical thinking and scientific literacy within the public.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to realize a computational paradigm that delivers continuum macroscopic models of far-from-equilibrium mechanical behavior with atomic or particle fidelity. In pursuit of this goal, the objective is twofold: 1) integrate information theory practices with machine learning to identify precise macroscopic state variables that would represent coarse-grained multiscale processes starting from the atomic or discrete particle behavior, and 2) use state-of-the-art physics-based variational formulation to determine the continuum evolution equations for these variables. The approach will be validated using experimental rheological data for shearing of dense packings of colloidal particles, a scientifically rich and technologically relevant example of far-from-equilibrium mechanical behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coupled with such 3D information is impressive progress in geometry processing aiming to reconstruct, analyze, and model 3D geometries. As 3D sensors become more affordable and ubiquitous, applications of geometry processing algorithms are expanding from traditional domains such as computer-aided design and architecture to integrative modules of interactive and autonomous systems in the life sciences, self-driving cars, and national defense. For these new applications, the currently dominant approach where geometry processing algorithms generate a single output (e.g., one reconstructed mesh) is not sufficient, because essential information such as the accuracy of the output, other plausible solutions, and data uncertainty in data-driven approaches is not conveyed. Such information is indispensable for critical decision making, such as whether a 3D reconstruction is accurate enough for surgery planning or bridge damage inspection, and if not where to add additional inputs to improve the reconstruction quality. This project will establish a unified and transformative framework to model and quantify uncertainties of geometry processing algorithms, and will develop new algorithms that possess uncertainty outputs.<br/><br/>This research will provide the first systematic study of uncertainty quantification for geometry processing. To this end, the project will establish an uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework that seamlessly integrates tools in probability theory, statistics, and deep generative models with core data representations and algorithms in geometry processing. Building upon a careful examination of the connection between the output and various uncertainty sources (input, algorithm, and data), the framework will incorporate a unified mixture model for encoding uncertainties via four thrusts, starting from algebraic approximations for modeling the local shape of a distribution to sampling and variational inference for characterizing mixture components. On the application side, the work will examine how uncertainties evolve in the geometry processing pipeline, starting from sensor uncertainty in scan registration and surface reconstruction to stochastic algorithms for structure detection to data uncertainty in data-driven geometry editing.  On the algorithm side, the research will develop a unified framework that outputs mixture models to approximate the output distribution derived from different uncertainty sources.

The sensory receptors that translate nanometer-sized movements into electrical events that underlie hearing, have quite different shapes and locations in the ears of vertebrates and invertebrates. Despite this, it is remarkable that all auditory receptors rely on differences in potassium concentrations between cellular compartments to power them, unlike other receptors that use sodium or calcium gradients. This project will use sensory cells in fly (Drosophila melanogaster) 'ears', which are located within its antennae, to understand the processes that lead to the development of such potassium gradients. Results from this research will generate molecular tools for measuring potassium concentrations inside and outside cells. In addition, the project will develop mathematical tools for illuminating the operation of complex cellular systems, and, as part of the broader impact objectives, it will also develop a set of experiments using equipment from Backyard Brains, which can be performed in high school biology classes and which will be designed to help students understand electrical current flow in living organisms, an idea which presents a challenge for many students. Summer workshops will give high school teachers the opportunity to use the equipment, which will then be made available for them to use in their classrooms. In addition, the project will expand the field of Computational Biology/Neuroscience at the University of Iowa by training undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Central to this proposal is the use of scolopidia, the mechanoreceptors of Drosophila ears, as a tractable model for studying the processes that establish potassium gradients. Scolopidia are cellular ensembles, consisting of sensory neurons and supporting cells. One support cell is the scolopale cell, a glial-like cell that envelops the sensory dendrites, creating a space filled with receptor lymph, which has a high potassium concentration. The project will use the powerful genetic tools developed by the Drosophila community, to identify the nature and location of ion transporters involved in generating potassium gradients. The project proposes to develop novel genetically-encoded potassium indicators to determine the ion?s concentration in the scolopale space. In addition, mathematical models that capture the dynamics of the coupled scolopale cell and its extracellular space, and that shape the electrical properties of fly ears, will be built. There is much to learn about the coupling of electrodiffusion processes between cells, to clarify the understanding of several physiological processes in cellular ensembles like epithelia. Since scolopidia are also found in mosquito ears, the research could provide new insights to help combat this prominent disease vector.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to study how evolutionary responses of an ecologically dominant plant to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and nitrogen enrichment influence the flow of carbon into and out of coastal marsh ecosystems.  The researchers plan to leverage a long-term experiment to characterize how plant traits that impact photosynthesis, the decomposition of organic matter in marsh sediments, and sediment accretion shift in response to increased carbon dioxide and nitrogen availability.  They then plan to establish the underlying genetic basis for these traits, so that changes in genetic variation can be used to confirm that evolution has taken place.  And finally, the researchers plan to quantify the consequences of changes in traits, and their associated genetic variation, for long-term carbon storage in, or loss from, highly productive marsh ecosystems.  This would enable the researchers to identify mechanistic and functional links between plant evolution and carbon cycling in coastal marshes, which face an uncertain future due to anticipated sea-level rise. Findings from this research have the potential to improve our understanding of the global carbon budget, and to foster more effective coastal restoration by advancing our understanding of marsh persistence.  Furthermore, the project can strengthen research infrastructure, create new educational and outreach opportunities, including the engagement of citizen scientists, and facilitate undergraduate research by students from groups underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>This project employs a complementary set of studies explicitly designed to bridge evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology. Using a combination of new experiments and tissue archives from an ongoing, long-term global change experiment, the researchers plan to simultaneously assay in situ genetic and genomic variation using ddRAD-generated SNPs, to characterize functional trait (e.g. maximum rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency) variation in the field, and to quantify complete marsh carbon budgets (e.g. quantifying NPP, gaseous C losses, litter decomposition rate, and belowground biomass and C accumulation).  These measurements are set in the context of more than a decade of exposure to elevated CO2 and nitrogen enrichment. To go beyond establishing associations between traits, genetic variation, and carbon flux post hoc, the researchers plan to conduct a complementary de novo quantitative genetics study of trait variation and physiology, with the intent of linking both to carbon fluxes mediated by individual plants. Establishing such mechanistic links can improve parameterization of a mechanistic model of C cycling in coastal marshes, enabling a more thorough characterization of ecosystem-level consequences of organismal evolution. Findings from this project can illustrate whether organismal evolution is an important determinant of how ecosystems function and offer new insights about how global change can directly and indirectly alter ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Digital knowledge commons like Wikipedia, open source software, and collaborative filtering systems like Reddit produce enormous social and economic value and serve as critical information infrastructure. Decades after many of the most important peer produced knowledge commons were launched, many are under attack by vandalism, disinformation campaigns, and a range of special interests. At the same time, many of the largely volunteer-based groups who sustain mature communities have been stable in membership or shrinking for years. A body of research suggests that these patterns of decline are due, at least in part, to commons becoming increasingly closed to contributions. Integrating and building on a body of social computing and social scientific research, this research will study why knowledge commons increasingly reject the work of volunteers and analyze how these communities should structure themselves to better manage growth. In doing so, the work will advance our general understanding of the relationship between collective action, public goods, and common pool resource governance.<br/><br/>In four parts, the project will attempt to (1) develop a theoretical framework to explain why online communities follow regular patterns of growth and decline and (2) conduct a series of empirical studies of wikis, open source software, and collaborative filtering sites.

Finally, the work will (4) create tools and datasets to help researchers and practitioners manage online community lifecycles. This work will be conducted in close collaboration with community managers and disseminated through a series of outreach-focused meetings, workshops, and information resources as well as through scholarly publications and university classes.  Managers of knowledge commons can use the strategies developed in this research to navigate tradeoffs between openness and closure across their communities' lifecycles.

More importantly, these agents often need to communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve their goals or satisfy their preferences. For example, in security, public safety, and environmental sustainability domains, law enforcement agencies defend against attackers and poachers. These agencies often work together with the local community to combat the actions of their opponents using communication and coordination, e.g., through community policing programs, or relying on justice collaborators. Game theory is an established paradigm for reasoning about strategic interactions among multiple decision-makers. It consists of mathematical models with the common assumptions that the players act rationally and they will try to make the best decisions to obtain their own best possible outcome. Several game-theoretic models and algorithms have been successfully deployed in the field to help law enforcement agencies allocate their limited resources in the presence of opponents. However, the problem of communication and coordination in complex environments is still underexplored. This research aims to design new game-theoretic models for multiagent communication and coordination. In addition, this research attempts to develop novel machine learning-enhanced computational frameworks for solving these games.  These will findings be applied to the real-world problems of wildlife protection and food bank operations.<br/><br/>This research seeks to establish theoretical foundations of multiagent communication and coordination in settings with varying commitment power (i.e., some agents can commit to a strategy first), make algorithmic advances, and make a transformative real-world impact. The research will provide answers to the following questions: (i) How to find the best communication and coordination strategies in large-scale multiagent interaction? (ii) How to account for the bounded rationality of human agents? (iii) How to deal with the uncertainties in the environment, e.g., noise in communication? The research consists of three thrusts for three critical classes of interactions: defender-attacker-community interaction, platform-users interaction, and mediators-agents interaction. In each thrust, the researchers attempt to answer the three questions by (i) propose new game-theoretic models and solution concepts; (ii) theoretically analyze the behavioral and computational aspects of the games and characterize the impact of coordination and communication; (iii) build human behavior models from data; (iv) propose efficient algorithms based on mathematical programming, deep learning, and multiagent reinforcement learning to compute close-to-equilibrium strategies given the human behavior models and uncertainties. The results will enrich the body of knowledge in computational game theory and transform the thriving line of work into new research topics that integrate game theory with machine learning and other research areas in and outside Artificial Intelligence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most current biomass fractionation processes face issues such as unwanted loss of carbohydrate fractions (cellulose fibers and hemicellulose sugars) and significant structure changes of lignin (aromatic compounds) during the process, both of which devalue the fractionated components. The proposed project will develop an energy-efficient, inexpensive, and value-preserving biomass fractionation system using aldehyde sulfonic acids. The success of the proposed research will directly impact the U.S. lignocellulose-based biorefinery, pulp and paper industries, and other related sectors. It will also contribute to a low-carbon bioeconomy by replacing petroleum feedstocks and reducing energy consumption in the fractionation process. The project will promote STEM education in biorefineries, bioenergy, and bioproducts (3B) through graduate and undergraduate student training (particularly female and minority students) and curriculum development. This project will also include outreach activities with K-12 students by providing lab tours, summer practicums, and research projects for the students interested in the 3B fields. <br/><br/>The proposed research uses novel aldehyde sulfonic acids (aldehyde-containing aromatic sulfonic acids) to accomplish a rapid and near-complete fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass without the need for significant biomass size-reduction pretreatment. This process not only maximizes the production of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin but it also reduces process energy consumption relative to existing methods. Using a model-based molecular design approach, aldehyde sulfonic acids with tunable structure, physical properties, and reactivity will be synthesized from inexpensive aldehyde-containing aromatics by sulfonation. Mechanistically, aldehyde sulfonic acids fractionate lignocellulose through the sulfonic acid group and then protect carbohydrates and lignin from degradation and condensation by interaction with the aldehyde group. Because of their multifunction nature as a catalyst, solvent, and preserver, aldehyde sulfonic acids are expected to fractionate centimeter-sized lignocellulose feedstocks rapidly and nearly completely under mild conditions into cleavable and upgradable lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. This research will test the central hypothesis that aldehyde sulfonic acid would be more effective and selective than current combinations of mineral/organic acids and aldehydes in fractionating lignocellulose. Mathematical models will be developed using quantitative structure-performance analysis to predict structural properties and performance of a range of aldehyde sulfonic acids. The tandem depolymerization and reversible preservation of lignin and hemicellulose will be mechanistically elucidated through these modeling studies to understand the cleavage reaction kinetics of the acid-labile linkages and the formation of protective chemical groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tiny organisms contribute approximately half of global photosynthesis, and form the base of the marine food web -- thereby supporting global fisheries and other marine ecosystem services. Understanding how these essential microbes will evolve as the oceans change is essential for predicting future shifts in marine ecosystem dynamics, global carbon cycling and climate. However, we still lack fundamental knowledge about how phytoplankton may adapt to future environmental changes. In addition, the representation of phytoplankton evolution has not yet been explicitly included in global climate models. As a result, our predictions of future carbon cycling and climate-feedbacks do not include this important mechanism (evolution) that will alter marine ecosystem dynamics. This project is developing and testing new hypotheses related to phytoplankton adaptation using a new framework that combines evolutionary theory with ecological and physical ocean models. This project investigates how phytoplankton community dynamics will be altered by adaptation in a changing ocean and the implications of these changes on ocean carbon cycling. In this age of big data, it is imperative that we provide our students with a deeper, more rigorous foundation in data analysis and experience with computational tools.  This project is generating a set of computational modules aimed at increasing the quantitative curriculum provided to environmental studies students at both the undergraduate and K-12 level. This curriculum is also being broadly distributed using online platforms.<br/><br/><br/>This project is providing new insights into phytoplankton trait adaptation in a dynamic environment by combining an evolutionary model of trait adaptation with a mechanistic, trait-based quota model for phytoplankton dynamics. By explicitly validating the model with physiology data from published experimental evolution studies and then applying the model to realistic environmental fluctuations (temperature, light and nutrient limitation) from a global circulation model, this study is scaling-up the impact of phytoplankton adaptation to the global scale. Specifically, this project is generating new hypotheses about the types of trait changes that might result from adaptation under multi-stressor selective pressure, constraining the relevant timescales for marine phytoplankton adaptation, and creating new understanding of the implications of phytoplankton adaptation for carbon cycling and ecosystem dynamics. The project is creating a novel framework for understanding the complex multi-dimensional problem of phytoplankton trait adaptation to multi-stressors and new understanding of how carbon cycling might change in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of social touch is becoming more evident as the time humans spend communicating through computers in videoconferencing, email, and text messaging increases. Social distancing guidelines required by the recent pandemic has exacerbated this issue, leading many individuals to suffer the negative effects of a lack of human touch. Without the depth and subtlety of in-person communication, remote communication causes increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation, which can have a significant impact on mental and physical health. Although prior work has created haptic devices for displaying virtual social touch, limited work has explored the acceptability of these virtual touch sensations or the role they play in virtual social interactions. The hypothesis of this research is that, as in the appearance of robots, there exist haptic sensations that produce a sensation of disgust or revulsion in the user due to a mismatch between the user's expectation (human social touch) and reality (touch from the device), creating a haptic ?uncanny valley?. The goal of this research is to explore and define the uncanny valley for haptic interactions, specifically as it relates to defining appropriate and comfortable virtual social touch.<br/><br/>This project will seek to uncover instances of virtual touch that produce feelings of disgust or revulsion in users due to a mismatch between the user's expectation and reality. Through a series of human subject studies, this work will define the parameters of the haptic uncanny valley for social touch in a set of three scenarios: (1) touch through haptic devices; (2) touch and visual representation with virtual reality; (3) touch and physical embodiment with a humanoid robot. The project will evaluate actuators, materials, control patterns, visual input, and physical embodiment for their role in the comfort of the user. By determining the existence of and parameters for the uncanny valley for social touch, this project will inform the design of future social touch systems in haptics, robotics, and virtual reality. The outcomes of this research will create design guidelines for haptics, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) designers creating physical social systems, allowing them to avoid designs that lie in the uncanny valley to create interactions that are pleasant, immersive, and socially appropriate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This program addresses a critical need for research and training while targeting the needs of traditionally underserved and underrepresented groups of neurodiverse students in engineering programs, including those with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and/or dyslexia, who are at high risk of academic failure. The REU Site will directly benefit participants by providing a positive research experience that recognizes and builds on their unique strengths to improve their self-image, encourages their persistence in engineering careers, and enhances their participation in engineering research. Additionally, the program aims to increase understanding of the challenges of neurodiverse students in traditional engineering education settings.  This knowledge provides a foundation for the future development of specialized programs that increase participation and foster the unique assets of this underrepresented group. The principal investigators will use formal and informal opportunities to inform engineering researchers and educators about the program to promote awareness about the unique talents and diverse learning needs of neurodiverse students within the engineering community. The information disseminated through this project may contribute to a change in how neurodiverse individuals are perceived by our society and our education system. It may lead to significant enhancement in the wellbeing of these individuals and their families.<br/><br/>This unique program nurtures the out-of-the-box thinking potential of neurodiverse students to advance radical solutions to the problems facing the nation?s aging water, power, or transportation infrastructure. This is accomplished by promoting the application of big data, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in tackling the engineering challenges caused by the interconnectivity, interdependency, and complexity of infrastructure systems. The magnitude of the problem demands advancing nontraditional, data-driven assessment methods and highlights the potential for incorporating AI and data-driven damage quantification methods in decision-making processes. The knowledge gained and solutions developed will establish the application of AI as a powerful tool for addressing the complex and pressing challenges posed by our nation?s aging infrastructure. This project capitalizes on the untapped strengths of an underserved population to promote creativity by encouraging novel, transformative, and radical approaches. The knowledge generated through this project regarding the experience of neurodiverse students and the obstacles they face in traditional engineering education and research settings may significantly encourage future research in learning environments and workforce development. It is anticipated that this work may also contribute to the development of more inclusive engineering programs for neurodiverse students. If retained, trained, and mentored, this underserved population of students presents significant potential to benefit society in areas in which innovation and creativity are most needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on the Mozambique Channel where ocean front ecosystems are continually being formed and reformed.  This area plays an important role in the well-being and livelihoods of many people in the area who depend on these fisheries and ocean ecosystem.  Exploitation of the ?sheries at these fronts poses a threat to the ?sheries resources which tend to concentrate in slowly sinking waters of the frontal zone thus making them vulnerable to over-exploitation.  To maintain sustainable social and natural ecosystems, it is critical to understand how these frontal ecosystems and their marine fauna and ?ora will be affected by changing climate.  This project will utilize existing satellite data from the Mozambique Channel to develop models that advance understanding of ocean fronts, and illuminate temporal and spatial dynamics of marine life using front ecosystems, including species important to commercial fisheries and to conservation.

Testing for statistical uncertainty surrounding the measured effects in these situations is difficult and existing methods do not provide precise and efficient ways to measure this uncertainty. This research project will develop new and improved methods for accessing statistical uncertainty associated with effect measurements in both situations. These situations arise routinely in economics and other social science research that addressing many policy questions, and accurate methods for assessing uncertainty are important for providing good policy recommendations. The results of this research project will help improve the quality of policy evaluation and statistical prediction and as result, provide policy makers with better advice.  This will contribute to better policy outcomes, hence foster faster economic growth in the US.<br/><br/>This research project will develop new methods to test statistical uncertainty in high-dimension data estimation in two settings.  In the first setting, we develop a general method for constructing intervals that satisfy an average coverage property: the intervals cover a prespecified fraction (95%, say) of the true effects on average. Focusing on average coverage allows us to form intervals that automatically reflect efficiency gains from data-driven regularization, including empirical Bayes methods, and estimators of a regression function based on machine learning techniques. Such gains are not possible under the usual notion of coverage, under which a coverage guarantee is required for each effect individually, not just on average. In the second setting, we focus on the usual notion of coverage. To obtain informative confidence intervals, we exploit a priori restrictions on the magnitude of the control coefficients. We show that our construction enjoys several optimality and near-optimality properties.

For example, a recent study showed a nearly 100% overestimation of particle concentrations due to a drone?s induced rotors. This project aims to understand how drone airflow affects sensor measurements and to develop mitigation strategies for ideal sensor placement and design. The outcomes and products of this research will affect numerous sub-disciplines including environmental engineering, forest service, fire monitoring, contaminant tracking, agriculture, etc. that use drones for observation, measurement, and intervention. <br/>				<br/>The overarching objective of this project is to characterize the mixing induced by drone airflow and its impact on on-board sensor measurements. The work will use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel and open-air experiments to characterize the airflow around drones and its effects on sensor measurements of suspended particulates. Quadrotor and hexarotor drones will be considered in this work as those are the most commonly used types of drones to conduct airborne measurements. CFD calculations using Large Eddy Simulation will first be conducted to simulate different sampling scenarios such as across and into a plume as well as confined and well-mixed environments. Particles will be represented as scalar tracers because of their very low Stokes number. In addition, the work will consider sensor housing and orientation to quantify its impact on the final measurements. Experimental measurements will then be conducted to validate the CFD proposed guidelines. This research will enhance our fundamental understanding of the interaction between the airflow created by a drone and measurements of suspended particulate matter and gases.

A major challenge in the development of TBI therapies is an incomplete understanding of the progressive disease that is initiated by TBI. Therefore, the goal of this CAREER award is to engineer technology to measure TBI-associated activity and use this technology to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie TBI. New understanding of TBI-associated molecular mechanisms can guide the development of new therapies for TBI and other brain disorders. The research will provide research-based training opportunities for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students to prepare them to enter the science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce. Ideas and concepts from the research will be incorporated into lesson plans in collaboration with high school teachers in order to promote broad participation in STEM fields.<br/> <br/>One existing challenge in the development of new therapeutics and clinical management of TBI is a lack of biomarkers that can measure the severity of disease and predict long-term outcomes. Proteases are key molecules in TBI disease progression and are candidates for therapeutic inhibition in TBI. Therefore, the measurement of TBI-associated protease activity may be critical to understand long-term biological outcomes and provide a greater understanding of disease. However, currently, there are no tools to measure protease activity in a living organism after TBI. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to engineer technology to measure protease activity in vivo and study the role of protease activity in TBI disease progression and therapeutic treatment. As a second goal, the technology will also be developed as a diagnostic to complement existing diagnostic paradigms in TBI. The proposed ?nanosensor? technology that will be developed is based on the ability of nanometer scaled materials to passively accumulate into the injured brain across the damaged blood-brain barrier and respond to elevated protease activity after TBI. Design criteria that will be engineered into the nanosensor include the ability to detect multiple proteases, be measured from biological fluids, and be actively targeted. The technology will be used to study protease activity in response to varying severities of TBI and in the presence of pharmacologic inhibition. The nanosensor will also be designed to integrate with a paper-based assay for a low-resource, rapid readout as a diagnostic tool that complements existing imaging and behavioral diagnostics in the clinic. This research will yield a multiplexed and targeted nanoscale sensor of protease activity. Due to the integral role proteases have across multiple diseases, including infectious diseases, tools to measure protease activity and a greater understanding of protease activity in disease have the potential to be broadly applicable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although observations critical for inferring subsurface magma motions, such as seismicity and infrasound, are being collected more and more often, we lack a theoretical framework for understanding the physical processes that give rise to such signals. This work will be a study of magma flow within volcanic conduits on short timescales, in order to understand the physical processes that give rise to a variety of eruptive phenomena. The first goal is to study volcanic activity at Kilauea volcano,  Hawai?i?, associated with  rocks falling onto an active lava lake, which cause resonant oscillations of magma within the conduit and sometimes small but hazardous explosions at the surface. These well-documented natural experiments provide a unique test for models of the shallow conduit and magma reservoir geometry as well as multiphase magma fluid properties. The second goal is to develop a high performance computing-enabled modeling framework to predict transient motions of magma in volcanic conduits under a range of flow conditions, including during explosive eruptions. This work will help bridge the gap between geophysical observations, volcano physics, and advanced computing.  The project will support graduate students in interdisciplinary scientific research, and contribute to ongoing development of ?The Volcano Listening Project?, an outreach effort dedicated to representing volcano data as sound and animations.<br/><br/>This proposal describes a study of small amplitude oscillatory magma flow in volcanic conduits.   The first goal is to study short term (tens of minutes) unrest episodes at Kilauea volcano, Hawai?i?,  associated with rock falls onto an active lava lake and from rising gas slugs. These disturbances cause ?very long period? (VLP, 5?40 s) oscillations of the multi-phase magma within the conduit, explosions, unsteady surface gas flux, and lava lake height variations, recorded on a nearby network of geophysical instruments. These well-documented natural experiments provide a unique test for unsteady conduit flow models, which will be used to invert for subsurface conduit and reservoir  geometry as well as magma  rheology and primary volatile content. Previous NSF-funded work developed a preliminary framework for modeling and inverting VLP seismic data in terms of the resonant eigenmodes of coupled conduit-reservoir systems, where fluid pressure changes cause elastic deformations of the surrounding solid Earth that are recorded  instrumentally. This framework will be applied to thousands of events spanning the ten-year lifespan of the Halema?uma?u vent on Kilauea. Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo inversions will incorporate constraints from seismicity, ground deformation, continuous gravity, petrologically-determined melt viscosity and volatile content, and lava lake geometry. The second goal is to generate a forward modeling framework to predict wave motion in complex states of magma flow.  Modeling relative motion between gas and liquid will predict surface gas flux data during transient unrest events, as well as transient explosions triggered by rockfalls. Wave-like disturbances will also be studied in the context of explosive eruptions, where such oscillatory fluid motions may play a key role in state shifts during eruptions such as the onset of fragmentation and explosive behavior. Flow in volcanic systems is typically not studied at the short timescales proposed here. Explicit consideration of non-equilibrium bubble growth and resorption, complex conduit geometry that includes branching cracks, and stratified, multiphase fluid flow with strong interfaces (such as bubble exsolution or magma fragmentation) is necessary to achieve consistency between multiple geophysical datasets.  This approach also permits a critical examination of quasi-steady conduit flow models, which can be shown to be conditionally linearly unstable to perturbations. This suggests a new approach to studying transitions in eruption style.  Finally, the study of unstable wave motions in strongly stratified multiphase systems will contribute to numerical method developments with applications beyond volcanology. Numerically resolving flow instabilities using recent developments in provably stable high-order finite difference methods provides a unique opportunity to advance models of volcanic conduit flow, discover new eruptive phenomenology, and connect with volcano monitoring efforts. The project will involve two PhD students at the University of Oregon across Earth Science and Computer Science. Software will be open-source and available to the community.  The project team will visit and collaborate with the USGS (Hawaiian Volcano Observatory) to study Kilauea. Ongoing results of modeling and seismic data analysis will be incorporated into public presentations and to ?Volcano Listening Project? outreach effort dedicated to representing volcano data as sound and animations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to answer this question in South American canopy palm trees, a diverse group that includes several geographically widespread species that vary in degree of usefulness to humans and in patterns of abundance. The research seeks to quantify the relative and combined influences of ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic processes on palm abundances. The research is expected to advance scientific knowledge by integrating perspectives from separate disciplines to achieve a more synthetic understanding of how human, ecological, and evolutionary impacts interact to shape biotic systems. The project has important societal and economic implications because palms provide food, income, and material for basic needs for millions of humans around the globe. Educational films and teaching modules produced during the project are expected to be used by thousands of high school and college students in the United States. Graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and high school teachers will receive training.<br/><br/>The research employs a multi-scale sampling design to link local ecological and microevolutionary processes to landscape patterns of abundance to test two major hypotheses: 1) that effective defenses via resistance genes (R genes) give common species the ability to escape negative density dependence, and 2) that human management over the past several millennia has promoted the abundances of useful species.  This is achieved by combining contemporary genomic analysis and aerial imaging and machine learning capable of identifying and mapping individual canopy trees over vast areas. Regular censuses provide information on survival of adults and seedlings of focal species in relation to local abundances, and a nursery experiment will further explore relationships between R gene diversity and seedling survival.  The project also tests potential impacts of Pre-Columbian humans on contemporary tree populations using paleo-ecological sampling of soil cores, including charcoal and phytolith sampling, while accounting for abiotic environment. This approach is expected to shed light on the relative and combined impacts of negative density dependence, abiotic environment, and Pre-Columbian human management, all thought to influence abundance in some way but typically treated in isolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These researchers must find ways of navigating such scrutiny while attempting to make their research meet both scientific and social goals. This project will examine how academic scientists at land-grant universities, with their explicitly public focus, adapt their work with controversial technologies to meet multiple scientific and public needs. A social scientist will be embedded with the agricultural researchers to help them reflect on their roles, responsibilities, and the meanings of their work. This will be used to produce a new model of embedded social science research that encourages scientists to think critically about the ethical impacts of their work in real-time. The result will be an enriched understanding of how scientists manage research programs involving controversial technologies and new methods for embedding social scientists in natural science groups to enhance benefits for science and society.<br/><br/>This project will combine interviews and ethnographic observations to produce a set of in-depth profiles of agricultural scientists working in genetic engineering at land-grant universities to capture differing versions of what it means to be a land-grant scientist working in the context of emergent agricultural biotechnologies. It situates these analyses within the deeply intertwined histories of the land-grant university, democratic professionalism, the political economy of biotechnology, and scientific ideas of control and responsibility. This theoretical framework challenges the boundaries of traditional studies of laboratory practices by considering the interactions scientists engage in beyond their ?contained? field trials and walled-off laboratories.

Approximately 50% of the world?s population lives within 50 miles of the coast and migration toward coastal areas is increasing.  The risks to these areas are reflected in the substantial increase in insurance and FEMA claims. This project will research and develop software systems that streamline the analysis, permitting, and implementation of nature-based coastal protection solutions that have been proven to adapt to these risks and provide environmental benefits.  This project will develop cross-cutting technologies that will enhance our knowledge of coastal sciences and engineering and leverage nature-based approaches to coastal integrity issues, leading to increasing ecological, cost, and performance advantages compared to traditional manual methods of data collection, analysis and engineering.  The empowerment of more resilient coastal communities, enhanced fisheries, and adaptive infrastructure solutions will incentivize private sector investment in these regions. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an integrated software system to prescribe intelligent coastal maintenance solutions through the automated characterization of the relationship of near-shore vegetative indicator species with shoreline protective actions. It is generally understood that shoreline stability is related to nearshore vegetative health, but the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the complex data sets with certainty levels sufficient to prescribe specific maintenance actions necessitates the investigation and development of a new analytical framework. The principal technical objective is the development of a machine learning and bayesian inference decision support tool incorporating data from existing imagery databases, multispectral UAV imagery, RTK bathymetry, and shoreline maintenance actions for experimental validation.   This approach would be applicable to a wide variety of vegetated erosional shoreline systems (i.e. wetlands, coastal dunes, and mangroves).  The anticipated result is the technical foundation of a commercial system to more efficiently manage coastal infrastructure risk at lower costs and with enhanced ecological benefits for society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our research cruise to the Galapagos Triple Junction in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean will characterize the transition from initial rifting to seafloor spreading, and the associated development of ridge axis segmentation. In this region, the western tip of the Cocos-Nazca Rift is breaking into ~0.5 Ma crust accreted on the east flank of the East Pacific Rise, and each stage in the transition from rifting to magmatic seafloor spreading can be studied.  In order to examine along-axis changes as a function of distance from the rift tip, we will collect geophysical data on morphology, gravity and magnetic variations, rock samples for chemical analyses, and water column data for identifying hydrothermal activity. Our findings on oceanic rifting will complement on-going studies of these processes in continental rift settings. <br/><br/>Our study area extends eastward from the site of initial rifting of the Cocos-Nazca spreading center to nucleation of magmatic spreading at the Hess Deep rift, to full magmatic spreading, thus exhibiting progressive stages in the initiation and development of rifting and segmentation. Multibeam bathymetry, gravity, and magnetic data will be collected to reconstruct the tectonic evolution from initial rifting through seafloor spreading, and in particular, changes in segment and offset characteristics as they develop. Chemical analysis of rock samples collected along the spreading axes and along flow lines will shed light on the evolution of mantle melting and melt delivery systems and their relationship to the tectonic segmentation.   Graduate and undergraduate students (Duke and MIT/WHOI), will participate in the cruise and on-shore research, gaining valuable seagoing experience and learning to conduct collaborative research. In addition, we will develop activities based upon this work for use in a yearly science-immersion program for minority, middle school girls."

Indeed, the heart of human adaptive systems lies in peoples? use of social networks to facilitate solutions to collective problems like resource shortfalls, information acquisition and dissemination, political turmoil, and conflict resolution. Material culture?clothing, artwork, jewelry?is often used to advertise important information about one?s personal and group identity within a social network. One way in which people do this is to adopt or manipulate the style of an object to distinguish themselves from others or more closely identify themselves with others. Archaeology is uniquely equipped, through the study of artifact style, to track the development of social networks across vast expanses of space and time. Within this broader context, Dr. Charles Egeland of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, along with several colleagues, will develop a methodology based on artificial intelligence to identify stylistic similarities among digital images of artifacts. The level of stylistic similarity among artifacts will be input into custom-coded program plugins that can produce visual, graph-based representations of the pattern and strength of social ties between archaeological sites. Two graduate students will be trained to apply artificial intelligence and software integration in a social science setting. The data, artificial intelligence methodology, and plugins generated by this project will be freely accessible online by other users, and the technique can eventually be applied to any object represented by a 2D digital image. Ultimately, this project will help clarify how humans construct and use social networks to meet challenges. <br/><br/>Dr. Egeland and his research team will examine how Paleolithic people used material culture to construct social networks and navigate the rapidly changing environments. The researcher will lead a team of archaeologists, paleoclimatologists, and computer scientists to (1) assemble a database of ~200 digital images of engraved artifacts; (2) construct an open-access, web-based application that uses artificial intelligence to identify stylistic patterns among the digital representations of the artifacts; and (3) develop custom plugins for an open-source graph analysis platform to produce visual representations of, and quantitative descriptors at multiple scales. With these data, the research team will explore how geography, environmental uncertainty, and population density influenced how people constructed and used their social networks to regulate social boundaries and offset resource shortages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These extremes are generally embedded in large-scale meterological patterns (LMPs).  For instance a drought might occur within a high-pressure center which is part of a pattern of highs and lows originating over the North Pacific and extending across the continental US.  The LMPs may in turn be generated or influenced by planetary-scale climate modes (PCMs) such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and the Arctc Oscillation (AO). Thus efforts to understand and predict extreme weather events, or to anticipate changes in their frequency and intensity due to climate change, must consider the events from a multi-scale perspective that recognizes the interplay of regional, continental, and planetary scales that contribute to them.<br/><br/>Work performed here seeks to develop a comprehensive suite of multi-scale metrics, or ""fingerprints"", for characterizing the atmospheric processes responsible for regional extreme weather events.  Once the fingerprints are developed they are used to determine the dynamical mechanisms through which larger-scale processes lead to, or strongly influence, the regional extremes.  The research also uses the fingerprints and subsequent dynamical analysis to assess the realism of climate model simulations of regional extremes and their associations with LMPs and PCMs.  One analysis technique uses the the tendency equation for geopotential height in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model to identify ""optimal modes"", meaning wave patterns which are optimally shaped to extract energy from the mean flow to achieve rapid growth over a few days.  Prior work by the Principle Investigators (PIs) and their collaborators used this approach to show that planetary-scale circulation anomalies can alter the mean state in a way that promotes the growth of an optimal mode that promotes CAOs.  Additional prior work links the long-term reduction in the summertime equator-to-pole temperature contrast to a reduction in frontal weather systems over North America, which in turn promotes dryer and warmer summers in the US.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the disruptions caused by extreme weather.

Second, the teams are comprised of a wide range of societal partners working closely with disciplinary experts. Although an improved understanding of guiding principles for engaged science are emerging through research and case study analysis at local to regional scales, sustainability scientists lack a common language and a common set of practices and approaches that can be used in many different regions and situations. This project aims to harness the collective wisdom of sustainability science researchers and leadership trainers from around the world, leading to aligned best practices and training products that can be used and adapted in regions around the world. This solutions-oriented, actionable science training will be used in academic and informal learning opportunities, improving the potential for researchers to partner effectively with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and the private sector to tackle pressing sustainability challenges.<br/><br/>This project will enable a collaboration of training and research communities that will  share knowledge, compare best practices, evaluate approaches and develop and test training materials for effective engaged science. The project will build a more coherent understanding of the central elements that allow solutions-oriented actionable research or transdisciplinary research to succeed, and provide a common framework for training in the field. The investigators plan to assemble a team of pioneering researchers and trainers who have been recognized in their region as thought leaders. The approach will be to mirror the process of transdisciplinary research?that of co-design, co-produce, and co-implement in order to create usable training products. These products will be tested in regional and global workshops in a variety of contexts by the experienced training team. After testing, the organizers will create a design guide accompanied by resources for transdisciplinary trainers and disseminate them widely throughout the regions where the researchers and trainers work as well as through global sustainability conferences and networks.

Does being tall confer evolutionary advantages? What is the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic, and when will it end? Although definitively answering these questions is challenging, evolution furnishes clues about them in the form of genetic variation. These clues can be decoded using mathematical models to analyze DNA samples from current populations. The amount of available genetic data has increased dramatically in recent years, and consequently faster and more accurate analytical methods are needed to fully utilize these rich new sources of information. This project will develop those methods. In addition, it will facilitate the creation of new curriculum materials designed to educate students about quantitative genetics and computational biology.<br/><br/>This project will develop new and scalable methods for phylogenetic and population genetic inference, with a particular focus on analyzing pathogen genetic data. Although these areas are already quite mature, historically many methods designed to analyze genetic data made modeling assumptions based on human biology and data availability. Such assumptions complicate efforts to study the genetics of species whose biology is very different from humans, even though these species can have important impacts on human health. This project addresses these shortcomings through: the creation of novel methods for phylogenetic inference which can adapt to the amount of phylogenetic signal present in the data; faster likelihood-based phylogenetic network inference methods which allow for horizontal gene transfer or other reticulate events; variational methods for rapidly inferring epidemiological parameters from pandemic data; and new applications of coalescent hidden Markov models which are faster and have less bias than existing methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current standard of care for COVID-19 patients battling SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited to supportive care, long hospitalization, and re-purposed anti-inflammatory or anti-viral drugs. Many survivors suffer long-term lung scarring that reduces respiratory function. There remains a need for effective therapeutics that prevent or reduce virus-induced lung damage and/or promote tissue healing. Recombinant human NELL1 protein has an excellent safety profile in healing tissue injuries and a virus-agnostic mode of action. NELL1 is strongly differentiated from COVID-19 therapeutics in clinical development because it can be manufactured large-scale, cost-effectively, and has broad utility in treating future viral outbreaks independent of causative virus, strain, or variant. The proposed studies will rapidly advance NELL1 towards preclinical and clinical studies using COVID-19 expedited path(s). <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of advancing NELL1 as a protein therapeutic for the treatment of viral-based respiratory damage, including damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. The first technical objective is to demonstrate NELL1 potential in promoting cell survival under hypoxic conditions and reducing inflammation in epithelial cell cultures. After NELL1 treatment and exposure to hypoxic growth conditions, the survival of bronchial epithelial cells and accumulation of reactive oxygen species will be monitored relative to no treatment controls. Similarly, inflammation will be induced in primary epithelial cells treated with NELL1 and inflammatory marker abundance and cell survival will be compared to no treatment control cells. Success is demonstrated by ?30% cell survival under each condition and a concordant reduction in reactive oxygen species and markers of inflammation in cells treated with NELL1. The second technical objective is to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of NELL1 in modulating SARS-Co-V-2 induced cytokine storm.

A personalized model can be a resource-efficient solution because it focuses on a particular user and a specific test environment for which a smaller model architecture can be good enough. However, training a personalized model requires clean voice data from the test-time user in advance, which are not always available because of the user?s privacy concerns or problems with recording. This CAREER project develops machine-learning methods to achieve the personalization goal while requiring no or few data samples from the test-time users. Because the project achieves the personalization goal in a privacy-preserving and resource-efficient way, it is a step towards a more available and affordable use of artificial intelligence for all members of society.<br/><br/>The project circumvents the lack of personal data in the context of personalized speech enhancement using no- and few-shot learning frameworks with help from adversarial and self-supervised learning. First, it verifies that a personalized system with reduced computational complexity can still compete with a generic model in speech enhancement performance. To this end, the training algorithm divides the potentially large model into multiple sub-modules, each of which handles a particular sub-problem (e.g., a particular user's utterance). If the sub-problems are defined to be mutually exclusive, the test-time inference can be made efficiently by using only the most suitable sub-module. Since the sub-module selection is done on noisy speech, it achieves personalization with no additional training on the test user's data. Second, the project explores a no-shot learning approach, in which the fundamental challenge lies in optimizing a machine learning model with no available target. To this end, an already-trained general-purpose model is fine-tuned for an unseen test environment using adversarial optimization. The third research topic handles the case when a small amount of user's clean speech is available, which falls in the category of few-shot learning. The project overcomes data shortage via a self-supervised learning method that learns effective features from noisy speech data, which are more available than the clean ones. That way, the model can be prepared for a subsequent fine-tuning step, which can be done with only a few clean user-specific speech utterances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is not yet completely known how processing in the brain gives rise to the richness of our experience. To understand how the activity of neurons contributes to the transformation of information in the brain, it is important to record neural signals across different areas of the brain with high resolution. One of the widely used tools to record neuronal activity is a needle-shaped implantable device, called neural probe that penetrates through the tissue and has multiple recording sites to capture the activity of different neurons in the brain. Given the complexity of brain, the number of recording channels on the neural probe should be increased so that more signals can be captured from the central nervous system. However, this comes at the cost of enlarging the implantable probe, causing severe damage to the brain tissue. In this project, the researchers aim to break this trade-off by designing a completely new class of ultrahigh density neural probes but with a very slim form factor to unravel the neural basis of brain function. This will be enabled by using light to carry the recorded signals from the brain. This novel scalable technology offers a unique approach for high-density neural recording that can revolutionize the design of next generation brain-machine interfaces and also new therapeutics for mitigating brain disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson?s and Alzheimer?s disease. This project provides a unique training opportunity for a new generation of students in the interdisciplinary field of neural engineering at the interface of nanotechnology, photonics, electronics and neuroscience.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this integrative research project is to design a novel ultrahigh density neural interface platform by directly recording the electrophysiology activity in the brain and encoding it into different optical wavelengths using the exquisite electro-optic properties of graphene. The optical signals will then be densely multiplexed using on-chip silicon photonic microresonators. This method will massively scale up the number of neurons which can be simultaneously recorded and will provide unprecedented sensitivity and signal fidelity. This multidisciplinary research builds on a host of technological breakthroughs to leverage (i) the exceptional electro-optic properties of graphene for encoding electrophysiology signals onto optical signals and (ii) the narrowband resonance of high-quality photonic microresonators for on-chip wavelength-domain multiplexing of many recorded neural signals.

The project establishes the efficacy of user-oriented privacy intervention strategies in altering young people?s privacy attitudes and behavior, leveraging strategies modeled after successes from other disciplines that vary in modality (text, video, or interactive format) and type (fact-based or narrative appeals). The project also examines the extent to which communication mechanisms on social media platforms (i.e., online comments) are viable entry points for users to participate in privacy preservation.

Most of these processes are carried out by proteins embedded in the membranes surrounding the cells and organelles inside; these proteins comprise one third of total proteins in plants and animals. Unfortunately, misfolding of membrane proteins is a common occurrence, either due to chemical and UV damage, aging, or genetic mutations.  To survive the constant, ongoing threat of protein misfolding, organisms are equipped with quality-control systems that detect and degrade these molecules.  Despite intense study on these pathways, the quality-control mechanisms for removing misfolded membrane proteins have remained surprisingly elusive for over two decades. This project seeks to advance our knowledge of the critical and widely conserved process of the quality-control system(s) that maintains functional and folded membrane proteins.  To attain this scientific goal, this project includes a significant component of URM education, outreach, and training to community college students.  Efforts of this project focuses on: 1) providing an iBiology Spotlight lecture to expose community college students to hands-on research, role models and careers in science; 2) incorporating and developing Course-based Research Experience modules at Miramar Community College in coordination with instructors; and 3) direct involvement of research projects in the Neal laboratory at UCSD.  Fulfillment of this research and educational plan will build and sustain interest in science, in particular for persistently underrepresented STEM students currently learning at community colleges.<br/><br/>Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD) describes a set of conserved degradation pathways that remove misfolded proteins from the ER.  Retrotranslocation is a universal feature of all ERAD pathways, entailing complete removal of misfolded substrates to the cytosol for degradation. For integral membrane substrates, this involves complete extraction of the protein, including all transmembrane spans, from the ER membrane.  Despite its commonality in ERAD, retrotranslocation of integral membrane substrates has remained a mystery.  This project builds on Dr. Neal?s discovery of a yeast rhomboid pseudoprotease Dfm1, which is a dedicated protein export factor for removing deleterious membrane proteins from the ER. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that Dfm1 and related rhomboid superfamily proteins are central mediators for removing aberrant membrane substrates, and loss of their function leads to profound cellular stress. Accordingly, the primary objectives to investigate this hypothesis are:  <br/>   1) To understand the mechanism associated with Dfm1-mediated retrotranslocation function. This objective will employ genetic, biochemical and biophysical approaches using a tractable model system, S. cerevisiae, for deep characterization of Dfm1?s retrotranslocation function. <br/>   2) Explore a newly identified stress response pathway associated with loss of Dfm1 function. This objective will use functional genomics, biochemical, and genetic approaches to define an entirely new sensing system for membrane proteins. <br/>   3) Extend acquired understanding of yeast Dfm1 function to higher eukaryotes.  This objective will determine the extent by which Dfm1?s molecular actions and functions are conserved in the related rhomboid proteins in human cells.  Overall, results emerging from this work will reveal novel mechanisms for safeguarding the membrane proteome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

COVID-19 social distancing may be required for a long period for a multitude of reasons including the uncertainty of the effectiveness of vaccines on emerging strains. Therefore, it is desired to identify mathematically principled solutions that strike an optimal balance between productivity and risk to infection through developing a ?science and engineering for social distancing?. Thus motivated, the PIs will develop (1) novel mathematical theory to better and more rigorously understand epidemic spreading on social-contact networks that undergo weekly and/or daily cycles; and (2) optimization theory to design realistic social-contact networks (e.g., using curfews for community and course scheduling for academic institutions) that both mitigate pandemics and allow an acceptable level of social/economic activity. These techniques will be applied to social-network datasets related to COVID-19 to validate theory and obtain practical knowledge. These mathematical and computational tools and related datasets will support policy makers for educational institutions, large companies, and governing bodies as they manage the economic and health impacts of COVID-19 as well as future pandemics. <br/><br/>The first goal of the project is to extend Floquet theory of ordinary differential equations to (a) characterize epidemic spreading on social-contact networks that are stochastic, time-varying, and periodic; (b) identify and analyze novel behaviors for disease dynamics that arise because the social-network?s periodicity and the disease progression change at similar time scales; and (c) study the effects of network structures that contribute to disease localization (e.g., in hub nodes and communities in the network). These questions remain underexplored for dynamically changing networks. The second goal of the project is to develop network optimization theory to design mathematically principled social-distancing protocols that can both suppress COVID-19 spreading and also maintain an acceptable level of economic and social activity. Specifically, network perturbation and optimization techniques for Floquet decompositions will be developed, and then they will be combined with non-convex optimization algorithms. To date, mathematical or even computational foundations for social-contact engineering in dynamically changing contact networks due to human activity are lacking. Finally, these techniques will be applied to social-network datasets related to COVID-19 which provide summarized and anonymized movements of individuals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without this shield, the atmosphere would have been eroded, and water would have been lost, especially when Earth was young and solar winds were intense. Hence, knowledge of Earth's earliest magnetic field can provide unique insight into the evolution of our planet's core and atmosphere. Because water is essential to life as we know it, this knowledge also bears on the origin of Earth's habitability. The only known material that can accurately record this early magnetic history is the mineral zircon, now found as tiny grains in younger sedimentary rocks. Some of these zircons are remarkable because they contain even smaller inclusions that can preserve signals of the ancient magnetic field from billions of years ago. But because these zircons are so small - only a few times thicker than a human hair - the measurement of their magnetism is extremely challenging. The investigators have developed and applied new techniques to characterize the nature of magnetic inclusions in zircons and to retrieve their magnetic signals, using a host of highly sensitive instruments. Their measurements indicate the presence of a magnetic field at least 4.2 billion years ago. These data indicate atmospheric shielding was in place. They also place constraints on the physical conditions in the core that resulted in the generation of a strong magnetic field. The investigators will fill gaps in the magnetic field history, generating data from new zircon localities in Western Australia, India and southern Africa. They will work with a team of international collaborators spanning 6 countries in multidisciplinary laboratory studies. The team will then use these new data to test the fidelity of the magnetic history, and to further explore the implications for magnetic shielding and Earth evolution. The work will support graduate and undergraduate students who will receive broad training in the field and in multidisciplinary analyses, and will include outreach to Rochester secondary schools through programs hosted for instructors and students.<br/><br/>Knowledge of the earliest history of the geomagnetic field can provide key insight into our understanding of the evolution of the core, atmosphere and Earth's habitability. The only known materials that can be accurately dated and that are able to record this history on the multi-hundred-of-million-year time scales required to advance our understanding of these fundamental issues of Earth evolution are Eoarchean to Hadean zircons bearing minute magnetic inclusions that are now found in younger sedimentary units. However, the magnetic measurement of zircons, and interrogations of their magnetizations to determine if they preserve primary signals, are formidable technical challenges requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The investigators have recently presented new paleomagnetic, electron microscope, geochemical, and paleointensity data that indicate the presence of primary magnetite inclusions in select zircons from the Jack Hills of Western Australia. These new data further support that select Jack Hills zircons record primary magnetic signals of the geodynamo, with a record extending back in time to ~4.2 billion years ago. These analyses thus indicate that shielding of the atmosphere by the magnetosphere was in place very early in Earth history. The new analyses also suggest a strong magnetic field in the Late Hadean at ~4 billion years ago which could be a signal that chemical precipitation in the core was powering the geodynamo. The team will use a paleomagnetic approach to further test and fill gaps in the paleointensity record building on recent discoveries of Eoarchean to Hadean detrital zircons at other global sites. Specifically, they will generate records spanning hundreds-of-millions of years from new localities in Western Australia, India and southern Africa. They will work with a team of international collaborators spanning 6 countries in multidisciplinary laboratory studies [including light and scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam slice and view and lift-outs, transmission electron microscopy, magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, ultra-sensitive 3-component direct current superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, scanning SQUID microscope magnetometry, sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) analyses, and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)]. The team will use these new data to test the internal fidelity of each record, test consistency between records, and further explore the implications for planetary magnetic shielding and chemical evolution of the core. The work will support graduate and undergraduate students who will receive broad training in multidisciplinary analyses. The work will contribute to Ph.D. and M.S. theses.

Within the drylands on Earth, the Antarctic deserts, represented in this study by the McMurdo Dry Valleys, exemplify life in extreme environments with scarce water, low temperatures and long periods of darkness during the polar winter. There is a scarcity of methods to determine water availability, data necessary to predict which species are successful in the drylands, unless measurements are done manually or with field instruments. This project aims to develop a remote method of determining soil moisture and use the new data to identify locations suitable for life. Combining these habitats with known species distributions in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, results from this project will predict which species should be present, and also what is the expected species distribution in a changing environment. In this way the project takes advantage of a combination of methods, from recent remote sensing products, ecological models and 30 years of field collections to bring a prediction of how life might change in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in a warmer, and possibly, moister future climate.  This project benefits the National Science Foundation goals of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic biota and the processes that sustain life in extreme environments.

During summer, melting of snow patches, seasonal steams from glacial melt and vicinity to lakes provide a variety of environments that maintain life, not yet studied at landscape-scale level for habitat suitability and the processes that drive them. This project proposes to integrate remote sensing, hydrological models and ecological models to establish habitat suitability for species in the McMurdo Dry Valleys based on water availability. The approach is at a landscape level in order to establish present-day and future scenarios of species distribution. There are four main objectives: remote sensing development of moisture levels in soils, combining biological and soil data, building and calibrating models of habitat suitability by combining species distribution and environmental variability and applying statistical species distribution model. The field data needed to develop habitat suitability and calibration of models will leverage a the 30-year dataset collected by the McMurdo Long-Term Ecological Research program. Mechanistic models developed will be essential to predict species distribution in future climate scenarios. Training of post-doctoral researchers and a graduate student will prepare for the next generation of Antarctic scientists.

The application focus will be on autonomous energy grids and distributed multi-robot teams, but the fundamental knowledge advancements can also impact other emerging critical infrastructure networks. Furthermore, the integrated research and education plan features an extensive array of activities that will train scientists and engineers and promote public understanding of data-driven control in dynamical networks, especially around issues of robustness, risk, and safety.<br/><br/>This project will significantly advance knowledge via a transformative robust and risk-aware integration of model-based control and data-based learning approaches that explicitly incorporate uncertainty from finite-data estimates. The overall approach will combine performance and robust-<br/>ness guarantees from model-based stochastic control, dynamic game theory, and risk-based distributionally robust optimization with modern non-asymptotic martingale concentration bounds and bootstrap techniques from statistics. Robustness to uncertainties in finite-data model estimates will be explicitly incorporated in two innovative ways: (1) a rich stochastic dynamic game framework that combines adversarial inputs and multiplicative noise to promote robustness to both highly-structured parametric and non-parametric uncertainties; (2) the use of axiomatic risk theory and distributionally robust optimization to guarantee meaningful risk-based safety constraints.

This project seeks to answer this question in South American canopy palm trees, a diverse group that includes several geographically widespread species that vary in degree of usefulness to humans and in patterns of abundance. The research seeks to quantify the relative and combined influences of ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic processes on palm abundances. The research is expected to advance scientific knowledge by integrating perspectives from separate disciplines to achieve a more synthetic understanding of how human, ecological, and evolutionary impacts interact to shape biotic systems. The project has important societal and economic implications because palms provide food, income, and material for basic needs for millions of humans around the globe. Educational films and teaching modules produced during the project are expected to be used by thousands of high school and college students in the United States. Graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and high school teachers will receive training.<br/><br/>The research employs a multi-scale sampling design to link local ecological and microevolutionary processes to landscape patterns of abundance to test two major hypotheses: 1) that effective defenses via resistance genes (R genes) give common species the ability to escape negative density dependence, and 2) that human management over the past several millennia has promoted the abundances of useful species.  This is achieved by combining contemporary genomic analysis and aerial imaging and machine learning capable of identifying and mapping individual canopy trees over vast areas. Regular censuses provide information on survival of adults and seedlings of focal species in relation to local abundances, and a nursery experiment will further explore relationships between R gene diversity and seedling survival.  The project also tests potential impacts of Pre-Columbian humans on contemporary tree populations using paleo-ecological sampling of soil cores, including charcoal and phytolith sampling, while accounting for abiotic environment. This approach is expected to shed light on the relative and combined impacts of negative density dependence, abiotic environment, and Pre-Columbian human management, all thought to influence abundance in some way but typically treated in isolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical component of these forecasts is understanding how variation in limiting environmental factors such as food, water, or shelter drive population fluctuations. In the absence of specific data on these factors, ecologists must use the properties of the observed variation in the data to make projections about future risk. In ecology, these forecasts often make simplifying assumptions about the underlying biology that may impact their accuracy. The project will integrate new mathematical ideas and models with empirical field observations to study the properties of populations that experience large fluctuations, allowing the PIs to test fundamental assumptions about how populations are structured. This work will focus on populations that experience regular cycles, a common phenomenon arising through factors such as competition for resources among individuals or predator-prey interactions. This work will improve both the tools used in the management and conservation of wildlife and the understanding of how external factors drive variation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The mathematical ideas and models developed in this project will use techniques similar to those that economists use to project stock market fluctuations or meteorologists use to predict paths of hurricanes; thus, the results may have important implications for many areas of general societal interest. <br/><br/>Emerging work has shown that universal laws describe the fluctuations of biological systems, regardless of the biological scale at which these processes operate. A key prediction of these laws is that the fluctuations of many biological systems will increase monotonically in response to increases in extrinsic variability, often termed ?environmental noise?. However, this scaling has only been studied in linearized models that are valid when fluctuations are small. When populations exhibit larger fluctuations, the assumptions underlying this theory break down. This project will develop the mathematics needed to study the variance scaling properties in nonlinear biological systems subject to increased environmental variation. In particular, the PIs will study the scaling properties of extrinsic noise in nonlinear biological systems focusing on how increases in the magnitude of external perturbations may drive declines in total system variance. The goal is to understand how nonlinearities in ecological systems may lead to robust or sublinear responses to environmental noise. The research scope includes developing mathematical theory to model how environmental variation interacts with highly nonlinear population dynamics, mainly for single species.  The PIs will also develop the statistical approaches to better detect the signal of the predicted variance scaling relationships from empirical population surveys. This work will be the first to determine how increases in external variability can drive increases in the stability of biological systems, an essential step in constructing a more nuanced description of how nonlinear biological systems interact with and respond to noisy environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This type of testing system can give healthcare providers key information necessary to make educated treatment decisions, and also can facilitate epidemiological studies of disease distribution patterns. This project investigates whether incorporation of a high surface area porous nanomaterial on a paper substrate can enable a new, highly sensitive, quantitative, and reliable platform for rapid diagnostic testing. The porous nanomaterial serves as the active sensing region that produces a clear optical signal change when signature molecules are selectively captured inside the pores, while the paper substrate is a simple and cost-effective fluid delivery vehicle that enables active transport of a test solution to the porous nanomaterial. The proposed work will lead to advanced understanding of fluid flow dynamics and molecular attachment in porous nanomaterials integrated with paper as well as advanced knowledge related to interfacing nanomaterials with non-traditional substrate materials. Educationally, this program will expose students to interdisciplinary research at the intersections of optics, materials science, engineering, and chemistry. A hands-on optical biosensor demonstration kit will be developed and deployed to K-12 students through shareable videos, classroom visits, and on-campus outreach activities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to demonstrate a porous silicon-on-paper optical biosensor capable of rapid, accurate, quantitative, and high sensitivity detection of protein biomarkers that will significantly advance the capabilities of rapid diagnostic testing.

This project will use naturally-occurring ?radiocarbon? (the radioactive carbon isotope 14C) to study how global carbon pools changed during that deglacial transition. The project will test previous radiocarbon evidence for a pulse of carbon release from seafloor volcanoes in the eastern Pacific Ocean at that time. That result challenges the idea that carbon release from the solid Earth is relatively slow and steady. Chemical and isotope measurements on fossil shells from deep-sea sediment cores will show whether the carbon pulse came in the form of acid or base. This will help pin down the source of the carbon. Carbon cycle models will be used to estimate the scale of these carbon pulses and their impact on ocean acidity and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Preliminary data and initial model results suggest that the carbon source was acid/base neutral. If so, then enormous quantities of carbon could have been released without causing strong ocean acidification or a strong atmospheric carbon dioxide rise. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and human activities are responsible for a large release of carbon dioxide today. Documenting the scale and nature of the natural carbon release at the end of the last ice age will help predict the environmental consequences of human carbon release. It will also help predict whether the human carbon release may be neutralized by natural processes.<br/><br/>The Gulf of California study site was selected because it contains: (1) a high-quality wood fragment-based chronology, (2) abundant and well-preserved benthic foraminifera for boron and carbon isotope analysis, (3) replicated evidence for regionally and temporally coherent 14C anomalies, and (4) known local sources of geologic carbon associated with the East Pacific Rise.  The main thrust of the proposed work comes from d11B and B/Ca measurements to establish if there was any seawater carbonate chemistry and/or pH change associated with the 14C anomalies, but the proposed work also includes a wider set of complementary isotope geochemical measurements (14C/C, d13C) to enhance the value of the database as a constraint on the possible explanations for the regional 14C anomalies. The project also includes regional and global carbon cycle modeling to assimilate the multi-proxy constraints and quantitatively assess the implied effects on global seawater carbon chemistry and atmospheric CO2. This work will inform the active debate about the contribution of deglacial carbon release to deglacial CO2 rise. The working hypothesis is that significant pulses of geologic carbon releases explain the observed 14C anomalies but would not significantly contribute to CO2 change because that carbon came in neutralized bicarbonate ion form. Overall, the study will take on a significant gap in understanding natural carbon cycle change on human-relevant timescales by collaboratively integrating novel multi-proxy measurements with carbon cycle modeling.

The first target application is to enable widespread use of nanometer-sized particles (30-150 nm) to carry cell signaling information throughout the body.

These situations arise routinely in economics and other social science research that addressing many policy questions, and accurate methods for assessing uncertainty are important for providing good policy recommendations.

Focusing on average coverage allows us to form intervals that automatically reflect efficiency gains from data-driven regularization, including empirical Bayes methods, and estimators of a regression function based on machine learning techniques. Such gains are not possible under the usual notion of coverage, under which a coverage guarantee is required for each effect individually, not just on average. In the second setting, we focus on the usual notion of coverage. To obtain informative confidence intervals, we exploit a priori restrictions on the magnitude of the control coefficients. We show that our construction enjoys several optimality and near-optimality properties.

New data show that the mix of foraminifera species present in the Northeast Pacific Ocean is changing rapidly in response to ocean warming events, commonly referred to as marine heat waves.

However, the ways that microbes are transported from one environment to another are not well understood. Each year, wildland fires emit millions of tons of smoke particles into the atmosphere and these particles likely carry microbes with them. Traditionally, wildfires have been studied in terms of direct impacts to terrestrial biota and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, but the role of smoke as an agent of biological dispersal has yet to be explored. Grasslands are one of the most widespread and frequently burned ecosystems, so this research will examine the impacts of smoke-driven microbial dispersal in tallgrass prairies of the central United States using unmanned aerial vehicles flying into smoke plumes, combustion experiments and soil incubations that mimic conditions in nature. This project uses an integrated approach to better understand the consequences of smoke to human, plant, and animal health across all environments where wildland fire occurs. The increasing size and severity of global wildfires, leading to increased interaction between biomass burning smoke and human populations, make this research relevant to a wide range of stakeholders including those interested in the potential transport of pathogenic microbes. In addition to mentoring three post-doctoral scholars, a graduate student, and undergraduate summer interns, the results will be disseminated to local communities through existing K-12 and informal learning programs at the Konza Prairie LTER and NEON sites. <br/><br/>Microbial emissions in smoke from biomass burning are both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the bioaerosols observed from wind-driven emissions, implying that wildland fire may be a globally relevant and yet-unquantified mechanism for microbial teleconnections among ecosystems. To test how smoke drives microbial metacommunity ecology, this project will use an integrated approach that compares the composition and viability of smoke source and sink microbial assemblages in field- and laboratory-based experiments. Smoke and particulate deposition during repeated prescribed fires in grasslands will be sampled over two years to characterize the relationships among fire behavior, meteorological conditions, and survival of microbes transported in smoke. Sterilized and untreated soils from similar, unburned sites will be exposed to contrasting dosages of smoke with known microbial content to compare the relative influence of selection, dispersal, and drift on soil microbial community assembly. These data will be used to build new capacity for simulating smoke microbial dispersal across scales by parameterizing microbial emission fluxes and microbial dispersion in atmospheric, chemical transport, and coupled fire-atmosphere models. Results will lend insight into the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic processes in driving microbial community ecology in systems where fire disturbances are frequent, while modeling will enable predictions of the scale and impact of smoke-related microbial dispersal. This research will inform questions about microbial gene flow, microbial pathogen epidemiology, phytopathogens, and meteorological processes, and will expand fundamental understanding of fire?s ecological significance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Trapping of liquid in a porous medium is important in a variety of technological and naturally-occurring processes, including extraction of natural resources such as petroleum.  Shale and sandstone are two types of sedimentary rock that serve as a common source of petroleum due the porosity of these types of rock.  Extracting oil from rock is an energy intensive process that only yields about 40% of the total available oil.  The remainder remains trapped inside void spaces within the rock.  Improving the extraction yield requires techniques that are prohibitively expensive and can cause greater environmental harm than the initial extraction process.  This project will investigate the hypothesis that acoustic sound waves can be used to improve the yield of petroleum from oil-bearing rock.  Sound waves are advantageous because they can travel long distances through rock and do not introduce potential sources of contamination to the petroleum reservoir.  A combination of analytical and experimental approaches will be used to describe transport phenomena related to multiphase flow through porous media.  The resulting information will yield insight into the growth, break up and phase separation of multiphase flows in porous systems that can have applications beyond the extraction of oil, such as the production and performance of paints, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and processed foods.<br/>  <br/>The overall objective of this project is to experimentally investigate acoustic separation of an oil phase from a porous oil rock analog. The results of these experiments will be used to develop a scaling model based on fundamental principles to describe oil phase separation from porous media across multiple scales. To achieve this objective, the specific tasks of the project are: (1) develop a two-dimensional experimental micromodel of oil-trapping porous media to serve as a control; (2) acoustically actuate the two-dimensional micromodel and use flow visualization and microscopic particle image velocimetry to study the resulting two-phase flow fields, and develop a three-dimensional scaling model to characterize the observed behavior as a function of injection rate, frequency, and input voltage (which is directly related to acoustic pressure and energy density); and (3) investigate and refine acoustic actuation in a three-dimensional porous oil rock analog using laser-based visualization of flows in an experimental model to validate scaling models.  The research team will collaborate with the Society of Hispanic Engineers to deliver lectures on acoustics to a Hispanic high school population of about 700 students. These lectures will utilize research products to enhance the learning experience of the students and provide them with insight into the STEM field.

This is particularly true of programs that train students in polar and climate sciences. The geosciences have long lacked diversity and are hampered by many barriers to entry for underrepresented students. The field environment associated with polar and climate research can be a barrier to students who have limited access to required equipment, supplies, or pre-field training. Under-represented students also often have limited exposure to related content in school and are confronting intrinsic cultural concerns about a career in these fields. To address these issues, the University of Maine will organize and support a conference where participants will focus on 1) developing new strategies for engaging under-represented students in polar sciences, both in the field and in the classroom; 2) developing relationships and collaborations between high school educators, informal educators who are part of the Upward Bound (UB) program and professional polar scientists; and 3) establishing a dialogue towards long-term engagement between educators and the Polar STEM community. Conference attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with students in the Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP) program. Positive undergraduate experiences and outdoor interest are two factors that have been attributed to attracting undergraduate students into geosciences, and a strong connection with mentors as well as summer research experiences are dominant factors in retention. Therefore, development of programs that provide opportunities for long term mentoring from faculty and inspiring summer field or non-field research experiences for students within target demographics is an important goal. This conference focuses on developing these opportunities for students in the Polar community by leveraging existing research and education resources. <br/><br/>This conference will support the development of new long-term collaborations focused on supporting the engagement of under-represented students in Polar STEM fields. The participants will strategize on how to improve polar STEM education through field experiences and through the development of data-centric, problem-based educational resources for the traditional classroom. These opportunities will not only benefit the attendees, but also the students whom they teach. Providing opportunities for students to learn about a career in Polar science is the first step in increasing a more diverse workforce within the field. The conference will be open to earth science educators and polar scientists from across the nation and to UB faculty and educators in Alaska, Washington, Maine, Florida and other UB programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowing phagocytic activity of blood cells is critical to determine the effectiveness of our immune system (body?s natural defense) to kill the pathogens potentially leading to stratify the high-risk individuals. Current clinical instruments are inadequate to perform phagocytosis monitoring in a rapid, automated way and requires extensive staff training, manual sample processing, long wait times, and huge cost per test. To address this unmet need, this project will design and fabricate a biosensor capable of quantifying phagocytosis requiring only a drop of blood. The project is at the nexus of micro-nano sensing, biomedical engineering, bioelectronics, microfluidics, machine learning and disease diagnostics. In proposed microfluidic biosensor, blood cells will interact with the functionalized microbeads (mimicking pathogens) and perform the phagocytosis. Different magnetic field configurations within microfluidic device will modulate the cells fluidic behavior accordingly which will in turn be identified and quantified using micro electrodes built on chip. The proposed biosensor will advance biomedical and device research and will have great potential to benefit human healthcare. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of bioelectronics, microfluidics, and machine learning. The project will also enable the integration of proposed research into PI?s educational efforts. Further, PI?s outreach activities will include engaging K-12 students, the local health-care industry, and the general public through educational lectures and making them available online for broad dissemination of knowledge. <br/><br/>The proposal will enable the development of a next generation in-vitro diagnostic platform equipped with Electronic-Sensing & Magnetic-Modulation (ESMM) modules integrated in a microfluidic chip to quantify the human blood cells ability to kill pathogens. The heterogeneity of the immune system activation in response to pathogenic infections is critical to strategize the correct clinical response to treat the patients. Quantifying blood cells natural ability to kill pathogens i.e., phagocytosis is critical to demonstrate the effectiveness of individual?s response in combating pathogens. Further, the ability to engineer/ modulate the phagocytic activity will tremendously improve the therapeutic outcomes for the infected patients. This project aims to develop a novel personalized biosensor capable of not only quantifying the phagocytic ability but also will determine appropriate therapeutics to improve phagocytes ability to kill the pathogens. The biosensor is equipped with microfluidics, microelectrodes for electronic sensing, and quadrupole magnetic configuration to modulate the blood cells behavior on-chip. Blood cells will interact with antibody conjugated magnetic particles and will perform phagocytosis on-chip. Furthermore, the proposed biosensor will be equipped with real-time data analysis using machine learning to improve the sensor performance. The proposed sensor will enable stratification of immune response of infected patients requiring only a drop of whole blood with a rapid time to result (TOR). Sensors will be benchmarked with patient clinical samples.

The project will enable a decentralized, end-to-end protocol that spans the entire vaccine user journey, from enrollment in phased vaccination to long term monitoring of adverse effects. The team will consider health equity from the perspective of trust, privacy, and inclusivity. Current systems for vaccination coordination focus on a single part of the system or require a smartphone for every vaccine recipient which aggravates the equity concerns. This project addresses such concerns through an array of user-facing solutions: QR codes on paper vaccination cards which can operate offline as well as mobile phone apps without live internet access. The standardized data sharing system consolidates both population-wide and individualized information in a single platform to increase the speed and effectiveness of the intervention, vaccination in this case, so that it can be monitored and analyzed. This enables a bird?s eye view of the cyber-physical-social ecosystem without creating a surveillance state. The project will push the boundaries of data-driven predictive analytics for pandemic response and pandemic preparedness. <br/><br/><br/>The project?s goal is to provide a user-centric solution that can aid researchers and planners of the current and future pandemics. In this project, the user?s journey and the relevant de-identified data collection is divided into four parts: (i) Digitally enhanced enrollment system for phased vaccination using digitally signed coupons, (ii) A privacy-preserving QR code based vaccination card, and a smartphone app to interface with vaccination sites without revealing any personally identifiable information to centralized servers, (iii) Proof of vaccination in a tamper-evident and secure manner available with digitally signed offline credentials, (iv) Monitoring and alert systems for adverse reactions that enable users to upload their symptoms in a cryptographically authenticated manner. The project involves building data aggregation and data dissemination solutions with varying levels of granularity for population-scale and individual scale analysis. For aggregation, to preserve the privacy of early contributors, the project will use a new generation of techniques based on secure multi-party computation. For dissemination, the project will use Split Learning and Split Inference methods invented by the investigator at MIT that may be able to better address privacy-utility trade-offs. Vaccination data is critical at all three levels: (i) logistics and monitoring of vaccines (ii) vaccination workflows and (iii) user experience before and after vaccination. This project will generate tools for an efficient data gathering monitoring system for future pandemics and emergencies of a similar nature without invasion of personal freedoms. The systems and methods are being built by a consortium of epidemiologists, engineers, data scientists, digital privacy evangelists, professors, and researchers from various institutions. Such a diverse collaboration is essential to minimize disruption to the existing vaccination system and ensure a smooth vaccination roll-out across the nation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The beginning of the current eruption was fairly low risk to the community but that could change quickly, as it did in 2018. One factor that could help forecast if this eruption might transition into a higher risk eruption is the amount of hot, gassy, and crystal-poor magma that is reaching the surface. If the magma is colder, more crystalline, and degassed this suggests that the eruption is more likely to end soon. However, if researchers detect a change in the gas or crystal content during these early stages of the eruption, they can assume this means the magma chamber is producing new, hot and gassy magma instead of erupting old, degassed and crystal-rich magma. This project will sample volcanic gas and estimate the crystal content in an attempt to characterize the deep magma feeding this eruption as old (lower risk) or new (higher risk).<br/> <br/>The project will conduct investigations on the 2020 eruption at the Kilauea summit with the goal of capturing and correlating changes in the crystal content of the lava and gas geochemistry. The researchers will use one tried-and-tested method and one experimental method to build a dynamic picture of the early stages of this eruption through 1) gas collection, and 2) hyperspectral imaging. With these techniques, they will constrain the carbon isotope ratio of the gas (an indicator of young, fresh magma), the crystal content (an indicator of stagnated, older magma), and the eruption vigor. The potential contribution of this project is to inform the forecast of the likely behavior of the current activity as well as develop a new remote method which may lead to real-time crystal contents during an eruption.

This salinity change is caused by alterations in rainfall patterns and enormous volumes of ice melt dumping into the seas. At higher latitudes, rapid salinity decline is imposing incredible amounts of stress on aquatic species, such that many populations are likely to go extinct. Among aquatic species the most abundant are zooplankton, which are free floating plankton eaten by fish. Among the zooplankton, copepods (small crustaceans) are the most abundant and important for providing the food source for coastal fisheries. This research will examine how copepod populations evolve and specifically how natural selection may rescue particular populations and result in the survival of species even in the face of climate change. The goal of this project is to use genetic data and mathematical predictions to answer the following questions: (1) How are the genomes of wild populations evolving when faced with rapid changes in salinity and temperature? (2) How will salinity and temperature influence reproduction and growth of wild populations? (3) Will changes in salinity and temperature force populations to migrate or cause them to go extinct? The researchers will address these questions by conducting laboratory evolution experiments to determine which genetic variants (alleles) are favored by natural selection during temperature and salinity change. The work will also involve mathematical models to understand whether natural selection favors genetic variants, and if this could rescue a population from extinction in the wild. The integration of  evolution into predictive mathematical models of demography is crucial for making accurate predictions of the fate of populations and species. Such research is especially important because the focal organisms (small crustaceans) are at the base of the food web and support many important fisheries throughout the world. One postdoctoral fellow, two graduate students, and several undergraduate students (including members of under-represented groups) will be trained in conducting integrative research <br/><br/><br/>Climate change is currently driving rapid changes in ocean salinity throughout the world. Drastic changes in the global water cycle are causing the freshening of high latitude coastal seas, with acutely severe impacts on estuaries. In such habitats, by the year 2100, salinity is projected to decline by up to 5 PSU, while temperatures are expected to rise by ~2-6C. Thus, rapidly declining salinity is predicted to become a potent driver threatening coastal populations. Adaptation is critical for surviving severe environmental stress that exceeds physiological thresholds, but we lack clear understanding of how responses to natural selection translate to population growth rate and demography. This proposal focuses on empirically testing the mostly theoretical concept of evolutionary rescue, where evolution proceeds with sufficient speed to forestall population decline so extirpation and extinction do not occur. The research will (1) determine the Response to Selection, by conducting laboratory natural selection experiments (experimental evolution) to quantify the genomic responses to salinity and temperature change (i.e., determine the trajectory of alleles and their selection coefficients) and then (2) reconstruct the Genotype-Phenotype Map, by performing genetic association studies, to quantify the effects of beneficial alleles on life history traits that determine absolute fitness, and finally (3) perform Eco-Evolutionary Modeling, by incorporating data on evolutionary trajectories of beneficial alleles (from #1) and fitness effects of those alleles favored by selection (from #2) into models that predict future population demography, including range shifts and probability of extinctions in response to climate change. This study will advance our fundamental understanding of mechanisms of evolutionary adaptation, by elucidating how candidate genes and their interactions could affect demography (linking genotype-phenotype-demography) and by injecting evolutionary data into predictive models of climate change impacts. Such an integration of evolution into demographic models is crucial for making accurate predictions on limits to future range shifts and probabilities of local and global extinctions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining many light-controlling components into a single chip, similar to complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips that have revolutionized the electronics industry, offers great advantages in terms of speed, bandwidth, reliability, scalability, power consumption, and etc. In order to fully exploit the benefits of PICs in free-space applications, it is crucial to have an interface that can flexibly control light when it converts between guided and free-space modes. However, conventional coupling techniques such as edge couplers and surface gratings have limited functionalities and lack of the capability to complete control over light. Although arrays of gratings can achieve more advanced functions, such as off-chip beam steering, focusing, and holographic image construction, they have large footprints and suffer from loss due to the existence of high-order diffractions. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a unified approach to achieve complex free-space optical functions on PICs. The major goal of the proposed program is to develop a hybrid architecture where metasurfaces ? ultrathin artificial surfaces which manipulate light by locally imposing abrupt changes to optical properties through engineered sub-wavelength structures also known as meta-atoms ? are directly driven by guided waves to realize complex free-space functions. The proposed program will include closely integrated educational activities (such as developing a new course on nanophotonics) designed to stimulate undergraduate and graduate students to pursue engineering career by exposing them to the exciting development of nanophotonic devices solving important societal problems in optical computing, communication, and networking. Besides, nanophotonic cloud computing tools will be developed that are free-to-run in web browsers without the need for powerful workstations that will be especially beneficial for economically disadvantaged research communities worldwide. Furthermore, outreach activities, such as organizing fun exhibitions of optics effects, will also be provided to promote the interests and participations of K-12 teachers and students in local schools and public libraries.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research program is to combine two powerful, complimentary technologies ? the integrated photonics and the metasurface ? together to develop a new architecture where metasurfaces are directly driven by the guided waves in PICs for realizing complex optical functions. The meta-atom building blocks with sizes much smaller than the optical wavelength will be placed on top of photonic integrated components. Through the metasurfaces consisting of such meta-atoms, the guided light can be molded to any desired complex light fields in free space or in PICs. The proposed research will establish a theory, design, material synthesis, and device nanofabrication platform and provide a complete photonic integrated route for complete light control. Tremendous benefits will be offered by the proposed hybrid architecture: (1) metasurfaces that are driven directly by guided waves in PICs; (2) light can be routed to different metasurfaces performing multiple complex functions on a single waveguide; and (3) PICs are now empowered with the ability to control light at the subwavelength scale. The technology will pave new exciting ways for building multifunctional photonic integrated devices with flexible access to free space and lead to a large spectrum of novel applications particularly where the grand challenges of the system size, weight, and power, performance are concerned.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Production by marine algae in the surface ocean is the largest source of DOC and its effects on the ocean carbon cycle are widely appreciated. However, the contribution of DOC from additional sources such as rivers, hydrothermal vents, and methane seeps and their impact on ocean ecology and chemistry are not well understood. Each source differs in terms of its biological utilization and age, which affects the storage and distribution of DOC among the ocean basins. Methane seeps located along continental margins are particularly significant because they may transfer globally significant quantities of carbon stored below the seafloor as natural gas and gas hydrate to the oceans. This project will investigate the production, flux, composition and potential for biological utilization of DOC at Hydrate Ridge, located offshore Oregon. Hydrate Ridge is a prominent methane seep with massive accumulations of gas hydrate and a node of the Ocean Observatories Initiative telecommunications cabled array on the Juan De Fuca tectonic plate, which provides a continuous stream of real-time regional oceanographic data. We will sample and chemically characterize methane, DOC, and other materials to provide information about where the materials originated (deep vs shallow), how they have been chemically altered, to what extent they may feed deep ocean organisms, or contribute to the long term storage of DOC in the ocean. Experiments and analysis will be conducted using sediment cores and bottom water samples collected using either the remotely operated vehicle Jason or the human occupied vehicle Alvin during a 7-day ocean expedition. Additionally, this project will place osmotically-driven pumps on the seafloor to continuously sample fluids for approximately one year, thereby allowing us to monitor the movement of methane and DOC expelled from the seafloor to the ocean and constrain processes that regulate the release of carbon to the oceans at methane seeps. This project will support one graduate student and several undergraduates from a community college in Maryland and a college located in a lower-income urban center in southeastern Massachusetts. We will disseminate project findings to the public with a series of videos for public TV. <br/><br/>This study will investigate the production, flux and reactivity of methane-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from methane (CH4) seeps at Hydrate Ridge, Offshore Oregon. The study will address four fundamental questions to determine the significance of CH4-derived DOC within the ocean carbon cycle: (1) How much CH4-derived fossil DOC do seeps contribute to the oceans? (2) To what extent is CH4-derived C incorporated into DOC during anaerobic oxidation of CH4? (3) Is seep DOC bioavailable or recalcitrant when released into the deep ocean? (4) How does the flux of DOC to the water column vary over time? We will employ an interdisciplinary strategy that includes in situ sampling, laboratory incubations, and a comprehensive analytical geochemistry program.

This occurred during a  period of peak population density and complexity with settlements established around monumental earthen constructions, including temples and ballcourts that drew people together for religious ceremony. To feed this population, local groups pooled their labor to convert natural wetlands into highly productive raised fields by digging a network of drainage canals and piling the fertile soils onto raised planting platforms. The whole system eventually failed.  Monumental constructions ceased, raised fields were no longer maintained, and people either migrated elsewhere or disbanded to live in smaller, self-sustained farmsteads. These types of collective arrangements remain imperative today as government agricultural subsidies and support programs, as well as farmer co-ops, have had varied successes and failures. The social and environmental conditions of agriculture continuously change due to climatic variability, erosion, soil fertility losses, and the willingness of individual farmers to cooperate both with each other and government institutions. These uncertainties, which have plagued all agricultural societies since the earliest domesticates, cannot be easily projected into the future, so we turn to the long-term approach of archaeology. The region of study presents the complete cycle from intensification of agricultural infrastructure to its ultimate failure.<br/><br/>The project focuses on a case study where detailed satellite and aerial remote sensing has identified remains of ancient agricultural field systems. Coring and trenching in the raised fields will reveal construction techniques and duration of use with geochemical analysis to assess soil fertility. Samples from fields will be used to date their construction and abandonment, and to determine what crops were grown in these fields through macro- and micro-botanical analysis. These data will be compared with that collected from survey and excavations as a means to reconstruct settlement history relative to raised field construction. Excavations will target households of different statuses to understand how wealth and power relationships changed over time. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on lagoon cores will model how the climate changed from the beginning to the end of this period of agricultural intensification. Together, these data will present a picture of the social, political, religious, and environmental factors that fostered an era of cooperation that led to the development of an intensive agricultural system and levels of monumentality not seen before in this region. Perhaps more importantly, the project will uncover the reasons why such collective action ceased. Regardless of the differences in scale and technology, this case shares many of the same social, political, and environmental concerns with our modern farming systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process transports heat from within the planet, in its core and mantle, to the surface.  Heat transport through the mantle is crucial for maintaining the geodynamo in the Earth's core, and the magnetic field which shields the surface from the solar wind. Mantle dynamics depends on the rate of heat transfer by convection, conduction (contact), and radiation (e.g., light). Quantifying the thermal conductivity of mantle and core materials is, thus, critical for understanding Earth?s thermal system, dynamics, and evolution. It is, however, challenging because of the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in Earth?s deep interior. Here, the researchers measure the thermal conductivity of lower-mantle minerals and core Fe-rich alloys. They carry out experiments on synthetic materials compressed at the tips of two opposing diamonds, which produces the relevant high pressures. They use high-power lasers to heat up the specimens and vary their temperature. Conductive and radiative thermal properties are extracted using state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques previously developed by the team. The project gradually unveils the physics of thermal transport at extreme conditions. It advances the Earth Sciences field, as well as adjacent fields in Materials Sciences with potential energy applications. It provides support and training to one postdoctoral associate at Carnegie Institution of Washington, and outreach towards undergraduate and high-school students. The project also fosters an international collaboration with European scientists.<br/> <br/>The thermal conductivity of materials in Earth?s interior is a key parameter in controlling the thermal history and dynamics of the planet. Thermal properties constrain processes involved in planetary accretion and differentiation, the thermal evolution of mantle and core, and the generation of Earth?s magnetic field. Here, the team focusses on constraining more accurately the heat flow through the outer core and core-mantle boundary (CMB).  Experiments in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) are combined with modeling of deep Earth temperature profiles. The team applies transient heating and broad band optical spectroscopy, two novel techniques they previously develop; these allow quantifying the conductive and radiative conductivities of the thermal boundary layer. The researchers develop a new technique ? the ""pulsed electric conductivity"" technique ? which applied in combination with transient heating allows quantifying the thermal conductivity of the outer core.  These experiments are performed on Fe-rich alloys (including the melts), and high-quality relevant minerals (e.g., single crystals of bridgmanite) synthesized in large-volume devices or in situ in the DAC. The starting materials are highly homogeneous glasses fused together in a gas-mixing aerodynamic levitation laser furnace. The project outcomes will provide accurate and consistent estimates of the heat flux through the core and the CMB. These results have strong implications for the understanding of the present-day heat flux at the CMB, the thermal history of Earth and heat transport mechanisms at the bottom of the lower mantle (e.g., via superplumes).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to sift through social media posts to identify hate speech and online attacks directed at election and other public officials.  The project?s novelties are the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to find attacks and hate speech directed at public officials in near real-time, and in the study of the networks where these attacks and toxic speech originate.  The project?s broader significance and importance are the development of methodologies that detect toxicity in social media conversations quickly and accurately, when these attacks are directed at public officials administering elections.<br/><br/>The project contributes to computer science and social science.  Identifying online attacks directed at specific public officials in streaming social media data is complex.  The first contribution of the project is building tools to determine the domain of streaming social media data to collect and analyze, as there are thousands of state, county, and local election officials.  The second contribution of this project is the use of artificial intelligence methods that adaptively seek hate speech and online attacks, in particular in situations where the adversaries try to avoid detection by shifting online identities and the language they use.  Substantively, the project contributes to the growing research on social media misinformation and harassment activities, in particular the identification of organized efforts to attack and delegitimize the work of election officials.

The project will recruit 18 prospective mathematics and science teachers, who will concurrently earn a Master of Arts in Teaching and teaching licensure. These Master Teaching Fellows will supported financially and receive professional development through their first four years of teaching in high-need secondary schools. The project features a unique focus on the development of teacher agency, which is the ability to actively plan and do things that enhance their growth as teachers.  The project intends to develop teacher agency by focusing on the authentic practice of science and mathematics.  A primary approach the project will take to engage teachers and students in authentic STEM practice will be ongoing involvement in school-based science, mathematics, and engineering fairs. To help them further engage in authentic practice, the prospective teachers will be mentored by university scientists and mathematicians on individual research projects. Through the focus on agency and authenticity, the project expects the prospective teachers will see themselves as scientists, which in turn will increase their effectiveness and commitment as STEM teachers.  It also expects that these teachers will be able to mentor their students to develop agency as STEM learners, supporting greater success of their students in STEM.  <br/><br/>This six-year  project at the University of Arkansas (UA) includes partnerships with Springdale Arkansas Public Schools, UA Center for Mathematics and Science Education, and three non-profit organizations (Springdale Education Foundation, Amazeum, and Arkansas STEM Coalition). These partnerships will serve as a framework for recruiting and preparing 18 STEM post-baccalaureates (in two cohorts of nine) for secondary teacher licensure in the disciplines of biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics and completion of the 11-month UA Master of Arts in Teaching program. A key aspect of the project is its focus on the development of personal agency (empowerment and ability in a specific domain) and its potential to impact attitudes and achievement in subjects such as science and mathematics. Agency is an important element of personal fulfillment and success but has thus far not featured strongly as a goal in teacher preparation, particularly with respect to authentic practices. Project leaders will explore questions related to efficacy of the strategies, implementation in field settings, and impacts on students. The project will follow and support the 18 teachers over the six-year award period and prepare them to be successful teachers and leaders who embrace the richness of culture and diversity as they launch a teaching career in a high-need school. The project leadership team will collect data to inform the building and dissemination of this model of STEM teacher preparation that combines engagement in authentic practice with the development of agency in the preparation of highly effective STEM teachers. This Track 2 Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When viewed on a relative scale, the fastest legged animals on the planet are the smallest of invertebrates. Organisms such as beetles, cockroaches, and mites are capable of running at speeds of tens to hundreds of body lengths per second. These remarkable feats of movement at the microscopic scale are enabled by strong limbs, robust foot attachment mechanics, and resilient exoskeleton structures that give these organisms locomotor capabilities vastly different from their larger counterparts. Yet smaller organisms also have to contend with incredibly complex and unstructured substrates that can impose step-to-step height variations equal to or larger than their leg length. This research will develop general principles of legged locomotion in complex environments which could contribute to the development of new legged robots that can move more effectively in unstructured environments. In parallel with the research aims, educational experiences for K-12, undergraduate, and academic professionals to better integrate living systems literacy into engineering curriculum will be developed. These activities include funded summer research experiences for underrepresented students in collaboration with a local Title 1 high school. At the college level, course development, hands-on training for undergraduate and graduate students, and interdisciplinary workshops for researchers in engineering and biology will be implemented. The overall goal of these efforts is to enable engagement, communication, and collaboration between engineers and biologists, facilitated through living systems literacy. <br/><br/>This research project uses modeling and experiment to develop new geometric and dynamic scaling principles for legged locomotion in centimeter- and millimeter-scale organisms. Experiments will be performed with invertebrates that vary in size by four orders of magnitude in mass (the American cockroach, the Argentine ant, and the mite). To develop geometric scaling principles between animal morphology and natural substrates, a new experimental substrate-scanning platform to identify the three-dimensional topography of natural substrates will be developed. To study the dynamic scaling principles of force production and acceleration, new force measurement platforms to measure the ground-reaction forces involved in microscale legged locomotion will be developed. These experiments will be supported by physical modeling and computational modeling to elucidate scaling laws for dynamic and geometric phenomena in legged locomotion. The combination of experiments, modeling, and theory will improve our understanding of the biomechanics of microscale legged locomotion. The overall aim of this work is to contextualize the regimes of legged locomotion across the microscopic to macroscopic scales. The research and educational aims of this work are highly interdisciplinary. Graduate and high-school students will receive extensive training in biomechanics, physics, and engineering. Students will present results of these studies at robotics, physics, and biology conferences, and the outcomes will be published in interdisciplinary journals. Thus, the broader impacts include more focused understanding of legged biomechanics, new inspiration for legged robots, new understanding of natural substrates, and training of interdisciplinary scientists. <br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the BIO Division of Biological Infrastructure Innovation Program, and the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology Program in the Engineering Directorate?s Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These specifications are traditionally gathered from stakeholders and customers during the domain-analysis and requirements-engineering phases. In contrast to deterministic software components, software components built using Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms learn their specifications from a set of collected examples rather than a set of agreed upon specifications. When the functional correctness of ML-enabled software depends only on the training data, there  can be a significant gap between specification of a real-world concept and what a collected dataset represents as the concept. The goal of this research is to define the meaning of requirements satisfaction for software with machine-learning components, and to investigate methods for engineering those requirements.   <br/> <br/>In this project, the investigators will formally specify partial requirements for Machine-Learned Components (MLCs) instead of allowing them to learn these specifications solely from a set of collected samples in an ad-hoc manner.  The goal is thus to make machine-learning components better meet requirements by augmenting the inductive nature of ML with domain analysis, in order to characterize the extent to which the dataset contains or lacks important features that are necessary to meet requirements. This project provides a framework for formally specifying partial requirements as well as validating the presence of such specifications in the collected samples, which in essence characterizes the extent to which the dataset contains or lacks features important to learning the task. The proposal considers this problem in the context of automated driving systems where the correct definition of real-world concepts is critically important for safety reasons. For example, correct image recognition is needed to classify objects to avoid; the objective is to show that combining training by datasets with partial domain models from elicited requirements can outperform brute-force ML.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All cells are surrounded by lipid membranes that are almost impermeable to water, salts or nutrients that cells need. For this reason, many membrane proteins (MPs) are inserted into the membranes that control cellular functions such as material transport, sensing, intercellular communication, cell adhesion, and energy conversion. MPs are also the targets for many therapeutic drug molecules. Knowledge of the molecular structure of MPs is necessary to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of their function and can guide the development of therapeutic drugs for many common diseases. However, MPs are difficult to study and therefore the molecular structure of most MPs is still unknown. The goal of this project is to develop broadly applicable new tools using DNA nanotechnology that will facilitate solving MP structures with cryo-electron microscopes. This project will provide research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented minority groups through several established programs, which will inform them about experimental research and potential career opportunities. Finally, introductory physics courses will be strengthened by developing modules that underline interdisciplinary aspects and applications of physical principles, and an interdisciplinary molecular biophysics course will be developed. These efforts will train the next generation of diverse, interdisciplinary leaders in STEM research and technology.<br/><br/><br/>Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is becoming the standard method for MP structure determination, but several experimental challenges have prevented solving more than 1% of human MP structures so far. The overall goal of this project is to establish DNA-lipid nanodiscs (DLNs) as a radically new customizable nanoscale lipid bilayer mimetic for single-particle cryo-EM of MPs. This DNA nanotechnology-based approach will overcome existing limitations of established bilayer mimetics and offer unprecedented control over structural, chemical and physical design parameters that could transform MP research. Such a paradigm shift involves significant risks and requires substantial exploratory development efforts. First, strategies will be developed to increase synthesis yields and to prevent lipid bilayer aggregation. Next, MP expression, purification and co-reconstitution of MPs in DLNs need to be established. Then, freezing conditions, additives and other sample preparation parameters need to be iteratively optimized to produce high quality grids for imaging. It is expected that the same or better resolutions can be achieved than with established bilayer mimetics, while providing new functionalities and unprecedented programmability. It is expected that DNA-lipid nanodiscs will initiate new research in structural biology, pharmacology, virology and bio-catalysis and therefore enhance the understanding of common diseases. The methods and models developed in this research will be made publicly available to benefit the larger scientific community researching the mechanisms of actions of drugs and vaccines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Production by marine algae in the surface ocean is the largest source of DOC and its effects on the ocean carbon cycle are widely appreciated. However, the contribution of DOC from additional sources such as rivers, hydrothermal vents, and methane seeps and their impact on ocean ecology and chemistry are not well understood. Each source differs in terms of its biological utilization and age, which affects the storage and distribution of DOC among the ocean basins. Methane seeps located along continental margins are particularly significant because they may transfer globally significant quantities of carbon stored below the seafloor as natural gas and gas hydrate to the oceans. This project will investigate the production, flux, composition and potential for biological utilization of DOC at Hydrate Ridge, located offshore Oregon. Hydrate Ridge is a prominent methane seep with massive accumulations of gas hydrate and a node of the Ocean Observatories Initiative telecommunications cabled array on the Juan De Fuca tectonic plate, which provides a continuous stream of real-time regional oceanographic data. We will sample and chemically characterize methane, DOC, and other materials to provide information about where the materials originated (deep vs shallow), how they have been chemically altered, to what extent they may feed deep ocean organisms, or contribute to the long term storage of DOC in the ocean. Experiments and analysis will be conducted using sediment cores and bottom water samples collected using either the remotely operated vehicle Jason or the human occupied vehicle Alvin during a 7-day ocean expedition. Additionally, this project will place osmotically-driven pumps on the seafloor to continuously sample fluids for approximately one year, thereby allowing us to monitor the movement of methane and DOC expelled from the seafloor to the ocean and constrain processes that regulate the release of carbon to the oceans at methane seeps. This project will support one graduate student and several undergraduates from a community college in Maryland and a college located in a lower-income urban center in southeastern Massachusetts. We will disseminate project findings to the public with a series of videos for public TV. <br/><br/>This study will investigate the production, flux and reactivity of methane-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from methane (CH4) seeps at Hydrate Ridge, Offshore Oregon. The study will address four fundamental questions to determine the significance of CH4-derived DOC within the ocean carbon cycle: (1) How much CH4-derived fossil DOC do seeps contribute to the oceans? (2) To what extent is CH4-derived C incorporated into DOC during anaerobic oxidation of CH4? (3) Is seep DOC bioavailable or recalcitrant when released into the deep ocean? (4) How does the flux of DOC to the water column vary over time? We will employ an interdisciplinary strategy that includes in situ sampling, laboratory incubations, and a comprehensive analytical geochemistry program. Data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array at Southern Hydrate Ridge will be used to provide context for field and experimental data. The composition and abundance of organic and inorganic chemical species along with the stable and radiocarbon isotope composition of pore water, bulk sediment, and water column C pools will be used to identify DOC sources and quantify fluxes from cold seeps characterized by a range of advection rates. The centerpiece of the investigation will be a 7-day research cruise to Hydrate Ridge to collect sediments, pore fluids, and water column samples, and deploy OsmoSamplers for continuous time series fluid sampling.

The project will advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by advancing a fundamental understanding of the complex dynamics that arise through the bidirectional physical interaction between human and robot agents during teleoperated locomotion. Activities planned to enhance the broader impacts of this research include efforts to enhance engineering education via active-learning activities, establish interactions with the general public, students, and professionals through outreach activities; and train the next generation of scientist leaders. <br/><br/>This CAREER project advances a fundamental understanding of the novel dynamics that arise during bilateral whole-body teleoperation of the locomotion of a humanoid robot traversing unstructured environments. Direct human-in-the-loop control of locomotion via teleoperation is one way to endow robotic assistants with human-level motor skills for physical interaction. In this project, the human teleoperator uses their body to directly command the robot's locomotor while receiving force feedback through a novel torso-mounted interface.  In contrast to conventional haptic interfaces that directly render to the operator the forces applied to the robot, the project's first research aim is to create a general mapping that renders also kinematic effect of perturbations. The second aim is to understand human motor adaptation to robot locomotion dynamics. The third aim is to achieve navigation on uneven terrain via a shared-autonomy framework in which the robot adapts to human locomotion intent by modifying its foot placement on the fly. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated through human subjects experiment. This work makes fundamental contributions to human whole-body haptics, biomechanics of locomotion, and control of legged robots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop presenters and attendees will be academic and industry leaders at the cross-over between quantum engineering and nanofabrication, and the presentations will provide overviews of the various aspects of quantum technology, as well as detailed information about the quantum capabilities of various NNCI nodes. This information will help to ensure the current facility infrastructure can best be used to enable new and ongoing projects. The workshop will also have a series of breakout sessions, where the participants will discuss the longer-term infrastructure needs of the network. The workshop outcomes will be compiled into a report that will be broadly distributed, which will enable follow-up activities on key action items developed in this three-day event.  The learning developed in the workshop will have broad benefits to the NSF and NNCI communities, and to the broader national effort on establishing a leadership position in quantum research and technology.<br/><br/>Quantum information systems are poised to change the way problems are solved in the coming decades. Similar to the computer revolution of the 20th century, quantum engineered systems offer the opportunity to access problems in the 21st century previously unattainable with conventional computing platforms. However, quantum technology is still in its infancy, and requires basic research, the kind that is supported by the NNCI network. Preparing this network for the quantum revolution is challenging, given the vastly different materials, processing, device and integration requirements compared to conventional microelectronics, and suggests a rethinking of the fabrication infrastructure that is needed. This challenge is even more acute given the fact that quantum engineered systems are based upon a diverse range of platforms including superconducting Josephson junctions, trapped ions, spin qubits using quantum dots, Majorana zero modes, color centers, and others. This workshop will seek to address the infrastructure issues in two ways. First, it will inform the community of quantum researchers that utilize NNCI facilities as to how their projects can be supported by the NNCI network. As a long-term goal, the workshop will help to inform a strategic vision for the future of quantum fabrication infrastructure, and how shared national resources can best be positioned to meet the needs of quantum engineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet this requirement, an increasingly large number of university campuses have deployed Science DMZs. A Science DMZ is a portion of the network, built at or near the edge of the campus or laboratory's network, that is designed such that the equipment, configuration, and security policies are optimized for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose computing. This project develops a secure and resilient architecture called SciGuard that addresses the security challenges and the inherent weaknesses in Science DMZs. SciGuard is based on two emerging networking paradigms, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), both of which enable the granularity, flexibility and elasticity needed to secure Science DMZs. <br/><br/>Two core security functions, an SDN firewall application and a virtual Intrusion Detection System (IDS), coexist in SciGuard for protecting Science DMZs. The SDN firewall application is a software-based, in-line security function running atop the SDN controller. It can scale well without bypassing the firewall using per-flow/per-connection network traffic processing.  It is also separated from the institutional hardware-based firewalls to enforce tailored security policies for the science-only traffic sent to Science DMZs. The virtual IDS is an NFV-based, passive security function, which can be quickly instantiated and elastically scaled to deal with attack traffic variations in Science DMZs, while significantly reducing both equipment and operational costs. In addition to these functions, the researchers also design a cloud-based federation mechanism for SciGuard to support security policy automatic testing and security intelligence sharing. The new mechanisms developed in this project are robust, scalable, low cost, easily managed, and optimally provisioned, therefore substantially enhancing the security of Science DMZs. This research encourages the diversity of students involved in the project by active recruitment of women and other underrepresented groups for participation in the project. The project has substantial involvement of graduate students in research, and trains promising undergraduate students in the implementation and experiments of the proposed approach. Moreover, the project enhances academic curricula by integrating the research findings into new and existing courses."

They have promising properties to bring new functionalities for developing next-generation information technologies, such as high-densities, ultrafast data processing speeds. Despite their potential benefits, these materials are difficult to investigate using conventional techniques. In this CAREER project, the principal investigator introduces nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging of antiferromagnetic insulators. This technique provides a new perspective to reveal emergent antiferromagnetic spin transport and dynamic behaviors. This research project is integrated with education and outreach plan that promotes the participation of underrepresented minority students into science and technology careers as well as public access to some of the most exciting developments at the forefront of materials science research.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Antiferromagnetic materials with exchange-enhanced magnon band gaps and vanishing net magnetization exhibit a wide range of exotic, unintuitive, and technically interesting phenomena. Examples include topologically protected magnetic textures, long-range spin transport, ultrafast magnetic switching, magnon Bose-Einstein condensation, and many others. Successful application of antiferromagnetic materials to functional spintronic devices requires a comprehensive understanding of these emergent material properties, which remains challenging in the current state-of-the-art. Here, the principal investigator employs nitrogen vacancy centers, optically active atomic spin defects in diamond, to perform quantum sensing and imaging of the local spin behaviors of antiferromagnetic insulators at the nanometer length scale. Exploiting the unprecedented field sensitivity and spatial resolution of nitrogen vacancy centers, the research team aims to reveal the fundamental mechanisms governing the intrinsic spin diffusion and Nel order switching in antiferromagnets. Taking advantage of the dipole-dipole interaction between antiferromagnetic magnons and nitrogen vacancy centers, the ?stretch? goal of this project is to develop antiferromagnet-based hybrid systems for next-generation quantum information technologies. The proposed research is expected to make important contributions to the burgeoning field of ?antiferromagnetic spintronics?. By developing cutting-edge quantum sensing and imaging techniques and demonstrating their operation in an ambient environment, the project provides a versatile measurement platform which can extend naturally to many other interesting magnetic systems and benefits the community in the long run by influencing future quantum sensing technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have the potential to protect human, animal, and crop plant health as well as to break down greenhouse gases to remediate our climate. However, microorganisms also cause disease and produce pollutants of Earth?s atmosphere, water, and soils. Each microbial cell ?decides? its function based on its genes and the environment in which it is living, but how genetically identical cells make different decisions is a major knowledge gap. The aim of this proposal is to understand how individual cells make these decisions based on the connection between genes and the environment. To accomplish this aim, the principal investigators will employ innovative high-throughput imaging of individual cells to quantify their decisions when placed under precise environmental conditions. The use of the fly microbiome will allow a realistic level of species diversity and environmental conditions that approximate natural environments. Such knowledge will benefit approaches to engineer microbial communities to improve health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment. Educationally, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained. In addition, both PIs will work with established programs to bring science to a large number of K-12 students from low income families. <br/><br/>This project implements a quantitative approach integrating single-cell physiology with consumer-resource theory from ecology to yield testable predictions of the impact of genetic pathways on community function. The project integrates computational microscopy and high-throughput continuous culture experiments to explicitly link the responses of individual cells to their fitness in the ecosystem. The research investigates a model gut microbiome that is natural, simple, and tractable, namely the wild fruit fly gut microbiome with ~5 stably associated species and a clear role in host fitness. Through cycles of theory and experiment, the project will 1) develop a completely parameterized consumer-resource model for the Drosophila gut microbiome, 2) quantify the role of single-cell decision-making in community dynamics, and 3) apply the model to study the dynamics of gut microbiomes in individual flies. By revealing the genetic basis of ecological fitness traits at the single-cell level and linking single-cell decisions to community function, this work will lay the foundation for genetic engineering that incorporates heterogeneity in individual organismal responses to their environment, providing a control knob to rationally tune the ecological stability of an engineered microbe in a given microbiome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, globe tomatoes are large and round, and are often used for slicing on sandwiches and burgers. Salad tomatoes tend to be small and oval shaped and eaten as snacks. Carrots and beets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, some of which are used for canning and juicing, some for the consumer market, and others for the food service market. The proper produce shape and size is also critical for growers and producers in order to efficiently harvest and process the products into soups and sauces. In many cases, the shape of the product determines its market class and is therefore closely connected to the price farmers obtain for the product. The continued improvement of crops for better yield and higher quality relies extensively on recreating the same shape of the produce. Off types and varieties that produce shapes that are not commensurate with the market class will not likely yield a commercially successful product, no matter how high it yields. Understanding the molecular aspects of shape and the application of this knowledge to other crops, will enable breeders to select for the desired morphology early in the breeding cycle. This knowledge would save time and efforts in other crops and thus would benefit societies across the world. Moreover, phone apps will be developed in collaboration with undergraduate computer science students to enable growers and breeders to evaluate produce quickly and accurately.<br/><br/>The recently discovered OFP-TRM-SUN regulon has emerged as an important paradigm in the variation in shape of produce ranging from fruits to grains. Proteins from these families are associated with microtubules that are thought to affect cell division leading to altered organ shapes. Still, much remains to be learned about this regulon and whether it extends to root crops. OFP, TRM, and SUN are members of multigene families, yet the role of most members in organ morphology is not well understood. To address these questions, the project plans to map modifiers of tomato sun and ovate in tomato; extend the regulon to carrot and table beet, and investigate the role of SUN in watermelon; discover the function of other members of the OFP, TRM, SUN family; and testing cell growth and geometry parameters by OFP-TRM-SUN. Combined, this information would lead to detailed mechanistic and fundamental insights into the regulation of organogenesis in plants and this knowledge will provide ample opportunities for crop improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important expected contribution of this project is identification of barriers facing rural high school students from low socioeconomic backgrounds to become licensed STEM high school teachers. This information is important because the project will first invest time in understanding the needs and the challenges facing the community and the students who will be served by this pathway. A key project activity will be building the necessary relationships among the local school districts, four-year institutions, and the community college leading the effort. This Capacity Building project is expected to yield a Track 1 Noyce proposal that will support students from high school, through a local community college, to four-year institutions to obtain their high school STEM teaching license.  <br/><br/>This project is led by Klamath Community College (KCC), a two-year, open access, public post-secondary institution. KCC is partnering with Southern Oregon University (SOU), a comprehensive, public university, and the Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT), a public, four-year polytechnical college, as well as local educational agencies. The project aims to create the infrastructure for a ?grow-your-own? pathway for students in high school, community college, or four-year institutions to become licensed secondary school STEM educators for rural South-Central Oregon. It will conduct a needs assessment, create formalized partnerships including dual-enrollment and articulation agreements, and systematically gather and analyze data that will guide the creation of a pathway for the licensing of secondary STEM educators. The project?s intellectual merit includes understanding the role of community colleges in identifying and addressing the needs of STEM high school teachers from a local, rural community with a poverty rate almost twice the national average.  The project?s broader impacts include the potential to motivate other community colleges to engage in capacity building for similar efforts.

A state-of-the-art 3D bioprinting systems will be used to build devices, allowing precise control of the tissue microenvironment to achieve functional and structural biomimicry.  The project will build upon preliminary achievements to create various perfusable 3D cardiac tissue constructs utilizing hiPSC-derived cardiac cells to reconstruct the dynamic microenvironment of the developing human heart. Multi-material 3D bioprinting enables creating perfusable heart chamber-like constructs, allowing for exposure of cardiac cells to varying environmental factors such as flow hemodynamics, stiffness, and tissue composition (Aim 1). The project will then explore the utility of these 3D-iDHHs to decipher microenvironmental mechanisms underlying CHDs (Aim 2).

The combined IRWTL and IRI observations will be used to study  D-region structure as determined from the data collected from the detection of ELF/VLF waves generated by the IRI facility. These studies will have a variety of broader impacts including the study of fundamental processes in plasma physics, aerosols, fluid dynamics while advancing radio science and remote sensing technology and techniques. The award will support research training and professional development of graduate students and two postdoctoral associates. The IRWTL will support the participation of both UAF undergraduate students and visiting students in scientific investigations and engineering projects. This effort fosters collaboration between three universities, an aerospace company, and a national space center.<br/><br/>The IRWTL lidar system will enhance the HAARP research infrastructure as a state-of-the-art solid state resonance lidar system using a frequency-stabilized Nd:YAG laser to achieve atmospheric illumination at the iron resonance emission wavelength at 372 nm. During geomagnetically active periods the auroral electrojet and auroral precipitation occur overhead at the HAARP site facilitating HF heating experiments to higher altitude ranges than otherwise would be the case. The IRWTL observations will yield new wind and temperature measurements in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere in both daytime and nighttime throughout the year; these results would be compared with similar wind and temperature observations obtained at the Poker Flat sodium resonance wind and temperature lidar system located in central Alaska to search for evidence of large scale structure in polar mesospheric winds. The observations, analyses and results of this activity will contribute to national and international programs, including CEDAR and SCOSTEP programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The response of an ecological system to environmental changes can shape the future of the goods and services associated with the ecosystem. Important examples include desertification and changes from high to low productivity regimes in fisheries, among others. Modeling the ecosystem state and predicting future shifts to other states requires the identification of measurable quantities that represent the state of the ecosystem. However, when the ecosystem shows spatial structure (for example, vegetation aggregates separated by bare soil, typical of semi-arid ecosystems), standard choices to represent the ecosystem state lead to erroneous predictions, unable to capture features shown by these systems across space and time. This project will combine concepts and techniques from mathematics and statistical physics to provide a novel theoretical framework able to describe reliably state shifts occurring in structured ecological systems. Such a framework will enable theoretical tools to diagnose ecosystem health and resilience as environmental conditions change and, therefore, facilitate preparedness, such as conservation strategies, against ecologically and economically costly shifts. Because aggregation occurs frequently in nature, the results of this project will be applicable to a wide variety of systems of socio-ecological importance (for instance, vegetation in ecosystems close to desertification). The project includes training through research involvement for junior researchers, to help develop the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Transitions between different states of a focal ecosystem often can be described with a single order parameter (observable representing the state of the system) and a single control parameter (factor whose change triggers the transition). For a given value of the latter, the order parameter enables the calculation of the stability landscape, a manifold that reveals key information such as potential ecological states, their basins of attraction, and the possibility of alternative stable states. When an ecosystem shows spatial regularity, however, standard approaches yield misleading results: a system-averaged order parameter neglects the underlying spatial patterns, and using the spatially-explicit population density as order parameter produces a stability landscape that erroneously detects the empty space between population aggregates as signs of extinction (and possibility of alternative stable states) even for healthy ecosystems. This project aims to offer the first framework able to represent reliably, for any dynamical system that shows spatial regularity and undergoes a phase transition, the key interactions between population dynamics, formation of non-trivial spatial aggregates, and changes in resilience occurring around the transition. The investigator will use existing theoretical models to identify an associated transition and the main features affected by it and aims to combine them in a single order parameter able to describe holistically the transition. The project involves innovative combination and development of concepts and tools associated with statistical physics and bifurcation theory (e.g. stability and perturbative analyses, numerical renormalization, Fourier transforms), typically used independently in the study of phase transitions or pattern detection. The results of this project will improve predictions and early warning signal tools for transitions in systems that show regularity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new technological innovations proposed here will more quickly identify bacteria responsible for the vast majority of blood infections while providing vital phenotypic data on antibiotics and dosages effective for treating these infections. This will improve patient outcomes through faster diagnosis and more precise antibiotic selection while also helping to combat the growing incidence of multidrug-resistant infections by reducing broad prescription of these drugs, which is critical to efforts to preserve the usefulness of existing antibiotics. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a new tests for direct-from-specimen identification (ID), antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and minimum inhibitory drug concentration (MIC) determination against Escherichia coli in blood. A significant limitation with existing standards-of-care is time required for actionable results; current approaches require 18-72 hrs. Due to the time required, physicians must make empiric antimicrobial therapy decisions that often lead to negative patient outcomes. Genotypic approaches are limited because of the varied mechanisms utilized by bacteria to evolve resistance, which can lead to false-negative results. Mass spectrometry requires colony isolation and provides ID only. Other time-consuming tests are then required for AST and MIC. Rapid phenotypic approaches are needed. To solve these problems, bacteriophage mixtures will be used that are highly specific and have demonstrated overlapping host ranges from component phages, produce a measurable signal quickly, and are well-suited to a simple automatable 96-well plate immunoassay.  Project objectives of are to: 1) develop a rapid ID and AST/MIC immunoassay using phage-specific antibodies, and 2) prove feasibility of direct-from-specimen testing in blood samples. Side-by-side comparison to the current standard-of-care diagnostic strategies will also be performed.

Because of its importance to workforce development, national security, and economic prosperity, there is a pressing need to fund broadening participation educational research with strong intellectual merit and that render findings that can be used to broadening participation throughout the engineering enterprise. This CAREER research project is motivated by the need to develop practical strategies and frameworks for helping underrepresented students successfully navigate hidden curriculum that often deter or impede their academic persistence in engineering degree programs. Research findings are likely to inform the engineering education community about negative impacts of hidden curriculum on underrepresented students' academic persistence in engineering and how to create a more inclusive engineering academic culture for all students. In engineering, there is strong need to better understand the academic and social challenges that underrepresented students often face in engineering degree programs. Conducting research studies, such as this, offers immense potential to transform engineering education and engineering practice for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This CAREER research project proposes to utilize a mixed-method, multi-institutional approach to study hidden curriculum in engineer degree programs and these curricula the motivations (i.e., emotions and self-efficacy), behaviors, and actions of engineering faculty and students at three Hispanic Serving Institutions, one Historically Black College and University, and one Predominantly White Institution. This research study comprises three phases: (a) an early stage exploratory study, (b) a design and development study, and (c) an efficacy study. More specifically, Phase 1 consists of conducting a quantitative study in civil engineering across different institutional types and classifications of institutions of higher education. Three unique surveys - focused on HC in engineering and the motivations, behaviors, and actions of engineering faculty and students - will be developed and validated. Phase 2 involves developing a set of custom-made advocacy mentoring training materials for each institution through member-checking qualitative interviews. Phase 3 focuses on expanding the project to other engineering specialties, beyond civil engineering, for each of the targeted institutions of higher learning. By including a targeted population first, followed by a wider spectrum of engineering disciplines, the findings from this project are likely to result in increased generalizability and transferability of the findings that could be used to improve engineering retention and graduation rates among underrepresented groups."

By designing from animal blueprints, engineers can create robotic systems capable of walking, running, crawling, swimming, and even flying. However, even with the advances in robotics over the past decades, robotic systems still fall short of many of the capabilities seen in biological animals.  One key difference between existing robots and their animal counterparts is that biological systems are made up of soft, adaptable materials, including muscles for actuation and neurons for control. This CAREER award investigates how to fabricate robust, adaptable actuators for biohybrid robots using living muscle, how these actuators adapt to exercise, and how to control biohybrid robots with living neurons. Additionally, this CAREER award supports educational and outreach initiatives to improve recruitment and retention of students and faculty in robotics and STEM. Accessible age-appropriate educational materials based on the research outcomes will be developed, made available to middle and high school teachers, and integrated into a graduate course on Bioinspired Robotics. The research team will host virtual and in-person outreach events to introduce students to bioinspired and biohybrid robotics. Undergraduate students will be recruited for summer research experiences in biohybrid robotics and modeling. Finally, the investigator will promote tools for recruitment and retention of faculty in robotics. <br/><br/>This 5-year CAREER project will result in bioactuators capable of interfacing with a range of robotic structures via tendon-like interfaces, bioinspired neural networks for bioactuator control, and the ability to perform basic ?programming? of biohybrid robots. Biohybrid robotics directly harnesses living tissues as renewable engineering materials. In particular, muscle-based bioactuators are self-healing, compliant, and adapt to loading. Whereas most biohybrid research to date has focused on biological materials as individual components of the system, approaches for the integrated design, fabrication, and ?programming? of robust bioactuators and biological control networks are needed to improve biohybrid robot performance and broaden applicability. To meet this need, this CAREER project will (1) enable adaptive bioactuation of a wide range of robotic peripheries through the creation of embedded biocompatible interfaces, (2) model and fabricate simple biological neural networks to control bioactuators, and (3) train integrated bioactuators and biological neural networks. Not only will the proposed research approach lead to advances in bioactuation and control, but it will also specifically focus on integrated biohybrid robot development. ?Programmable? biohybrid robots have applications in medicine where small-scale biocompatible systems could be used as self-actuating stents or medical implants, or as functional components of neuromuscular tissues-on-a-chip for drug-screening and neuroscience. The proposed research lays the foundation for addressing future challenges in biohybrid robotics, including integrating various sensing modalities into biohybrid robot systems, understanding the effect of embodiment on neuromuscular control circuits, and studying emergent dynamics in distributed biohybrid actuation systems. The research approach in this CAREER proposal will be integrated with an educational and outreach plan to (1) incorporate neuromuscular modeling in biohybrid robotics curriculum, (2) improve retention of students in robotics through biohybrid robot experiences, and (3) build tools to improve the visibility of a broad range of faculty in robotics towards improving retention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coatings are often needed to protect or functionalize surfaces, or even to create the final product itself.  It is an essential element in American manufacturing. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research promotes national prosperity in this critical area while developing new scientific insights into a complex problem. In contrast to liquid-film coating on flat substrates, liquid-film coating on non-flat discrete objects is considerably more challenging to understand at a fundamental level.  For most applications, a coating of uniform thickness is desired. However, the complex interplay between forces arising from object rotation, object curvature, gravity, viscosity, surface tension, and inertia may lead to the growth of instabilities and thus coating non-uniformities.  The overall objective of this project is to use a combination of theory, experiment, and industrial interaction to significantly advance fundamental understanding of the flow of liquid films on rotating discrete objects.  The general principles that the work aims to establish provides a firm foundation for systematic design and optimization of industrial coating processes, thereby enabling future breakthroughs that address critical industry needs.  Industrial outreach and involvement of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups complement the research activities.<br/><br/>This project uses a combination of theory, experiment, and industrial interaction to significantly advance fundamental understanding of how liquid rheology, non-circular cross sections, and end-effects influence the flow of liquid films on rotating discrete objects.  The theory involves finite-difference and finite-element simulations of generalized Newtonian liquids and viscoelastic liquids. The simulations yield predictions of coating-film thickness and stability limits as function of parameters characterizing rotation velocity, object shape, and, rheological properties.  These predictions, along with asymptotic analysis of the underlying equations, are used to generate scaling laws that provide quick and accurate estimates helpful for industrial practitioners.  The experiments involve flow visualizations using three-dimensional printed objects having non-circular cross sections and liquids having rheological properties consistent with the rheological models used in the simulations.  Film-thickness variations and the onset of instabilities are inferred from the visualizations and compared to the theoretical predictions.  The interplay between theory, experiment, and industrial interaction ultimately advances physical understanding and lead to general principles that can be applied in manufacturing processes involving the coating of discrete objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent progress on genome technologies, especially high-throughput sequencing technologies, has provided an opportunity to investigate the complexity of SVs in genomes. However, a lack of computational approaches for efficient discovery and genotyping of different types of (complex) SVs has hindered our ability to comprehensively study the complexity and diversity of SVs in genomes. The goal of this project is to develop novel combinatorial methods to provide researchers with necessary tools to better capture the diversity of SVs and their potential biological impact. The results of this research will have application in a wide range of foci in genomics, from evolution to disease. This project will also achieve broader impact by providing training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students interested in computational genomics. <br/><br/>This project seeks to develop novel computational methods to address some of the main challenges in studying SVs.

Furthermore, novel mapping-free approaches for comparative SV discovery using long-read sequencing data will be developed. This will provide the necessary methods for studying the diverse set of SVs (including hard to detect and complex SVs) in sequenced samples of any species using these technologies. A combinatorial approach will also be developed to predict the functional impact of SVs by altering the chromatin structure of the genome.

This project will (1) establish a method for measuring essential PPIs for a secreted protein and identify PPIs correlating with secretion rate. This method will be applied to Rituximab-producing CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells. (2) A novel systems biology analysis approach will be applied to unravel how changes in PPI strength impact secretion. This computational framework will help define roles of interacting proteins and prioritize PPIs for further study. (3) Expression of these interaction factors will be modulated to validate their role in mAb secretion. (4) Finally, product-specific vs. more general PPIs used for protein secretion will be identified by quantifying PPIs for additional Fc-fusion proteins and comparing how much the secretory pathway needs differ across secreted proteins. The tools developed by this project will guide host cell engineering for biomanufacturing of diverse proteins and will provide deep insights into the functions of the mammalian secretory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It offers foundational research for an exploration of the relationship between the marine insurance industry and the trans-Atlantic trade in human beings across more than one hundred years. Through this work, the project traces a complete circuit of value across the trans-Atlantic slave trade?from the price for which enslaved persons were sold on the coast of Africa, to the price for which they were insured as cargo, to the price for which they were auctioned, to the price for which they were later insured or rented out as a workers. This research contributes significantly to the resurgent interest in making sense of the role enslavement played in shaping techniques of accounting, risk management, and actuarial science. Data will be used to expand the Treasury of Weary Souls, a public database of policies that insured enslaved persons as property.<br/><br/>This research is comprised of three activities that produce two outcomes.  First, it conducts a systematic scoping review and qualitative coding of the remaining records of known individual underwriters in London during the eighteenth century. Second, it conducts a systematic scoping review and qualitative coding of insurance-focused archival collections for records pertaining to the trade of enslaved Africans as well as a reevaluation of slavery-focused archival collections for records pertaining to insurance. Third, it conducts preliminary archival research on the relationship between the slave trade and insurance in western Europe as well as the insurance of slave-produced goods returning to Europe. This research produces traditional scholarly output including articles and a book.  Through our methodological innovations, our publications, and our database, we will generate foundational material for scholars and the public to better understand the role of still-in-use risk-assessment techniques and financial instruments that have their roots in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their responses to anticipated but uncertain disruptions exist on a continuum, from inaction to transformative change that fundamentally alters an urban system. We do not know enough about the factors leading cities to more or less transformative responses, inhibiting efforts to tackle such disturbances. To address this challenge, we propose the networked micro-decision context (NMDC), an arena where individuals involved in determining a policy response confer, negotiate, and act. This research assesses how two key dimensions of the NMDC?the composition of its actors and the flexibility of its structure?affect the transformative potential of governance. Via the administration and analysis of a nation-wide survey, qualitative cases studies, and social network analyses, this research yields insight into the potentially nuanced ways composition and structure affect the transformativeness of a city?s approach to disruptions linked to the climate crisis. Climate-induced disruptions share similarities with other mounting social challenges in that they are highly complex, affect multiple economic and governmental sectors, and are characterized by substantial resource interdependencies. As such, lessons this research produces can help understand and improve governance responses to other societal disruptions.<br/> <br/>This research examines and predicts when and how local governments pursue decision processes theoretically linked to a greater likelihood of transformative policy outcomes. In so doing, the research establishes the networked micro-decision context, which constitutes the micro-level, relational underpinnings of aggregate government behavior. The diversity of NMDC participants, the flexibility of its structure, and the presence of policy entrepreneurs are hypothesized as determinants of transformative governance, which is characterized by learning-focused, proactive, and risk-accepting processes. The research team leverages a mixed-methods approach to develop theory and test its generalizability, proceeding in three phases: (1) a large-n quantitative analysis, involving a nationwide survey and collection of secondary-source data; (2) in-depth case studies of 16 cities, employing interviews and archival analysis; and (3) a detailed social network analysis of the interactions that comprise the NMDC within those 16 cities. The network analysis is be coupled with the survey and interview-based findings to evaluate how a city?s likelihood of pursuing transformative governance processes around climate-related disruptions is affected by the NMDC?s balance between diversity and social cohesion; the position of climate policy entrepreneurs in the NMDC; and the NMDC?s diversity (organizationally and individually) and flexibility (operationalized as trust and fungibility).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CO2 enters plants through small openings on leaves, called stomata, while water is taken up by roots in the ground and transported to the leaves by plants? vascular systems. How efficiently the plant stomata and vascular systems work to supply water and CO2 to the plant ? through a process called plant hydraulic regulation ? depends on a range of environmental conditions (e.g., dryness in the soil and in the air) and plant characteristics. This project will use the mathematical optimization of plant performance to understand how hydraulic regulation impacts stomatal openings (at the leaf scale), carbon use and storage (at the whole-plant scale), and the spatial distribution of plant types (at the ecosystem scale) over different timescales of environmental variation. New insight into how plants cope with variation in environmental conditions can be used to more accurately incorporate plant hydraulic regulation into modeling frameworks, which would allow more accurate predictions of global water, carbon, and energy cycles. Additionally, this project aims to promote systems thinking in the general public and in middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The project plans to develop and implement interactive exhibits at the Bell Museum and classes at the University of Minnesota that integrate Earth system science and environmental engineering, both using the context of plant water use in variable environments.<br/>This project uses optimization and maximum entropy to improve the understanding and prediction of plant hydraulic regulation at the leaf, plant, and ecosystem scales. At the leaf level, optimal stomatal conductance will be derived such that it maximizes cumulative carbon assimilation over a season, subject to competition and carryover costs. At the whole-plant level, optimal plant carbon allocation will be derived such that it maximizes cumulative net carbon gain over multiple years, subject to legacy effects of drought. At the ecosystem level, the composition of plant hydraulic traits will be derived such that it maximizes the information entropy of the resulting trait distribution, representing the most likely trait configuration under environmental constraints.

With respect to feeding and nutrition, it is unclear how social animals evolved to mediate their own personal feeding behavior while also engaging in social feeding behaviors, such as the collection of food for their offspring. Bumble bees are considered social, but they have an annual life cycle wherein each spring, solitary queens must initiate new nests. Queens directly care for their first offspring as they develop in the nest and only cease performing this care when their daughters remain in the nest and assume all brood care. This project examines how queen bumble bees navigate the transition from being solitary, to expressing maternal care, to ceasing brood care, and identifies how these changes are mediated at the molecular level. A team consisting of undergraduate researchers from local community colleges and a university, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral researcher, will carry out the research. This will create a bridge between community colleges and a public university system and give valuable research experiences to traditionally underserved students. Hands-on research activities will also be integrated into two undergraduate courses taught by the PI to give students research experience in the classroom, and an outreach program based on bumble bee life history and conservation will be developed to inform the public about this threatened pollinator group.<br/><br/>The evolution of parental care and eusociality are both fundamental topics in social research. Lineages that exhibit both are particularly important systems for examining how social behavior evolves. This project explores the regulation and evolution of maternal care in bumble bee queens, which transition from a solitary to social lifestyle during the nest initiation stage. First, experiments that cause changes in offspring investment and brood care will be used to explore hypotheses inspired by both subsocial insects, which resemble bumble bee queens at this life stage, and also honey bees, which share a common origin of sociality with bumble bees. Next, RNAseq will be used to identify genes that change expression patterns in association with changes in offspring investment, and are thus candidates for the co-regulation of personal feeding and brood care. Evidence for the behavioral precursor hypothesis and the novel genes hypothesis will be explored by examining, respectively, whether these genes are conserved, or whether they are novel in either the bumble bees or in the lineage of progressively-provisioning bees they belong to. This project will improve our understanding of how sociality evolves using the bumble bee system, which is more socially plastic than many eusocial lineages but also exhibits greater social complexity than the subsocial insects. The project will also generate new insights into how feeding behavior is regulated in social systems, and shed light on how social animals have evolved mechanisms that mediate personal nutritional homeostasis while also dynamically responding to cues that mediate social feeding behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to study how evolutionary responses of an ecologically dominant plant to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and nitrogen enrichment influence the flow of carbon into and out of coastal marsh ecosystems.  The researchers plan to leverage a long-term experiment to characterize how plant traits that impact photosynthesis, the decomposition of organic matter in marsh sediments, and sediment accretion shift in response to increased carbon dioxide and nitrogen availability.  They then plan to establish the underlying genetic basis for these traits, so that changes in genetic variation can be used to confirm that evolution has taken place.  And finally, the researchers plan to quantify the consequences of changes in traits, and their associated genetic variation, for long-term carbon storage in, or loss from, highly productive marsh ecosystems.  This would enable the researchers to identify mechanistic and functional links between plant evolution and carbon cycling in coastal marshes, which face an uncertain future due to anticipated sea-level rise. Findings from this research have the potential to improve our understanding of the global carbon budget, and to foster more effective coastal restoration by advancing our understanding of marsh persistence.  Furthermore, the project can strengthen research infrastructure, create new educational and outreach opportunities, including the engagement of citizen scientists, and facilitate undergraduate research by students from groups underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>This project employs a complementary set of studies explicitly designed to bridge evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology. Using a combination of new experiments and tissue archives from an ongoing, long-term global change experiment, the researchers plan to simultaneously assay in situ genetic and genomic variation using ddRAD-generated SNPs, to characterize functional trait (e.g. maximum rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency) variation in the field, and to quantify complete marsh carbon budgets (e.g. quantifying NPP, gaseous C losses, litter decomposition rate, and belowground biomass and C accumulation).  These measurements are set in the context of more than a decade of exposure to elevated CO2 and nitrogen enrichment. To go beyond establishing associations between traits, genetic variation, and carbon flux post hoc, the researchers plan to conduct a complementary de novo quantitative genetics study of trait variation and physiology, with the intent of linking both to carbon fluxes mediated by individual plants. Establishing such mechanistic links can improve parameterization of a mechanistic model of C cycling in coastal marshes, enabling a more thorough characterization of ecosystem-level consequences of organismal evolution.

The NNCI Coordinating Office at Georgia Tech enhances the impact of NNCI as a national infrastructure network by promoting its capabilities, facilitating user access to its resources, sharing best practices, and improving overall efficiency through coordination of activities of the individual sites. The Coordinating Office assists users from academe, industry, and government in finding NNCI fabrication and characterization resources to meet their research needs through an NNCI website and other marketing approaches. The Coordinating Office leadership, using site staff expertise, facilitates programs in education and outreach, social and ethical implications, computational modeling and simulation, and innovation and entrepreneurship across the network, and helps provide linkages with other national and international nanotechnology resources. The overall activities of the NNCI Coordinating Office contribute to the economic competitiveness of the U.S. in training a globally competitive workforce and in providing efficient access to resources for commercialization of nanotechnology. They also help to inform and educate the general public on fundamentals and advances of nanoscience and engineering and their social and ethical implications.<br/><br/>The mission of the NNCI Coordinating Office is to support the interests of individual NNCI sites, site users, and the broader public using the combined assets of a nation-wide network of university-based nanotechnology user facilities. The Coordinating Office uses a variety of mechanisms to communicate availability of network assets to users of the facilities, foster interactions among the sites, and assess the impact of the various programs. A primary mode for communication is a dedicated NNCI website, which allows new and existing users to efficiently locate capabilities and expertise within the network, and also provide up-to-date nanotechnology resources to students, teachers, and the broader public. To emphasize the importance of a network of sites, the Coordinating Office is guided by an Executive Committee with representation from all 16 sites as well as a number of Working Groups and Subcommittees that address topics of broad interest and solve common problems. Research Communities are organized around key scientific and engineering challenges and represent an opportunity for the NNCI to interact with the broader research ecosystem. A flagship event for the NNCI network is an annual NNCI Conference that will highlight the research supported by the individual sites, as well as provide a venue for site staff to share best practices and research trends. An External Advisory Board provides input on network management issues and future directions. Education and outreach activities are coordinated across the network to share and disseminate best practices and resources for impactful programs at the local, regional, and national levels. Network and multi-site programs include those for undergraduates (REU) and teachers (RET).  Societal and ethical implications programs, such as an annual retreat and workshops, enable social scientists to interact with nanoscale scientists, engineers, and students so that all groups can consider the potential impacts new discoveries might have on society. Computational modeling and simulation needs of the user community are supported through an inventory of available resources and collaboration with the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN), as well as a planned seminar series. Innovation and entrepreneurship activities, such as a speaker series, undergraduate education, and entrepreneur-in-residence programs, provide a means for realizing the economic and societal benefits of NNCI resources and expertise. Assessment of the strength of the sites and the network as a whole are determined through metrics developed in collaboration with the sites and are based on site usage, site productivity and impact, contributions to the network, and education and outreach activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The utility of random matrices lies in the universality of their eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics for very large matrices. This phenomenon depends only on the underlying symmetry and is independent of the law of individual entries. This research project aims to broaden understanding of the universality phenomenon of random matrices and to develop new tools and techniques for more applications of random matrix theory.  <br/><br/>The project will explore two research directions related to random matrix theory. In the first direction, the project aims to understand the spectral properties of adjacency matrices of random d-regular graphs. The sparsity and dependency among entries make the analysis of such models more challenging than that for Wigner-type random matrices. The investigator and collaborators previously proved the universality of the local spectral statistics for sparse random graphs with growing degrees. The project's goal is to understand the local statistics of random d-regular graphs with fixed degree, particularly the fluctuations of extreme eigenvalues of random d-regular graphs. This will provide insights for the universality phenomenon for extremely sparse systems and is expected to have applications in theoretical computer science. In the second direction, the investigator aims to study statistical learning models, such as deep neural networks and tensor models. Even though these models are built out of random matrices and random tensors, the powerful machinery of random matrix theory has so far found limited success in studying them, due to the nonlinearity.  This project seeks to develop random matrix theory to incorporate nonlinearity and open the door for more applications of random matrix theory to statistical learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The idea behind the framework is simple to state: instead of controlling a large network, one controls a large population of small ones. The project will bring transformative change for controlling large-scale complex systems by enabling the use of a single control input to simultaneously steer an arbitrarily large number of networked control systems. This will be achieved by integrating both ensemble control theory and networked control theory. The intellectual merits of the project include developing an original set of methodologies and establishing novel control-theoretical results for controlling infinite ensembles of networked systems. The broader impacts of the project include establishing new connections between mathematics and the study of multi-agent systems, enabling the use of the proposed framework across various domains such as quantum systems, unmanned aerial systems, and robotics, and developing new courses that prepare the next generation of students with advanced mathematical tools and engineering methods. <br/><br/>To establish the proposed control framework, the PI will investigate ensemble systems that are composed of infinitely many networked control systems. The individual networked systems in the ensemble may share common information flow topologies, but show variations in system parameters which are indexed by points in a continuum parameterization space. A major technical challenge is that one can only use a finite-dimensional, common control input to steer a continuum ensemble of individual control systems. Moreover, these individual systems are constrained by information flow topologies. Such a challenge has not yet been tackled in the literature. Thus, to develop the proposed control framework, the PI will: (1) establish new concepts, such as ensembles of motifs, and formulate new problems, such as structural ensemble controllability; (2) establish necessary and/or sufficient conditions for information flow topologies of individual networked systems that can comprise a controllable ensemble; (3) establish a deep understanding of the fundamental relation between physical dynamics of individual systems, information flow topology, and geometry of parameterization space for ensemble controllability and for various types of output controllability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing approaches in robot perception are very good at reasoning about the current state of the world but suffer from a marked limitation in reasoning about potential changes that inevitably occur over time. Another common problem of robot perception is that when deployed in unforeseen environments, robots commonly experience perception failures due to unanticipated conditions and violations of design assumptions. Finally, end-use customization and enhancements during operational use is tedious and fragile. This project will overcome these challenges by developing robust algorithmic approaches to recognize and react to dynamic changes in environment, identify failures in perception and learn from them, and additionally learn new tasks while in operation. The research will enable the development and long-term deployment of mobile service robots in homes, workplaces, disaster zones, hospitals, and myriad other environments. As part of the project, the education and outreach plan will include a longitudinal effort for the education and mentoring of undergraduate students throughout the academic year as well as computing workshops with fun robotic activities for middle to high school students.<br/><br/>This objective of this project is to develop robust algorithmic formulations and analytical and symbolic models to enable long-duration autonomous mobile operations of service robots in dynamic human environments. First, a reformulation of robot perception will be introduced that will explicitly reason about the relation between the current state of the world and possible changes over time, in terms of the geometric shapes, visual appearances, and types of motions that objects are likely to exhibit in the world. Second, approaches will be developed for robots to autonomously build models of their perception competence by leveraging redundant sensing and discrepancies between perceptual predictions and actual outcomes, thus enabling them to avoid or overcome future situations that would lead to errors. Finally, techniques will be developed to address customizability and learning of novel tasks using physics-inspired symbolic programs. The approaches developed will be rigorously tested at multiple levels of integration, including on a team of autonomous mobile service robots deployed indoors and outdoors, performing tasks including package delivery, guided tours, and environment monitoring.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite progress in quantifying the ecological factors affecting the rates of necromass decomposition, which microorganisms actually drive this turnover and how interactions among different functional groups affect degradation dynamics remains poorly understood. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to functionally characterize how bacteria and fungi, both alone and together, degrade microbial necromass and how the carbon and nitrogen from necromass moves into different ecosystem pools (both soils and plants). The cross-disciplinary strengths of the research team will provide a holistic understanding of how decomposer community functioning influences microbial necromass decomposition in ways directly relevant to important ecosystem services such as soil carbon storage and plant nutrient acquisition. Along with enhancing our understanding of the functioning of necromass-associated microbial communities, the project has multiple broader impacts activities focused on sharing knowledge with public audiences and training a diverse pool of STEM-focused students.  <br/><br/>The specific research aims include: Aim 1: Characterize the genes and metabolic pathways involved in microbial necromass degradation using well-studied fungal and bacterial decomposition systems; Aim 2: Determine which soil microbes use resources derived from microbial necromass and how its decomposition affects soil carbon and nitrogen pools; Aim 3: Track how trees acquire microbial necromass-derived nitrogen via ectomycorrhizal fungal symbioses. These aims will be addressed through an integrated set of experiments that scale from individual microbial cultures to complex communities. In the first aim, RNAseq-based lab experiments will generate a detailed profile of gene expression during the decay of fungal necromass in an ecologically relevant and diverse set of fungi and bacteria. The second aim will couple qSIP analyses of the microbial communities on field-based decaying necromass with isotopic analyses of surrounding soils and roots (using both IRMS and NanoSIMS imaging) to quantitatively track carbon and nitrogen release from necromass types into different ecosystem pools. Finally, in Aim 3, microbial communities present on lab-incubated necromass will be experimentally manipulated to examine how initial substrate chemistry and interspecific competition affect the amount of necromass nitrogen transferred to trees by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Collectively, this research seeks to transition the study microbial necromass decomposition from a largely descriptive to a mechanistically predictive science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon, known as ?fouling,? is usually considered a confounding problem which can lead to a wide range of issues, such as clinical failure of biomedical implants and undesirable attachment of marine organisms to ship hulls. However, this project aims to leverage the persistence of protein fouling as the basis of a new, highly versatile approach for creating multifunctional surfaces. Using silk fibroins, a class of biocompatible proteins derived from or inspired by the main component of natural silk, this project will develop methods for creating robust nanometer-thin coatings on a variety of surfaces without requiring hazardous chemicals or complex instrumentation. Towards this goal, the project will seek to gain a fundamental understanding of the fouling behavior of silk fibroins as they undergo self-assembly ? an aggregation process which underlies the spinning of silk threads by insects and spiders. Through a combination of synthetic biology and surface-sensitive material characterization techniques, this project will also reveal fundamental insights about how proteins and other biomacromolecules in nature are able to adhere tenaciously to surfaces without specific chemical reactions. Furthermore, this project will develop a bio-inspired strategy by which the function of surfaces, such as biocompatibility or therapeutic activity, can be modified for applications in human healthcare and sustainability. To facilitate the dissemination of complex scientific findings from this project to a global public audience, the Merian Studio for Visual Communication will be founded at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This technology-equipped workspace will enable students to produce compelling visual educational tools, such as 2D/3D graphics and animations. As part of this visual communication effort, the project will also support an interdisciplinary team of art and engineering students to create an interactive video game that intuitively teaches the fundamental concepts of natural protein assembly and fouling phenomena.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop a powerful bottom-up strategy for creating multifunctional thin-film coatings that leverages the unique self-assembly behavior of silk fibroins at solid-liquid interfaces. Such interfacial behavior, where adsorption occurs concurrently with protein-protein assembly, is a type of robust ?fouling? which has not been sufficiently studied to date, despite being an important aspect underlying natural biomacromolecular adhesion. Furthermore, whereas fouling of surfaces by proteins has long been considered an undesirable but unavoidable problem, interfacial silk fibroin self-assembly can be used as a versatile non-covalent approach for modifying a variety of surfaces under mild, biocompatible conditions without complex chemistries or advanced instrumentation. This project will seek to gain a fundamental understanding of the growth of adherent and defect-free coatings via interfacial protein self-assembly by 1) relating silk fibroin adsorption on high and low surface energy substrates to tunable solution-phase assembly phenomena, 2) determining the role of protein sequence and size on coating formation using de novo designed recombinant silk fibroins, 3) visualizing the effects of nanoscale substrate topography on coating formation, and 4) exploring co-assembly of enzymes and growth factors with silk fibroins as a one-pot method for creating therapeutically active surfaces. The project will generate a comprehensive model for interfacial assembly of network-forming proteins, such as silk fibroins, in terms of protein-protein and protein-surface interactions. Moreover, this work will establish a new non-covalent approach towards functionalizing surfaces for a variety of materials applications. To facilitate the dissemination of complex scientific findings from the proposed research to a broad lay audience, the project will establish the ?Merian Studio for Visual Communication? at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which will be a technology-equipped workspace enabling students to produce compelling visual educational tools, such as 2D/3D graphics and animations. The project will also support an interdisciplinary team of art and engineering undergraduate students to create an interactive video game that teaches fundamental concepts in protein adsorption and assembly related to the proposed research for use in global outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The massive amount of available opinion data presents tantalizing opportunities to study the perspectives expressed on these platforms. Insights derived from this analysis can help gauge public opinion, inform public policy, and help support human decision making. Realizing these opportunities requires models adapted to the new social media settings, in which linguistic content and its social context cannot be separated. This CAREER project develops novel modeling techniques and learning algorithms for combining these two aspects under a common innovative principle -- creating a socially grounded language representation that views opinion understanding as part of a larger framework of understanding real-world scenarios (such as the implementation of specific policies or the response to an emergency situation) and their participants.  This research helps provide the relevant context needed for better understanding social media content and result in highly nuanced analysis, capturing the stances, attitudes and relationships between the different stakeholders of a given real-world scenario.<br/><br/>This project suggests a new way to conceptualize opinionated text analysis, as part of a real-world scenario, reflecting the attitudes-of and relationships-between stakeholders in the scenario from which the text emerges. A major design goal is to avoid the supervision bottleneck, and allow the system to easily adapt to new events and policy issues by using the social information associated with users as a form of indirect supervision over documents they author. This is done by representing documents, authors, referenced entities, their connections and behaviors in a shared neuro-symbolic framework enabling symbolic inference over latent entity representations learned from data. The project addresses three main challenges: (1) constructing a representation language for characterizing opinions, their targets and motivation, and the stances they express, (2) grounding opinion text in real world scenarios by infusing relevant real-world information into a neural language model, and (3) exploiting social information by formulating a unified view of social, behavioral, and textual information.

This project aims at understanding the fundamental science governing corrosion of multicomponent borate glasses, achieved through the unification of experimental studies and artificial intelligence. Successful completion of this project is expected to lay the foundation of new fundamental knowledge to understand and describe composition-structure-property relationships in glass corrosion, and advance new machine learning-based models to promptly and reliably predict the corrosion behavior of borate glasses. The U.S. glass/materials industry is facing a severe shortage of experienced glass engineers/scientists. The project reduces this shortage by training undergraduate and graduate students in glass science and engineering, thus providing a talent pool for the U.S. glass/materials industry, academia, and national laboratories. The education and outreach activities are designed to invoke interest in students and teachers at the middle and high school levels, in addition to the training of undergraduate and graduate science and engineering students. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Our current understanding of glass corrosion is based primarily on empirical data, as there is still no complete consensus on the primary mechanism of glass dissolution that applies across a wide composition space. Therefore, there is an exigent need to develop robust, fundamental understanding of the linkage(s) between chemical composition, atomic/molecular structure, and chemical durability of glasses in order to address crucial and scientifically challenging problems (e.g., designing glasses with desired chemical durability). Accordingly, the project aims at combining the strengths of experimental studies and artificial intelligence to reveal the underlying mechanisms that dictate the dissolution behavior of borate glasses in aqueous environments; and developing a cloud-based quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model ? powered by theory-guided machine learning engine ? to predict the time-dependent corrosion behavior of oxide glasses. Enabling the materials-by-design approach ? which is in alignment with the U.S. Materials Genome Initiative ? this project is a pioneering effort, representing a leap forward in designing oxide glasses with controlled chemical durability.

The recent development of AI makes it possible to automate medical diagnosis by using AI to process large amounts of imaging data. However, in reality the adoption of AI in clinics has been slow because most AI functions as ""black boxes"" -- physicians cannot see why AI makes a given diagnosis or to correct AI when seeing a mistake. As such, there is a lack of trust that prevents AI from being integrated into and enhancing physicians' work. This project develops methods to make AI's diagnosis explainable to physicians while allowing physicians to interact with and control how AI works, such as telling AI to adjust its parameters based on a specific patient's case and teaching new medical knowledge to AI to improve its performance. The outcome of this project will contribute to a new generation of AI-enabled medical diagnostic systems that can collaborate with human physicians by cost-effectively communicating results with physicians while giving them easy and sufficient control over the underlying process.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the investigator seeks to expand the interaction bandwidth between physicians and AI by adding a user interface layer that guides a physician to see, ask and understand what AI is doing and enable them to delegate tasks to AI while being able to tell or teach how AI performs those tasks. Specifically, the investigator will conduct studies to understand physicians' need for explanatory information in existing practices, and use this information to co-design with physicians interactive visualization that enables physicians to comprehend the AI's findings via question-and-answer. This project will also investigate methods that enable physicians to express their intents to control the AI behavior (e.g., specifying rules at run-time to complement an existing model's limitation).  The project will also enable physicians to convey their domain knowledge to AI to control its long-term behavior for future diagnoses (for example by extracting AI-learnable medical concepts from physicians' labels and annotations on medical imaging data).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims at understanding the fundamental science governing corrosion of multicomponent borate glasses, achieved through the unification of experimental studies and artificial intelligence. Successful completion of this project is expected to lay the foundation of new fundamental knowledge to understand and describe composition-structure-property relationships in glass corrosion, and advance new machine learning-based models to promptly and reliably predict the corrosion behavior of borate glasses. The U.S. glass/materials industry is facing a severe shortage of experienced glass engineers/scientists. The project reduces this shortage by training undergraduate and graduate students in glass science and engineering, thus providing a talent pool for the U.S. glass/materials industry, academia, and national laboratories. The education and outreach activities are designed to invoke interest in students and teachers at the middle and high school levels, in addition to the training of undergraduate and graduate science and engineering students. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Our current understanding of glass corrosion is based primarily on empirical data, as there is still no complete consensus on the primary mechanism of glass dissolution that applies across a wide composition space. Therefore, there is an exigent need to develop robust, fundamental understanding of the linkage(s) between chemical composition, atomic/molecular structure, and chemical durability of glasses in order to address crucial and scientifically challenging problems (e.g., designing glasses with desired chemical durability). Accordingly, the project aims at combining the strengths of experimental studies and artificial intelligence to reveal the underlying mechanisms that dictate the dissolution behavior of borate glasses in aqueous environments; and developing a cloud-based quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model ? powered by theory-guided machine learning engine ? to predict the time-dependent corrosion behavior of oxide glasses. Enabling the materials-by-design approach ? which is in alignment with the U.S. Materials Genome Initiative ? this project is a pioneering effort, representing a leap forward in designing oxide glasses with controlled chemical durability. Apart from revealing fundamental drivers of glass corrosion and advancing a QSPR model to reliably predict glass corrosion, a significant outcome of the project is the development of a talent pipeline of undergraduate and graduate students well-trained in glass/materials science and machine learning. Further, the project's education plan incorporates a foundational, spiral approach that builds interest at the elementary, middle, and high school level students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CAREER project will seek to develop new methods for generating higher quality and more reliable sentences, and ensure better and more faithful generation results. The project will also lead to open-source software and tools that facilitate the diagnosis of neural generation models, and provide resources for building the next generation faithful language generation models. The investigator will integrate research with educational components, and enable underrepresented high school students to access Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing research and course materials. <br/><br/>A major challenge that prevents deep learning based natural language generation models in practical deployment is faithfulness. For example, in the task of image captioning, when using sequence-to-sequence models for generation, it often leads to the ?hallucination? phenomenon: an object that does not belong to the context might be generated in the text. Similarly, in the task of data-to-text generation (e.g., generating a Wikipedia biography from structured data) problem, deep learning models are prone to generate erroneous entities and attributes that do not belong to the input data. These behaviors significantly downgrade the performance of neural generative models, and the faithfulness of the output becomes a significant issue for building the next generation faithful natural language generation engines. This project will investigate the complex relationships between uncertainty and faithfulness at various levels. And several mitigation strategies will also be considered. An interactive agent will be built to reason in user-generated text to understand the faithfulness constraint. The goal of this project is to deeply understand how to quantify and access faithfulness in robust settings, and build useful open-source software that facilitates this purpose.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recommender systems provide their users with recommendations based on their expressed preferences, but decision scientists have demonstrated that users' preferences are often constructed on the fly and thereby focused on their immediate desires rather than their longer-term goals. The recommendations, in turn, tend to reflect these short-term likes, ignoring users' ambitions and long-term goals. This proposal will take an important step towards escaping this vicious circle by developing and testing two novel user-adaptive interaction mechanisms that leverage recommendation algorithms to support unique new ways for users to develop, discover, and understand their own preferences. This will turn the users of these systems into confident consumers who are able to construct preferences that focus on their broader long-term objectives.  The decision-support platform and the proposed interaction mechanisms will be made available to academics to support their research on recommender systems and decision-making.<br/><br/>Two innovative interaction mechanisms can advance the field of recommender systems research as well as the field of decision science by extending the reach of personalized decision-support tools beyond ""choice"" towards preference construction: (1) Personalized preference profiles that use recommendation algorithms to visualize users' preferences and highlight surprising preference dynamics. These profiles will induce preference construction by helping users understand their preferences, reflect upon their long-term goals, and make better-informed decisions. (2) Preference-based communities that use recommendation algorithms to automatically create ad-hoc groups of users whose interests overlap enough to generate interesting discussion, yet not so much that they turn into epistemic bubbles. These communities seek to induce preference construction through discussion, thereby reinstating the social and intellectual benefits of active advice-giving practices.

With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic situation and the recent emergence of the coronavirus variants, one common concern is that the virus variants are more contagious than their predecessors, and will likely spread quickly within communities without early detection and warning. Other concerns are that future mutations may not be covered by existing vaccines, in which case early monitoring through high resolution wastewater-based epidemiology will become one of the only effective means of providing early alerts of the presence of such mutated virus variants within local communities. With a wide adaptation of the proposed instrumentation by municipalities, large and small communities such as college campuses and senior care facilities, the project enables the early detection and monitoring of the current coronavirus and its variants during the pandemic. The technology can also be extended to other emerging viruses with risks of community spread in the years to follow, not only in wastewater but also in widespread environmental and recreational water quality monitoring.<br/><br/>The proposed project is a highly-optimized reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) approach for in-situ sampling and analysis, and the realization of a corresponding instrumentation platform that is applicable to the early detection and monitoring of different viruses, including the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), its variants, and other emerging viruses. The proposed technology aims to reduce the time-to-result compared to current wastewater-based epidemiology approaches while minimizing cost and logistics.  The effort will include the testing of several protocols that are amendable to adaption for automated in-situ SARS-CoV-2 measurement, followed by the selection and optimization of the most suitable one. The protocols will be subsequently tested and validated using spiked samples, along with appropriate positive and negative controls. The approach will implement, for the first time in an automated device, the latest advances in molecular biology protocols, such as extraction-free single-step RT-qPCR. The project strives to achieve the first in-situ RT-qPCR available, with the potential to completely revolutionize the fields of wastewater-based epidemiology, general environmental testing and source tracking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within the drylands on Earth, the Antarctic deserts, represented in this study by the McMurdo Dry Valleys, exemplify life in extreme environments with scarce water, low temperatures and long periods of darkness during the polar winter. There is a scarcity of methods to determine water availability, data necessary to predict which species are successful in the drylands, unless measurements are done manually or with field instruments. This project aims to develop a new method of determining soil moisture and use the new data to identify locations suitable for life. Combining these habitats with known species distributions in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, results from this project will predict which species should be present, and also what is the expected species distribution in a changing environment. In this way the project takes advantage of a combination of methods, from recent remote sensing products, ecological models and 30 years of field collections to bring a prediction of how life might change in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in a warmer, and possibly, moister future climate.  This project benefits the National Science Foundation goals of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic biota and the processes that sustain life in extreme environments.

During summer, melting of snow patches, seasonal steams from glacial melt and vicinity to lakes provide a variety of environments that maintain life, not yet studied at landscape-scale level for habitat suitability and the processes that drive them. This project proposes to integrate remote sensing, hydrological models and ecological models to establish habitat suitability for species in the McMurdo Dry Valleys based on water availability. The approach is at a landscape level in order to establish present-day and future scenarios of species distribution. There are four main objectives: remote sensing development of moisture levels in soils, combining biological and soil data, building and calibrating models of habitat suitability by combining species distribution and environmental variability and applying statistical species distribution model. The field data to develop habitat suitability and calibration of models will leverage a the 30-year dataset collected by the McMurdo Long-Term Ecological Research program. Mechanistic models developed will be essential to predict species distribution in future climate scenarios. Training of post-doctoral researchers and a graduate student will prepare for the next generation of Antarctic scientists. Results from this project will train high-school students from native American communities in the SouthWest where similar desert conditions exist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These studies will have a variety of broader impacts including the study of fundamental processes in plasma physics, aerosols, fluid dynamics while advancing radio science and remote sensing technology and techniques. The award will support research training and professional development of graduate students and two postdoctoral associates. The IRWTL will support the participation of both UAF undergraduate students and visiting students in scientific investigations and engineering projects. This effort fosters collaboration between three universities, an aerospace company, and a national space center.<br/><br/>The IRWTL lidar system will enhance the HAARP research infrastructure as a state-of-the-art solid state resonance lidar system using a frequency-stabilized Nd:YAG laser to achieve atmospheric illumination at the iron resonance emission wavelength at 372 nm. During geomagnetically active periods the auroral electrojet and auroral precipitation occur overhead at the HAARP site facilitating HF heating experiments to higher altitude ranges than otherwise would be the case. The IRWTL observations will yield new wind and temperature measurements in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere in both daytime and nighttime throughout the year; these results would be compared with similar wind and temperature observations obtained at the Poker Flat sodium resonance wind and temperature lidar system located in central Alaska to search for evidence of large scale structure in polar mesospheric winds. The observations, analyses and results of this activity will contribute to national and international programs, including CEDAR and SCOSTEP programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall goal is to combat the seasonal resurgence of COVID-19-like diseases by tracking the health and safe practices followed by essential workers in such facilities. At a societal level, this technology will help to monitor an active hotspot region where symptomatic cases spike suddenly.  The technology will also assist decision-makers in setting up corrective actions. The proposed mask has several wireless connectivity options with the option to share data with third party apps for reporting health abnormalities and give public health officials a real-time awareness of possible breakouts. Additionally, Smart Mask assists in raising awareness of harmful hygiene habits, to help in preventing contamination and leading to a healthier society. The Smart Mask offers essential care facilities a way to ensure their own health, sustain business growth by reducing the risk of facility spread, and inspire trust among potential customers and current employees.<br/><br/>This I-corps project provides a data collection and analysis system using a network of Smart Masks. Each Smart Mask has wireless connectivity with a smartphone and the following sensors: health metric sensors to non-invasively measure respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and body temperature.  The Smart Masks provide notifications of abnormal readings to the user.  They also have gesture sensors that track the gestures of touching or moving hands close to the face, using thin film and flexible capacitance coupling plates on the mask.  Finally, the Smart Masks have proximity sensing using capacitive coupling that performs mask-to-mask and mask-to-infrastructure distance ranging using signal strength measurements and coupling of capacitive fields.

Combining cutting-edge nanotechnology, concentrating solar power, and innovative and compact design, the technology can convert any saline water or wastewater to potable quality fresh water using sunlight as the only energy source.  The research will evaluate a novel reactor design that allows the thermal energy converted from sunlight to be recovered and reused multiple times for desalination and purification of saline water, all in one compact, low cost device. If successful, this technology could provide a low-cost, energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable solution to a wide range of water challenges: providing reliable and affordable drinking water for communities that lack access to fresh water or reliable power supplies; supplying clean water at off-grid industrial production sites; recovering clean water from municipal and industrial wastewaters; minimizing discharge of contaminants-laden waste streams to the environment. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a high efficiency, low cost desalination technology directly powered by sunlight. The research pursues two innovations that greatly enhance the performance of a novel desalination process: nanophotonics enhanced solar membrane distillation (NESMD). First, a novel membrane module design (patent pending) could achieve multi-effect solarthermal membrane distillation in a compact, low-cost module; second, coupling the multi-effect module design with a low-cost solar concentrator would deliver high intensity solar irradiation necessary to drive a multi-effect process while maintaining high membrane flux. The goal is to increase in the gained output ratio (GOR) by a factor of 5. The high GOR value will reduce the specific energy consumption for desalination, and enhance water production rate per irradiated area.  Proposed research includes (1) constructing a multi-effect NESMD module that demonstrates multi-stage heat recovery, (2) modeling the nonlinear, and coupled heat, momentum, and mass transfer in the module, (3) determining the effect of solar concentration, and (4) determining the effect of operating conditions and feed water quality.  Model simulations will guide design, prototype testing, and optimization, while experimental research results will be used to improve the process model.

This project will use naturally-occurring ?radiocarbon? (the radioactive carbon isotope 14C) to study how global carbon pools changed during that deglacial transition. The project will test previous radiocarbon evidence for a pulse of carbon release from seafloor volcanoes in the eastern Pacific Ocean at that time. That result challenges the idea that carbon release from the solid Earth is relatively slow and steady. Chemical and isotope measurements on fossil shells from deep-sea sediment cores will show whether the carbon pulse came in the form of acid or base. This will help pin down the source of the carbon. Carbon cycle models will be used to estimate the scale of these carbon pulses and their impact on ocean acidity and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Preliminary data and initial model results suggest that the carbon source was acid/base neutral. If so, then enormous quantities of carbon could have been released without causing strong ocean acidification or a strong atmospheric carbon dioxide rise. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and human activities are responsible for a large release of carbon dioxide today. Documenting the scale and nature of the natural carbon release at the end of the last ice age will help predict the environmental consequences of human carbon release. It will also help predict whether the human carbon release may be neutralized by natural processes.<br/><br/>The Gulf of California study site was selected because it contains: (1) a high-quality wood fragment-based chronology, (2) abundant and well-preserved benthic foraminifera for boron and carbon isotope analysis, (3) replicated evidence for regionally and temporally coherent 14C anomalies, and (4) known local sources of geologic carbon associated with the East Pacific Rise.  The main thrust of the proposed work comes from d11B and B/Ca measurements to establish if there was any seawater carbonate chemistry and/or pH change associated with the 14C anomalies, but the proposed work also includes a wider set of complementary isotope geochemical measurements (14C/C, d13C) to enhance the value of the database as a constraint on the possible explanations for the regional 14C anomalies. The project also includes regional and global carbon cycle modeling to assimilate the multi-proxy constraints and quantitatively assess the implied effects on global seawater carbon chemistry and atmospheric CO2. This work will inform the active debate about the contribution of deglacial carbon release to deglacial CO2 rise. The working hypothesis is that significant pulses of geologic carbon releases explain the observed 14C anomalies but would not significantly contribute to CO2 change because that carbon came in neutralized bicarbonate ion form. Overall, the study will take on a significant gap in understanding natural carbon cycle change on human-relevant timescales by collaboratively integrating novel multi-proxy measurements with carbon cycle modeling. Both PIs are early career scientists with demonstrated domain expertise and track record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For a large percentage of the population, caffeine is known to have negative side effects, including anxiety, jitteriness, and insomnia. In the case of anxiety, an estimated 40 million Americans suffer from an anxiety disorder, which may be exacerbated by caffeine in coffee, energy drinks, and other beverages. Paraxanthine is an active ingredient that has stimulatory qualities similar to caffeine but is less likely to cause anxiety and jitteriness. Thus, paraxanthine can play a role in contributing to improved mental health.<br/> <br/>The proposed project aims to develop a cost-efficient, biological method to manufacture paraxanthine. Producing paraxanthine at low cost is currently a significant technical challenge. The compound is only found naturally in substantial quantities within the human body as the result of caffeine metabolism; it is not produced in plants in above trace amounts. Furthermore, synthetic methods to produce paraxanthine are complex, inefficient, and expensive. The research goals of this Phase I project are to use a combination of protein and microbe engineering to develop a biological method to fermentatively produce paraxanthine at high yields and with high volumetric productivities. The approach uses directed evolution to select for enzymes and microbes with improved activity, enabling rapid iteration of the experimental design-build-test cycle. If successful, this technology will not only deliver an efficient paraxanthine production process, but it also establishes a novel, scalable platform that can be applied to improve upon other food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reference materials for total dissolved inorganic carbon and for total alkalinity will be based on natural seawater, sterilized, bottled, and analyzed using appropriate reference methods for these parameters. Reference materials for pH are based on Tris buffers in synthetic seawater and calibrated using spectrophotometric pH measurements. In addition, the laboratory will distribute calibrated acid titrant for alkalinity measurements. Reference materials will be distributed to US and to international investigators to assist in the quality control of oceanic CO2 measurements. During the three years of this project, the laboratory expects to distribute about 30,000 bottles of reference material. These materials will also be used to provide test samples for use in collaborative studies of the analytical methods used to determine these various parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technological revolution makes it critical to look beyond robots working in parallel, and towards actual swarm intelligence where the whole is more than the sum of its parts. As a proof of concept, natural swarms exhibit scalable, error tolerant, and adaptive properties by integrating and propagation information into their shared environment over space and time. Adoption of these concepts in robot swarms can complement existing control architectures, and may result in systems that are less efficient than those with centralized control architectures, but are much faster and inexpensive to deploy, are resilient to individual failures, resize easier from initial to full-scale deployment, and can adapt to changing tasks or environments.<br/> <br/>Although gaining in popularity, this type of distributed coordination has many facets and is still poorly understood - especially as a design tool for engineered swarms that aim to achieve biological levels of resilience and adaptability. To address these shortcomings, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research project will extend upon the concept of environmentally-mediated coordination from working on perfect robots operating in static environments, to include dynamic environments and ways to deal with realistic bounds on error and hardware reliability. The work will result in a model of swarms in dynamic environments that act to integrate, diffuse, decay, and filter information derived from characterization of a biological model system, as well as practical robot experiments. Practical verification involves collective robotic construction, odor plume tracking by honey bees, and strain-mediated behaviors in programmable matter.

Production by marine algae in the surface ocean is the largest source of DOC and its effects on the ocean carbon cycle are widely appreciated. However, the contribution of DOC from additional sources such as rivers, hydrothermal vents, and methane seeps and their impact on ocean ecology and chemistry are not well understood. Each source differs in terms of its biological utilization and age, which affects the storage and distribution of DOC among the ocean basins. Methane seeps located along continental margins are particularly significant because they may transfer globally significant quantities of carbon stored below the seafloor as natural gas and gas hydrate to the oceans. This project will investigate the production, flux, composition and potential for biological utilization of DOC at Hydrate Ridge, located offshore Oregon. Hydrate Ridge is a prominent methane seep with massive accumulations of gas hydrate and a node of the Ocean Observatories Initiative telecommunications cabled array on the Juan De Fuca tectonic plate, which provides a continuous stream of real-time regional oceanographic data. We will sample and chemically characterize methane, DOC, and other materials to provide information about where the materials originated (deep vs shallow), how they have been chemically altered, to what extent they may feed deep ocean organisms, or contribute to the long term storage of DOC in the ocean. Experiments and analysis will be conducted using sediment cores and bottom water samples collected using either the remotely operated vehicle Jason or the human occupied vehicle Alvin during a 7-day ocean expedition. Additionally, this project will place osmotically-driven pumps on the seafloor to continuously sample fluids for approximately one year, thereby allowing us to monitor the movement of methane and DOC expelled from the seafloor to the ocean and constrain processes that regulate the release of carbon to the oceans at methane seeps. This project will support one graduate student and several undergraduates from a community college in Maryland and a college located in a lower-income urban center in southeastern Massachusetts. We will disseminate project findings to the public with a series of videos for public TV. <br/><br/>This study will investigate the production, flux and reactivity of methane-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from methane (CH4) seeps at Hydrate Ridge, Offshore Oregon. The study will address four fundamental questions to determine the significance of CH4-derived DOC within the ocean carbon cycle: (1) How much CH4-derived fossil DOC do seeps contribute to the oceans? (2) To what extent is CH4-derived C incorporated into DOC during anaerobic oxidation of CH4? (3) Is seep DOC bioavailable or recalcitrant when released into the deep ocean? (4) How does the flux of DOC to the water column vary over time? We will employ an interdisciplinary strategy that includes in situ sampling, laboratory incubations, and a comprehensive analytical geochemistry program. Data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array at Southern Hydrate Ridge will be used to provide context for field and experimental data. The composition and abundance of organic and inorganic chemical species along with the stable and radiocarbon isotope composition of pore water, bulk sediment, and water column C pools will be used to identify DOC sources and quantify fluxes from cold seeps characterized by a range of advection rates. The centerpiece of the investigation will be a 7-day research cruise to Hydrate Ridge to collect sediments, pore fluids, and water column samples, and deploy OsmoSamplers for continuous time series fluid sampling. The results will form the foundation for estimating the contribution of CH4-derived DOC to the oceanic DOC pool.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials will (i) have high R-values, (ii) be safe to install, (iii) not require toxic chemical and fossil fuel feedstocks, (iv) reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and (v) be produced securely in the United States.  By developing new biotechnology tools to make these materials, this project will advance the fields of energy conservation and material science and grow the bio-economy. The new materials will be sustainable, biologically grown versions of the best known insulation materials called aerogels.  As excellent insulators requiring little energy to produce, these biological aerogels will reduce GHG emissions. Being non-toxic, the materials will be safer to make and install. Production with locally-sourced materials will secure vulnerable supply chains revealed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These materials will help meet increasing demand for green building materials. For example, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings command premium new and resale prices, with under 300 certifications in 2007 growing to over 67,000 in 2018. <br/><br/>Using genetically engineered bacteria, this SBIR Phase I project will develop an entirely new aerogel material that is a composite of bacterial cellulose (BC) and structures forming nanoscale cavities of air. This approach will circumvent the supercritical drying needed in the production of conventional aerogels, which is an expensive and energy intensive process because it requires high temperatures and high pressures. These biological aerogels materials will have excellent insulation properties comparable to conventional aerogels, (that is, high R-values) produced at a fraction of the cost. To create biological aerogels for insulation, the project plan is to (1) optimize production of the components (BC and nanoscale cavity structures), (2) use genetic engineering tools to merge the components to create a biologically-derived aerogel, and (3) create synthetic gene networks to endow the biological aerogel with hydrophobicity and fire-retardant properties needed for a building insulation material.

The Beyond Basic Science REU program will immerse participants in the transdisciplinary science being done at the Earth Institute (EI) of Columbia University. Our overarching goals include: 1) enhancing participant interest and experience in participatory action research in climate science, 2) building confidence and competence in research, 3) gaining fluency and insights into scientific processes and practices, 4) connecting participants to layered mentoring structures, and 5) providing learners with opportunities for engagement with stakeholders on real-world challenges. This project will embed participants in the scientific process and provide them with a window into research in individual and team settings. In these experiences, participants will have the latitude that is appropriate to their level of understanding in order to gain comfort with the research process. The core foundations of each research project are grounded in basic science that will introduce participants to the scientific process. Additionally, all projects will have a strong practice and participatory aspect that involves a range of partners, which will introduce participants to how mentors design and conduct their research in order to develop shared knowledge that is practical and can be used by stakeholders in decision and policy-making processes.<br/><br/>This 3-year project will involve 10-week research experiences annually that will embed students and educators in the process and application of transdisciplinary science. The Beyond Basic Science REU program demonstrates a powerful strategy for how organizations such as the Earth Institute can transform the relationship between science and the public, by ensuring that the knowledge we produce through our research is jointly created, shared, and disseminated in a way that has meaningful impacts on the people and communities that climate change is going to impact the most. The Beyond Basic Science REU site will provide opportunities for undergraduate students and educators in transdisciplinary research rooted in climate science and participatory action. The activities proposed in this project are strategically aligned with NSF?s goals of broader impacts and supports a diverse group of participants in immersive research experiences. The project framework supports participants to engage in team learning around a meaningful project, participate in professional development activities beyond direct research, and build learning and professional relationships through layered mentoring in a world-renowned research environment. The pool of students targeted by this program (i.e., community colleges and state schools) are substantially more likely to be first generation college students and to identify as underrepresented minorities in STEM. The project will likewise produce a cohort of scientists and educators trained in participatory research approaches to science that integrate basic research methods with meaningful stakeholder participation.

Virus-based approaches have been primarily used for gene therapy applications, as they possess the natural ability to efficiently deliver genetic cargo to target tissues. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a leading therapeutic gene delivery system and recently became the 1st virus to be granted approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use. Given its growing and broad potential utility, it is important to understand how AAV traffics and distributes throughout the body to ensure it is a safe and effective modality for gene therapy applications. Prior work has shown that the interactions of AAV with components of the bloodstream and tissues like the brain, liver, and heart can cause inactivation or limit penetration of AAV within target organs. The aim of this NSF CAREER project is to develop the tools necessary to comprehensively assess these biological barriers to AAV gene therapy in order to optimize its performance and maximize therapeutic benefits in diseases such as arthritis, cancer, and hemophilia. The project includes a synergistic education plan that promotes research exposure and awareness of career opportunities for URM students, enhances undergraduate courses and provides training opportunities in research for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds.  Specific activities include developing a summer research immersion and educational lab activity development program for science teachers in Baltimore City and incorporating new lab modules focused on nano- and microparticle transport in blood into an undergraduate course on biofluids.  <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this CAREER project is to build quantitative tools to support the development and rational design of gene therapies using natural and novel bioengineered AAVs.  Though AAV shows serotype-dependent interactions with serum proteins in the blood that can either inhibit or enhance AAV-mediated gene transfer, it is unknown if these interactions with serum proteins promote or compromise the stability of AAV in circulation. In addition, target receptors used for cell entry by many AAV serotypes (e.g. heparan sulfate) are present at high levels in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which could lead to adhesion of AAV to the ECM and as a result, poor distribution in target tissues. However, these potential barriers to effective AAV gene therapy have not been studied.  To address this issue, the investigator will pursue three research objectives: (1) characterize AAV-serum interactions and protein corona formation, (2) examine AAV stability in whole blood under physiological flow conditions, and (3) evaluate AAV diffusion through ECM and ex vivo tissues. The investigator will use expertise in measuring and modeling protein adsorption at interfaces, protein-mediated particle aggregation, and diffusion of nanoscale particles in 3D biological matrices to understand the behavior of AAV in the blood and tissue microenvironment. The results of these objectives will be interpreted with analytical models to determine (1) how competitive adsorption of serum proteins and protein corona formation on AAV particles influences their stability in circulation and (2) how tissue-specific properties of ECM (e.g. density and composition) influence distribution of AAV within target organs. If successful, this work will establish new assays that are generalizable to viral gene therapeutics and can be used as an additional screening tool for pre-clinical studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within the drylands on Earth, the Antarctic deserts, represented in this study by the McMurdo Dry Valleys, exemplify life in extreme environments with scarce water, low temperatures and long periods of darkness during the polar winter. There is a scarcity of methods to determine water availability, data necessary to predict which species are successful in the drylands, unless measurements are done manually or with field instruments. This project aims to develop a new method of determining soil moisture and use the new data to identify locations suitable for life. Combining these habitats with known species distributions in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, results from this project will predict which species should be present, and also what is the expected species distribution in a changing environment. In this way the project takes advantage of a combination of methods, from recent remote sensing products, ecological models and 30 years of field collections to bring a prediction of how life might change in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in a warmer, and possibly, moister future climate.  This project benefits the National Science Foundation goals of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic biota and the processes that sustain life in extreme environments.

During summer, melting of snow patches, seasonal steams from glacial melt and vicinity to lakes provide a variety of environments that maintain life, not yet studied at landscape-scale level for habitat suitability and the processes that drive them. This project proposes to integrate remote sensing, hydrological models and ecological models to establish habitat suitability for species in the McMurdo Dry Valleys based on water availability. The approach is at a landscape level in order to establish present-day and future scenarios of species distribution. There are four main objectives: remote sensing development of moisture levels in soils, combining biological and soil data, building and calibrating models of habitat suitability by combining species distribution and environmental variability and applying statistical species distribution model. The field data to develop habitat suitability and calibration of models will leverage a the 30-year dataset collected by the McMurdo Long-Term Ecological Research program. Mechanistic models developed will be essential to predict species distribution in future climate scenarios. Training of post-doctoral researchers and a graduate student will prepare for the next generation of Antarctic scientists. Results from this project will train high-school students from native American communities in the SouthWest where similar desert conditions exist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This occurred during a  period of peak population density and complexity with settlements established around monumental earthen constructions, including temples and ballcourts that drew people together for religious ceremony. To feed this population, local groups pooled their labor to convert natural wetlands into highly productive raised fields by digging a network of drainage canals and piling the fertile soils onto raised planting platforms. The whole system eventually failed.  Monumental constructions ceased, raised fields were no longer maintained, and people either migrated elsewhere or disbanded to live in smaller, self-sustained farmsteads. These types of collective arrangements remain imperative today as government agricultural subsidies and support programs, as well as farmer co-ops, have had varied successes and failures. The social and environmental conditions of agriculture continuously change due to climatic variability, erosion, soil fertility losses, and the willingness of individual farmers to cooperate both with each other and government institutions. These uncertainties, which have plagued all agricultural societies since the earliest domesticates, cannot be easily projected into the future, so we turn to the long-term approach of archaeology. The region of study presents the complete cycle from intensification of agricultural infrastructure to its ultimate failure.<br/><br/>The project focuses on a case study where detailed satellite and aerial remote sensing has identified remains of ancient agricultural field systems. Coring and trenching in the raised fields will reveal construction techniques and duration of use with geochemical analysis to assess soil fertility. Samples from fields will be used to date their construction and abandonment, and to determine what crops were grown in these fields through macro- and micro-botanical analysis. These data will be compared with that collected from survey and excavations as a means to reconstruct settlement history relative to raised field construction. Excavations will target households of different statuses to understand how wealth and power relationships changed over time. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on lagoon cores will model how the climate changed from the beginning to the end of this period of agricultural intensification. Together, these data will present a picture of the social, political, religious, and environmental factors that fostered an era of cooperation that led to the development of an intensive agricultural system and levels of monumentality not seen before in this region. Perhaps more importantly, the project will uncover the reasons why such collective action ceased. Regardless of the differences in scale and technology, this case shares many of the same social, political, and environmental concerns with our modern farming systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is supporting 4th and 5th grade teachers to adopt culturally-responsive teaching and studying how this impacts the identities of Latinas as they relate to computational thinking (CT) and computer science (CS). Female Latina students are one of the populations that presently are among the least likely to engage in CS or to pursue CS-related careers. Although it is widely accepted that early interventions are critical to engage underrepresented students in STEM, there is a dearth of opportunities for students to effectively engage with CS and CT skills as part of their classroom instruction.  The study focuses on addressing this and developing among Latinas positive identity around foundational CT skills, particularly algorithmic thinking and abstraction as they relate to mathematics. The project activities are preparing teachers to effectively teach abstraction and algorithmic thinking and assess CT practices; developing CT activities for 4th & 5th grade that are culturally responsive and that promote positive identity among Latinas; and assessing the effectiveness of these curricula towards improving positive identity and math achievement in classrooms serving predominantly minority youth in the 4th and 5th grades.  In total, this project is impacting 1400 students and among them, at least 350 Latina students. <br/><br/>A central objective of this project is to apply culturally responsive teaching to computational thinking practices that will provide an opportunity to support positive identity in STEM in Latina girls. The first activity in achieving this objective is developing professional learning for 4th and 5th grade educators using Critical Race Theory and other culturally responsive teaching methods that use the Framework for Multicultural Curriculum Design (Sleeter et al., 2005). The strategy is to integrate CT into mathematics and other curricula through a modified Engage-Investigate Model-Apply  progression. Teachers then use these culturally responsive methods to create positive identity with the content. Teacher practice is being assessed on the CT Practices of algorithms and abstraction, but specifically on abstraction as well as on related ideas in mathematics to determine if there is a tertiary effect on increasing math scores. A mixed-methods study is exploring the impacts of the curricula and professional development through observations, data collection on student work, and attitudinal surveys.

These irregular kernels normally accomplish little computational work despite the high cost of accessing memory. These costly bottlenecks must be remedied by a new approach to high-performance computing. But, at the same time, computing is evolving and is becoming less dependent on the low-level programming languages that cause these bottlenecks and more dependent on learning algorithms such as neural networks to attain the necessary efficiency. This project builds the foundation for accelerating irregular kernels by replacing them with neural networks that run on accelerators optimized for neural networks. These neural networks offer better performance and energy consumption. Additionally, these networks are tuned in high-level programming languages (e.g., Python) that are easier for novice users to learn. This allows more computer scientists to aid the scientific and high-performance computing communities. This project also builds a new curriculum such as adding neural accelerators and expanding neural network algorithm materials into traditional undergraduate courses. This project, in both its research and educational aspects, significantly reduces the development time and costs of high-performance computing while simultaneously reducing performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, this project will support graduate and undergraduate students as they engage in cross-disciplinary involvement to match accuracy and performance constraints from the scientific-modeling and big-data-analysis communities that currently depend on irregular kernels for areas such as climate modeling, large scale circuit design, and drug analysis on infectious diseases. <br/><br/>The goals and scope of this project are to build a framework that allows irregular kernels to be optimized in terms of both their performance and energy usage using the technique of neural acceleration, i.e., being represented and executed as a neural network. The methods used to meet the project?s goals and scope include the following: 1) The development of an approximation-bound characteristic that quantifies and qualifies acceptable error bars on the developed neural networks along with performance and energy requirements; 2) The development of initial neural networks for commonly used irregular kernels that can be used as starting networks for more complex irregular kernels and be used by individuals tuning their irregular kernels (which will be made available by a public database that is created and maintained by the investigator to support research in this area); and 3) The construction of a toolchain to aid in identifying irregular kernels in code, constructing neural networks based on user input, and deciding how the neural networks should be scheduled. The deliverable toolchain has support for popular libraries like TensorFlow and will be disseminated via an open-source repository. The transformative impact of this project?s effort generates a completely new optimization option for irregular kernels and a base set of tools (i.e., a public database and scheduling toolchain) that will foster future advances into using neural acceleration for various codes and lead to significant advancements in science and engineering. As such, this new optimization option may inspire a new computational model in a post-Moore era that provides timely scientific data for urgent government policy, such as climate change and foreign affairs.<br/>This project is jointly funded by CAREER Software and Hardware Foundations  HPC program and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teacher quality is one of the most important school-related inputs influencing student success.  This project will do this by constructing a novel dataset linking administrative birth records, teacher employment records, and student school records to answer this question. This project will compare the paths of employment for men and women in teaching around the time of childbirth to understand the differential impacts of childbirth on employment by gender. Additionally, it will investigate differences in this type of attrition by teacher quality in order to understand whether childbirth is a point of high quality teacher dropout. Teacher quality is one of the most important school-related inputs influencing student success.  Given that childbirth is a well-known point of attrition from the labor force for many women in the U.S. and teaching is a female-dominated profession, it is not clear whether this is the period when high quality teachers are lost to the profession.  The results of this research has important implications for policies to retain teachers, improve teacher quality, and improve educational outcomes.<br/><br/>This project employs gender-specific event-study regressions to track employment in teaching around childbirth, compare the patterns for male and female teachers, and investigate heterogeneity by teachers? ?value-added? to student achievement, as measured by cognitive outcomes such as student test scores and non-cognitive outcomes such as student attendance. This project contributes to the existing literate in three ways. First, the novel dataset construction overcomes a multitude of limitations in existing data, such as small sample size and limited information on fertility and employment. Second, the project contributes to the literature on labor market penalty of motherhood by focusing on one specific profession that is both an interesting case study and has an overwhelming proportion of employees as women   Third, relating the risk of leaving the profession around childbirth to teacher effectiveness provides the first descriptive evidence of whether childbirth is a contributing factor to the loss of high quality teachers from the profession. This research can inform the ongoing debate in the U.S. on the provision of family-friendly labor market policies such as paid family leave, which has been shown to increase women?s employment and retention to their pre-birth employer but is still not available to most individuals in the U.S. labor market<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite progress in quantifying the ecological factors affecting the rates of necromass decomposition, which microorganisms actually drive this turnover and how interactions among different functional groups affect degradation dynamics remains poorly understood. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to functionally characterize how bacteria and fungi, both alone and together, degrade microbial necromass and how the carbon and nitrogen from necromass moves into different ecosystem pools (both soils and plants). The cross-disciplinary strengths of the research team will provide a holistic understanding of how decomposer community functioning influences microbial necromass decomposition in ways directly relevant to important ecosystem services such as soil carbon storage and plant nutrient acquisition. Along with enhancing our understanding of the functioning of necromass-associated microbial communities, the project has multiple broader impacts activities focused on sharing knowledge with public audiences and training a diverse pool of STEM-focused students.  <br/><br/>The specific research aims include: Aim 1: Characterize the genes and metabolic pathways involved in microbial necromass degradation using well-studied fungal and bacterial decomposition systems; Aim 2: Determine which soil microbes use resources derived from microbial necromass and how its decomposition affects soil carbon and nitrogen pools; Aim 3: Track how trees acquire microbial necromass-derived nitrogen via ectomycorrhizal fungal symbioses. These aims will be addressed through an integrated set of experiments that scale from individual microbial cultures to complex communities. In the first aim, RNAseq-based lab experiments will generate a detailed profile of gene expression during the decay of fungal necromass in an ecologically relevant and diverse set of fungi and bacteria. The second aim will couple qSIP analyses of the microbial communities on field-based decaying necromass with isotopic analyses of surrounding soils and roots (using both IRMS and NanoSIMS imaging) to quantitatively track carbon and nitrogen release from necromass types into different ecosystem pools. Finally, in Aim 3, microbial communities present on lab-incubated necromass will be experimentally manipulated to examine how initial substrate chemistry and interspecific competition affect the amount of necromass nitrogen transferred to trees by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Collectively, this research seeks to transition the study microbial necromass decomposition from a largely descriptive to a mechanistically predictive science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeologically, material culture provides a perspective that allows researchers to observe how people in the past coped with external stresses when facing broader sociopolitical changes. Previous research has argued that Quality of Life (QOL) embedded in inequality is a factor in how households incorporate or reject material elements from new traditions after culture contact. Their project will focus on ceramic hybridity, a common phenomenon in colonial societies where potters incorporate foreign cultural elements into the traditional ceramic production sequence. The project will contribute to the anthropological understanding of culture contact demonstrating that a great amount of cultural continuity is commonly overlooked when studying processes of conquest; and it will contribute to the methodological issue of identifying the agency of underrepresented groups in the past who did not leave their mark in the written records, usually created by colonizers. The project will demonstrate how inequality interacts with changes brought by colonization such as land use, forced labor, and health among unequal households, thus serving as an example to shed light on how inequality interacts with how people cope with catastrophes in the present. How are we different from populations who experienced epidemics in the past? What were the unfair circumstances that made it more difficult for unequal households back then? What can we learn?<br/><br/>The project will investigate cultural continuity of indigenous populations between the prehispanic and colonial eras. It will consider how unequal QOL impacted the ways in which households incorporated elements of European and African styles. It is argued that strongly negative impacts of colonization on QOL, as in populations that labored at sugar plantations, encouraged continuity in material culture to reaffirm indigenous identity. Populations that were not as negatively affected are therefore expected to have adopted a wider range of foreign styles. The project will use household inventories to assess the impacts of colonization from an archaeological perspective of QOL of indigenous communities at various points in time. The project will include members of the local communities, both in fieldwork and in the dissemination of the knowledge produced, also contributing to education working with archaeology students. This research will result in a more nuanced understanding of localized experiences when facing broad scale stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the ways that microbes are transported from one environment to another are not well understood. Each year, wildland fires emit millions of tons of smoke particles into the atmosphere and these particles likely carry microbes with them. Traditionally, wildfires have been studied in terms of direct impacts to terrestrial biota and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, but the role of smoke as an agent of biological dispersal has yet to be explored. Grasslands are one of the most widespread and frequently burned ecosystems, so this research will examine the impacts of smoke-driven microbial dispersal in tallgrass prairies of the central United States using unmanned aerial vehicles flying into smoke plumes, combustion experiments and soil incubations that mimic conditions in nature. This project uses an integrated approach to better understand the consequences of smoke to human, plant, and animal health across all environments where wildland fire occurs. The increasing size and severity of global wildfires, leading to increased interaction between biomass burning smoke and human populations, make this research relevant to a wide range of stakeholders including those interested in the potential transport of pathogenic microbes. In addition to mentoring three post-doctoral scholars, a graduate student, and undergraduate summer interns, the results will be disseminated to local communities through existing K-12 and informal learning programs at the Konza Prairie LTER and NEON sites. <br/><br/>Microbial emissions in smoke from biomass burning are both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the bioaerosols observed from wind-driven emissions, implying that wildland fire may be a globally relevant and yet-unquantified mechanism for microbial teleconnections among ecosystems. To test how smoke drives microbial metacommunity ecology, this project will use an integrated approach that compares the composition and viability of smoke source and sink microbial assemblages in field- and laboratory-based experiments. Smoke and particulate deposition during repeated prescribed fires in grasslands will be sampled over two years to characterize the relationships among fire behavior, meteorological conditions, and survival of microbes transported in smoke. Sterilized and untreated soils from similar, unburned sites will be exposed to contrasting dosages of smoke with known microbial content to compare the relative influence of selection, dispersal, and drift on soil microbial community assembly. These data will be used to build new capacity for simulating smoke microbial dispersal across scales by parameterizing microbial emission fluxes and microbial dispersion in atmospheric, chemical transport, and coupled fire-atmosphere models. Results will lend insight into the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic processes in driving microbial community ecology in systems where fire disturbances are frequent, while modeling will enable predictions of the scale and impact of smoke-related microbial dispersal. This research will inform questions about microbial gene flow, microbial pathogen epidemiology, phytopathogens, and meteorological processes, and will expand fundamental understanding of fire?s ecological significance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These extremes are generally embedded in large-scale meterological patterns (LMPs).  For instance a drought might occur within a high-pressure center which is part of a pattern of highs and lows originating over the North Pacific and extending across the continental US.  The LMPs may in turn be generated or influenced by planetary-scale climate modes (PCMs) such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and the Arctc Oscillation (AO). Thus efforts to understand and predict extreme weather events, or to anticipate changes in their frequency and intensity due to climate change, must consider the events from a multi-scale perspective that recognizes the interplay of regional, continental, and planetary scales that contribute to them.<br/><br/>Work performed here seeks to develop a comprehensive suite of multi-scale metrics, or ""fingerprints"", for characterizing the atmospheric processes responsible for regional extreme weather events.  Once the fingerprints are developed they are used to determine the dynamical mechanisms through which larger-scale processes lead to, or strongly influence, the regional extremes.  The research also uses the fingerprints and subsequent dynamical analysis to assess the realism of climate model simulations of regional extremes and their associations with LMPs and PCMs.  One analysis technique uses the the tendency equation for geopotential height in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model to identify ""optimal modes"", meaning wave patterns which are optimally shaped to extract energy from the mean flow to achieve rapid growth over a few days.  Prior work by the Principle Investigators (PIs) and their collaborators used this approach to show that planetary-scale circulation anomalies can alter the mean state in a way that promotes the growth of an optimal mode that promotes CAOs.  Additional prior work links the long-term reduction in the summertime equator-to-pole temperature contrast to a reduction in frontal weather systems over North America, which in turn promotes dryer and warmer summers in the US.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the disruptions caused by extreme weather.

In the face of declining insect biodiversity worldwide, it is more important now than ever for entomology collections to preserve, digitize, and disseminate specimen data to the broader community. The Frost Entomological Museum at Penn State cares for more than 1.3 million specimens that span the diversity of insects. This collection stands to grow further, through the incorporation of satellite collections of pollinators, especially bees (more than 125,000 specimens), and through the activities of the Insect Biodiversity Center (IBC), a recently established research initiative at Penn State. The infrastructure provided through this grant increases the storage capacity of the Frost by 50%, allowing for the curation of these collections and to serve as a repository for scaled up efforts to understand insect diversity through time. The award also provides the resources to digitize the substantial aphid collection (approximately 224,000 specimens on 49,000 slides), which holds important data regarding these insects? plant hosts, and aquatic insects (approximately 100,000 specimens in 15,000 vials), which are indicators of habitat health. These improvements will facilitate research that addresses native pollinator decline, epidemiology, global climate change and its impact on species distributions and invasive species, niche restrictions, indicator species, and the evolutionary history of insects. The project will also generate data that contribute to ongoing research on imperiled insects and will fill critical taxonomic, geographical, and temporal gaps in existing datasets.<br/><br/>A high-density compactor storage system will be installed in the Frost Museum in order to accommodate new rows of cabinets for pinned insects. These cabinets will accommodate approximately 1,600 drawers of expanded space. A portion of this storage will be utilized by incorporating the pollinator collection previously housed at Penn State?s Fruit Research and Extension Center and specimens generated by Penn State?s Center for Pollinator Research. The aphid collection, which consists of slide-mounted specimens, will be imaged on a flatbed scanner and then moved to new custom-built slide cabinets. The slide scans will be transcribed in the Frost Museum database, georeferenced, and the data shared with iDigBio and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

The PIs identify an empirical puzzle that suggests that even an ethnic group heavily affected by conflict may choose representation through a national rather than an ethnic party. The key to the puzzle lies in the different experiences of conflict that bred different rebel-civilian relationships. The PIs theorize that the experience of 'in-group betrayal' (siding with state counterinsurgency rather than ethnic rebels) during ethnic war can undermine the perceived legitimacy of ethno-national political movement and thereby disincentivize ethnic mobilization in post-conflict elections. <br/><br/>While political scientists have linked elections in post-conflict environments as arenas for renewed violence, little is known about how wartime identity politics might have influenced these outcomes. This project connects ethnic politics literature with conflict literature by drawing attention to how the rebel-civilian relationship affects post-conflict electoral politics.  The PIs propose that experience of harm inflicted by in-group rebel leaders affect the likelihood of ethnic political mobilization among conflict-affected groups. Methodologically, the PIs use a survey experiment procedure to assess the validity of the causal mechanism of 'in-group betrayal' in a highly sensitive political environment. Identifying the source of cross-ethnic political mobilization after a violent conflict has important implications for post-war reconstruction.

However, engineering principles to support the rigorous design and quantitative test of systems incorporating AI components are needed to ensure properties such as security, robustness, and resilience. AI system engineering research will provide the foundation required to establish user trust and promote regulatory activities such as safety assurance. To enable to the promise of AI systems, this project proposes a unique Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site focused on secure, robust, and resilient AI-enabled system engineering. This REU Site will intertwine AI research with cybersecurity and systems engineering in a portfolio of synergistic projects. Ten undergraduate students will be engaged in a ten-week summer research program to conduct research at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMD).  The themes of the proposed REU Site are AI, cybersecurity, and system engineering research and their combined implications. Specifically, the following research topics will be explored: (1) cyber attacks that degrade the performance of AI algorithms; (2) AI-enabled cybersecurity against malicious actors; (3) resilient AI-enabled system engineering methods. These research themes will create opportunities for multidisciplinary knowledge sharing between AI and cybersecurity from software, hardware and system engineering perspectives, including topics in biometrics, UAVs, brain computer interaction, and signal processing.

To do so, it will recruit undergraduate STEM majors to complete STEM degrees and obtain a secondary teacher certification. These STEM undergraduates will receive scholarships and other supports designed to enrich their STEM knowledge, as well as their teaching knowledge and skills.  To expand their STEM content knowledge, the Noyce Scholars will have the opportunity to participate in collaborative mentor-scholar projects, summer computational workshops, and a chemometrics course. They will also benefit from faculty mentorships that include opportunities to reflect on their academic and career pursuits. Monthly workshops will include sessions related to interpersonal skill development, such as grit, and cultural and linguistic competence.  Such skills are important for effective teaching in high-need school districts. The project expects these undergraduate Noyce Scholars will gain the knowledge, skills, and perspectives needed to help students in Central Louisiana high-need secondary schools learn mathematics and science.   <br/><br/>This project at Louisiana State University at Alexandria includes partnerships with seven high-need school districts (Allen, Avoyelles, Concordia, Evangeline, Grant, LaSalle, and Rapides Parish School Districts) and Central Louisiana Technical Community College. There are three specific projects goals.  The first is to recruit, prepare, and graduate 21 qualified undergraduate biology, chemistry, and mathematics majors for secondary education certification over the five-year grant period. The second goal is to provide professional support for the long-term success of these STEM educators.  The final goal is to place and retain a high percentage (90%) of these Scholars in teaching positions in high-need school districts upon graduation as they complete their teaching service requirement of two years of teaching for each one year of scholarship support. The project is based on a theoretical framing that proposes evidence-based and innovative strategies are needed to ensure the preparation of highly effective STEM teachers for service in high-need schools. The project expects to generate new knowledge about pathways that support Scholar success and strategies to increase interest of STEM undergraduates in pursuing teaching careers in high-need schools. A robust project assessment process, led by an independent evaluator, is intended to identify aspects of the program that are most effective in STEM teacher recruitment, retention, and preparation. The project intends to use results from this evaluation to improve the teacher education program and will disseminate the results locally and nationally via publications and presentations. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends Noyce project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary k-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

This instrument will be used to conduct a series of coordinated observations with the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI) at HAARP that will be operated in campaign mode centering upon three major heating experiments. The Arctic atmosphere and the subauroral region are a natural laboratory for understanding plasma-neutral and dynamical coupling in the atmosphere and geospace. The lidar will measure the profile of the ion-neutral collision frequency needed for the determination of D-region electron density profiles from IRI HF radar data.  A second application of coordinated IRWTL and IRI measurements is aimed at the investigation of the charge transfer mechanisms in dusty plasmas based on lidar observations of polar mesospheric clouds and radar observations of polar mesospheric summer echoes. These coordinated measurements will also study the dynamical forcing of E-region winds using the technique of radar artificial periodic irregularities. The combined IRWTL and IRI observations will be used to study  D-region structure as determined from the data collected from the detection of ELF/VLF waves generated by the IRI facility. These studies will have a variety of broader impacts including the study of fundamental processes in plasma physics, aerosols, fluid dynamics while advancing radio science and remote sensing technology and techniques. The award will support research training and professional development of graduate students and two postdoctoral associates. The IRWTL will support the participation of both UAF undergraduate students and visiting students in scientific investigations and engineering projects.

During geomagnetically active periods the auroral electrojet and auroral precipitation occur overhead at the HAARP site facilitating HF heating experiments to higher altitude ranges than otherwise would be the case. The IRWTL observations will yield new wind and temperature measurements in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere in both daytime and nighttime throughout the year; these results would be compared with similar wind and temperature observations obtained at the Poker Flat sodium resonance wind and temperature lidar system located in central Alaska to search for evidence of large scale structure in polar mesospheric winds.

Volcanic unrest prior to eruptions, expressed by increasing seismicity or ground deformation, tends to be directly correlated with subsurface magmatic processes (magma ascent, mixing of different magmas, formation of new pathways into the surrounding rock). Therefore, quantifying the timescales over which these processes operate is at the heart of volcanology and scenario-based hazards mitigation. Fortunately for scientists, magmas carry mineral cargo to the surface that can be used as ?crystal clocks?. Chemical gradients preserved in minerals represent incomplete rehomogenization of the mineral?s chemical components, and can be used to estimate the duration over which the gradients formed through a technique called diffusion chronometry. The rate at which chemical elements diffuse/move in those minerals at magmatic temperatures needs to be first quantified through laboratory experiments for this method to be effective. However, these rates currently suffer from problems associated with simplified experimental setups and may not be directly applicable to natural magmas. This project proposes to carry out new sets of lab experiments at high temperature to better tune our crystal clocks, to aid in quantification of magmatic timescales under high threat volcanoes.<br/>The project also develops ?Experiments in Geosciences? as a common theme and educational goal. High school and college undergraduate student interest in STEM vocations has been shown to decline towards graduation. STEM careers are often deemed difficult due to math, physics or chemistry requirements, and achievement gaps tend to affect underrepresented minorities the hardest. Hawaii is one of the most diverse places in the US, yet this diversity is not yet reflected in undergraduate enrollment in Geosciences. Through series of integrated educational and outreach activities involving the PI, a Native Hawaiian PhD student, a MS student in Geoscience education, as well as several undergraduate students and senior collaborators, this project seeks to reconnect high school and undergraduate students to science and scientific research through hands-on experimentation. <br/><br/>Diffusion chronometry in minerals is a powerful technique to extract magmatic timescales, based on the extent of concentration gradients produced by element diffusion with time. The method can theoretically be used to resolve any timescale, as long as suitable analytical tools are available, and the element diffusion rate is well known. Diffusion chronometry has experienced a surge in igneous applications over the last two decades as diffusion coefficients have become available. These coefficients are extracted from laboratory experiments involving solid couples, but natural magmatic minerals are surrounded by melt. The few diffusivities derived from melt-solid experiments appear significantly faster than their solid-solid counterparts. This project aims to better understand diffusion in minerals within magma. (i) Series of mineral-melt diffusion experiments will be carried out in the lab using olivine and plagioclase to determine whether diffusivities obtained are similar or higher than solid couples. Analytical work and TEM imaging will aid in understanding the mechanisms underpinning any differences observed. The experiments will also be used to extract melt-crystal partition coefficients. (ii) A unique, 29 year-long natural experiment (a slowly cooled lava lake) will be leveraged to test the diffusion chronometry technique. Olivine within a series of drill core samples collected 1959-1988 will be analyzed to study the compositional homogenization of elements within an olivine population, and detailed elemental profiles used to test the diffusion chronometry method with samples of known temperature histories. The overarching theme of this project is experimentation, both for research and educational purposes. A ?scaled earth laboratory? will be built during the project to allow students to engage in the science reasoning process, from designing to performing experiments, collecting and interpreting data, and making connections with natural systems. This lab will be exploited for undergraduate experiences at all levels and a new introductory course will be constructed with the help of the graduate students involved. Mobile portions of the lab will be taken to high schools, benefiting from an existing funded outreach effort (EPIK). We will conduct ?Science Saturdays? events, where small groups of high schoolers and their teachers are invited to tour the experimental and analytical facilities. Emphasis will be put on providing a tiered mentoring structure, where the PI, graduates, undergraduates all contribute to student advising. Everyone will get training on how to conduct Place-based investigations, and sensitized to the need to strengthen our institutions by increasing diversity and promoting equitable access to STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, harassing behaviors impede this goal. In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) published the report, Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. This report conceptualizes the most prevalent sexually harassing behaviors as gender harassment, described as ?verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey hostility, objectification, exclusion, or second-class status?. Evidence indicates that academia is second only to the military in prevalence of sexually harassing behaviors. Evidence also indicates that, within academia, engineering is second only to medicine. Unfortunately, published engineering-specific data about frequency of occurrences are scarce and it is evident from this limited published data that there are substantial gaps in the knowledge base. Of particular concern is the disproportionate lack of data disaggregated by demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identification, sexual orientation, intersectionality), the lack of data disaggregated by discipline within engineering (e.g., aerospace engineering vs. chemical engineering), and the lack of data about the prevalence and nature of harassing behaviors during experiential learning opportunities (e.g., co-ops, internships, research experiences). Ultimately, the results of this project will lay the foundation for future research and inform the design and implementation of interventions. <br/> <br/>This project will bring together representatives of Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) in an effort to determine what data already exists at IHEs and could be published, to identify priorities for additional data, and to engage in a coordinated national effort to collect and analyze data. The workshop will occur virtually, over several months to give participants time in between sessions to engage in action assignments. The workshop will employ a participatory action research method, known as Group-Level Assessment (GLA), to address the research questions: (1) Who is interested in conducting this work (i.e., who are our workshop participants and who do they identify as collaborators and other stakeholders)? (2) What do workshop participants (self-identified as interested in this topic) already know, and what do they want to know, about existing data (inside and outside their institutions) and the landscape in engineering? (3) What methodological tools and other skills and resources do researchers need for conducting research on harassing behaviors at their institutions? The use of GLA will emphasize the development of action plans determined by a broad group of stakeholders; engage workshop participants in the process of making decisions about data, priorities, and action plans; and actively model a method that could be used by workshop participants in their own data collection and analysis efforts. In addition to published proceedings, outcomes of this workshop will include several toolkits on topics such as data collection and analysis, conversations with stakeholders at IHEs, and recruiting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, late-stage protein engineering represents a major time, labor, and financial bottleneck. Since real-world translation is the focus of late-stage development, assays are more reflective of their end-use application and therefore necessarily require more time, labor, and capital. This precludes many variants from being screened at this stage. Failure at these late stages of development is costly, and often results from a change in environmental parameters from test conditions in early high throughput screens. Accurate prediction of protein variants based on minimal data but with high likelihood of function under end-use conditions is a critical unmet need.<br/><br/>The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging a machine learning model, trained on raw protein sequences, mutagenesis datasets and natural sequence- function pairs, to predict highly functional variants of a protein of interest (POI) without sequence-function datasets specific to the selected POI and application. Such an approach, known as zero-shot learning, has not been applied to protein engineering to date. To achieve this, a large-scale language model will be trained with almost 5 billion curated unlabeled protein sequences from public and private databases and a collection of mutagenesis datasets. This general knowledge model can then be fused with an application-specific top model derived from natural sequences (distinct from the POI) paired with parameters of their natural environments. This training is hypothesized to imbue the model with a notion of which sequence features improve protein function in a general sense, and under particular environmental conditions (e.g., high temperature, high salinity, etc.). To demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approach, the model will be used in virtual directed evolution experiments to optimize two therapeutically relevant enzymes, optimized for function in non-native environments, and assessed for this function in vitro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These traits are among the most widespread and successful adaptations in the plant kingdom for mitigating drought stress, and thus, represent highly useful traits for the design of climate-resilient crops. The goal of this project is to test optimized synthetic versions of crassulacean acid metabolism alone and in combination with engineered tissue succulence. The proposed synthetic gene circuits developed by this project can be applied widely to other food, feed, fiber, and biofuel crops to improve their productivity, improve water-use efficiency, and drought/salinity stress tolerance under the hotter and drier environments of the future. The project will also provide training of an increasingly diverse scientific workforce through student recruitment efforts that target students from historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In addition, the project will provide training and preparedness of future scientists in evidence-based, visually focused, scientific communication through unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars in plant biochemistry, synthetic biology, and biotechnology blended with infographics, interactive visualizations, and visual social media. The investigators will increase public awareness of the need for more climate-resilient crops through the production of two high-quality videos describing the project deliverables to showcase the societal benefit of these biotechnological innovations. Lastly, the training and outreach activities will be evaluated through robust assessment activities to appraise their impact on public science outreach.<br/><br/>Future increases in drought severity and duration will significantly slow the rate of crop productivity increases needed to satisfy future projected crop demands and threaten global food security. Therefore, innovative synthetic biology approaches for curtailing photorespiration and improving water-use efficiency via the introduction of synthetic crassulacean acid metabolism into C3 photosynthesis crops are essential. The proposed research will generate optimized synthetic carboxylation, decarboxylation, starch degradation, and complete crassulacean acid metabolism gene circuits. The resulting plants will be evaluated for improved growth, productivity, water-use efficiency, and water-deficit and salinity tolerance. In addition, plants expressing optimized crassulacean acid metabolism gene circuits will be evaluated with and without engineered tissue succulence in Arabidopsis and soybean, a critically important C3 photosynthesis crop for the U.S.. Empirical testing will be accompanied by detailed, genome-scale transcriptomic and metabolome profiling and diel flux balance analysis modeling to corroborate energetic efficiency predictions for each iteration of the synthetic crassulacean acid metabolism gene circuits. The broader impacts of the project include improving national food, feed, fiber, and biofuel security by enhancing crop productivity, water-use efficiency, and drought/salinity tolerance in a changing environment. Outreach and training goals include ensuring the training of an increasingly diverse scientific workforce through recruitment of underrepresented students, providing training and preparedness of future scientists in scientific communication, increasing public awareness of the need to improve the climate-resiliency of crops using videos describing the concepts of synthetic CAM and engineered tissue succulence, and assessing training, outreach and engagement activities for didactic and societal impacts.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program and the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unique opportunities for outreach and education will also be created through open-source software development, interactive workshops, and curriculum development. <br/><br/>The main thrusts of the project include the following: i) investigate novel edge and distributed cloud computing methods to develop a massive, parallel data platform purposefully built for deploying AI algorithms on big data; ii) investigate new architectures for deploying multipurpose machine learning algorithms, which will enable the development of a decision support system that is interactive and collaborative - with abilities to respond to questions via voice, text, or web interactions and continuously learn from a human expert to enable it to improve its performance over time; and iii) develop a framework for infusing explainability at every stage of the AI lifecycle (training, testing, deployment) by integrating rule-based learning into the building blocks of the multipurpose model ? this will provide insight and visibility into black-box AI algorithms, allowing humans to play an active part of the AI process and course-correct when needed. In pursuing these objectives, this CAREER project draws inspiration from theories of deep learning and adaptive computing to design and deploy an end-to-end transportation systems management solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Production of ethylene and propylene is among the most energy-intensive processes in the chemical sector, emitting more than 300 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. The project explores an alternative to current industry practice known as chemical-looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH).   CL-ODH has potential to substantially increase energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions compared to conventional ODH.  The project focuses on improving the performance and durability of CL-ODH catalyst materials by understanding ? at a fundamental level ? the mechanism by which they work, and by using that understanding to optimize catalyst design.        <br/><br/>The project focuses on the mechanistic aspects of alkali metal molybdate promoted perovskites oxides, specifically, Na2MoO4, Na2Mo2O7 or K2MoO4 promoted La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 and La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 for CL-ODH of ethane and propane. The CL-ODH concept has potential to greatly intensify light-olefin production. The research team has previously discovered that molybdate promoted perovskite oxides form a core-shell structure with the Mn/Fe-containing perovskite oxide core promoting active lattice oxygen storage/exchange, and the molten molybdate shell facilitating selective C-H bond activation and oxidative conversion. This project represents the first in-depth attempt to investigate the roles of the core, shell, and active species for this novel redox catalyst system.  The project aims to unveil the underlying mechanisms for the CL-ODH reactions by preparing thin-film model catalysts and performing extensive characterizations using a variety of surface science tools.  Epitaxially grown thin films of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 and La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 will be prepared on commercially available SrTiO3 via polymer-assisted deposition. This is followed with sequential MBE deposition of MoO3 and Na/K, and O2 ambient treatment. The growth of the thin film will be monitored in situ and characterized afterwards.  Mechanistic investigations and reactive testing will be performed on perovskite thin film samples both with and without alkali metal molybdates to establish a rational approach for redox catalyst optimization.  Results from the project will be integrated in teaching by the investigators. Through the Kenan fellowship program at North Carolina State University, high school teachers will be involved in the project to stimulate students' interest towards STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underrepresentation means that academia and industry are shortchanged from the benefits associated with greater diversity among their technical professionals. The 50k Coalition was founded in 2016 by the leaders of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) to recruit stakeholder organizations that would work collaboratively to broaden participation in engineering. Now totaling 60 institutional members (33 universities, 22 engineering professional societies, and five corporations), the 50k Coalition will use this planning grant from the Broadening Participation in Engineering program to develop a strategic plan that will focus on increasing the retention and graduation attainment of undergraduate BIPOC and women students by building the capacity of existing Multicultural Engineering Programs (MEPs) and Women in Engineering Programs (WEPs). We will also develop plans to assist in the development of MEP/WEP structures and programs on campuses that do not currently have them. Since the 1970?s, the MEP and WEP functions in engineering schools have proliferated and been successful, but neither the availability nor the implementation of MEP/WEP functions is universal across ABET-accredited institutions. While there is research available on the positive impact of MEP/WEPs, there is not yet research to define models of highly effective MEP/WEP offices, or to support implementation in ways that ensure their quality and longevity. The knowledge generated from this planning grant will fill this gap. The presence of these functions is critical to broadening participation in engineering and thus achieving the Coalition?s goals as well as the goals of the NSF Engineering Directorate.<br/><br/>During the planning process, we will: 1) conduct ethnographic research to construct archetypes (that will become blueprints) of successful MEP/WEP offices for various institutional types: large, small, public, private, minority-serving; 2) develop guidelines for implementing, scaling, and institutionalizing MEP/WEP programs and plan for a transparent common-evidence system; 3.) determine the role that the NSBE, SWE, SHPE and AISES collegiate chapters can play in MEP/WEP capacity building, given that chapters are typically sponsored by MEP and WEP offices. Extended Case Study analysis of 50k Coalition engineering schools that are currently graduating higher than-average numbers of American Indian, African American, Hispanic or women students (positive outliers), will provide insight into key characteristics of successful MEP/WEP programs and how to best implement and institutionalize them. The study will also include two HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), two HSIs (Hispanic-serving Institutions), and a TCU (tribal college/university), all ABET accredited. Moreover, WEPs are typically structured to support women students (i.e., white, Asian, BIPOC, female identified) though not necessarily exclusively, while MEPs engage BIPOC students (those identified as male, female and gender non-conforming). Although these groups are not intentionally exclusive, recent literature has highlighted how Black women are not adequately served by engineering programs (Gibson & Espino, 2016). With this in mind, we will focus part of our study on how various intersections of identity are considered in MEP/WEP programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Future U.S. competitiveness depends on how well prepared the nation?s students are for 21st century careers in STEM. The CUNY-Lehman College teacher preparation program intends ensure that more students are prepared for these future STEM careers.  To do so, it will recruit three cohorts of individuals who have obtained baccalaureate degrees in a STEM discipline and support them in earning a master?s degree in education with teacher certification.  The support will include a two-semester, mentored experience in public schools.  The project is expected to strengthen the pipeline into mathematics and science teaching in areas with high needs and to improve the quality of STEM teaching in public elementary, middle, and high schools in New York. <br/><br/>This project at the City University of New York-Lehman includes partnerships with high-need, New York school districts in the Bronx and in Mount Vernon.  During each of the first three years of the project, it intends to recruit annual cohorts of nine individuals who have a STEM degree and provide them with scholarships and other support to complete a master?s degree.  As a result, 27 new certified STEM teachers should be teaching in high need schools by the end of the award.  The project will provide the Noyce Scholars with coursework that builds their content knowledge and pedagogical skills in working with elementary and secondary school students in science and mathematics classrooms.  Additional project goals include development of the Noyce Scholars? ability to connect teaching and learning to the experiences of their linguistically and culturally diverse students.  These skills are expected to be honed during a two-semester sequence of immersive experiences at New World High School in the Bronx and at a K-8 school in Mount Vernon, where the Noyce Scholars will be mentored by experienced in-service STEM classroom teachers.  The project also aims to build the capacity of the host schools to provide high-quality, clinical experiences for pre-service teachers, both online and onsite, by becoming ?best practice? demonstration sites.  The project also intends to reform and implement a joint elementary-secondary teacher preparation program to meet local school needs.  Finally, the project aims to generate and disseminate new knowledge about the relationships between teacher effectiveness and their preparation in mathematics and science education. This Track 1 Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-elevation environments exceeding 2500 meters above sea level pose severe biological, ecological, and logistical challenges for human adaptation. While it is recognized that humans have used such settings on an ephemeral basis for thousands of years, catalysts of sustained year-round human occupation of such places remain a matter of debate. This project examines this issues in a region with an average elevation of over 4500 meters above sea level and focuses on the introduction of cold-adapted domesticated species which are believed to have contributed significantly to permanent human occupation. However, the prehistoric archaeology of the area is in its infancy. Such high-altitude zones can provide anthropologists with appropriate laboratories to examine the impact of novel technologies and interactions on people living in high-elevation extremes. It is to such regions that scholars must turn to discover the causes and process of human engagements. <br/><br/>Using a theoretical framework blending risk-reduction and optimization-based models of high-altitude foragers with culture contact dynamics, the doctoral student and colleagues develop hypotheses that attempt to capture the range of risk-management strategies adopted by local occupants given the region's formidable natural constraints. These hypotheses are evaluated via an integrated program of excavation at a site with a well-stratified cultural sequence. The project addresses major questions of culture-historic importance for understanding the sustained long-term occupation at high elevations and documents an entirely new and potentially unprecedented cultural complex.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hospital-acquired infections can be prevented by killing bacteria, molds, and fungi; and inactivating viruses on surfaces before they are able to pass to another person. The project will develop antimicrobial paints based on hydrogen peroxide (HP), which does not have toxic degradation products since it turns into water and oxygen. HP has a long history of safe use, without allowing generation of resistant strains of infectious organisms.  The paints can improve hygiene, and allow more efficient cleaning with peroxide-based agents, from which the paints can regenerate their antimicrobial efficacy, providing durable protection without highly toxic chemical applications. Competing antimicrobial paints are expensive, have not demonstrated long-term antimicrobial activity, or have used chemistries that carry the risk of developing microbial resistance. The proposed peroxide based antimicrobial paint will be more affordable, and very safe to implement, allowing regeneration of efficacy during cleaning. This will enable more widespread use in public health and institutional settings to help protect against transmissible infections.<br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the technical challenge of developing an antimicrobial paint that can be regenerated, based on the use of HP in the formulation to achieve broad-spectrum antimicrobial and virucidal activity with long-term efficacy. This project leverages new technology to produce paint coatings that can sequester HP into a coated surface in a dry non-volatile form. This enables the slow release of HP over time that can be regenerated by exposure to commercially available solutions containing HP. HP degrades into innocuous products. Bacteria and viruses are not able to develop resistance to its disinfecting mechanism. Hence, the resulting product and its regeneration process will be long-lasting, cost-effective and environmentally safe. Technical challenges to be addressed in this project include ensuring formulation stability, antimicrobial and virucidal potency and recharging functionality of the paint, and the effects of HP on paint integrity. The team will closely collaborate with specialty coatings experts to develop and test viable paint formulations. Anticipated technical results include a prototype version of the technology, and documentation of the research outcomes and further regeneration requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>This project focuses on coral reefs ? one of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet that are being lost at an alarming rate.  This loss threatens human lives because coral reefs provide food, income, and shoreline protection. Efforts are underway worldwide to rehabilitate reefs, with mixed success.  This project uses a novel approach to rebuild coral reef ecosystems by building artificial reefs and seeding them with biota from healthy coral reefs.  The project will be carried out in Ranobe Bay in southwest Madagascar which contains 32 kilometers of coastline with 13 villages, increasing populations, and growing rates of malnutrition largely caused by overfishing.  The primary goal is to rebuild healthy coral reef ecosystems and increase fisheries catch in Madagascar to reduce the incidence of malnutrition in the most impoverished country in the world.  All aspects of the project will involve local scientists and fishers. The project will utilize cutting edge tools, including environmental DNA barcoding, fisher supported GPS tracking of fisheries activities, and extensive human health and well-being data collection to comprehensively connect ecosystem health to human health.  This project will provide a comprehensive blueprint for other coral reef restoration projects by thoroughly testing a new technology, creating tools to measure success, providing a guide describing the ecosystem to human health data collection protocols. Overall, this project will greatly enhance the equitable and sustainable use of marine resources and will respond to a threat caused by global change, all with a tool that can be applied anywhere coral reef ecosystems are found.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

About 15 km downstream of the avalanche location, the Rishi Ganga Hydroelectric project was washed off and the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Tapovan project was also damaged. The cause of this glacier melt-induced landslide and flooding is suspected to have links to global warming and glacial retreat. The data to be collected for this project will inform whether this natural disaster was triggered by snowpack and glacial melt versus land-use change and deforestation, or a combination of these factors, that cause devastating landslides and floods in the ecologically fragile, headwater region of the Ganges. Understanding hydrologic and geomorphic processes in high-altitude environments is essential to closely evaluate if human-induced changes are contributing to extreme events. Improvements in our ability to predict glacial outburst/landslide/flooding events in high elevation, glaciated areas such as the Himalayan region has potential to mitigate impacts of future disasters.<br/><br/>Changing climate and deforestation are impacting hydrological processes in the high elevation regions of the Himalayan range. Climate change is causing glacial retreat and changes in snowpack dynamics, while deforestation and land use change are modifying snow energy budgets and soil moisture dynamics. These impacts are compounded by one another and may result in extreme flood events. The data to be collected for this project will inform gaps in knowledge on snowmelt runoff and soil moisture dynamics and landslide vulnerability in the hillslopes of the Himalayan Range.

However, most current biomass fractionation processes face issues such as unwanted loss of carbohydrate fractions (cellulose fibers and hemicellulose sugars) and significant structure changes of lignin (aromatic compounds) during the process, both of which devalue the fractionated components. The proposed project will develop an energy-efficient, inexpensive, and value-preserving biomass fractionation system using aldehyde sulfonic acids. The success of the proposed research will directly impact the U.S. lignocellulose-based biorefinery, pulp and paper industries, and other related sectors. It will also contribute to a low-carbon bioeconomy by replacing petroleum feedstocks and reducing energy consumption in the fractionation process. The project will promote STEM education in biorefineries, bioenergy, and bioproducts (3B) through graduate and undergraduate student training (particularly female and minority students) and curriculum development. This project will also include outreach activities with K-12 students by providing lab tours, summer practicums, and research projects for the students interested in the 3B fields. <br/><br/>The proposed research uses novel aldehyde sulfonic acids (aldehyde-containing aromatic sulfonic acids) to accomplish a rapid and near-complete fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass without the need for significant biomass size-reduction pretreatment. This process not only maximizes the production of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin but it also reduces process energy consumption relative to existing methods. Using a model-based molecular design approach, aldehyde sulfonic acids with tunable structure, physical properties, and reactivity will be synthesized from inexpensive aldehyde-containing aromatics by sulfonation. Mechanistically, aldehyde sulfonic acids fractionate lignocellulose through the sulfonic acid group and then protect carbohydrates and lignin from degradation and condensation by interaction with the aldehyde group. Because of their multifunction nature as a catalyst, solvent, and preserver, aldehyde sulfonic acids are expected to fractionate centimeter-sized lignocellulose feedstocks rapidly and nearly completely under mild conditions into cleavable and upgradable lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. This research will test the central hypothesis that aldehyde sulfonic acid would be more effective and selective than current combinations of mineral/organic acids and aldehydes in fractionating lignocellulose. Mathematical models will be developed using quantitative structure-performance analysis to predict structural properties and performance of a range of aldehyde sulfonic acids. The tandem depolymerization and reversible preservation of lignin and hemicellulose will be mechanistically elucidated through these modeling studies to understand the cleavage reaction kinetics of the acid-labile linkages and the formation of protective chemical groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FlyBase provides an openly accessible centralized resource for Drosophila genetic and genomic data to enable researchers and educators worldwide both in the Drosophila community and broader biomedical sciences community to further their research. Drosophila is one of the premier model organisms and provides cost-effective help in elucidating the basic tenets of genetic and developmental mechanisms. FlyBase has three main goals. First, it curates literature and reagents relevant to Drosophila research, so that researchers can continue to rely on FlyBase to find the latest innovations in the field. FlyBase prioritizes curation of data sets relevant to gene expression, cellular functions, signaling pathways, and results relevant to human biology, and displays the information in an intuitive, integrated, readily searchable format. Secondly,  it strives to be of value to the broader genetics and population genetics communities, by curating and integrating relevant data sets, and developing tools that enable better access to this wealth of data. Finally, it seeks to develop and integrate tools to expand it's utility. FlyBase has a long history of very successfully serving the scientific community in this capacity. FlyBase works closely with other Model Organism Databases (MODs) to integrate data sets and develop tools to enable cross-species analyses.  NSF funding allows FlyBase to maintain its three main activities.<br/><br/>Activities essential to the operation of FlyBase include: Automated triaging pipeline; Full genetic curation with emphasis on genome feature curation and physical interaction curation; Human disease model curation; Allele-based curation of disease models based on the Disease Ontology; Gene Group curation; Curation of datasets deemed to be of highest general interest to the FlyBase user community; Import of graphical abstracts in FlyBase references; Identification of new lncRNAs, anti-sense lncRNAs and smORFs; Incorporation of available transcription start site data into FlyBase; Addition of new anatomy terms; Review and improvement of phenotypic class ontologies; Development of database modules for gene groups and human disease models; Annotation of all Drosophila cell types and curation of scRNAseq data sets; Update of the genomic sequences of all Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) strains; Expansion of a Pathway page resource. To facilitate integrative analyses and approaches FlyBase continues to expand its utility as a platform by integrating and displaying large-scale studies, transcriptomics and proteomics data sets. In addition, FlyBase improves access and display of tools available within the community, and incorporates the most useful data sets and tools for visualizing complex data sets to enable more researchers to take a more global approach to their genetic research. NSF funding allows for continued coordination with the ongoing operation and maintenance of the existing infrastructure to enable discovery in the biological sciences by supporting the computational database pipeline infrastructure of FlyBase data. FlyBase will maintain and further develop the central database that houses all FlyBase data; manage the incorporation of additional curated or large-scale data into the database; produce weekly internal reports and bi-monthly outputs that are transformed into the updates to the public FlyBase servers; work closely with NCBI to incorporate genome annotation-related data into FlyBase and to submit periodic whole genome annotation updates to GenBank. Collectively, these activities maximize the impact of essential Drosophila research on discovery and translation. Through their role in carrying out these missions, FlyBase will continue to help Drosophila research advance as quickly as possible for the ultimate benefit of various scientific communities via http://flybase.org<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The design, growth and synthesis, development, and characterization of electronic materials are central to a wide range of scientific fields, from quantum sensing, communication and computation to renewable energy, optical communication and sensing, data storage, power systems, and nano-electronics. EMC provides a unique opportunity for researchers from academia, government labs, and industry to meet and share the latest cutting-edge results across these broad range of fields. While currently drawing from a broad range of disciplines and institutions, EMC is looking to broaden participation of scientists and engineers from minority serving institutions (MSIs), including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

Specifically, the researchers will study a group of molecules that are predicted to play important roles in plant growth, development, and defense, which are critical to crop quality and yield. Because bacteria and nematodes infect a wide range of plants and these molecules are present in virtually all crop plants, successful completion of the proposed objectives will have broad significance to U.S. agriculture. This work will provide interdisciplinary training of postdoctoral researchers and mentoring of undergraduate and high school students on cutting-edge technologies of genetics, proteomics, and molecular biology. <br/><br/>Diverse species of plant pathogens secrete molecules that mimic those produced by the host as a strategy to manipulate host cellular function. For example, the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) secretes a microbial peptide called RaxX, which is required for activation of rice XA21-mediated immunity. RaxX shares sequence similarity to the plant peptide containing sulfated tyrosine (PSY) family, which is critical for plant growth and development. RaxX is conserved in multiple Xanthomonas species and can promote root growth to the same extent as the host PSY peptide. Null mutation of raxX compromises the virulence of Xoo on rice plants that lack the XA21 immune receptor. Together, these results suggest that RaxX functions as a bacterial virulence factor. The researchers discovered that the genomes of the root-knot nematode, of the Meloidogyne incognita group, are also predicted to contain genes for PSY-like peptides (named MigPSY). In Arabidopsis, PSY promotes cellular proliferation and expansion. Considering that formation of the nematode feeding site requires extensive host cell expansion and cell wall modifications, we hypothesize that root-knot nematodes utilize MigPSY to commandeer host PSY signaling to manipulate cellular proliferation and remodeling during feeding site formation. This proposal aims to test this hypohtesis. This project will (1) analyze the expression and bioactivity of PSY-like peptides, (2) investigate how PSY-like signaling contributes to successful bacterial and nematode infection, and (3) identify plant receptors involved in this signaling response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These extremes (e.g., wildfires, heat waves, storms, etc.) contribute to an estimated 150,000 deaths each year, and the World Health Organization conservatively projects they will result in 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050. Addressing these escalating environmental extremes will require personal and household adaptation to reduce human suffering (e.g., chronic respiratory ailments due to wildfire smoke exposure) and death (e.g., as a result of acute smoke exposure). The unprecedented scope of extremes makes it difficult for people to adapt, particularly for low-income persons of color (POC) who have access to fewer resources. Effective, low-cost, easily-accessible decision support tools such as those deployed through smartphone applications could play an important role in helping people understand the escalating nature of extremes and motivate them to adopt behaviors that result in improved personal outcomes contributing to greater societal resiliency. Yet, little is known about how exposure experienced as events unfold ? unbiased by time or outcome knowledge ? affects psychosocial factors, adaptation behaviors, and personal outcomes, and how decision support effects decision making in this context. The objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) integrated research and education plan are to (1) advance fundamental understanding of how decision support tools affect adaptation behavior given psychosocial antecedents in the face of real-time exposure to escalating extremes over time, particularly among low-income POC populations, (2) advance the conceptualization and testing of environmental extremes adaptation behavior models, and (3) transform how we train and educate the next generation of behavioral decision scientists to co-produce and deploy decision support tools with relevant stakeholders ? especially among those low-income POC populations that may benefit the most?to more effectively motivate adaptation behaviors that yield desired adaptation outcomes.<br/><br/>The research objectives will be achieved by conducting a longitudinal randomized controlled trial to determine whether a ?positive affect? or ?social comparison? wildfire smoke intervention, delivered via a smartphone app-based decision support tool, can effectively enhance adaptation behaviors (face mask wearing, sheltering, home or workplace improvements) and desired adaptation outcomes (improved health, adoption of other adaptation measures such as fire protection) in the context of actual exposure (volatile organic compounds, NO2, particulate matter) among approximately 720 San Francisco Bay Area residents from low-income POC communities over time. My educational objective will be achieved by developing and testing a Research-Education-Practice curriculum that trains behavioral decision science scholars on co-producing and deploying effective decision support tools, and attracts and retains underrepresented minorities, low-income, and first-generation students and young investigators.

They often function under milder conditions, are more energy efficient, and generate less chemical waste. They also have a smaller carbon footprint if operated using renewable electricity. However, some catalysts often convert water to hydrogen as an undesirable side reaction that wastes energy.

The challenge of product selectivity over hydrogen evolution is pervasive throughout electrochemical reduction reactions. The studies will pursue catalyst design strategies to kinetically suppress proton reduction while not inhibiting the reduction of desired substrates. The strategies will be tested on complexes designed to have CO2 reduction activity. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction toward fuels is important as a mechanism for renewable energy storage and transport.

This measurement method is particularly significant in measuring cell signaling where small molecule messengers travel between cells dictating how they interact with their neighboring cells and environment. Because of the generality of the sensing method, the approach can be applied to a wide range of cell types, including non-neuronal cells in the brain. The proposed approach by Professor White and his team involves embedding a cellular membrane protein receptor, or protein channel, at the end of a nanoneedle electrode that can be placed in proximity to various interfaces for localized detection. In order the achieve this detection, the project will overcome the major challenge in protein channel measurements for analytical purposes ? the ability to control and maintain a single channel through the duration of an experiment. The long-term goal of the research program is to develop probes that create ?artificial synapses? to monitor the dynamics and heterogeneity of the cell membrane and cellular microenvironment. The work will provide broad impact in measurement science and new knowledge in the measure of cellular communication in the brain. This impact will reach a diverse group of students and scientists through the development of a program targeting the increased and sustained participation of first-generation college students in undergraduate research, through the creation of a strong community and culture.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop nanoscale ion channel probes for imaging and localized molecular and ion sensing at interfaces with high spatial resolution (nanometer-micrometer). The impactful research will expand localized detection abilities to analytes that are not accessible with current methodologies, because the analytes are neither optically nor electrochemically active. This need is particularly significant in measuring cell signaling where messengers travel between cells, dictating how they interact with their environment. The measurements enabled by the new method will facilitate discoveries of how astrocytes, with contacts to the neurovascular system and neurons, differentially signal between the two which is critical for networked communication in the brain. Currently, however, there is a lack of generalizable tools that can measure molecules localized at a cell surface. The use of ion channel probes for scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), where protein channels are embedded in a lipid bilayer at the end of a probe, is a promising method to leverage ion channel activity for ion and molecular detection with the imaging capabilities of SICM. However, major hurdles exist that hinder their use. To overcome these challenges, Professor White and his team will develop a new SICM imaging mode that employs metal nanoneedle probes that support ion channel measurements with dramatically reduced probe size over existing approaches for localized detection at interfaces. They will demonstrate the ability to perform localized detection on test-bed inorganic substrates and the surface of astrocyte cells. These measurements are anticipated to enable the first direct, localized detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from astrocytes. The broader impacts of the work lie in the ability of the proposed measurement method to provide new knowledge about how biological systems (single cells, tissue slices) communicate via the release of small molecules. This impact will reach a diverse group of students and scientists through the development of a ""Pathway to Undergraduate Research"" program that targets increased and sustained participation of first-generation college students in undergraduate research through the creation of a strong community and culture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, over 30% of our proteins have regions that are not rigid, but rather are floppy tethers that connect the chemically-active regions. Two examples of tethers are: immunoreceptors, the proteins involved in how immune cells receive signals from other cells; and formins, proteins that maintain the cell's architectural skeleton and are hijacked by invading bacteria including cholera. Tethers are easy to overlook. In part, this is because the mathematical descriptions that allow understanding of rigid proteins do not work for tethers. Therefore, mathematically characterizing tethers may lead to novel avenues of research in biology and medicine that were missed by focusing only of the rigid regions of proteins. This project will develop a mathematical description of tethers. The mathematics will be used to, first, develop a rapid computational algorithm to simulate the first few steps of how immune cells respond to external signals, including how they respond to off-switch signals through the protein PD-1, signals that is exploited by cancers to evade immune detection. Second, the mathematics will be used to study the tethers in formins. The resulting mathematics will create new connections between two separate fields of mathematics: stochastic process theory, and polymer physics. The project will also result in the training of graduate students with skills in immunology, cell biology, applied mathematics, computational science, and biophysics. Open-access resources for enabling computational science researchers will also be developed. These will have a special focus on creating tools for research in the remote era, including tutorials for high school and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Many proteins (around 30% in humans) have regions that lack well-defined structure, but rather fluctuate through an ensemble of configurations characterized by high intrinsic disorder. Many of these act as tethers that connect chemical reaction sites. Examples include immunoreceptors like the T Cell Receptor, PD1 and CD28, and formins, which regulate cytoskeleton assembly. Tethered reactions are ubiquitous; they have properties that are fundamentally distinct from standard solution reactions, requiring novel mathematical characterization; they are exploited by biology; and, in some cases, they provide novel avenues for therapeutics. This project exploits and extends a long-known mathematical correspondence between stochastic process theory and polymer physics to study tethered reactions. The mathematical theory aims to resolve biological mysteries, first, concerning the formin tethers and their ability to assemble the cytoskeleton even when bound at both termini, in a force-responsive manner. Second, the project addresses experimental data on immunoreceptor tethered signaling that cannot be explained by models that omit volume exclusion (crowding). The project will also develop 3 online resources that will help the Mathematical Biology community thrive in a future dominated by online interaction, including tutorials for high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as experiments probe deeper with increasing energies, it is evident that the SM is an incomplete theory; for example, it fails to account for astronomical dark matter. This work at the CMS Experiment at the CERN LHC, seeks to explore multiple avenues to discover and characterize the nature of dark matter particles and to contribute to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade. Research and education activities will be integrated by providing international collaborative research opportunities for undergraduate students and by developing a new course that uses open-source data for the upper-division undergraduate curriculum.<br/><br/>One goal of this project is to explore signatures with one or more jets and an overall momentum imbalance to discover and characterize dark matter particles. In addition, the Higgs boson will be used as a tool for discovery by searching for its decay to invisible particles. Techniques to suppress the effects of additional proton-proton interactions in jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction both at the real-time event selection (trigger) and analysis levels will also be explored to maximize the sensitivity to the dark matter searches. The High Luminosity LHC will increase the discovery potential for new particles, providing unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter processes. However, the projected 200 proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing at the LHC will pose severe challenges as the data rates in CMS will grow significantly and the readout of the sub-detectors will be very demanding. To adequately handle the challenging operating conditions and high data bandwidths, nearly all sub-detectors of the CMS experiment will be upgraded. The work will develop new readout electronics for the Inner Tracker sub-system of the CMS detector as an important element of the HL LHC upgrade.<br/><br/>The PI plans to establish procedures for recasting physics results and to provide a publicly available software implementation of the searches for new particles. The planned work provides an educational opportunity through experiential learning to undergraduate and graduate students who will participate in the electronics development project. In addition to direct research experience, the PI aims to integrate education and research through a redesign of the academic components of a Boston University study abroad program at CERN that encapsulates academic courses and hands-on research opportunities. The PI will also host the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics at Boston University, using it to foster dialogue with high schools through the involvement of STEP-UP Ambassadors in the conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Companies across the chemical industry have pinpointed electrochemistry as a promising avenue for the implementation of more sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing processes. However, the large cost and effort required in new process development hinders the implementation of electrochemical technologies. ML predictive algorithms can be a powerful tool to accelerate the development and optimization of more sustainable chemical processes, but repeatedly require large amounts of experimental data to train the models. These large datasets are often unavailable and expensive to obtain, which significantly limits the use of ML in the chemical industry. The project will advance future manufacturing by enabling the development of new and more sustainable chemical production routes using 50% less experiments, ultimately unlocking the manufacture of new molecules, medicines, and materials in societal applications. Moreover, by reducing the number of experiments required, the technology will significantly lower emissions and resource consumption in the industry.<br/><br/>The proposed project introduces a ML platform capable of guiding experimental campaigns and data collection to enable accurate predictions of reaction behavior with the smallest possible datasets. The approach relies on the combination of chemical engineering and ML knowledge to overcome the optimization limitations found within each field.

Some organic pollutants of drinking water are not easily treated by the commonly used techniques of filtration and chlorination, so advanced treatment processes are used. Advanced treatment typically requires complex and expensive systems that are difficult to use in rural areas. The goal of this CAREER research project is to understand the basic chemistry of a new advanced treatment method that removes pollutants by combining iron and sulfur. The advantage of this new method is that it can be used without the complex steps needed by existing advanced treatment methods. Knowledge obtained in this research will then be used in larger scale demonstrations of the new treatment technology to provide real-world performance data. These demonstrations will also be used to improve middle-school science education through a partnership with the Rhode Island 4-H organization. Successful completion of this project will help the Nation by providing a new approach for advanced water treatment and science education appropriate for rural areas.<br/><br/>Rural communities in the United States face higher risks of drinking water quality violations and have less access to advanced STEM curricula compared to more populated areas. This CAREER development plan directly addresses these issues by focusing on rural water quality and STEM education through the development of a simplified advanced oxidation process based on iron and sulfur. Although advanced oxidation processes are of growing importance in water treatment, they require complex systems for on-site generation, making them inappropriate for many settings. The ferrate-sulfur advanced oxidation process (FeSAOP) shows promise as an effective yet simple way to transform recalcitrant organic pollutants, but key unknowns block adaptation. The rationale for this research is that current advanced oxidation processes are not accessible to all water systems and exploiting FeSAOP will close this gap. The central hypothesis is that FeSAOP yields several radical species that rapidly oxidize contaminants while also offering simplicity of production, enabling rural water system use and compelling educational experiences. The plan includes four specific research aims to: (1) elucidate iron radical formation and fate via ultrafast spectroscopy; (2) determine the mechanism of 1,4-dioxane (a model recalcitrant compound, and emerging contaminant) oxidation by FeSAOP; (3) incorporate novel FeSAOP into conventional treatment processes at the pilot-scale; and (4) integrate research and education goals via a learning-through-research model. Broader societal impacts of this work include addressing the elevated risk facing rural water systems, increasing opportunities for STEM exposure, improving public understanding of water treatment, and supporting a graduate student researcher. The proposed plan will accelerate achievement of the Principal Investigator?s long-term career goal to ensure safe water and comprehensive STEM educational opportunities for all.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to answer this question in South American canopy palm trees, a diverse group that includes several geographically widespread species that vary in degree of usefulness to humans and in patterns of abundance. The research seeks to quantify the relative and combined influences of ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic processes on palm abundances. The research is expected to advance scientific knowledge by integrating perspectives from separate disciplines to achieve a more synthetic understanding of how human, ecological, and evolutionary impacts interact to shape biotic systems. The project has important societal and economic implications because palms provide food, income, and material for basic needs for millions of humans around the globe. Educational films and teaching modules produced during the project are expected to be used by thousands of high school and college students in the United States. Graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and high school teachers will receive training.<br/><br/>The research employs a multi-scale sampling design to link local ecological and microevolutionary processes to landscape patterns of abundance to test two major hypotheses: 1) that effective defenses via resistance genes (R genes) give common species the ability to escape negative density dependence, and 2) that human management over the past several millennia has promoted the abundances of useful species.  This is achieved by combining contemporary genomic analysis and aerial imaging and machine learning capable of identifying and mapping individual canopy trees over vast areas. Regular censuses provide information on survival of adults and seedlings of focal species in relation to local abundances, and a nursery experiment will further explore relationships between R gene diversity and seedling survival.  The project also tests potential impacts of Pre-Columbian humans on contemporary tree populations using paleo-ecological sampling of soil cores, including charcoal and phytolith sampling, while accounting for abiotic environment. This approach is expected to shed light on the relative and combined impacts of negative density dependence, abiotic environment, and Pre-Columbian human management, all thought to influence abundance in some way but typically treated in isolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monumental construction remains one of the most widely recognized markers of settled agricultural communities and relationships of inequality which structure labor organization. Thus, it is often viewed as an outcome of social complexity. However, several noteworthy early instances of monumental constructions throughout the world indicate impressive projects could be accomplished through cooperative relationships among largely mobile and minimally stratified populations. These findings require an adjusted framework for interpretation of the social relationships between individuals engaging in the construction and use of public spaces and the role of constructed space in promoting new social relationships. Does the act of creating and interacting in a constructed space bind people together in new ways? Do such constructions promote integration across broader regions, as well as local communities? This dissertation project will investigate the role of public architecture in local community formation and regional integration at an archaeological site. In an effort to increase analysis capacity and offer laboratory experience to aspiring researchers, local students will participate in the research.<br/><br/>The proposed project investigates how the development of the public architecture relates to markers of increased community integration by focusing on evidence for labor investment, activity, ritual deposits, and regional interaction. A key architectural complex at the site dates to very early in its history. Its foundation appears to predate household construction at the site and indicates the complex was integral to the formation of a local settlement. Changes in the architectural materials and arrangement of the complex correlate with important temporal and political regional changes providing a fitting archaeological context to examine the long-term relationship between public architecture and integration and the local and regional scales. In this project, shifts in labor investment and activity within a public plaza-structure complex will be examined as markers of local community development while increased similarity in ritual deposits and ceramic styles between those found within the site and those reported from others in the region will be examined as markers of regional integration. Indicators of change will be anchored in time through the use of statistical modeling in building and improving the site chronology. Activity residues, derived from geochemical testing of samples, collected from buried floors across the site, add an important dataset to the study of early monuments and elucidate additional aspects of their uses and meanings to local populations. Integrating this dataset within systematic examination of traditional archaeological measurers derived from architectural excavations and analysis of recovered artifacts expands understanding of early construction and stands to further understanding of the diverse drives contributing to social complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This instrument will be used to conduct a series of coordinated observations with the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI) at HAARP that will be operated in campaign mode centering upon three major heating experiments. The Arctic atmosphere and the subauroral region are a natural laboratory for understanding plasma-neutral and dynamical coupling in the atmosphere and geospace. The lidar will measure the profile of the ion-neutral collision frequency needed for the determination of D-region electron density profiles from IRI HF radar data.  A second application of coordinated IRWTL and IRI measurements is aimed at the investigation of the charge transfer mechanisms in dusty plasmas based on lidar observations of polar mesospheric clouds and radar observations of polar mesospheric summer echoes. These coordinated measurements will also study the dynamical forcing of E-region winds using the technique of radar artificial periodic irregularities. The combined IRWTL and IRI observations will be used to study  D-region structure as determined from the data collected from the detection of ELF/VLF waves generated by the IRI facility. These studies will have a variety of broader impacts including the study of fundamental processes in plasma physics, aerosols, fluid dynamics while advancing radio science and remote sensing technology and techniques.

The neurons communicate with each other through specialized junctions known as synapses. The non-neuronal cells influence these communications. Importantly communications between these cells mediate various brain functions including sensory perception, memory storage, and intelligence. Furthermore, there is also communication within neurons. Inside neurons, long tracks are traveling from one end of the neuron to the other end. Microscopic structures move along these tracks for mediating communication within neurons. Decades of research have established the significance of brain cell communications. However, it is not well understood precisely how these cells influence each other?s communications for brain functions. In this study, the investigative team assesses how the formation of connections between two neurons modifies each other for mediating neuronal communications. To study this complex problem, the team studies neurons of a sea slug that has a much simpler nervous system. Neurons of sea slug are about 10-100 times larger than human neurons. Specifically, using the neurons of sea slug, the team in this project studies communication within neurons and between neurons by imaging the movement of microscopic structures in neurons and its relation to neuronal communication during memory formation. The project also offers high school and undergraduate students to participate in research using cutting-edge techniques, and includes lessons on how the brain is wired for middle school students in Florida.<br/><br/>The complexity of neuronal architecture such as the extensive dendritic branching and axonal terminals necessitates active bidirectional transport of gene products between the cell body and its terminals for synapse function. Several studies, including our own, have indicated that anterograde transport (i.e., towards terminals) facilitates synapse formation and activity-dependent remodeling of synapses, while retrograde transport (i.e., from terminals) serves as signals to the nucleus resulting in transcriptional changes. However, several aspects of this bi-directional transport, such as the regulation, dynamics, and mechanisms of transport during formation, and maintenance and remodeling of synapses are poorly understood. In this project, exploring the advantages of the identified neurons and synapses of the sea slug Aplysia californica, the investigative team addresses these questions by studying the bidirectional transport of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) in presynaptic sensory neurons of Aplysia gill withdrawal reflex. LROs are membrane-bound acidic organelles transported bidirectionally and are involved in degradative pathways. Specifically, the team studies whether and how bidirectional transport of LROs in presynaptic sensory neurons is regulated during formation and maintenance, and excitatory and inhibitory forms of plasticity at sensory-motor neuron synapses of Aplysia gill withdrawal reflex.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We now know there are three kinds of neutrinos that are distinguishable through the different interactions that they undergo whenever there is an interaction. We also know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Such measurements lie at the heart of this award which will study neutrino-nucleus interactions in order to deeply understand how neutrinos oscillate from one type to another. This work will be crucial to the upcoming neutrino experiment, DUNE, at the U.S. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), one of the top-priority experiments in High Energy Physics. This research group at Rutgers University will also broaden diversity in physics by using their data analysis work to promote engagement in physics among African-American New Jersey high school students. <br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the new DUNE project at FNAL and in neutrino physics in general. Another technology of interest to DUNE is water-based liquid scintillator detectors. This award will develop both of these technologies and study neutrino interactions with both liquid argon and liquid scintillator. The data will be obtained using the Booster Neutrino Beam at FNAL and the detectors of the ANNIE and SBND experiments. A simultaneous measurement of neutrino interactions with water and argon targets using the same high-intensity neutrino beam will precisely relate these two nuclei, enable stringent constraints on models, deepen our understanding of crucial energy losses to neutrons in liquid argon detectors, and enable scientists to quantitatively re-tune models. These advances will enable improved cross-experiment comparisons that enhance our global picture, and broadly extend the physics capabilities of liquid argon based detectors. In particular, the proposed work represents a unique window of opportunity to enable future joint analysis of DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To design effective, de novo biomaterials for cardiac repair, this CAREER award supported by the Biomaterials program aims to investigate a new biomaterials design strategy with data-driven approaches. The first objective is to create a large number of functionally relevant proteins with a computer algorithm, which are subject to systematic screening and selection. The second objective is to assess the selected pool of candidate proteins in a 3D model tissue including healthy and infarct conditions, where the model tissue is 3D bio-printed with another computer algorithm to minimize experimental trials and effort. With data-driven approaches, the PI seeks to attain 1) optimal, newly designed sequences of therapeutic proteins to accelerate the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and 2) optimal combinations of biomaterials and 3D bio-printing parameters to fabricate the model tissue with minimal experimental cost. In contrast to conventional approaches, the proposed data-driven approaches are adaptive to altered experimental conditions to reach the optimal target of biomaterial properties with enhanced experimental efficiency. The outcome of this CAREER award can potentially provide a novel platform of engineering therapeutic proteins and fabricating a model tissue with optimal cost and effort. Outreach activities and educational curricula are proposed to engage a range of students from middle school to undergraduate students to promote the exposure of biomaterials research to those students in highly agricultural and petrochemical engineering-oriented industrial settings. <br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/><br/>This CAREER award aims to engineer an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein to accelerate the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. Once over 4 million functionally relevant chimeras are created by a computer algorithm, screening and selection of those chimeras are experimentally expensive. Thus, the new approach proposed in the CAREER award is to utilize publicly available data to build machine learning models to screen and select those chimeras, which will be built upon a Gaussian Process to derive a posterior from a prior and observations. To avoid the overfitting problem of machine learning with the relatively smaller number of publicly available data, an additional machine learning model will be built with 1) protein folding metrics and 2) intracellular protein-based assay. To assess the performance of designer ECM proteins, an in vitro model of infarct (border zone) will be fabricated with 3D bio-printing. To recapitulate complex features of the border zone with minimal numbers of trials of 3D bio-printing, Bayesian Optimization will be applied to balance the exploration of the overall search space and the exploitation of the local search space to effectively achieve the optimal 3D bio-printing and biomaterial parameters. To unambiguously identify the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in the model border zone, genetically labeled adult cardiomyocytes will be 3D bio-printed in the model border zone to assess the increase of cardiomyocyte proliferation. This CAREER award also seeks to support STEM education in the areas of biomaterials research. The outreach program targets specifically local secondary school and undergraduate students to attract them into future workforce in biomaterials areas with priorities to female and underrepresented groups in STEM education.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biomaterials Program, Division of Materials Research, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Categories available in one language may not be available in others. Adding to this complexity, the same categories can be expressed through similar structures or very different ones. To understand this diversity, linguistic data must be captured and compiled in a structured manner, through documentation. As a field of inquiry, language documentation augments the empirical foundations of linguistic research and related disciplines which rely on linguistic data.  This doctoral dissertation project contributes to linguistic infrastructure by documenting, describing, and analyzing the grammar of an endangered minority language that to date, has no documentation of its structures and categories, yet exhibits displays interesting typological features that are of interest to linguistics broadly.  In addition to the training of a doctoral student, the project trains native speakers in the techniques and processes of language documentation.<br/><br/>National and transnational languages are spoken by millions of speakers, yet most of the world's languages are spoken by minority populations. As the world becomes more interconnected, majority languages increasingly dominate minority ones, leading to their disappearance. Language extinction makes it impossible to collect data on that language, which is a loss in knowledge and perspectives on the world. This project adds to linguistic corpus by documenting the grammatical features of an endangered minority language with several typologically unusual properties, for example, the lack of both absolute and relative tense. The doctoral student will document language information using audio- and video-recording of different linguistic genres including conversations and mythical narratives, and prioritizing naturalistic data. Using annotations of these recorded texts the doctoral student will then describe and analyze the language and document its grammar. This effort builds linguistic infrastructure and advances linguistic knowledge by enabling other scientists to hypothesize about the range of linguistic structures. <br/><br/>The data collected from this project will be available at The Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The leaders will guide participants in short but intense research projects in one of the many active research areas in physics and astronomy at Brigham Young University. The whole cohort is mentored from initial research prospectus to final report and intermediate presentations in addition to the one-on-one faculty mentoring. Professional preparation and skill development are complemented with informal activities for social cohesion and networking. The individual participants' projects explore a broad spectrum of currently unsolved problems through hands-on activities under a faculty mentor's direct supervision to provide significant and lasting educational and intellectual benefits to the participants. As the participants' projects are integrated into the current research program of active research groups, they are likely to contribute to the advance of knowledge and produce results that can be published and/or presented at professional meetings. When it matters most, participants are immersed in an intense collaborative experiment centered around collegiality and scientific practice at a significant time in their educational development. By assembling a vast group of diverse participants from different walks of life but with a common purpose and interest in physics, the program intends to create lifelong connections and a resource network that will benefit all participants, their scientific productivity, and professional trajectory. The project provides cohort diversity by striving towards a 50-50 gender balance and seeking out participation from underrepresented groups. It contributes to the long-term goal of increasing the participation of under-served groups in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University (BYU) proposes to offer a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Physics. The objective is to guide participants in short but intense research projects in one of the university's many active research areas through one-on-one mentoring by faculty. The program also emphasizes the whole cohort's progress from research question to final products through close academic mentoring by the PI and co-PI, as well as weekly meetings to discuss the cohort's progress and provide professional development.  These complement informal activities for social cohesion and networking. The site will have twelve REU participants and two RET participants each summer for the next three years. The REU site at BYU has run successfully for the past twenty years. It benefits from a departmental and institutional commitment that allowed it to complete a successful program during the Covid-19 period of 2020 despite nearly all projects being done remotely and a department and institutional commitment to undergraduate research excellence. The leaders strive to bring together a diverse cohort of participants from different institutions and backgrounds, with special efforts to recruit students from underrepresented groups in physics and those from two-year and four-year colleges in the nearby geographical region. The leaders undertake particularly concerted efforts to recruit women and ethnic minorities. Because of the geographical location and past experiences with minority students, the team expects to be particularly effective recruiting students from Hispanic and Native American groups. A particular aspect of the program is the inclusion of two RET participants, typically one local. There are identical research expectations for REU and RET participants, but both groups benefit from the association. The small RET component of the program is a significant asset. The breadth of the projects offered is a valuable asset. Many participants have not yet decided on the particular sub-field of physics they want to pursue as graduate students or professionals. The program offers experimental, computational, and theoretical projects in a wide variety of sub fields of physics. Although each student's project is unique, participants indicate that they the broader exposure to physics through the REU cohort. The areas covered include: Quantum Information and Dynamics, Semiconductor Nanomaterials, Brown Dwarfs and Transiting Planets, Coherent Lenses Imaging and Optics, Local Structure of Quantum Materials, Materials Structure and Properties, Modeling Complex Systems, Nano magnetism, Nonlinear Acoustics, Numerical Relativity, Pulsating Star Astronomy, and Underwater.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is still a gap from the current state-of-the-art techniques to the artificial general intelligence that can bring good performance in learning speed, data efficiency, and generalization of the optimization performance.<br/><br/>Inspired by this observation, the PI proposes a natural concurrent RL framework that carries three major advantages over traditional RL methods, namely the i) advantages of simultaneously learning multimodal properties of the complex system; ii) structural advantages of using a personalized learning scheme; and iii) implementation advantages of the data-driven sample-efficient design. Within this framework, the PI proposes to design two concurrent RL methods to consolidate past experiences and anticipatory knowledge and build the ?learning-in-learning? control paradigm. The theoretical results will certify that the proposed RL framework can be deployed with  high confidence for complex adaptive systems under uncertain environments. The applications on smart energy community will support the novel learning framework and theoretical results.<br/><br/>Beyond the scientific impacts, the proposed research has broader impacts for a wide range of research disciplines including transportation, rehabilitation, and robotics. The integration of research and education activities will also positively impact the institutions regionally and nationally. A proposed workshop will bring world renown experts to engage (state college) students and young researchers with limited financial supports to attend professional conferences. The collaboration with the industry and the national laboratory provides the students the opportunity to get external training, which can lead to competitive job offers. The proposed take-home AI/RL projects will promote interactive distance learning for schools with limited research capacity (e.g., rural community college) and for students with the preference of remote studying during the current pandemic.

This limit constrains the size of a material under investigation to roughly the wavelength of the radiation used to probe it. This project uses terahertz radiation with wavelengths of hundreds of micrometers to probe the emerging two-dimensional materials that have unique and unprecedented properties including superconductivity and magnetism. By confining the terahertz radiation to the surface of the small-scale materials being studied, this technique circumvents the diffraction limit and offers new understanding about the dynamic response and electronic properties of these fascinating materials. The research also advances understanding of high frequency radiation transmission on small-scale chips for applications in next generation high frequency communications technology. The project heavily relies on undergraduate and graduate student involvement and provides an outlet for these students to learn cutting-edge experimental techniques. Several activities in this project focus on recruitment and retention of underrepresented students for long term careers in science.

The THz spectrum resides in a range of energies and timescales which are particularly important in materials with strong interactions. It would be highly advantageous to apply the technique to the emerging class of correlated two-dimensional, van der Waals heterostructures to characterize ground states and interactions which are currently not well understood. This project designs and optimizes a platform for THz spectroscopy of microscopic materials, at first focusing on 2D superconductors and magnets. Using planar waveguides and optically pumped photoconductive switches, the technique harnesses on-chip single cycle THz pulses to perform THz time domain spectroscopy of these materials, ushering in spectral information of low energy excitations and dynamics. The platform provides much needed insight on the possible pairing mechanisms in unconventional 2D superconductors and the relaxation dynamics of 2D magnets. It can also be readily applied to microscopic materials beyond investigations here and has broad application in routes to optimization of sub-diffraction THz spectroscopy and high frequency communications.

This becomes a critical challenge when deploying models into real world systems. For example, an aircraft control system has to perform a certain action when detecting a nearby intruder. A self-driving car has to recognize stop signs even under small perturbations. This project will develop a framework to verify and improve the safety of machine learning models. The proposed verification methods will be efficient and support a wide range of structures. Further, the framework can be used to train models that are guaranteed to meet some safety specifications. These functionalities will enable safe models for a much broader range of applications beyond small neural networks. The project supports education and diversity through the recruitment of a diverse team. The research results will be integrated into textbooks, courses, and outreach activities on AI safety.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enable machine learning verification for more general models and to make it easily applicable to users in the application domains. To achieve this goal, we will build an automatic verification algorithm based on a convex relaxation framework. In this framework, model verification can be posed as an optimization problem, and (convex or linear) relaxations are used to get an efficient solution. By generalizing this framework to a general computational graph, we will design an automatic verification algorithm. The algorithm will run automatically for any model specified by a user, without the need of re-deriving a new verification procedure for each new model. In addition to allowing a wider range of models, the project will also enable verification of more complex semantic perturbations. The investigator will also study verification of discrete models (e.g., KNN or tree ensembles) under an optimization-based framework.

This is problematic as the world trends towards large-scale AI. This project will build new general statistical inference algorithms that will still run efficiently, even on very large datasets and on very complicated models, while having provable reliability guarantees.

This doctoral dissertation project will examine human aging in a non-industrialized population, and evaluate how aspects of lifestyle contribute to age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. This project will help create a broader picture of how humans experience growing older across a range of biosocial contexts, and so advance our fundamental knowledge about human senescence. The project will inform public health research by examining whether certain aspects of aging can be mitigated through elements of lifestyle. Furthermore, by employing an interdisciplinary approach to the study of aging, this project will strengthen research infrastructure ties among several institutions and departments, and also contribute to the professional development of women in STEM fields. <br/><br/>In industrialized populations, growing older is associated with declines in physical and cognitive function that limit independence and increase risk of disability. Large-scale epidemiological studies indicate that engaging in high levels of physical activity (PA) may attenuate age-related declines in function. It is not clear, then, whether the age-related functional declines seen in industrialized populations are inevitable aspects of human senescence or by-products of sedentary industrialized lifestyles. This project will examine variation in lifestyle and aging in hunter-gatherer populations that currently include members who continue to engage in full-time foraging, and others who engage in more market-integrated lifestyles with less reliance on foraging. The project tests the overarching hypothesis that variation in engagement in traditional foraging practices is associated with distinctive PA profiles that benefit age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. Researchers will recruit participants (ages 18+) from communities who engage in different amounts of foraging, and participants will complete tests of physical and cognitive function. Participants will also wear an accelerometer for several days, allowing researchers to characterize patterns of PA. The researchers will compare age-related patterns of function for non-industrialized and industrialized populations, as well as assess whether amount of foraging is related to variation in age-related patterns of function. They will also use formal mediation analyses to assess how patterns of PA influence the relationship between age, function, and amount of foraging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such training is expected to enhance their problem-solving skills, academic performance, and retention. Information that students previously had to memorize is now just a mouse click away.  However, this availability makes it much more important that students learn how to think critically about that information.  Critical thinking includes thinking objectively, seeking unbiased data, and considering a broad range of perspectives. This project aims to systematically study how critical thinking affects both short- and long-term student success over the four years of undergraduate Chemical and Electrical Engineering education. The study will include first year students whose progress will be monitored through graduation. The research team also plans to investigate gendered effects of critical thinking since women are greatly underrepresented in STEM fields. Finally, the team will work with middle and high school teachers to explore ways to integrate critical thinking activities at the secondary-school level, helping to better prepare students for college.  The project's findings have the potential to help educators to design more effective critical thinking programs, including efforts that focus on the success of women in STEM.  <br/><br/>The project goal is to explore whether deliberate training in critical thinking in early years of the engineering curriculum improves students? learning.  To this end, the multidisciplinary project team of engineers, psychologists, and education researchers will use the NSF-funded Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT), which was designed by a member of the investigative team in 2004.  The CAT instrument is one of the few critical thinking assessment tools that uses short answer essay responses to assess critical thinking. The research will use a two-level, two-factor, factorial design using direct statistical analysis, with the CAT exam administered as pre- and post-intervention treatments. In this design some students will be provided with interventions meant to improve critical thinking and some students will have multiple interventions.  The performance of these students will be compared to that of control students who did not receive the intervention(s).  The nation?s socioeconomic success will be strengthened by individuals who look objectively at information before acting and who make informed decisions rather than relying on instinct and preconceptions. Thus, critical thinking, together with effective problem solving and the ability to draw connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information, are of tremendous societal benefit.

The project will address four research questions related to teachers? persistence in high need schools and districts, and the relationships between their preparation experiences and their STEM teaching and cultural efficacy. A third project goal is to develop data collection tools and use survival analysis methodology to uncover relationships between preparation program characteristics and teacher persistence. Broad dissemination of research findings, including through the university partners and regional and national conferences and networks, completes the set of project goals. The project will use grounded qualitative analysis to examine emergent patterns that will illuminate whether and how components of teacher preparation relate to each other and to the teaching outcomes being measured. Analyzed components will include those that support the development of disciplinary content knowledge, professional knowledge and pedagogy, and program context, design, and quality assurance.   This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the growth in the number and diversity of programmable devices, end-users (i.e., those not trained as programmers) are increasingly becoming de facto programmers, configuring and commanding their own systems. At the same time, computing is increasingly interacting with the physical world, as consumer robotics and home automation systems are becoming commonplace. In this new context, where end-users program cyber-physical systems, both the programming languages they use to specify programs and the programming tools that help them avoid common mistakes will become vital to their productivity, security, and safety. This REU site will train 9 undergraduate students per year, including a significant cohort of those traditionally under-represented in computing, as contributors who will ultimately research, design, and evaluate novel techniques for end-user programming of cyber-physical systems.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state-of-the-art in end-user programming for cyber-physical systems, an activity which will impact hundreds of millions of users in the coming decade. The project?s research strategy is to apply the hard-won lessons from traditional software engineering and CS education research to end-user programming, making improvements upon the relevant tools and languages, ultimately making end-user programs more robust, secure and easier to write. The project will leverage programming environments targeting novice programmers, such as block-based programming. After embodying new research ideas as prototypes, the research team will evaluate them via quantitative user studies, analyze generated user study data, create and conduct large-scale surveys, and qualitative methods such as interviewing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The state of Hawai?i, a hub for technologically innovation in the Pacific, offers computer science in all public high schools throughout the state. As more elementary, middle, and high school computer science courses are established, an increase is needed in the number of qualified, licensed computer science teachers. The project seeks to provide a framework for licensure in computer science education for college students majoring in computer science or mathematics. The project team will determine critical components needed in a culturally responsive computer science curriculum in a state that has a majority of minority students. With its established online learning infrastructure, the university intends to initially develop a curriculum that can be accessed online or face-to-face, which may increase access to the certificate program by removing the barrier of commuting to the Honolulu-based campus. The project also focuses on building capacity for future recruitment and retention that will allow successful statewide alliances to be scaled up for broader impact.  <br/><br/>This project at the University of Hawai?i at Manoa, a public teaching and research university, will partner with the Hawai?i Department of Education, the sole school district in the state of Hawai?i. The project goal is to build capacity to provide a pathway for computer science and mathematics majors to obtain licensure to teach computer science in K-12 through developing the infrastructure for a five-course computer science education certificate program. It is the intent of this project to increase content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, culturally sustaining knowledge, and pedagogical practices to align with the K-12 computer science teaching standards. The knowledge gained through this project may guide future research and interventions designed to enhance individual aspirations and capacity of underrepresented groups to pursue computer science teaching. The project includes an advisory board of content experts, education partners, industry partners, teacher education faculty experts, and computer science faculty experts.  This Board will evaluate the development of the new teacher preparation program to determine if it is sound in both content and context for Hawai?i. The resulting curriculum and development process will be shared at local and national education conferences.

This phenomenon, called hybrid vigor, is a cornerstone of modern crop breeding efforts and has immense value for global food security. Despite over a century of intensive research, the causes of hybrid vigor are still poorly understood. Recently, the first evidence has arisen that microbes in the soil play an important role in hybrid vigor. This project will investigate the microbial contribution to hybrid vigor in more detail, combining classic and cutting-edge scientific approaches, including field experiments, microbial culture, DNA sequencing, and advanced molecular techniques such as metaproteomics. Specifically, this study will (1) test a wide range of microbial strains and soil microbiomes for the ability to induce hybrid vigor in corn;  (2) identify genetic variants and regions of the corn genome that are associated with responsiveness to soil microbes; and (3) characterize the behavior of microbes within the roots of inbred and hybrid corn at the molecular level. Together, the results will advance knowledge of how, when, and why soil microbes affect hybrid vigor which could potentially lead to applications in agriculture and ecological conservation. This project will also grow the American scientific workforce by supporting the training of two post-doctoral researchers, one Ph.D. student, and two undergraduate student researchers. It will also support four high-school teachers to attend researcher-led workshops to learn about soil microbes and agricultural ecosystems.<br/><br/>This project was motivated by preliminary data showing that hybrid vigor (i.e., heterosis) of maize root mass was eliminated or greatly reduced in sterile conditions or diminished soil microbial communities in the field. The overarching goals are to determine the generality of this phenomenon with respect to the microbes and host genotypes; to investigate the genetic architecture of microbe-dependent heterosis; and to characterize molecular mechanisms of microbial interactions with inbred and hybrid hosts. An existing collection of maize root endophytes will be screened for the ability to induce maize heterosis, in monoculture and in simplified communities. Metaproteomics will be used to quantify in planta protein expression by heterosis-inducing and non-inducing bacterial strains while colonizing roots of inbred vs. hybrid hosts, while RNA-seq will be used to quantify host gene expression aboveground. The generality of microbe-induced heterosis will be assessed by measuring better-parent heterosis in a genetically diverse panel of maize hybrids and their parent lines, under sterile and inoculated conditions. Finally, a high-resolution mapping population (?IBM?) will be backcrossed to each parent line, generating a test population that will be used to map genomic loci that interact with microbes to affect phenotype when in the heterozygotic state. The same test population will be scored for disease resistance in the field to investigate the interplay with plant immunity. Together, these experiments will help clarify how inbred and hybrid maize plants interact with their microbial neighbors, and how these interactions relate to the expression of phenotypic heterosis.  All data and genetic resources will be made available to the general public through long-term repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Development of a ""quantum smart"" workforce needs to begin before college. The logical venue for exposure to quantum might be a physics course, but numerous K-12 students attend schools where physics is not offered. Since most students will not major in physics, it is vital to expose K-12 students to quantum concepts that are relevant to everyday experiences with credit card security, phones, computers, and basic technology. This project will provide opportunities for students to learn about quantum, regardless of whether they take a physics class. This project will also provide opportunities for secondary educators to learn about QIS and practice teaching it. Project partners include universities, businesses, and professional organizations such as Science Teacher Association in Utah and Texas, American Association of Physics Teachers, Institute for Quantum Computing, and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. These organizations will provide support for participants and presenters, and provide professional growth opportunities. This project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.    <br/><br/>This project aims to impact a minimum of 100 teachers and 600 students. The project will support professional development (PD) for STEM teachers to learn about quantum effects and effective curricular connections through carefully planned resources with learning cycles appropriate for high school students. The first summer will involve virtual PD. The second summer will involve face-to-face (F2F) PD and the third summer will involve F2F local camps. Teachers will co-teach student camps in Year 2 and then provide local camps in year 3.  The camps will provide opportunities for students to learn about quantum mechanics and for teachers to increase confidence in teaching quantum.  The camps will be led by educators who have participated in the workshops, and will provide local opportunities for underrepresented groups.  The project will identify pedagogy appropriate for teaching QIS to high school teachers or students, and content concepts that are difficult to understand, through the use of pre- and post-content assessments, confidence surveys, and participant engagement.  Participants will be asked to provide feedback on the resources and curriculum in the classroom as well as the potential for classroom implementation and impact on interest in QIS and ICT careers.

However, the webs of interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators are not very well resolved. Much of what we know about plant-pollinator networks, even for some common and economically important plants, is based only on observations of insects visiting flowers. One way to be sure that insects are acting as pollinators of a particular plant species is to examine their bodies for pollen of that plant. Large collections of insects in museums provide a perfect resource for quantifying pollen on insect bodies. Using the insect collections at the University of Nevada Museum of Natural History (UNRMNH), researchers will identify large webs of pollen-butterfly interactions, with a focus on the Great Basin Desert in Nevada. These networks will also allow inferences about how plant-pollinator interactions have been affected by changes in climate in the Great Basin over the last century. Additionally, the research will provide insight into how pollinators may be threatened by a changing environment. The project will include training students in ecology and museum science, expanding UNRMNH collections with pollen samples collected from museum specimens and butterflies encountered in the field, and creating large interactive displays for the public that illustrate the roles of butterflies as pollinators in the Great Basin.   <br/> <br/>The research will integrate new techniques, combining data gleaned from museum specimens, field observations, and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize insect-pollen networks over the last 100 years.

This information will be used to test hypotheses about changes in pollination networks in response to extreme weather events and other commonly measured global change parameters.

In carrying out this research in the context of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, this project also opens a new vantage point for looking at disruptive socio-technical changes, particularly in postcolonial contexts. <br/><br/>This project ethnographically addresses three research questions. 1) How do digital infrastructures such as government application programming interfaces (APIs), platforms, and mobile apps shape?and how are they shaped by?the dual pursuit of governance and entrepreneurial value? 2) How do techno-entrepreneurs from different social backgrounds navigate the everyday practices of start-up incubation? How are they reimagining their agential capacities for innovation and social mobility amidst the on-going structural shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic? 3) How do computing in start-up incubators program seek to tether the recent global history of digital innovation and disruption to national futures? Based on multi-sited fieldwork, this project comparatively follows start-up incubators in a metropolitan and a tier-two city to spatialize the growing interface between the state and start-ups. The researcher deploys historical, virtual, and in-person ethnographic methods, including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, digital archival and software studies approaches, to track the former futures and the everyday imaginaries and practices of state-sponsored start-up incubation. This project combines interdisciplinary scholarship in STS, media studies, anthropology and related fields, to think through the three-way relations between the postcolonial state and technological nationalism, digital innovation and capitalism, and aspirational futures and social mobility. By focusing on the emergent relations between digital infrastructure and innovation in a computing start-up incubators ecosystem, this project contributes to global STS research on cultures of computing.

Given the urgency of this need, the team's first product aims to support ongoing SARS-CoV-2 disease diagnosis by enabling point-of-care diagnosis from a patient nasal swab within minutes. Despite the prevalence and rapid spread of the disease, the majority of diagnostic tests remain time intensive, require numerous external reagents, and/or lack detection sensitivity in the early stages of infection. The team hypothesizes that the technology has significant value in this space and is interested in exploring this potential value more thoroughly through I-Corps. The technology may also find application to other diagnostic markets that traditionally rely on culture-based detection and/or nucleic acid amplification technologies. The platform can process complex biofluids and large volume samples, which could translate to pathogen detection in a range of biological fluids, including urine, saliva, and synovial fluid for the detection of urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, and joint infections, respectively. There are also a number of potential non-medical applications, including food and water quality monitoring, biosecurity surveillance, and applications to the point-of-care.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on understanding the market need for the platform, which performs nanoscale Pathogen Enrichment and Detection (nano-PED). For infectious disease, current diagnostic methodologies remain extremely time-consuming, costly, and rely on labor intensive sample preparation steps, followed by additional steps for pathogen identification and characterization.  The platform aims to: 1) circumvent laborious sample preparation steps through direct isolation of rare pathogens from a patient's biofluid sample, and 2) eliminate the need for molecular amplification through ultrasensitive, sequence-specific nucleic acid detection.

Injured animals can incur long-lasting costs that impact survival, reproduction, and almost every other aspect of behavior, and which often extend beyond the acute post-injury period. Long-lasting behavioral changes that minimize injury costs are therefore likely to be advantageous and widespread among diverse species. However, despite their obvious importance to survival, the brain mechanisms that govern changes in behavior after injury are poorly understood. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to reveal links between memory-like changes in sensory neurons that detect injury (nociceptors), and long-lasting enhancement of adaptive behaviors that compensate for injury. One group of animals that have evolved particularly complex injury-induced behaviors are cephalopod molluscs (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish), who rely on changeable skin camouflage that is heavily impaired if the skin is injured. Previous work in the investigator?s lab has shown long-lasting behavioral changes in cephalopods that promote survival after injury. This project focuses specifically on asking how these changes are produced by the nervous system, and how these changes may be similar or different from those of other animals, including mammals and humans. Broader impacts of the proposal include science education outreach to pre-K children, research training of diverse student populations, and improved knowledge of invertebrate animal welfare.<br/><br/>Injury-induced plasticity underlies a range of long-term behavioral changes, ranging from peripheral reflex hypersensitivity to complex, emotionally-valenced cognitive processing. The PI has shown previously that in cephalopods, activity-dependent nociceptive sensitization promotes hypervigilance toward potential threats, and that this hypervigilance promotes survival. The neural mechanisms driving long-term injury-induced plasticity in defensive behaviors remain poorly understood, and whether nociceptive sensitization also promotes fitness-protecting behavior in other contexts is completely unknown. In this CAREER project, the principal investigator conducts experiments to evaluate whether permanent changes to the intrinsic excitability of nociceptors drives plasticity in higher-order neural circuits governing attention and arousal. Next, the investigator examines whether these circuits modulate not only defensive behavioral plasticity, but also fitness-protecting plasticity in foraging, social, and reproductive contexts. Finally the investigator determines if molecular mechanisms of plasticity driving diverse injury-induced behaviors are shared among invertebrates and vertebrates. The studies involve use of a combination of molecular, genetic, physiological and behavioral techniques. This project provides training and educational experiences for Pre-K children, as well as undergraduate and graduate students from groups under-represented in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Behavioral adaptation engages specific cellular and molecular pathways in the brain that in turn instruct neural activity patterns. The goal of this project is to determine how the removal of proteins in a specific region of the brain known as the hippocampus instructs neural activity patterns to allow species to adapt to changes within their environment. This knowledge will benefit society as it will determine how disruption of these critical pathways may blunt adaptive behaviors, which have been found to be defective in human neurological conditions that include neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. This project also integrates research on behavioral adaptability with education and outreach activities that target underrepresented STEM groups by creation of an intensive Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) summer program for engagement of skillsets such as experimental design, scientific rigor/reproducibility and data analysis, and through community outreach educational opportunities at regional and local science fairs. <br/><br/>Behavioral adaptation requires the engagement of molecular signaling pathways at individual synapses that subsequently shape neural ensembles. However, the signaling pathways that can promote adaptive learning and memory processes in organisms and why a breakdown of these pathways leads to deadly consequences (e.g., an inability to identify the location of a new food source or escape from predators) is still poorly understood. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate how posttranslational-dependent protein removal drives changes in synaptic plasticity that update neural representations of a changing spatial behavior. This project uses Mus musculus as a model system to examine the role of protein ubiquitination on the disengagement of a learned behavior and the formation of new ensemble patterns in hippocampus. It also addresses how altering synaptic protein half-lives modulate long-term potentiation thresholds with changing spatial contingencies. This project addresses key limitations of capturing neural ensembles for molecular and synaptic characterization during select phases of behaviors and uses multi-disciplinary techniques that include modern molecular biology approaches, Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators, imaging of neural ensembles with a microendoscope, electrophysiology, and advanced analytical skillsets. Findings from our work will advance our understanding on the posttranslational protein removal mechanisms that drive decision making processes and bring us a step closer to resolving how brain representations remodel in response to sensory experiences in changing environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integration of renewable energy is transitioning to achieve zero-carbon emission in the decades to come. Due to solar and wind energy?s transitory nature, the successful deployment of renewable energy on a large scale depends on the development of efficient energy storage systems. While lithium-ion batteries are the most developed electrochemical storage technology at utility scale, they are best suited for four to six hours (4?6 h) storage and high demand peak shaving. To achieve longer-term emission goals, longer duration energy storage of 8?12 h or more is required. Long duration storage technologies, such as the proposed battery technology, have potential for utility, industry, and residential scale applications. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of energetically dense and inexpensive electrolytes for robust symmetrical organic Redox Flow Batteries (RFBs). In RFBs, power is controlled by the electrode size and the number of stacked electrodes, while energy capacity is controlled by the size of the tank that stores the electrolyte, resulting in the decoupling of power and energy capacity. For long-term storage, the ability to decouple power and energy is beneficial since the size of RFB stacks and tanks may be changed to meet application requirements. Unlike metal-based RFBs, organic RFBs overcome limitations of conventional RFBs, such as high cost and high toxicity, while providing the long duration energy storage that lithium-ion batteries cannot. The proposed technology employs carbocation, such as methoxyquinolinoacridinium salt, which is a stable electrolyte with an open circuit potential of 2.12 V. These salts may be used as both the anolyte and catholyte, resulting in a fully symmetric system that has high cyclability and high efficiency retention.  This I-Corps team will determine the suitability of this technology to the marketplace through customer discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the quality and value of PRO is contingent on a number of factors, and one of them is the missing-not-at-random (MNAR) issue. For instance, patients might fail to fill in a depression survey because of their level of depression, or patients who are sicker may be less likely to complete a quality-of-life questionnaire. In general, these PROs are missing due to the patient's declining health status, but the extent of decline is not known because it is not observed; hence, these missing data are informative and are MNAR. Similar situations also appear in large-scale health surveys and electronic health records database.  In this project, the PIs will study statistical methodology and computational algorithm for the MNAR issue in PRO as well as in other similar situations. The research product has the potential to be applied to various studies, such as Alzheimer's disease, mental health disorders, orthopedics, and pain research. The PIs will also engage in education at both disciplinary and interdisciplinary levels, with beneficiaries ranging from local high school students and undergraduates, to master and PhD students, and to biomedical investigators. The project will also provide research opportunities for postdoctoral scholars. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to establish a groundbreaking and translational statistical methodology framework including robust methods as well as efficient estimators, where the assumption on the missing data mechanism is imposed at a minimum level hence the developed methods can be applied with the largest flexibility. Motivated by the well-recognized fact that there is no adequate way to test the correctness of the missing data mechanism, the PIs will adopt the shadow variable approach to achieve the model identification and essentially make no further assumptions on the mechanism, thereby provide largest possible protection to model misspecification. The methodology is robust against the mechanism model misspecification by leveraging the model-based likelihood and its associated semiparametric structure. The statistical methods developed in this project will be implemented into efficient R packages and user-friendly interfaces for researchers whose primary goal is the analysis of missing data, especially MNAR data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses whether return migrants can strengthen electoral integrity and competition in countries at risk of electoral violence by examining candidates who run for mayor in Mexico after living as immigrants in the United States. Mexican mayoral candidates and their family members face significant risks of being murdered or violently attacked; yet, as many as 30 percent of elected mayors previously lived in the US. The project examines whether return-migrant candidates have access to resources and capacities that enhance resilience against violence and the ability to accommodate violent actors, advancing knowledge relevant to policies on migration management and the reduction of electoral violence's negative repercussions on democratic competition and electoral integrity. <br/><br/>To examine return migrants in the context of violent elections, this project surveys a national sample of approximately 1,100 mayoral candidates during the two months leading up to Mexico's 2021 election. Respondents are drawn from a list of 2,100 candidates developed using a stratified sampling design that involves a random selection from each Mexican state's official candidate registry with an oversampling from municipalities with higher migration. Survey questions address personal migration experiences and access to migration-driven resources and capacities, including cross-border networks, migration-generated wealth, experiences with crime and criminal justice in the United States, and facilities for crossing the US-Mexico border. Candidates are also asked about other factors that influence candidates' choices to run for office, such as political socialization within Mexico, party affiliation, personal attributes, and socio-economic status. The survey data are merged with publicly available municipal-level data for analysis.  As the first large-n survey in the world that examines candidates' migration experiences extensively, the project provides methodological lessons for future surveys in other countries affected by migration to the US and electoral violence, including El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ultimately this project works to illustrate and provide pathways for advanced STEM education and careers for URM students. Promoting progress in science and building a globally competitive workforce, a core part of the National Science Foundation's mission, requires increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). <br/><br/>This project provides training pathways for both Ph.D. and Master's level students in the STEM fields of Chemistry, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Transport and Fluid Mechanical Engineering, and Civil and Mechanical Engineering. GEM consortium-selected URM students apply to the university-member programs, and upon acceptance, GEM provides a stipend towards living expenses and tuition. The universities cover the remainder of the tuition, and in the case of Ph.D. level students, a living stipend (through teaching or research assistantships or other methods) for the duration of the degree. This encourages member universities to accept URM students, while assuring students of the economic feasibility of an advanced degree. A total of 52 students will be supported through this effort. These students also participate in a paid internship that GEM helps to arrange, which enables students to build a career network and provides them with work experience. These students and others supported through GEM will be part of a long term evaluation on the effectiveness of this approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. There are two ideas about how these patterns might form. The ?positional specification? model is that the patterns are created by a set of genes being turned on in specific locations in a controlled fashion. The ?reaction-diffusion? model is that patterns can arise from a self-organizing system of interacting genes. According to this second model, the location of each pattern component is determined by random fluctuations in one gene?s activity level. Other genes in the network respond to the first gene to create the elements needed for making a unit of the pattern. Some traits, such as petal spots in the monkeyflower genus Mimulus, appear to depend on both types of pattern formation. This petal-spot system is being used to study both positional specification and reaction-diffusion, and how they interact to create new, complex patterns in nature. The collaborative project creates research opportunities for one Ph.D. student and eighteen undergraduates. Three high school students will be recruited from a public school in rural Walla Walla, WA that specifically serves youth not routinely exposed to scientific experiences.<br/> <br/>Previous work in Mimulus has established that nectar guide spots of red anthocyanin pigment are formed in a manner consistent with a reaction-diffusion system. The discovery of elaborate spot patterns in the petal lobes of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus hybrids creates a unique opportunity to examine (a) whether this reaction-diffusion system explains floral patterning in Mimulus more generally, (b) whether positional cues originating from petal vasculature shape these patterns, and (c) how the inter-genomic interactions associated with hybridization can generate novel phenotypes not seen in either parent species. The researchers will first develop a reaction-diffusion model that recreates the distribution of anthocyanin spotting phenotypes observed in a hybrid F2 genetic mapping population. They will test this model by examining the diverse sets of homozygous genotypes present in a Recombinant Inbred Line population, and by using transgenic manipulation to alter the expression of key genes in the anthocyanin regulatory network. Finally, they will investigate the hypothesis that petal vasculature influences the location of spot formation. This will be achieved by using digital image analysis and spatial statistics to test for correlations between spot and vein locations, and experimentally manipulating vein development through chemical and transgenic perturbations to test for effects on spot formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stroke is a debilitating, life-changing event. Part of the brain dies, and the mind-body connection is lost.  Stroke survivors experience problems such as lack of hand control, including difficulties grasping and opening, and instability.  These problems leave them dependent on others for some of the most basic tasks.  Current medical devices are inadequate.  The devices come in limited sizes and either prevent motion or constrain the hand to unnatural movement.  A custom-sized orthosis could mitigate all these problems, providing a better fit and more effective recovery.  Automating the customization process may reduce the risk of design/fitting/fabrication error by the orthotist, as well as the need for a skilled technician, in addition to time and monetary costs.  The proposed technology may benefit the orthotics industry, making custom assistive devices more accessible to patients and enabling them to reach new levels of independence.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a rapidly customizable, 3D printed, powered hand orthosis.  Prior to design, anatomical data was analyzed to determine mathematical relationships between hand length and width and individual joint and bone positions.  The intellectual merit of this innovation involves several key components including a smart computer aided design (CAD) package based on the anatomical relationships to generate custom size part files that can be rapidly 3D printed, reducing the need for a skilled orthosis technician.  In addition, flexible joints will enable multiaxial mobility.  An active, intelligent control will provide the needed assistance for users to perform activities of daily living independently.  Currently, a preliminary CAD package and orthosis prototype have been developed.  The primary design challenge remaining is how to fit the entire actuation system within the anthropometric envelope without sacrificing assistive capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The major categories of crimes for which lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can be removed are broad and amorphous, and for undocumented individuals, any conviction can lead to removal. Research has shown that racial and ethnic disparities profoundly impact the criminal justice system, adding to the risk of negative outcomes for Black and Latino immigrants in particular. We advance the concept of the ?criminal deportation pipeline? to describe the intertwining criminal and immigration system processes that funnel certain immigrants toward removal. The study, drawing on the disciplines of sociology and criminology, focuses on the factors which shape and constitute this pipeline. Highlighting racial, ethnic and spatial disparities in criminal justice and immigration enforcement, as well as local policies and practices that aid immigrants targeted for expulsion, the study will demonstrate the pipeline?s functional presence in this iconic city of immigrants as well as factors that define its impact and character. The results of the research will contribute to the public debate on immigration policy and human rights reform while deepening our understanding of the relationship between citizenship, the law, and policing practices that have so impacted racialized immigrant communities. <br/><br/>Informed by theories of social exclusion and criminalization, particularly along the vectors of race, as well as the field of resistance, the study is oriented by the following research questions: (i) How do local patterns of non-immigration-related criminal justice enforcement shape the flow of the criminal deportation pipeline?; (ii) How do protective legal policies and practices affect the function of the criminal deportation pipeline?; and (iii) How do immigrants experience and respond to overlapping processes of criminalization and deportation? We will examine these questions using a mixed methods research design that combines 120 hours of targeted observation of deportation proceedings; secondary analysis of official documents and administrative government datasets; and 120 in-depth interviews with affected immigrants, legal practitioners, and community-based advocates. Research will expand upon preliminary spatial analysis of high deportation areas in order to: (i) better understand how spatial, racial, and ethnic patterns in policing shape processes of criminal deportation; (ii) assess the function and impacts of protective legal policies, and (iii) identify the experiences of immigrants facing deportation with criminal records, as well as the impacts of overlapping criminal and immigration. The new knowledge produced will allow further development of theory around processes of social control, state practices and human agency with regard to the collective and individual immigrant experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variations in the refractive index causes the captured images to be geometrically distorted and blurry. These distortions adversely affect the performance of subsequent computer vision algorithms such as object detection and recognition. Hence, it is important to compensate for the visual degradation in images caused by atmospheric turbulence. Adaptive optics-based techniques can be used to compensate for turbulence effects in images. However, they require large, complex and expensive hardware. On the other hand, image processing-based approaches are cheap and effective. The idea of the proposed approach is to pose the turbulence degraded image restoration problem as a nonlinear regression problem, where the optimal parameters are learned from synthetically generated data. As a function approximator, we propose to use deep convolutional neural networks. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop data-driven learning-based approaches for restoration and understanding of images degraded by atmospheric turbulence. This project will help create new undergraduate/graduate courses on Deep Learning and Image Restoration. This project will also include a broad range of outreach activities.<br/><br/>Our research will provide a comprehensive framework for restoring and understanding images/videos degraded by atmospheric turbulence. We will significantly innovate in the areas of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised image restoration techniques by developing novel end-to-end trainable deep convolutional neural networks and corresponding loss functions. Furthermore, domain transfer learning-based methods for adapting computer vision algorithms such as object detection and segmentation to turbulence-degraded images will be developed. Algorithms that will be developed in this project will significantly enhance the quality of images and videos collected by long-range visible and infrared imagining systems, and will result in improved understanding of images degraded by atmospheric turbulence. The proposed methods will be useful in many applications of remote sensing, long-range surveillance, optical communications, astronomy, road traffic monitoring, underwater imaging, and autonomous navigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The sense of taste is used to determine whether potential food items will be ingested or rejected and is critical for an organism?s survival.  Because the chemicals that activate the taste system have variable structures, there are multiple taste cell types that use different signaling pathways to detect these stimuli.  Some taste chemicals activate receptors that initiate second messenger cascades, while others interact directly with ion channels to cause a cellular response.  The PI?s laboratory has recently reported that the monovalent selective TRP channel, TRPM4, has a critical role in taste transduction but how it functions in taste cells is poorly understood. The goal of this application is to characterize how TRPM4 contributes to taste transduction in the different signaling pathways. Overall, the current understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that translate taste stimuli into a signal that is sent to the brain for processing is still quite limited.  Therefore, a better characterization of these signaling pathways will provide an enhanced understanding of how taste information is sent to the brain and more generally, provide new insights into how the brain gathers information about its surroundings.  The project will also support the PI's efforts to increase the number of underrepresented groups to pursue careers in STEM through the University at Buffalo?s Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP).<br/><br/>Taste stimuli activate multiple signaling mechanisms in distinct taste cells populations within the oral cavity.  One cell population communicates via conventional synapses and expresses voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). A different cell population lacks chemical synapses and relies on the phospholipase-C-dependent signaling pathway to activate a Calhm1/3 channel complex to release neurotransmitter.  Taste cells that express this pathway (called Type II cells) contribute to the detection of bitter, sweet and umami taste stimuli.  Taste cells with conventional synapses (Type III cells) detect sour and salty stimuli.  Recently, it is becoming clear that the signaling pathways in these different cell types are more complex than previously appreciated. The PI?s laboratory identified a critical role for the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel (TRPM4) in the Type II signaling pathways and reported that TRPM4 is also expressed in Type III cells. Initial data has found that the role of TRPM4 varies within the different signaling pathways and is differentially used to affect the output response.  How this happens and the modulators regulating TRPM4 activity in these different cell populations is unknown.  The proposal?s focus is to define the function of TRPM4 in different taste signaling pathways and to identify how it is regulated in each.  The specific aims are: (1) How is TRPM4 regulated in the GPCR signaling pathway in Type II cells? and (2) What is the role of TRPM4 in ionotropic signaling in Type III cells?  These aims will be accomplished using mouse transgenics, live cell imaging and pharmacological approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These patterns can be recorded by mass spectrometry (MS) and recognized by artificial intelligence (AI).  Unbiased identification of the patented ""fingerprints"" by MS and analysis using AI may produce a diagnosis. The proposed technology may not only reduce time-to-diagnosis from years to days but provide less-invasive tests for customers, replacing techniques such as biopsies, colonoscopies, and heart catheterizations. This method will not depend on the professional qualification of health care workers and can be used at primary care facilities, hospitals, or urgent care sites.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project seeks to detect cancers and chronic lung and heart diseases. Initially, cancers and lung or heart diseases develop asymptomatically and so the patient does not seek professional help. Even after the onset of nonspecific symptoms, such as tiredness and fatigue, conditions often remain unrecognized for greater than two years. There is a significant need for novel diagnostic tools to shorten the time-to-diagnosis and initiate therapy at earlier stages of the disease. Cancers and lung and heart diseases are known to significantly alter the metabolic profile. The proposed technology shows that alterations in metabolites occur when diseases are mild and no symptoms are evident. Thus, profiling of circulating metabolites could become an efficient tool for tracing diseases at early and developed stages. The proposed patented technology detects specific changes in circulating metabolites that relate to discrete pulmonary hypertension from heart disease, colorectal cancer, and other chronic lung conditions. A mass spectrometry (MS) based platform is used for differential diagnosis to distinguish from diseases with similar, non-specific symptoms. Three preliminary metabolic panels have been developed. Each panel comprises of ten to twelve metabolites allowing separation of a specific group of diseases with current precision greater than 75-98%.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participation in research has been shown to increase student retention and performance STEM.  This project intends to expand research experiences to online students.  Specifically, the project team aims to develop a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for students in online biology degree programs, which typically do not include a research component.  The CURE will use bioinformatics as the research methodology.  Bioinformatics is the collection and analysis of biological data.  Thus, a bioinformatics CURE will enable students to conduct authentic research with only a computer and an internet connection.  The project intends to increase opportunities for inquiry-based computational research that can be easily adopted by other institutions, potentially increasing access to research for thousands of students. Students in online degree programs are more likely to be women, first generation students, low income, rural, working full-time, and/or primary caregivers.  Thus, an online CURE experience has the potential to diversify who participates in science.  As a result, this online CURE has the potential to broaden the diversity of individuals who engage in computational life sciences research.<br/><br/>This project intends to: 1) develop an online computational life sciences CURE focused on training in computer programming, genetics, statistics, and reproducibility; and 2) assess the impact of the online computational life sciences CURE on students? scientific research goals and learning goals. Students will learn basic computational command line skills, read primary literature, develop hypotheses, use software to produce results, and interpret those results.  The research aim of this project is rooted in biological questions relevant to datasets that change annually.  Students will be asked to assess how changing bioinformatics parameters affect the biological interpretations of their results. This project is intended to yield scientific research findings regarding the effects of different parameters on biological inference in next generation sequencing data.  Students will be engaging in scientific research and it is hoped that the research that they conduct will be compiled into a publishable manuscript. Further, through the assessment of this online CURE, the project team anticipates defining the impacts of an online CURE on undergraduate students, thus contributing to understanding the impact of CUREs in undergraduate biology education.

Although WSANs work satisfactorily most of the time thanks to years of research, they are often difficult to configure as configuring a WSAN is a complex process, which involves theoretical computation, simulation, field testing, among other tasks. To support new services that require high data rates and mobile platforms, industrial WSANs are adopting wireless technologies such as 5G and LoRa and becoming increasingly hierarchical, heterogeneous, and complex, which significantly increases the network configuration difficulty. This CAREER project aims to advance network configuration and runtime adaptation methods for industrial WSANs. Research outcomes from this project will significantly enhance the resilience and agility of industrial WSANs and reduce human involvement in network management, leading to a significant improvement in industrial efficiency and a remarkable reduction of operating costs. By providing more advanced WSANs, the research outcomes from this project will significantly spur the installation of WSANs in process industries and enable a broad range of new wireless-based applications, which affects economics, security, and quality of life. This project enhances lectures and course project materials, supports curriculum developments, creates research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and establishes outreach programs for K-12 students. <br/><br/>Different from traditional methods that rely largely on experience and rules of thumb that involve a coarse-grained analysis of network load or dynamics during a few field trials, this project develops a rigorous methodology that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to configure and adapt WSANs by harvesting the valuable resources (e.g., theoretical models and simulation methods) accumulated by the wireless research community. This project develops new methods that leverage wireless simulations and deep learning to relate high-level network performance to low-level network configurations and efficiently adapt the network at runtime to satisfy the performance requirements specified by industrial applications. This project demonstrates the performance of WSANs that are equipped with those new methods through testbed experimentation, case study, and real-world validation. The research outcomes from this project affects not only industrial WSANs but other complex wireless networks as this project  creates a replicable template for novel network configuration and runtime adaptation strategies that advance the state of the art of wireless network management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned as key components of 5G wireless technology and beyond: thanks to their low cost, improved line-of-sight over terrestrial base stations, and controllable mobility, they will enable low-cost wireless broadband access. Nonetheless, UAVs? integration into wireless networks poses unique challenges on the network and physical layers, due to the intricate coupling between trajectory design and communication resources to be jointly optimized, and uncertain air-to-ground channel propagation conditions. Furthermore, UAVs need to seamlessly operate under sources of randomness and uncertainty typical of wireless networks. This project aims to design techniques to enable real-time physical-layer adaptation of the communication resources, and adaptive trajectory designs to optimize communication performance and energy-efficiency of the system. This research addresses the global industrial and societal need for ubiquitous wireless broadband access by enabling a cost-effective integration of UAVs into wireless networks. This research integrates an educational and outreach program designed to foster research interests and participation of underrepresented students in electrical engineering, through activities created in collaboration with programs at ASU and local high schools.<br/><br/>This project develops a novel decision-making framework to address the critical need for adaptation in UAV-assisted wireless networks operating under uncertainty. Adaptive techniques are developed that leverage the high mobility of UAVs to optimize communication metrics such as latency, throughput, outage probability, area spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, by focusing on the interplay between network-level optimization and physical-layer communication, trajectory design, and control. A key novelty is a multi-scale decision framework to achieve scalable design. The framework leverages multiple spatio-temporal scales induced by the coupling between trajectory and channel propagation conditions to centralize slow timescale trajectory decisions and decentralize fast timescale communications decisions. The design aspect leverages unique features of single- and multi-antennas, operating at sub-6GHz or millimeter-wave frequencies, and provides adaptation to uncertain and dynamic channel conditions. The second goal consists of designing adaptive multi-UAV wireless systems, including UAV selection, user association, resource allocation, optimal charging schedules to enable uninterrupted operation, and contention-based access schemes to improve coverage and grant-free access.

Such infrastructures are less likely to break in catastrophic events. The proposed technology is based on research that shows that in addition to mechanical acceleration channels in solids, there also is a mechanical strain channel that may be used for communication.  The strain communication channel is formulated based on the fractional particle displacement parameter.

Yang-Mills flow is a natural evolution process designed to solve the Yang-Mills equations, much as Hamilton's Ricci flow does for the Einstein equations.

The second is to the Atiyah-Jones conjecture on the stable topology of instanton moduli spaces on the 4-sphere or a K3 surface.

The students and postdoctoral fellows working on the project will learn how to integrate the life and physical sciences fruitfully and develop as leaders in an exciting frontier of science. Notably, in partnership with a local university, the project aims to inspire young students to pursue careers in science.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the proposed work is to deduce general principles that describe how stochastic non-equilibrium collective processes determine the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the nucleus that control gene regulation and genome architecture, and thus the emergence of cell state. Phase-separated condensates of proteins and RNA form at particular genomic loci, and this project aims to determine how non-equilibrium processes regulate their formation and function. DNA loops encompass active genes and their regulatory elements, and active and silent regions of the genome are segregated. The project aims to advance understanding of how interactions among DNA, RNA and proteins underpin genome architecture, dynamics and function.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms program of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Physics of Living Systems program of the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women and leads to higher risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, infertility, and cancer. Women with PCOS are using on average 5 to 6 separate apps to manage their symptoms. Many of these apps are not based upon research. Women with PCOS note frustration, confusion and exhaustion trying to determine the right diet and the right way to manage their health problems. Many do not have access to a specialist or even a local health care provider with knowledge of PCOS. The goal is to educate women with PCOS about their unique nutritional and metabolic needs and to offer ?one place? for women with PCOS to go for evidence-based advice from experts in this field.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a web-based application for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).  Research has shown that PCOS patients may control and mitigate their symptoms by managing their diet. The unique feature of this diet is that it is not based on counting caloric intakes, rather it is based on eliminating certain elements from the diet. The technology is based on a prospective clinical trial leading to an average weight loss of 19 pounds in 8 weeks without counting calories, carbs or fats. In addition, participants showed a 50% reduction in fasting insulin and a significant reduction in total testosterone as well. The goals of the proposed technology are to provide evidence-based education about PCOS directly to patients, and to relieve some of the burden on health care providers who care for these patients.  The goal is to provide education and treatment based on 10 years of research conducted by nutritional and medical experts for the management of PCOS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of this, properly understanding large data sets is a crucial endeavor. Big data sets today are often modeled by a large collection of pairwise interactions - that is, the interactions between two entities, such as people, firms, or molecules. However, such pairwise interactions can miss important phenomena, such as a multi-firm trade deals, one chemical catalyzing the reaction of several others, or a single patent using many technologies. Fortunately, these ""higher-order"" interactions in big data sets can be accurately modeled using the mathematics of tensors. Tensors are rapidly becoming a fundamental data structure and key mathematical object for the 21st century, much as linear algebra dominated science and engineering for the last 200 years. Tensors are central to a wide range of areas, from fundamental physics to mechanical engineering, from quantum computing to neural networks and deep learning. Within computer science, they arise in cryptography, algorithms for key tasks such as multiplying matrices, and the deepest problems across computer science and mathematics (whether brute-force search algorithms can always be improved, the infamous P versus NP question). The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the computational properties of tensors, and to develop a foundational theory of the mathematics  and algorithmics of beyond-pairwise interactions. Because higher-order interactions arise in so many different areas, in addition to research, this award supports multidisciplinary workshops, as well as education and training at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>This project is developing new algorithmic techniques for analyzing and comparing tensors, as well as advancing their fundamental mathematical theory. The investigator is using isomorphism problems as a key testbed in this project, both as inspiration for theoretical foundations and as a target application in and of itself. Isomorphism problems ask when two given objects - be they data sets, topological spaces, algebraic groups, or tensors - have the same structure, despite being presented differently. The most useful properties for understanding tensors are those that are the same for any two isomorphic tensors, so there is a rich interplay between algorithmic techniques used to solve tensor isomorphism and foundational mathematical results on tensors. The project is focusing on both tensor isomorphism and group isomorphism; these two problems already have implications for fields as diverse as material science, network analysis, and quantum computing. The investigator is bringing to bear a range of mathematical techniques, including group cohomology, algebraic geometry, and computational complexity theory. The theory of higher-order interactions developed in this project, with isomorphism problems as a testbed, will open up potential applications in a wide variety of areas, from core computer science to complex adaptive systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This diverse urban nature is important habitat for many types of plants and wildlife, and is affected by a variety of stressors, ranging from toxic pollutants, to pests, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. Urban nature, in all its diversity, is also critically important to urban residents, providing numerous potential benefits, ranging from aesthetic and health-related, to climate control and recreational opportunities. However, these benefits are not equally accessible to everyone. This project will explore how urban residents and urban nature interact with one another and respond to ongoing rapid environmental and social change. The ultimate goal is to figure out ways that environmental outcomes can be improved for all people living in the city. Researchers will work with education specialists from the Bell Museum to help middle school students and teachers learn and teach about science, using their own schoolyards as natural classrooms. Researchers will also nurture new university-community partnerships to better understand the factors contributing to disparities in human relationships with urban nature and to learn about approaches to address those disparities.<br/><br/>The Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) Urban Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) aims to determine the long-term coupled dynamics of urban nature and the urban social system in the face of rapid environmental and social change. The project examines this coupling across organizational scales of urban nature from diverse organisms in habitat patches, to stream and stormwater drainage networks, to landscapes with abundant surface water. The project likewise examines human-nature coupling at multiple scales in the urban social system, from diverse individuals acting in groups in numerous municipalities to complex governance systems and institutions at the metropolitan region. Specifically, the research addresses how biodiversity at the organism to habitat patch scales, and habitat fragmentation and connectivity mediate long-term responses of ecological structure and function to urban stressors such as toxins, pests, pathogens, and climate change. Researchers will determine how ecological, hydrological, and climate processes of urban nature create benefits and burdens for diverse human communities over time, and in turn how governance, policy, and practice can change to improve decisions about urban nature. Finally, the project will explore how the long-term process of growing partnerships for knowledge creation and practice can change scientific and community outcomes in the urban ecosystem. By advancing understanding of how pollutants, biodiversity, land cover, habitat fragmentation, and drainage network properties affect urban nature processes in the face of environmental and social change, research will test whether ecological theories developed in non-urban ecosystems can predict patterns and processes in highly modified and managed urban systems. The project will shed light on patterns of social disparities in human relationships with urban nature and how such disparities are addressed through institutional and policy change with long-term socio-ecological research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When they reach the surface, they can be used to reveal structures within the Earth, in a similar way than sonography is used in medical imaging. Seismic waves lose energy as they travel, a phenomenon known as seismic attenuation. Attenuation depends on the rocks the waves travel through, notably their temperature, how densely they are fractured, as well as on the fluid content of the fractures (e.g, partial melts).  The rate of energy loss is related to the frequency (rate of vibration) of the seismic wave. High frequency (rapidly vibrating) waves lose energy faster than low frequency (slowly vibrating) waves.  By analyzing the attenuation in seismograms of a set of earthquakes, it is possible to create a 3D image of seismic attenuation in the Earth. This procedure is known as attenuation tomography. It allows unveiling the processes at play within the Earth. A key aspect is measuring the wave amplitude as a function of frequency, known as the wave spectrum. Here the team uses the ratio of the spectra of many pairs of nearby earthquakes observed on a set of seismic stations.  This new method is called double-difference attenuation tomography. It allows imaging attenuation in the vicinity of the earthquakes with greater accuracy and spatial resolution than the conventional method. The team uses it to image the shear-wave (side-to-side vibration) attenuation structure of the geothermal reservoir at The Geysers, California. The goal is to determine the change of fracturing and fluid content caused by the exploitation or stimulation of a geothermal reservoir. The researchers also intend to image the compressional-wave (push-pull vibration) attenuation structure of two areas in Japan.  There, normal earthquakes and anomalous low-frequency earthquakes occur at great depth where oceanic plates are diving down (subducting) into the Earth?s mantle. The study, thus, contributes to a better understanding of the origin of deep earthquakes and the processes at work along the upper edge of subducting plates. The developed software, applicable in different geological contexts, is made available to the scientific community.  The 1-year project also provides support to a postdoctoral associate, training for one undergraduate, and outreach to the public. <br/><br/>Here, the team develops and applies a new method called double-difference (DD) attenuation tomography. The underlying concept is as follows: use event-pair measurements of differential whole-path attenuation (dt*), along with ""absolute"" t* measurements, to invert for three-dimensional (3D) attenuation structure, parameterized in terms of Q. An event-pair spectral ratio method is used to make robust estimates of dt*. A modified seismic tomography code is then used to invert the absolute and differential t* measurements for 3D Q structure. The dt* measurements allow for higher-resolution imaging of 3D Q structure in seismogenically active regions, just as in the case of DD velocity tomography.  The team tested the approach with synthetic data and applied it to data from The Geysers geothermal area in California to obtain a snapshot of 3D Q structure for P waves in 2011. They determined the change in P-wave Q structure between 2005 and 2011 using carefully matched earthquakes.  The project supports the application of this innovative method to image the S-wave structure at The Geysers, which provides complementary information to the P-wave Q results.  It also fosters the imaging of the P-wave structure at two subduction zone segments in Japan.  The combination of P-wave and S-wave Q models at The Geysers provides strong constraints on the fracturing and saturation state of the geothermal reservoir.  For the subduction zone segment in Northern Honshu, the team develops and analyzes new high-resolution 3D P-wave and S-wave Q models. This helps constrain the nature of the double seismic zone and the cause of seismicity within the two zones. For the subduction zone segment in Shikoku, previous work finds a zone of high P-wave to S-wave ratio (Vp/Vs) sandwiched between planar zones of low-frequency earthquakes above and regular earthquakes below. Here the researchers test predictions regarding how Qp and Qs should vary in the different parts of these two subduction zone systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Effective membrane separation technology has the potential not only to reduce the energy consumption of chemical industries and accelerate the adoption of green alternative energy sources, but also to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases.  Replacing existing energy-intensive processes with membranes may reduce annual U.S. energy costs by $4 billion and eliminate 100 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Deploying efficient membranes for the purification of hydrogen and natural gas also may accelerate the replacement of coal for electricity generation, while implementing membranes for carbon dioxide separation from flue gas may reduce the cost of carbon capture by 50%. Despite their great potential, however, the broad adoption of membranes has been hampered by the inadequate separation performance of existing materials. The proposed technology uses molecular filters capable of performing precise separations based on gas molecule size, and enables separations currently unaddressed in industry that may realize the full potential of energy-efficient membrane-based technologies.	<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on the development of molecular filters engineered to have similar pore sizes to gas molecules, making them exceptional molecular sieves. Traditional membrane materials consist of single-stranded and flexible polymer chains that pack efficiently in the solid state, leading to virtually no pores in the membranes. This dense packing results in limited productivity because molecules could not diffuse quickly through the dense material.  The materials had low selectivity because they could not  distinguish molecules by size. The materials in the proposed design represent a shift in polymer chemistry and materials engineering. A rigid ladder, or double-stranded, molecular motif was incorporate into the polymer chains. These rigid ladder motifs prevent the dense packing of polymer chains in the solid-state, leading to abundant microporosity that may be leveraged for molecular separations. By systematically tuning the conformation of these ladder motifs, the productivity and selectivity of the membrane may be simultaneously tailored for specific applications. In addition to the potential applications in the energy sector, this project may provide important intellectual insights to guide the understanding and design of porous organic materials with other applications yet to be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the US, with 5.5 million new cases diagnosed in 2019. Research shows that skin cancers are highly treatable if detected early. Early detection of melanoma saves lives and improves the treatment outcomes by reducing the risk of spreading cancer to other parts of the body. Early detection of nonmelanoma skin cancers minimizes disfigurement and enhances the quality of life and productivity for many patients. The proposed technology may be a new tool for dermatologists and make skin cancer screening more affordable by optimizing the skin evaluation process, supporting teledermatology services, and lowering the overall costs of care. In addition, there may be other applications of this 3D imaging technology in skin evaluation for cosmetic product development, planning and evaluation of orthodontic and cosmetic procedures, real-time monitoring of radiotherapy patients, facial expression and virtual character creation for movie and virtual reality game productions, and dynamic facial recognition for identity and property protection.   <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a high-speed, high-accuracy 3D scanner using multi-wavelength, phase-shifting structured light and an automated skin analysis software using computational conformal geometry. The proposed 3D scanner is designed to capture the human body?s geometry at high speed (up to 180 frames/second) and with high precision (depth resolution of 0.2mm). Visual identification of skin changes in 2D is impractical. When the viewing angle is altered, the individual?s posture varies, or the surface is deformed, image registration becomes challenging and unstable. The proposed solution is based on extensive research in computational conformal geometry. Due to the shape-preserving property of conformal mapping, 3D geometric analysis may be accomplished by processing 2D conformal images, which is easier and faster. Independent of their geometric or topological complexities, shapes in real physical worlds may be conformally transformed into one of three canonical shapes (i.e., unit sphere, Euclidean plane, or planar disk). Because of the uniformity, the design of all geometric algorithms can be simplified, resulting in dramatically improved efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. By combining high-performance 3D scanning and advanced conformal mapping techniques, this foundational platform technology may enable many applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These errors have been widely deemed harmful, so the state-of-the-art on error control mainly target for absolute error removal. Yet, data errors can be benign or even beneficial (e.g., introducing errors to gradients may help the machine learning models to escape local optima), while existing research that are reactive and non-functional fail to turn data errors into good. Hence, the research objective of this project is to proactively harvest, render, and control data errors across C3 of wireless devices for significant performance gains in energy efficiency, throughput, data privacy, etc. Moreover, the research efforts will be coupled with educational innovations through the development of new laboratories, lecture contents, outreach demos and a novel undergraduate/graduate co-learning pedagogy. The successful completion of this project will enhance diversity in the wireless workforce in the nation, promote community outreach and create fundamental innovations of wireless technologies that are transformative to future wireless applications (e.g., AI and smart health).<br/><br/>The proposed research activities include a synergy of hardware and software designs across layers of application, embedded memory and front-end radio in wireless devices as well as network protocols on wireless network edges.

To accomplish these goals will require fundamental changes in agricultural land management and the broader structure of our food systems. Central to this restructuring must be an emphasis on improving soil health and managing agricultural systems to provide environmental ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, improved water quality, reduced erosion, biodiverse pollinator habitat, etc.) as important coproducts to crop yields. Supporting the transition to, and maintenance of, this so-called regenerative farmland management requires monetizing the value of the various environmental services provided and ensuring that farmers retain a greater proportion of the value of both the crops and environmental services they cultivate. Our proposal seeks to develop a greater understanding of the opportunities for and barriers to adoption of regenerative agricultural practices, as well as collective decision-making about land use management by regional farming communities. <br/><br/>To carry out this investigation, this project will bring together the nation?s leading soil scientists and social scientists with Pecan Street?s award-winning engineering team to design an integrative research project laying the technological and social foundations for facilitating regenerative farmland management. This project will 1) enhance and expand an existing farm greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting system (COMET-Farm) with state-of-the-art sensors and geospatial datasets to better facilitate landscape-scale assessments for rural communities, and 2) pilot that system in select communities with a goal of nudging farmers off individual-level decision-making towards collective decisions about regenerative farmland management that will result in improved, marketable carbon sequestration and ecosystem service provisioning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their importance, these commodity OS kernels are complicated, highly concurrent, and all it takes is a single weak link in the code?one to leave a system vulnerable to hackers. Many of these vulnerabilities are virtually impossible to detect via traditional testing. Even if a commodity OS kernel can be written 99% correctly, a hacker can still sneak into that particular 1% set-up where the system will not behave as expected. This project is designing, implementing, and evaluating microverification, a new approach to verify that a large, commodity, multiprocessor OS kernel is secure under all circumstances without the need to prove the correctness of every part of the system. This approach is being used with the Linux kernel, used in much of today?s computing infrastructure. The project provides a foundation for future innovations in building trustworthy system software and making tomorrow?s computing infrastructure more secure.<br/><br/>Microverification retrofits an existing commodity OS kernel into a small, trusted core and a larger set of untrusted services, such that it is possible to verify the information-flow security of the entire OS kernel by reasoning about the core alone. This project is developing security-preserving layers to make verification tractable by decomposing the core into a hierarchy of composable, layered specifications. The core implementation can then be incrementally verified to refine its high-level layered specification, such that security guarantees can be proven over the core's top layer specification, preserved across layers, and hold for the entire implementation of the retrofitted OS kernel. Retrofitting and verification are being done on the Linux Kernel, whose verification was previously considered intractable, demonstrating that microverification techniques are capable of verifying existing large-scale commodity OS kernels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans deal with deformable objects all the time when we fold laundry, pour ourselves a drink, and peel vegetables. Although such tasks are performed effortlessly by humans, they are challenging for traditional robotics techniques which assume that all objects are rigid. Robot deformable object manipulation, such as laundry folding or cooking, could enable those who cannot perform these tasks easily for themselves to live more independent lives. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop novel methods for robots to learn to manipulate deformable objects. First, robots will learn to predict how their actions will cause an object to deform; robots will then use these predictions to determine how to achieve deformable object manipulation tasks. To enable the public to better understand this research, the investigators will develop a virtual robot interface called ?Teach-a-Robot"" that will enable anyone in the world to experience teaching a robot a new task: users will upload a video of themselves performing a task and then watch a robot attempting to imitate them. Finally, the investigators will design new course assignments that demonstrate the interplay between robotics, computer vision, and machine learning.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to explore how self-supervised representation learning can be used by robots to achieve deformable object manipulation. Given a set of demonstrations of robots or people interacting with deformable objects, the project will enable robots to learn representations of these objects that are useful for manipulation. This effort will explore how self-supervised learning can be used to: predict the effect of a robot's actions on a deformable object; infer object properties; recognize deformable object parts under large deformations; learn to transfer policies between deformable objects of the same class; and learn visual representations that transfer well from simulation to the real world. The second research thrust will explore how robots can use these self-supervised representations to efficiently learn policies to manipulate deformable objects. This effort will develop novel methods for reinforcement learning that can perform multi-scale reasoning, enabling robots to focus on both task-relevant low-level object details as well as the global object configuration. This research effort will open new doors for robots to interact with a wide range of deformable objects, such as folding cloth, molding dough to make pastries, spreading sauce onto pizza dough, and peeling vegetables.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the key tasks that robots will need to do when talking with everyday people is referring expression generation, which is the process of creating descriptions like ""the office at the end of the hallway."" When robots generate such descriptions, they need to do so in a way that is accurate (the description shouldn't be wrong), natural (the description shouldn't sound awkward), understandable (the listener should be able to interpret the description quickly and effortlessly), and efficient (the robot should be able to generate the description without having to pause and think for too long). To understand how robots might generate descriptions in a way that satisfies these properties, we can start by trying to understand how people do so. One reason we are good at generating referring expressions may be because of our working, or short term, memory, which we use to keep a small amount of timely and important information available in a way that we can quickly and effortlessly access. The key idea of this project is to give robots the same type of working memory capabilities, and the same ways of thinking about what might be in peoples' working memories, so they will be able to use that timely and important information to do a better job at generating referring expressions. By taking this cognitively inspired approach, this work will advance the state of the art of multiple fields, including AI, robotics, and psychology. In addition, the educational aspect of this project aims to develop materials that will help train the next generation of students working at the intersection of these fields. To ensure the broadest possible impact, these efforts will be integrated with the PI's department's activities relating to Broadening Participation in Computing so that they reach currently underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the key goal of this research is to show how models of working memory that appropriately cache task-relevant beliefs about goal-relevant objects will enable robots to better perform referring expression generation. To this end, the work will assess two key hypotheses: that cognitively inspired models of working memory will enable robots to generate referring expressions in a way that is more accurate, natural, computationally efficient to generate, and cognitively efficient for the listener to process; and that goal relevance can be leveraged to ensure that the most task-relevant information is retained within those models. By addressing these hypotheses, the research will develop: (1) the first algorithms for referring expression generation in robot cognitive architectures that are informed by current psychological theories of human working memory; (2) a fundamental new understanding of how robots can intelligently manage and allocate resources within artificial working memory models, (3) an understanding of which memory models will produce optimal performance from both robotics and cognitive modeling perspectives; (4) fundamental new understanding of how the goal relevance of entities and their properties can be automatically assessed within integrated cognitive architectures; (5) understanding of how goal relevance can be used to allocate cognitive resources within robotic models of working memory; (6) understanding of which goal-driven resource allocation strategies will produce optimal performance from both robotics and cognitive modeling perspectives; and (7) freely-available datasets of human-robot dialogues, and a freely-available experimental framework to allow other researchers to collect additional such dialogues, both of which will be permanently archived via the Open Science Framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DL is also increasingly more often used in physics, medicine, and chemistry, among other disciplines. Training a DL model in any of these applications requires solving a mathematical problem whose properties are poorly understood. Consequently, existing DL training methodologies are sub-optimal and consume a large amount of resources, time, and money. Our limited understanding of DL compromises the progress of all public and private sectors that rely on DL technology, and limits its deployment in new applications. This project aims at overcoming this limitation by describing universal properties of DL systems that hold across a variety of DL models and data sets. The acquired knowledge will be used to develop a new generation of training strategies that are tailored to the DL setting and are efficient, accurate, and scalable. New algorithmic tools will have a strong impact on a wide range of applications and can be leveraged by US public and private entities to shift to significantly more powerful computational learning platforms in various areas of their AI-based businesses that require the processing of large and complex data. Broader impact activities of this project include (a) graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, (b) summer research opportunities for high-school students via NYU Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering program, and (c) knowledge popularization via NYU Tandon ECE Seminar Series on Modern AI, organized by the investigator, that is open to universities, high schools, and industry, and that is streamed worldwide.<br/><br/>The proposed research is a multi-level approach to explore the principles of DL optimization and generalization, and to develop new generation DL optimization tools.

The obtained optimizers will be parallelized in order to be compatible with the architecture of the computer clusters that are typically used to train large-scale DL networks on massive data. The new parallel optimizers will accommodate dynamic allocation of computational resources during training and will be able to process extremely large data batches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This convenience of modern computing, however, comes with a steep cost in terms of energy use and environmental impact: today, the global information infrastructure, i.e., data centers, emit as much greenhouse gases as that of the state of Nevada or a country such as Netherlands or Malaysia and constitute around 1% of world-wide electricity demand. According to scientific estimates, this fraction may balloon up to 20% in the next 15-20 years. At the core of this predicament lies the fact that our cutting-edge digital hardware has long been overdue for a prime upgrade in terms of their energy efficiencies?at the level of its most fundamental, building blocks: the transistors.  The proposed research aims to explore an energy-efficient transistor concept - negative capacitance field-effect transistor, which will be made using a new class of nanometer-scale materials, called the antiferroelectric oxides.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The project aims at addressing the generational, global challenge of energy efficiency of information processing electronics by exploring an energy-efficient transistor concept, namely the negative capacitance field-effect transistor (NCFET). The main claim of innovation is the use of a new class of nanometer-scale materials, called the antiferroelectric oxides, to enable this transistor technology. The underlying hypothesis is that owing to a unique physical phenomenon in antiferroelectrics: the electric field-induced non-polar-to-polar phase transition, antiferroelectric NCFETs can lead to a reduction of the energy in transistors below the fundamental, thermodynamic limit, much more than that is allowable in their conventional counterparts: ferroelectric based NCFETs. Tightly integrated with these research activities is a 5-year plan to pilot sustainable, all-level educational curricula that is scalable to the state and the national levels for creating a steady pipeline of domestic semiconductor workforce. Proposed pre-college activities include increasing awareness and excitement for semiconductor related topics in high-school classrooms through hands-on, outreach activities and teacher training via partnership with local schools. For higher-level education, the project will undertake formal and scholarly studies to understand the efficacy of different pedagogical techniques, such as online, remote and hybrid mode of teaching, in the new socio-economic realities of the post-pandemic world for undergraduate and graduate semiconductor courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Special metals, such as titanium and its alloys, have unique corrosion resistance, high specific strength, and excellent bio-compatibility.  These metals may be used in the fabrication of high-performance parts for medical implants and other applications such as deep sea mining and robotics.  In addition, the proposed room temperature process for titanium production may enable the development of future alloys such as high entropy alloys, which are not suitable for the current high temperature manufacturing process.  Also, the proposed manufacturing process may be applied to extract rare earth metals from their oxides, satisfying critical needs in manufacturing electric motors for the US auto industry.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an electrochemical approach for titanium (Ti) parts manufacturing utilizing low-cost pigments (TiO2) refined into value-added products (e.g., Ti powders/wires) at room temperature.  Though electrochemical approaches have been exploited by others, the proposed technology is based on a unique liquid metal alloy as the anode. The liquid metal alloy has a ?catalytic? capability, capable of accelerating titanium extractions from solid TiO2 without the need for elevated temperatures.  The resulting value-added products may be used as raw materials in additive manufacturing to deliver Ti parts.  This proposed room temperature process potentially may save more than 50% of the energy costs versus the traditional Ti refining process and may be easier to directly couple with additive manufacturing.

However, these assays have limited capacity to discriminate between active and past infections. The goal of this project is to design and validate nanobiosensors capable of reporting active coronavirus infections. Optical nanobiosensors will be developed that detect two signature proteases of SARS-CoV-2. These optical nanobiosensors are anticipated to provide quantitative assessment of active viral load, such that disease trajectories can be measured.<br/><br/>PCR-based and immunological methods are limited in their ability to distinguish between patients with active coronavirus infection and patients that have survived the disease. Moreover, immunoassays are hampered by the incomplete specificity of currently available antibodies. A critical need exists for a technology that is capable of detecting the activity of a coronavirus in a ""liquid biopsy"" such as plasma, serum, sputum or exhaled breath condensate. The hypothesis of this research is that proteolytic activities of SARS-CoV-2 signature proteases PLpro and 3CLpro will provide a real-time, quantitative marker of active viral infection. Optical nanobiosensors specific for these proteases will be developed and validated, leveraging the optical properties of magnetic Fe/Fe3O4 core/shell nanoparticles linked to fluorophores and FRET-quenchers. Subsequent in vitro validation will utilize biosamples from infected cell cultures and pre-clinical models.

The discovery of the Higgs boson is the first major highlight of the LHC program, which established that the predicted particle content and interactions of the Standard Model (SM) are complete. Despite this success, the SM is widely believed to be an incomplete theory. Ongoing studies must determine whether or not this new Higgs boson is that of the SM, and new experimental data are essential to discover if and how Nature has chosen to extend the SM. These studies include new measurements and searches for new physics, primarily using data recorded at the highest currently available center-of-mass energy. The physics analysis activities form a comprehensive program to extend characterization of Higgs boson properties. This award will push the limits of this search for physics beyond the SM by employing new Machine Learning techniques. The innovation being developed by this award: using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to analyze the massive amount of data being produced by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, will push the discovery potential in the Higgs boson study. The award will also expand an education and outreach effort using data from the LHC and GNN techniques into local area high schools and the general public. <br/><br/>This award will search for Beyond the SM (BSM) physics in the Higgs boson channels involving top-quark-associated production (ttH and tH). It will also further study Higgs decay into two-photon and four-quark channels. These are rare processes and will require the new techniques being developed by this award. These channels are expected to put strong constraints on BSM physics. The novel use of GNN is in a nascent state but involves re-classifying LHC data into a graph structure. This graph structure can then be fed into a neural network which can in effect select out the very rare events that are of interest, revealing BSM. This award will also further develop the upgrade to the ATLAS detector currently in preparation for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The work will focus on the Strip Tracker upgrade and the Data Acquisition system, which requires a new software framework in order to meet the stringent performance requirements of the HL-LHC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each neuron can receive and process information from thousands of other neurons through discrete connections, called synapses. It is currently not known whether changes made at one synapse between two neurons can influence the development and/or activity of neighboring synapses that the target cell makes with other synaptic partners. For example, it might be the case that a decrease in communication at one synapse triggers increases in communication at other synapses in a brain circuit. The goal of this study is to document the existence of such compensatory programs, and to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. This project is conducted using individual cells in the neuromuscular circuitry of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster because of the advantages this preparation presents for studying and manipulating synaptic function, and because of striking functional similarity these cells share with mammalian excitatory brain synapses. The project includes a joint University of Chicago - University of Puerto Rico summer program for undergraduate students, which will integrate underrepresented citizens into cutting edge research labs to facilitate their development as independent researchers. It will additionally strengthen ties with predominantly Hispanic and Black schools on the south side of Chicago through outreach programs that allow high school students and teachers to conduct project-relevant lab experiments and disseminate the work in their respective classrooms. A joint quarter-long laboratory course for undergraduate juniors and seniors at the Woods Hole Biological Laboratories will enable students to gain high levels of competence in advanced neuroscience experimental techniques. This project will advance our understanding of neural circuit function and adaptation, as well as enhance education and participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>Neural circuits have highly complex connectivity patterns in which many inputs congregate on single targets. The number and strength of the synapses provided by each input can vary greatly, but how these synapses respond to perturbations ? a process known as synaptic plasticity ? is not completely understood. Unlike the densely packed synapses of the brain, motor neuron-muscle connections are easily visualized and differentiated from each other, facilitating examination of all synapses from each input. The central hypothesis of this project is that co-innervation in early circuit development creates an environment in which subsequent functional defects trigger synaptic plasticity in the remaining connections. Rigorous analyses of several co-innervating motor neuron pairs will characterize the contribution of each input to the total muscle activity and examine how perturbations in one input induce structural and functional plasticity phenotypes in the adjacent input(s), a process we refer to as inter-input synaptic plasticity (IISP). Genetic manipulations combined with calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings will examine IISP in the neuromuscular circuit and help delineate molecular pathways that enable IISP. The results of this project will fundamentally advance understanding of how synaptic inputs develop and interact in a complex nervous system. The educational module expands student research experiences, while the outreach plan combines mentoring and research to train underrepresented high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and expand access to neuroscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent research indicates that it is becoming atypical for students to complete a four year baccalaureate STEM degree directly from high school. For example, nearly half of all STEM bachelor?s degree recipients attend a community college at some point in their college career.   After they transfer to a four-year degree program, these students are often required to repeat courses they successfully completed at community college. Such challenges can be amplified by complex university admission requirements that may be difficult for transfer students to navigate. This project seeks to build capacity to address four goals: 1) Improve transfer efficiency in engineering disciplines; 2) Improve curricula that result in improved student retention; 3) Improve participation and persistence among students of color and students from low-income backgrounds in STEM; and 4) Increase the numbers of engineering graduates to contribute to the economy.<br/><br/>The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) and New Mexico State University (NMSU), in collaboration with NMSU?s four community colleges, plan to address the goals by testing the feasibility of using sets of lower-division student learning outcomes (SLOs) as the basis for block transfer into engineering programs. This approach contrasts with most institutions? practice of accepting transfer credit based on specific courses completed. Project partners hope to demonstrate that students who transfer can complete an engineering degree without substantially extending their time to graduation. SLO-based block transfer is the foundation of the project?s long-term goal of supporting institutions in reforming and generalizing their transfer practices within the STEM disciplines.  These changes are intended to have direct benefits for students from underrepresented groups and students from low-income backgrounds. To accomplish this work, NMSU will identify the student learning outcomes that are critical for students to complete a four-year electrical engineering degree and map those SLOs to visually depict their prerequisite course relationships and preferable course sequencing. The resulting SLO map will inform identification of a lower-division SLO block to simplify curricula, potentially improving degree progress and persistence for all students, not just transfer students. WICHE will conduct a literature review to further identify factors that inhibit transfers within STEM and engineering disciplines; articulate a theory of change; and recruit leaders of national organizations and two-year and four-year institutions representing at least four states to analyze and refine NMSU?s proof of concept and assess the feasibility of scaling NMSU?s work to additional institutions.

Because most genomes are composed of a mosaic of recombined segments inherited from different ancestors, genealogical relationships vary across different regions of the genome. This variation has been the primary focus of new methods developed over the last two decades in the field of phylogenetic systematics. However, the growing availability of chromosome-scale genome sequence data presents many new opportunities and challenges for existing methods, which have traditionally focused on genealogical patterns among few statistically independent gene regions, as opposed to many contiguous and non-independent regions. This project involves the development of new methods for linking phylogenetic inference at genome-wide and local genealogical scales. These new methods will bring increased power to disentangle phylogenetic relationships among rapidly radiating clades, thus contributing to our understanding of biodiversity and the ecological mechanisms that generate diversity. This work also supports training opportunities for students, as well as the development of several didactic software tools for teaching evolutionary genomics, which will form the basis for a new online and interactive textbook. Together, these tools will promote increased interactions among the phylogenetics and broader data science communities.<br/><br/>This project supports a number of research and educational approaches for linking phylogenetic inference at genome-wide and local genealogical scales. This includes a combination of approaches (1) to improve phylogenetic network estimation from unlinked SNPs, as opposed to error-prone gene trees; (2) to improve local genealogical inference in species-level phylogenies using a novel Bayesian machine-learning approach that incorporates prior information from recombination maps and a parameterized species tree or network; (3) to develop new genomic resources in the highly diverse plant clade Pedicularis to enable the application of genome-wide phylogenetic inference methods to investigate selection and introgression; (4) to expand population-level genomic sampling across dozens of species of Pedicularis in a biodiversity hotspot, including historical samples, to investigate spatial and temporal factors affecting genetic diversity and endemism within and across species; (5) to develop a free on-line textbook based on interactive coding exercises to teach phylogenetic methods through modern data science techniques in Python; and (6) to develop a new course where students will be involved in the process of researching and generating content for this textbook.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In agriculture, primary products such as grain and fruit rely on the success of sexual reproduction. In particular, the ability of pollen to transmit sperm cells to the embryo sac is critical to the production of the next generation of seeds. In maize, the focus of this project, environmental stressors such as high heat can lead to loss of pollen viability and subsequent crop disruption. This project will utilize a novel imaging and automated computer vision system (EarVision) coupled with a large set of easily assayed mutants to measure the contributions of hundreds of genes to maize pollen function. Quantitative and computational approaches will analyze available genome-scale data to help predict gene function during maize reproduction and build an improved understanding of the pollen genetics of this crop plant. The project will inform approaches directed towards multiple agricultural goals such as improving crop resilience or controlling germ line activity. In addition, the project will educate students at high school, undergraduate, and postdoctoral levels in plant genetics and quantitative scientific skills via outreach through summer camps and inclusive research projects.<br/><br/>This project targets the two cell types of the male gametophyte, vegetative and sperm cells, for a data-driven, systems-level investigation of genes underlying their biological functions using mutational interrogation as a test of gene function. Taking advantage of the haploid nature of pollen and a large set of fluorescently-marked insertional mutations known as Ds-GFP lines (acdsinsertions.org), the project will employ an innovative automated phenotyping approach to generate measures of gene-specific contributions to pollen fitness for several hundred genes. Machine learning and statistical approaches will be used to analyze the resulting quantitative dataset, developing integrative models to relate omics-scale datatypes, such as genome, transcriptome, and proteome data, to the loss-of-function phenotypic outcome for specific genes. The optimal model will be used to predict pollen phenotype from genotype, and subsequently be validated via indirect and direct tests. The project will also develop appropriate statistical methods to exploit the high-content images generated via the phenotyping system, to address hypotheses relating how altered pollen function can influence patterns in the progeny population on the maize ear inflorescence. The project brings together three Oregon State University faculty members with complementary expertise to support its transdisciplinary approach: in plant genetics and development, in statistics and systems analysis, and in machine learning and computational biology. The project will train a postdoc in transdisciplinary application of computational and quantitative approaches to a biological question as well as undergraduate researchers in either genetic or quantitative approaches in biology in collaboration with the Oregon State STEM Leaders Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses a gap between vision and implementation of such standards by designing a coordinated suite of instructional, assessment and teacher professional learning materials that attempt to enact the vision behind the Next Generation Science Standards. The study focuses on the design of such materials using state-of-the-art technology to create an 8-week long, immersive, life science field experience organized around three investigations. Classes of urban students in two states will collect data on local insect species with the goal of understanding, sharing, and critiquing environmental management solutions. An integrated learning technology system, the Learning Navigator, draws on big data to organize student-gathered data, dialogue, lessons, an assessment information. The Learning Navigator will also amplify the teacher's role in guiding and fostering next generation science learning. This project advances the field through an in-depth exploration of the goals for the standards documents. The study begins to address questions about what works when, where, and for whom in the context of the Next Generation Science Standards. <br/><br/>The project uses a series of case studies to create, test, evaluate and refine the system of instructional, assessment and professional development materials as they are enacted in two distinct urban school settings. It is designed with 330 students and 22 teachers in culturally, racially and linguistically diverse, under-resourced schools in Pennsylvania and California. These schools are located in neighborhoods that are economically challenged and have students who demonstrate patterns of underperformance on state standardized tests. It will document the process of team co-construction of Next Generation Science-fostering instructional materials; develop assessment tasks for an instructional unit that are valid and reliable; and, track the patterns of use of the instructional and assessment materials by teachers. The study will also record if new misconceptions are revealed as students develop Next Generation Science knowledge,  comparing findings across two diverse school locations in two states. Data collection will include: (a) multiple types of data to establish validity and reliability of educational assessments, (b) the design, evaluation and use of a classroom observation protocol to gather information on both frequency and categorical degree of classroom practices that support the vision, and (c) consecutive years of ten individual classroom enactments through case studies analyzed through cross-case analyses. This should lead to stronger and better developed understandings about what constitutes strong Next Generation Science learning and the classroom conditions, instructional materials, assessments and teacher development -- that foster it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These technological breakthroughs open doors for communication, interaction, and automated negotiation among travelers, vehicles, and the transportation infrastructure, enabling many innovative applications in which value is created from interactions among peers. This project contributes to both theory and practice in several emerging peer-to-peer applications, including: 1) Shared multi-modal transportation systems in which on-demand shared mobility systems can be integrated with traditional transportation modes (such as transit) to provide seamless door-to-door mobility solutions; 2) Platooning, wherein synchronization of vehicle motion allows a group of automated vehicles to travel together at close proximity, thereby increasing fuel efficiency as well as road capacity; and 3) Vehicle-to-vehicle wireless power transfer between electric vehicles, wherein electric vehicles may pair with one another to exchange electric power. The resulting models and algorithms from this grant can revolutionize the way people and goods move in smart cities of the (near) future, and offer more efficient, affordable, sustainable, and equitable mobility options.<br/><br/>In response to challenges that arise in operationalizing peer-to-peer systems, this project offers several major intellectual contributions within the realms of algorithm design (mathematical programming and large-scale optimization) and mechanism design (auction theory and economics). To achieve the full potential of what smart cities, autonomy, and connected transportation systems have to offer, planning and optimization of sub-systems can no longer occur in isolation; instead, they need to be optimized simultaneously as one integrated system. To address the emerging massive-scale planning and dynamic matching problems that support the real-life operation of future peer-to-peer systems, this NSF grant tackles open problems in graph theory, and designs a suite of new specialized methods (namely decomposition and aggregation/disaggregation schemes that utilize the distinct structure of peer-to-peer systems) to obtain exact or bounded solutions efficiently and as quickly as needed, which often implies in real-time. In addition, this grant designs novel mechanisms for pricing and resource exchange in P2P systems.

This University is an upper-division university that exclusively serves transfer students, most of whom are adult learners. Over its four-year duration, the project will fund scholarships to 30-45 different full- or half-time transfer students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Information Technology, or Mathematics.  These Scholars will receive two to four years of scholarship support, depending on whether they are taking courses full or half-time. To facilitate degree completion, scholarship support will be coupled with other supports, including structured faculty mentorship, access to laptops and online tutoring services, cohort and peer support activities, project-based learning opportunities focused on research and career preparation, and an online learning community that connects participants with peers and community mentors. This project has the potential to advance understanding of the support initiatives that are most effective for transfer students and adult learners in STEM fields. Such information may be generalizable to STEM transfer students at four-year institutions. Athens State University has a high population of low-income students and is located within the science and technology hub of the Huntsville Metro Area.  Consequently, this project can provide a pathway to degree completion that expands access of low-income, high-achieving students to regional STEM careers.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The specific project goals are to improve recruitment, retention, academic success, and graduation rates of academically talented, low-income transfer students in STEM fields through (1) financial assistance and access to critical technology, (2) project-based learning opportunities (including research and work-based learning), (3) peer support, and (4) faculty and community mentoring. Although support initiatives that specifically target transfer students and adult learners have been shown to generally increase student success, more research is needed to determine which types of support are the most effective at increasing success in STEM fields. Because Athens State University is a transfer-only institution, this project is uniquely positioned to identify specific factors contributing to the success of transfer students in STEM fields. The project will investigate whether and to what extent specific support structures increase academic success.  To do so, it will use institutional data about recruitment, retention, and graduation rates, along with the results of Scholar surveys. The overall outcomes of the project are expected to be an increased understanding of effective ways to support transfer students in STEM majors and an increase in access to STEM careers for marginalized populations. An external committee will conduct yearly formative evaluations of project implementation and effectiveness and will also conduct a summative evaluation at the end of the project. Results of this project will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local, regional, and national conferences.

Additive manufacturing is a promising technology that may be used for fabrication of customizable, complex, and cost-effective microneedles arrays (MNAs). MNA devices are micron-sized needles that pierce the outer layer of tissue (skin) to deliver drugs in the form of proteins, molecules, and/or peptides into the body. MNAs are considered painless, minimally invasive devices. Currently, MNA patches developed using traditional technologies such as molding, chemical wet etching, and direct laser micromachining require advanced manufacturing facilities, have limited customizability, and lack flexibility over specific MN parameters. The proposed technology allows superior control over geometric parameters such as sub-millimeter height, tip sharpness, and high-aspect ratio.  Applications of MNA patches include drug delivery, electric stimulation, chemical biosensing, electrical biosignal recording, and neutral interfaces.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of microneedle array (MNA) devices that are micron-sized needles that pierce the outer layer of skin (epidermis) to deliver drugs into the body.  The proposed technology is based on a customizable stereolithography (SLA) technique for fabricating high quality MNA devices with 10 m - 100 m resolution using biocompatible and biodegradable materials. The microneedles may be fabricated with tip heights of 200 m - 800 m and diameters of 50 m - 200 m, respectively.  Using this SLA advanced manufacturing technique, various MNAs such as conical-, pyramidal-, tetrahedron-, angled, honeybee structure, and arrowhead-shaped may be fabricated with high fidelity and mechanical properties. The proposed microneedle technology can bridge current treatment modalities and is amenable to scale-up for large-scale transdermal applications.  Moreover, 3D printed microneedles may be embedded with pharmaceuticals providing tunable drug release kinetics for a variety of medical treatments. These MNA patches will be designed to possess superior mechanical strength and piercing capacity for transdermal drug delivery applications in hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and specialty clinics. The initial market target of this technology is diabetes diagnostics to deliver insulin and regulate glucose for Type 1 diabetes treatment. In addition, these MNAs may provide therapeutic efficiency, and safe, painless penetration through skin that may be easily adapted for other drug delivery modalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Common tests are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions like atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. These conditions affect millions of patients in the US alone and represent $2 B of spending annually.  However, many current solutions cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system or sample, causing clinically significant problems for end-users and raising the cost and inconvenience of performing these tests routinely. The technology in this project will enable various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable system. This will potentially lead to cheaper and more convenient blood coagulation testing for medical professionals and improve medical outcomes by bringing accurate and multiple tests to a single portable devices.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a point of care (POC) direct, mechanical test in a meter and single-use disposable card format, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods that underpin blood clotting tests in the clinical laboratory. As a mechanical measurement, the card will measure physical properties of a clotting whole blood sample and account for confounding factors, such as hematocrit. Specifically, the objective of the project will be to develop a POC, hand-held, battery-operated system that can enable the generation of a viscoelastic curve and associated thromboelastography parameters in less than 10 minutes, a significant improvement over current bulky and labor-intensive solutions with turnaround times of up to 30 minutes or more. Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time.

All US newborns, and most internationally, undergo oxygen saturation (SpO2) based Critical Congenital Heart Defects (CCHD) screening with pulse oximeters. However, this screening still misses hundreds of babies with life-threatening heart defects in the US every year. The proposed NeoPOSE technology could prevent deaths associated with late detection of heart defects in babies. Moreover, its noninvasive approach and automated interpretation make it easy to use to reduce nursing time associated with CCHD screening. Most US states (80%) require reporting of the CCHD screening data to public health departments. Most health care facilities submit data manually, which is labor intensive and error prone. Even those with automated reporting have data management difficulties that are labor intensive. NeoPOSE will ease the data transmission process while improving its accuracy, thus decreasing manual labor associated with data management and also providing more reliable data to guide future CCHD screening research and quality improvements. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of noninvasive blood flow measurement technology for improved timely detection of Critical Congenital Heart Defects (CCHD). In their current form, oxygen saturation (SpO2) blood flow measurements cannot be used clinically for this purpose.

The discipline of synthetic biology applies this understanding to practical problems within a framework of engineering design principles. This project will use this framework to apply recent advances in understanding mechanisms of gene expression in plants to improve agronomic and nutritional traits, and to foster the use of plants as ?green? factories for pharmaceuticals and other beneficial biochemicals. Foundational principles inferred from basic research will be used to design genetic ?parts? to optimize the expression of genes that confer beneficial properties. This project will also provide research training for undergraduate and postdoctoral students, and it will engage at-risk high school students in hands-on workshops in nutritional biochemistry as part of a broader program at the University of Oregon that aims to encourage such students to enroll and succeed in college.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop tools for metabolic engineering, biotechnology, and enhancement of agronomic traits in plants. Many such applications require expression of multiple genes, with optimal outcomes depending upon their suitably balanced expression. The chloroplast genetic system offers particular promise as a chassis for the expression of multiprotein assemblies and multi-enzyme metabolic pathways because chloroplast genes are naturally expressed in operon-like polycistronic transcription units, they do not experience epigenetic effects, and they can achieve very high expression levels. A current limitation, however, is a paucity of characterized genetic elements to program predictable expression over a wide dynamic range, especially for the purpose of multigene applications. This project aims to fill this gap by leveraging recent advances in (i) understanding mechanisms that determine expression levels in natural chloroplast operons, (ii) elucidating the basis for sequence-specific RNA recognition by pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, which are key to this regulation, and (iii) cataloging translational efficiencies of native chloroplast genes. This deep knowledge base will be used for the rational design of a palette of cis-elements and cognate trans-factors to achieve predictable, regulatable, and suitably tuned gene outputs in synthetic multigene transcription units.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although it occurs in every kingdom of life, one of the most familiar and beautiful examples is the snail shell.  The diversification of the snail shell is thought to be related to the abundance and success of this group of animals (the second largest phylum in terms of species number, after arthropods).  With ocean temperatures increasing worldwide, there is also an urgent need to understand how shells form and grow to protect aquaculture species like oysters, clams, and mussels.  Shells begin forming during development, when shell gland cells express a suite of transcription factor proteins that in turn regulate shell matrix proteins; matrix proteins form a scaffold that controls calcium carbonate crystalization.  This project examines shell matrix formation using a well-studied marine snail, Crepidula.  Taking advantage of tools to modify the genome of this species, this project examines which specific transcription factors control matrix protein production, and how they influence shell structure and growth. These studies will be the first of their kind among molluscs.  Another innovative aspect of this project is that matrix proteins will be studied in the living animal.  The research will be brought into the classroom as part of an inquiry-based laboratory course where undergraduates, graduate students, and high school students can study mollusc shell development and test their own hypotheses.  <br/><br/>Although much is known about the biomaterial properties, micro-structure, and evolution of molluscan shells, major questions remain about how they are made during the process of development.  The overarching goal of this project is to make the first comprehensive study of the expression and function of extracellular matrix proteins embedded in the shell of the marine snail Crepidula atrasolea.  Aim 1 will uncover the spatiotemporal expression patterns of shell gland-expressed regulatory genes and mantle tissue-expressed matrix genes, using scRNAseq, in situ hybridization, and proteomics.  Aim 2 will use lineage tracing to show how the shell gland cells mature into the adult mantle tissue, and use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to make matrix protein-GFP fusions to study shell formation in vivo.  Aim 3 will identify the upstream regulators of matrix proteins, and knock them down to test their function.  This work will lead to the first bona fide gene regulatory network (GRN) for biomineralization in a mollusc.

Significant to this project is the realization that many students do not begin college knowing their long-term career aspirations. This project intends to lay the foundation to enable students who decide to become teachers later in their college years to successfully pursue teaching certification without significant additional time to degree.  In addition to providing the principal investigators with information they can use to create and submit a Noyce proposal, this Capacity Building project may yield information to encourage similar efforts across Wisconsin and the nation. <br/><br/>This project is a partnership between St. Norbert?s College, a four-year private Catholic Liberal Arts College, and Northeast Wisconsin Technical School (NWTS), a two-year public college that prepares students for careers in science and technology. The project goals include development of: (1) a pathway for geology, physics, mathematics, computer science, environmental science or chemistry majors to obtain an undergraduate minor leading to Wisconsin state education licensure; (2) a general education introductory course that satisfies licensing requirements, with a teaching-focused field experience; (3) a strong partnership with NWTS leading to transfer students matriculating to St. Norbert's College; and (4) strengthening community partnerships to increase the number of qualified STEM teachers. This Capacity Building project proposes to build a pathway to teaching for STEM majors starting at NWTS. In addition to creating a minor in education, the project?s intellectual merit includes the creation of a single class that satisfies general education requirements, provides foundational knowledge on adolescent development requisite for licensure, and provides students with an extensive internship experience to aid them in discerning if STEM teaching is an appropriate career trajectory. The project?s broader impacts include the creation of a model that can be adopted by other institutions for the purpose of providing a low-risk entrance into STEM education experiences. The work will be evaluated through targeted formative and summative evaluation that involves qualitative and quantitative approaches.  Work will be disseminated through national, local and regional channels for institutions with similar licensure requirements. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

This project specifically seeks to extract deeper insights into the environmental information preserved in one of the most commonly used geochemical proxies: the sulfur isotope composition of pyrite, a mineral commonly formed in marine sediments. It has become apparent that the traditional analysis of the bulk isotopic composition of pyrite in sediments is inadequate because it averages environmental information contained within individual pyrite grains. However, by analyzing a representative suite of individual pyrite grains in sediments, investigators propose that they can distinguish both the direct imprint of biological activity and the degree of subsequent overprinting acquired after sediment deposition.  This grain-specific approach can transform the ability to distinguish between competing biological and environmental processes that together give rise to the more commonly measured bulk geobiological signatures.  This work will include mentoring of an undergraduate as part of the Students and Teachers as Research Scientists (STARS) Program, which offers incoming high-school seniors an opportunity to work within a laboratory research setting. In addition to gaining experience using cutting-edge techniques, the students are taught to express the results and significance of their research orally and in a research paper.<br/><br/>Reconstructions of past environmental conditions and biological activity are often based on stable isotope proxies whose interpretations are inherently non-unique. In this project, researchers will develop and refine a new approach centered upon integrating traditional bulk (cm-scale) measurements of pyrite with micron-scale in-situ analyses in a petrographic context using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). They hypothesize that acquiring the individual sulfur isotopic values from a representative population of pyrite grains within each sample will enable a more rigorous reconstruction of depositional environments and, for the first time, distinguish between biological controls (i.e., isotopic fractionation during microbial sulfur cycling) and environmental controls (e.g., impact of sedimentation rate, organic carbon loading, etc.) that regulate the diffusive exchange between porewaters and the overlying water column. They seek to characterize and minimize any offset between the bulk value and the SIMS average, which could arise from several sources related to grain size, insufficient sampling density of individual pyrites, intragrain isotopic variability, or analytical artifacts in SIMS. They will demonstrate the technical feasibility of this approach and address the theoretical soundness of the hypothesis by analyzing samples from two contrasting systems: methane-seep sediments from Santa Monica Basin and mid-Pleistocene sediments from the Crotone Basin, Italy. In the former, the depositional environment has been stable and the porewater redox gradient is known, providing a control to investigate potentially variable biological fractionation and whether textural differences are diagnostic of different precipitation mechanisms. Samples in the latter location represent a wide range of depositional environments, exhibit large variations in the bulk slfur isotope values (-44 to +24?), and include a wide range in petrographic textures and pyrite grain size and shape. Specific outcomes that will make this microanalytical approach more robust include: developing a mathematical algorithm to predict the sampling size (n) needed to accurately represent a sample distribution given the bulk sulfur isotope value and number of textures observed in SEM, refining their protocols to allow for analysing smaller grains while retaining < 1? precision, developing an iterative ion imaging-sputtering method to incrementally analyze the 3D structure of grains and isolate any oxidized rims that may contribute to artifacts. The successful development and testing of this approach will provide a framework that allows for the unique identification of biological fractionation during microbial sulfur cycling as well as the degree to which the associated sediments have been impacted by closed-system processes during pyrite formation. This transformative framework could be widely applied to a host of geobiological problems in modern environments and the sedimentary record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The neural network architecture that is present in many of these methods has some universal approximation properties that allow users to apply software tools with minimal preprocessing of data or tailoring of algorithms to the specifications of the problem.  However, in most instances where ML works well, mathematical analysis does not yet offer a satisfactory answer to the fundamental question: Why is a machine learning method so effective for solving this problem?  The aim of this project is to investigate how ML methods can be applied to solving non-Markov dynamic programs (DPs), and to answer this fundamental question for some specific problems in this area.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/><br/>The investigator analyzes a new method for solving non-Markov DPs, wherein a policy-approximation function is obtained by training a system of neural networks.  The main idea is similar to recently-developed methods for solving high-dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), wherein the so-called Deep BSDE Solver learns a function of a high-dimensional input to approximate the optimal control for a Markovian DP.  The aims of this project differ from those of other work because the focus is non-Markov DPs and the hurdles that come from path dependence.  Issues that are explored in depth include the level of accuracy needed in the training set generated by a Monte Carlo particle method, and the role that implicit regularization plays in the TensorFlow algorithms.  The project also considers more conventional theoretical concepts that may provide proof of this method's general effectiveness, such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation for continuous functions and the types of sigmoidal functions used in neural networks.  The results contribute to an improved theoretical understanding of the mathematics behind Deep BSDE when applied to DPs with nonlinear filtering, and help answer important questions regarding the method?s effectiveness.

The terahertz frequency range is relatively underdeveloped part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which resides between the infrared and microwave. In past research, this team demonstrated a new laser architecture that addressed the challenge of how to generate high power THz light simultaneously with high beam quality, known as the THz quantum-cascade vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser. The goal of this research is how to adapt this laser architecture to create a so-called ?mode-locked? terahertz laser. In such a laser, instead of emitting steady continuous light, the laser would emit a series of extremely short high-intensity light pulses at regular intervals. While mode-locked lasers are ubiquitous in the visible and infrared wavelengths, they have proven very difficult to implement for terahertz lasers. Work will focus on several approaches to adapt the vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser approach, including coaxing the laser to emit many wavelengths at once, controlling the speed of propagation of all of these various wavelengths within the laser cavity, and introducing a fast ?saturable absorber? switch into the laser cavity to encourage these various wavelengths to travel in lock-step so that they all constructively interfere to create a short pulse. If successful, this research would result in a new terahertz source for applications in the fields of astrophysics, atmospheric science, biological and medical sciences, security screening, illicit material detection, combustion science, antiquities, waste-sorting, next-generation wireless communications, and non-destructive evaluation. As a part of the project, the research will train graduate and undergraduate students, and will support recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities to engineering through participation in a targeted research project course.<br/>Technical description<br/>The research goal of this proposal is the development of active and passive mode-locked terahertz quantum-cascade lasers that emit picosecond pulses based upon the metasurface vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser (VECSEL) concept. Two primary schemes will be investigated: active mode-locking in which the gain metasurface is modulated via radiofrequency (RF) electrical injection at the round trip frequency, and passive/hybrid mode-locking where a fast saturable absorber is used with optional RF loss modulation. The enabling component of the VECSEL is a reflectarray metasurface made up of sub-wavelength antenna-coupled microcavities loaded with laser gain material; this creates an active amplifying mirror which serves as one mirror in an open cavity. The intellectual merit in the proposed work lies in the use of the metasurface VECSEL architecture to investigate mode-locked terahertz lasers. Such a configuration gives the possible of engineering the metasurface to achieve broadband gain and dispersion compensation; furthermore the external cavity allows power combining for high-power output along with control of the cavity repetition rate. Additionally, the external cavity will allow integration of a fast saturable absorber, which can be separately optimized to have a fast recovery time while the quantum-cascade active material is optimized to have a long gain recovery time. The broader impacts are addressed at several levels including undergraduate and graduate research experiences, dissemination of results, technology advancement, and outreach to underrepresented minorities. Outreach will specifically occur through development of research projects for a course designed for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority first-year engineering students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the goals of mitigating traffic congestions, improving transportation safety, and reducing vehicle emissions, many smart mobility applications require accurate, reliable, and timely traffic information as input. To meet such needs, this project will lay the foundation of machine learning and traffic flow theory to yield better estimations and predictions of mobility patterns. The method uses transportation domain knowledge to regularize the training process of machine learning. The results will significantly enhance the effectiveness and robustness of those smart mobility applications at both small and large scales. The research activities can be closely integrated with a set of education and outreach activities that include (i) developing a virtual computing lab to facilitate student educations, researcher engagement, government employee training, and industry collaboration, (ii) modernizing the transportation curriculum with research outcomes, (iii) broadening the participation of k-12 students in the annual summer ?Transportation Camps? and underrepresented students in the Artificial Intelligence club of a minority-serving institution. Those activities will help transportation students better recognize the importance of engineering knowledge in the era of smart mobility system.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to contribute fundamental theories and a set of markedly improved algorithms to traffic flow modeling. Leveraging the concept of physics regularized machine learning, the research could encode both continuous and discretized traffic flow models into Gaussian process for training regularization. This new model can efficiently resolve the common data sparsity and noise issues and facilitate various smart mobility applications. To accommodate streaming data, this project will also develop a novel physics regularized streaming learning framework that can efficiently improve the model performances in real-time. When dealing with big data, this project can further synergize data of different resolutions, fidelities, and sources to enable sparse Gaussian process and Bayesian committee machine for fast learning.

The information recorded in the dataset includes the value of the taxed property and the amounts of tax revenue raised the number of public and private schools, teachers, and pupils in those schools; their finances by revenue source; the number of libraries and newspapers printed; and the prevailing wages paid to different kinds of labor. Utilizing this data, the project considers potential mechanisms to understand how internal migration affected local schooling choices. <br/><br/>The project explores how migration from more educated states affect school enrollment rates for the local population. The project builds on the notion that inequality in school enrollments can be explained by the origins of migrants who chose to live in a given county. Accordingly, internal migration was an important channel in the spread of schools in the US. Using detailed historical data, the project examines specific channels through which migrants from more educated states improved the schooling outcomes of the locals. The project particularly focuses on the funding of schools through property taxes to consider that migrants from states with functioning public systems can be instrumental for more public funding for schools in their destinations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Part of the clean energy equation involves the capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced from the combustion of fossil resources.  The project further supports progress towards low carbon emission chemical manufacturing by exploring electrochemical conversion of CO2 to small building-block molecules used widely in the manufacture of a broad range of chemical and fuel products.  The study focuses on novel catalyst designs that promote highly localized electric fields, thus potentially enabling more efficient energy utilization and greater CO2 conversion efficiency than obtained with conventional catalyst designs.  The project also incorporates clean-energy related educational and outreach activities targeted at both pre-college and college level students. <br/><br/>A high electric field can rearrange the electronic orbitals of chemical species and alter the electronic interactions between adsorbates and catalytic surfaces. This influences the thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanisms of (electro)catalytic reactions. The project investigates the effects of local electric fields and exposed-surface sites on the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) to C2 products.  The concept is investigated using a combination of atomic-scale simulations, electrocatalyst synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and electrocatalytic performance testing. The catalyst is prepared from a bifunctional thiol-based monolayer (e.g., -S-CnH2n-NH2) immobilized onto a Cu nanowire (NW) array. This catalytic structure enhances local electric fields due to opposing charges in the head and tail functional groups of the monolayer. Surface coverage of thiol molecules is simultaneously tuned to expose Cu step and defect sites.  Effectiveness of the combined approach for accelerating CO2RR-to-C2 will be evaluated by (1) deriving relationships between thiol composition/structure and local field strength, (2) determining the thiol surface coverage effects on exposed Cu sites, and (3) investigating the performance and stability of the bifunctional organic monolayer modified Cu NWs under reaction conditions. In parallel with the research, the investigators will involve both graduate students and undergraduate students in their research, and participate in the Immersive Scholar Program at UMass Lowell to promote undergraduate research, including women and underrepresented minorities. The investigators will also convey the importance of clean energy technology and modular electrocatalysis into outreach activities for K-9 students and distribution via various educational media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At present, however, wide deployment of medical ultrasound for disease detection and monitoring has been limited by rigid sensor geometries. On one hand, rigid sensor geometries are generally considered desirable, as known geometries facilitate coherent beamformation and image reconstruction. On the other hand, however, rigid sensors do not accommodate body surface curvature, necessitating the application of sensor pressure by a skilled operator during imaging. This compression-based process of image acquisition, termed ?sonography,? requires considerable skill, in turn increasing interoperator variability. Moreover, the need to have an operator apply pressure is incompatible with wearable technology, greatly limiting the scope and utility of medical ultrasound technology. The aim of this proposed research is to address the core unmet need described above, which is the development of a novel class of conformable ultrasound systems that would enable insights into soft tissue biology presently not possible owing to a lack of suitable instrumentation. The system has the potential to complement mammographic imaging by providing tissue characterization data that would facilitate optimal use of scarce breast cancer care resources. This work will be particularly relevant to developing nations, where a shortage of qualified ultrasound operators and related infrastructure greatly limits access to care. The proposed interdisciplinary project will be integrated with educational and outreach activities, including development of new courses geared towards disseminating new microfabrication techniques outside of the traditional physics and material science communities to increase interest and engagement in STEAM fields and to proliferate the study of piezoelectric systems at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education levels.<br/> <br/>Obtaining sufficient contact over soft surfaces of large areas (i.e., shoulder, breast) or small joints (i.e., finger joints, wrist joints) is not achievable, due to the rigid planar design of the ultrasound transducer versus the typical curvilinear shape of body parts. The human breast presents a particular challenge, as its geometry and deformability are highly variable not only between subjects but also at different times and ages within a given subject. At the same time, breast cancer is the most common cancer and such cancers are typically located within the expected penetration depth of sonography. As a result, there is an opportunity to develop technology for longitudinal imaging of breast lesions both for cancer diagnostic and early detection purposes and also serve as a new non-invasive window into the biological behavior of breast tumors. The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop conformable phased array ultrasound patches for soft tissue imaging over large-area, curvilinear regions by introducing a novel system design and microfabrication strategy, along with a framework and advanced algorithms to reconstruct spatiotemporally-accurate images that could be applied to any human body parts. The challenges that will be addressed during the course of the project include: 1) Development of large-area, conformable phased array transducer design, 2) Spatiotemporally-accurate 3-D image reconstruction from highly curvilinear body parts, 3) In vivo, real-time actuation and sensing on both in vitro on mock tissue phantoms and in vivo in a limited human trial focused on the detection, localization, and characterization of breast lesions. The proposed work will build upon the PI's interdisciplinary expertise and experience in piezoelectric, microfabricated biomedical devices and conformable systems. The proposed system will provide interfaces that enable next-generation features of wearable technologies, such as accurate, real-time and autonomous monitoring of any soft tissue for 3-D imaging, and machine learning strategies to detect disease progression in an objective manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From this simple arrangement of objects, we might suspect that someone was using the chair, left temporarily, and intends to return. Situations where we extract social information from our physical surroundings are commonplace: we hang rope across entrances to signal people should not walk through, we mark trees to indicate hiking trails, and we leave our office doors ajar to reveal we are available. This project will use a combination of computational modeling and behavioral studies to understand how people read social signals from their physical environment. Characterizing how people extract social information from their physical surroundings is critical for understanding how humans seamlessly coordinate and cooperate with each other, even in the absence of direct communication or physical interactions. The results also have implications for the goal of instantiating human social intelligence in machines. For example, there have been remarkable advances in robot navigation, but these algorithms do not yet represent the social information in physical environments, treating them as devoid of social meaning.<br/><br/>The proposed project will answer three questions: What aspects of the physical world contain social information for humans? How do we infer what produced this information? And how do we determine what it means? To answer these questions, the investigator will combine advances in computational models of social reasoning and computational models of physical reasoning to determine how these two cognitive systems interact with each other. Specifically, the investigator will build computational models that jointly reason about how people?s mental states lead to different behaviors and how these behaviors leave observable traces in the environment. The model?s behavior will be compared with data from human participants to determine the extent to which the model can capture and replicate human reasoning. Computational tools will be developed with the parallel goals of producing high-quality open-source libraries that are widely accessible to all students interested in computational cognitive science. Software will be complemented with extensive tutorials showing how to implement various classical models, created by the investigator in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the world's oceans. Waterfront maintenance workers face the brunt of the marine trash pollution issue as 80% of marine trash is sourced near-shore. As a result, waterfront governments alone spend a total of $10.2 billion to clean these waterways. The proposed technology benefits ecosystems by removing trash pollution from our shores, thereby preventing ecosystem degradation and allowing people to both benefit from marine services now and in the future. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project introduces the use of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) to maximize debris cleanup performance and provide affordable solutions to cleaning these waterways. Solutions are being developed to address the oceanic plastic pollution problem once the debris is already in the ocean; however, insufficient effort is directed towards improving shoreline pickup, which contains 80% of plastic debris. Human-operated methods to collect the debris is inefficient and cost ineffective. This opens the door to expand USV technology to waterway maintenance. Similarly, USV environmental monitoring capabilities may provide data to the waterways and researchers such as oxygen monitoring for algae blooms and affordable data capture. The team currently has a working prototype and partnerships at the Jacobs School of Engineering and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The I-Corps customer discovery activities will reveal the exact pain points experienced in these waterways to inform the proposed technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly speaking, a coherent structure is a well-defined feature in fluid flow that can be easily distinguished and mathematically described in a simple manner. One example is a vortex, where all fluid particles rotate about a single point. Another example is a sharp front, which may arise when a fluid consists of warm and cold regions separated by a thin moving transition region.  Many more examples of coherent structures exist in the natural world and we encounter them daily. While it seems to be an extremely formidable problem to give an efficient way to describe general fluid flows, describing the evolution of coherent structures seems to be amenable to mathematical analysis. Moreover, since coherent structures are often observed to be dominant in physical and numerical experiments, describing their evolution is of great importance. A simple question that one could ask in this regard is: What happens to a ""strong"" vortex under small perturbations? Does the vortex persist or does it quickly disintegrate? Another question of interest is whether nice fluid flows can develop coherent structures that possess a singularity, that is, infinite velocity or velocity gradient.  Such questions lie at the core of this project.  <br/><br/>Mathematically, the research focuses primarily on the dynamics of both weak and strong solutions to the incompressible Euler equations and related models. The project investigates a novel approach to the classical problem of finite-time singularity formation in fluids with zero viscosity -- that is, the emergence of certain singular structures in a fluid without external influence. Previous work provided an example of finite-time singularity formation for strong solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in certain settings. Part of the project involves extending and strengthening these results as well as investigating the applicability of the methods to other questions including the dynamics of vortex patches in the 2D Euler equation. Another part of the project studies the stability of certain singular weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equation and related models, specifically, the stability of singular vortices with respect to smoother perturbations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Basic thermodynamics implies that the strongest hurricanes in a cooler climate are weaker than their counterparts in warmer climates, and this strengthening with warming has now been detected in the observed record.  But the strengthening of the strongest storms may be just one of a number of changes in TC activity that result from warming.

Since 2010, there have been variable reductions, especially among African-American parents and youth who have been disproportionately imprisoned for minor drug offenses punished as serious crimes. The economist Glen Loury has observed that ?blackness? had led to ?misattributions detrimental to blacks,? while the sociologists Becky Pettit and Bruce Western has shown that this has made the abnormality of going to prison disproportionately ?normal? for many African-American parents and their children. The present study focuses on the results of disparities in parental incarceration on children. The focus is on children from ages of about 15 to 35, using data from five waves of the National Longitudinal of Study Adolescent and Adult Health [Add Heath]. The analysis concentrates on (a) how state variation in parental incarceration and resulting family trajectories affects their children, (b) the unfolding life experiences of child transitions from youth to adulthood, and (c) the later life course educational and occupational consequences of differences in these parental and youth experiences. <br/><br/>The Add Health data set offers unique possibilities for assessing unfolding life events of parents and children who have experienced variation in profiling and punishment across American states during the recent era of mass incarceration. This study will analyze this mass incarceration era sample of youth from adolescence into adulthood.  Understanding variable consequences of state level policies requires analysis of these states alongside data also collected on the affected individuals, and the Add Health data allow both.  In the past, Add Health has worked with this research team to add new measures of youth and adult crime and the return of parents, as well as their adolescent and young adult children, from prison. The current research will extend this work and uniquely develop new measures with Add Health of the policing and punishment of traffic violations. Traffic violations are uniquely important, for example, when they are disputed as resulting from ?driving while Black.? Analysis of these measures will be of special importance because they can be embedded within the larger multiple wave and national framework of Add Health. The measurement and analysis will further examine how the variable accumulation across states and the sampled individuals of fines and court costs may have damaging consequences for life outcomes that last into and through middle adulthood.  The above additions to the national Add Health data set will be made publicly available for other researchers to analyze as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project advances the state-of-the-art of research in the area of DP, and contributes to privacy education. On the research front, the project develops new algorithms and analytical tools that enable more precise privacy accounting and higher utility in DP. On the education front, the project involves training future leaders in DP areas, creating educational materials and expanding an open-source software library called autodp that makes state-of-the-art differentially private computation more accessible. Collectively, the integrated research and educational activities contribute to ongoing collaborative efforts in building innovative applications of differential privacy.<br/> <br/>The project has three main components in use-inspired fundamental research. The first component unifies the recent breakthroughs in DP, such as, Renyi DP, moments accountant, f-DP and produce an intermediate functional representation that allows lossless conversions among these representations.

Undergraduate students across the nation will work with a group of experienced faculty members and industrial mentors and conduct cutting-edge research in biometrics and authentication during each summer. Biometrics is replacing traditional passwords and becoming the most preferred authentication approach in daily-life scenarios, including mobile applications, banking, and border security. The trend leads to an impressive upsurge in the industry's need to hire scientists and engineers with biometric computing skills. To hardness the biometric technology and meet the increasing industry demand, biometrics and authentication have become a core part of the cybersecurity course curriculum. This REU site will provide a short-term intensive research training experience to a group of undergraduate researchers to prepare them for a career in the field of cybersecurity and benefit their graduate applications and job hunting. Through various activities such as hands-on projects, seminars, demos, presentations, field trips, and other professional development opportunities, undergraduate students will also enhance their professional skills. This REU site aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research activities.<br/><br/>Despite substantial previous efforts, there remain unresolved challenges about the effectiveness and management of systems for biometric recognition, as well as the appropriateness and societal impacts of their use. Moreover, the general public has been exposed to biometrics largely as high-technology gadgets in spy thrillers or as fear instilling instruments of state or corporate surveillance in speculative fiction. The following research problems in biometrics are challenging and unexplored, but of great importance to trustworthy biometrics: new biometric modality, anti-spoofing, cancelability, continuous authentication, and societal acceptance. The problem formulation and solutions will help the community strengthen the understanding of biometrics in individual identification and authentication. Specifically, under the long-term vision of biometrics and authentication, this REU site will focus on the two fundamental research directions on (A) biometric modality and (B) biometric security.

The REU site focuses on research to support emerging trends in cybersecurity, usability, safety and fairness as they pertain to the Internet communication. As the world has all learned from the current Covid-19 pandemic experiences, Internet communication permeates the daily lives. Even before the pandemic, people relied on the Internet for business and entertainment. During the pandemic, this reliance grew to meet education, telemedicine, exercise, governance and many other human needs. It is critical to keep Internet safe and secure for all participants, offering access to reliable and unbiased information. The research at the REU site will also investigate complex and timely issues of fairness in society, leveraging information shared on the Internet.<br/><br/>This REU site intentionally offers a wide spectrum of research themes under the umbrella of ``Safe, Usable, Resilient and Fair Internet,'' to attract diverse student population. The research topics are grouped into three areas: communication infrastructure and cybersecurity, scientific experimentation and knowledge capture, and social data science. The communication and cybersecurity theme tackles several open problems: resilience in the face of natural disasters or targeted cyberattacks, secure communication with cloud servers, detecting emotionally manipulative language in online content and password reuse. These problems have naive solutions. As our reliance on the Internet grows, we need more systematic solutions to increase resilience and security of our communication and protect users from manipulation. The scientific experimentation and knowledge capture theme addresses important problems on data integration, knowledge representation and reusability, entity linking and knowledge discovery that span over multiple domains and are critical to improve scientific products and broaden participation in science. The social data science theme deals with important problems that require AI, data mining, data management and statistics to understand human behavioral patterns and preferences.  Its novel focus on cognitive factors and their impact on communication has already uncovered phenomena that can change the way social networks present information to users, and the way people leverage crowdsourcing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project consists of five research questions that examine macroeconomic implications of micro-level heterogeneity by building macroeconomic models that can be tightly connected to data. The first project is on understanding the conduct of monetary policy when the distributive implications of exchange rates is taken into account. The second project focuses on the optimal use of fiscal and monetary policy. The third project examines the consumer bankruptcy system. The fourth project explores economic adjustments to shifts in the sectoral composition of workforce. The fifth project investigates the recent decline in the employment of the young workforce by gender and skill group. The educational component of the project convenes workshops with graduate students to teach frontier research on solution methods for heterogeneous-agent models. The findings from these research projects will have broad implications for macroeconomic policy.<br/><br/>The proposal consists of five projects that use general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents calibrated to micro data. The first project introduces a Heterogenous-Agent New Keynesian model of a small open economy. In the model, exchange rate depreciations increase import prices and lower real income, which can in turn lower domestic output and employment. This is a contractionary effect absent in standard models with profound implications for the transmission of monetary policy. The second project provides a general method to solve for the optimal policy response to aggregate shocks in heterogeneous-agent economies. The third project studies the automatic stabilizer role of the consumer bankruptcy system in a model in which consumers face incomplete markets with an option to default on their debts. The fourth project builds a dynamic model of labor supply with adjustment costs to study the effects of sectoral demand shocks. The fifth project uses a model of skill acquisition with heterogeneity in ability to understand the observed changes over time in the elasticity of labor supply of the workforce by gender and skill group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research in this project links experiments to understand how mating behaviors are formed with models that build on those findings to make predictions at the level of populations and diverging lineages. The subject of the behavioral experiments is the strawberry poison frog, a species that shows striking diversity in coloration and for which color-assortative behaviors are known to be shaped by learning. The theoretical models developed in each objective will broaden the project?s findings by asking how different types of mating traits and learning that are found in other animals affect the likelihood of speciation.

The major categories of crimes for which lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can be removed are broad and amorphous, and for undocumented individuals, any conviction can lead to removal. Research has shown that racial and ethnic disparities profoundly impact the criminal justice system, adding to the risk of negative outcomes for Black and Latino immigrants in particular. We advance the concept of the ?criminal deportation pipeline? to describe the intertwining criminal and immigration system processes that funnel certain immigrants toward removal. The study, drawing on the disciplines of sociology and criminology, focuses on the factors which shape and constitute this pipeline. Highlighting racial, ethnic and spatial disparities in criminal justice and immigration enforcement, as well as local policies and practices that aid immigrants targeted for expulsion, the study will demonstrate the pipeline?s functional presence in this iconic city of immigrants as well as factors that define its impact and character. The results of the research will contribute to the public debate on immigration policy and human rights reform while deepening our understanding of the relationship between citizenship, the law, and policing practices that have so impacted racialized immigrant communities. <br/><br/>Informed by theories of social exclusion and criminalization, particularly along the vectors of race, as well as the field of resistance, the study is oriented by the following research questions: (i) How do local patterns of non-immigration-related criminal justice enforcement shape the flow of the criminal deportation pipeline?; (ii) How do protective legal policies and practices affect the function of the criminal deportation pipeline?; and (iii) How do immigrants experience and respond to overlapping processes of criminalization and deportation? We will examine these questions using a mixed methods research design that combines 120 hours of targeted observation of deportation proceedings; secondary analysis of official documents and administrative government datasets; and 120 in-depth interviews with affected immigrants, legal practitioners, and community-based advocates. Research will expand upon preliminary spatial analysis of high deportation areas in order to: (i) better understand how spatial, racial, and ethnic patterns in policing shape processes of criminal deportation; (ii) assess the function and impacts of protective legal policies, and (iii) identify the experiences of immigrants facing deportation with criminal records, as well as the impacts of overlapping criminal and immigration.

These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. There are two ideas about how these patterns might form. The ?positional specification? model is that the patterns are created by a set of genes being turned on in specific locations in a controlled fashion. The ?reaction-diffusion? model is that patterns can arise from a self-organizing system of interacting genes. According to this second model, the location of each pattern component is determined by random fluctuations in one gene?s activity level. Other genes in the network respond to the first gene to create the elements needed for making a unit of the pattern. Some traits, such as petal spots in the monkeyflower genus Mimulus, appear to depend on both types of pattern formation. This petal-spot system is being used to study both positional specification and reaction-diffusion, and how they interact to create new, complex patterns in nature. The collaborative project creates research opportunities for one Ph.D. student and eighteen undergraduates. Three high school students will be recruited from a public school in rural Walla Walla, WA that specifically serves youth not routinely exposed to scientific experiences.<br/> <br/>Previous work in Mimulus has established that nectar guide spots of red anthocyanin pigment are formed in a manner consistent with a reaction-diffusion system. The discovery of elaborate spot patterns in the petal lobes of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus hybrids creates a unique opportunity to examine (a) whether this reaction-diffusion system explains floral patterning in Mimulus more generally, (b) whether positional cues originating from petal vasculature shape these patterns, and (c) how the inter-genomic interactions associated with hybridization can generate novel phenotypes not seen in either parent species. The researchers will first develop a reaction-diffusion model that recreates the distribution of anthocyanin spotting phenotypes observed in a hybrid F2 genetic mapping population. They will test this model by examining the diverse sets of homozygous genotypes present in a Recombinant Inbred Line population, and by using transgenic manipulation to alter the expression of key genes in the anthocyanin regulatory network. Finally, they will investigate the hypothesis that petal vasculature influences the location of spot formation. This will be achieved by using digital image analysis and spatial statistics to test for correlations between spot and vein locations, and experimentally manipulating vein development through chemical and transgenic perturbations to test for effects on spot formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pace of these changes can lead to rapid shifts in the structure of marine communities due to changes in the distribution, abundance, and diversity of species. This collaborative project is among the first to examine the consequences of deoxygenation on coral reefs, which are sentinel ecosystems for studying ecological responses to global change because of their importance to human society, sensitivity to stress, and intricate relationships among their inhabitants. Specifically, the research team investigates why and how some coral species are more tolerant than others and the role that bacteria associated with the corals have in such tolerance. This predictive understanding is important to support conservation and management efforts by identifying stress-tolerant coral species and establishing indicators for assessment of hypoxia stress. The project provides training for multiple undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Findings from this project are disseminated  through undergraduate and graduate courses taught at the University of Florida, a teacher training program at the Bocas del Toro Research Station at STRI in Panama, a workshop in Panama to build a community of scientists and informed practitioners, and webinars, toolkits, and other resources communicated through established networks of coral conservation and management practitioners. <br/><br/>Understanding the responses of coral reefs to ocean deoxygenation is limited to a few post hoc assessments of how unanticipated hypoxic events have impacted macrofauna. This project employs a predictive approach to examine the resilience of coral reef communities to ocean deoxygenation by examining both corals and their associated microbiomes. Complimentary manipulative laboratory and field experiments and surveys along natural gradients of hypoxic stress are being used to answer the following three fundamental questions about how variation in the tolerance of corals and their microbiomes predicts the resilience of reefs to deoxygenation: (1) How does the physiological response of the coral to hypoxia predict community shifts in the microbiome with deoxygenation? (2) To what degree do corals and their microbiomes show evidence of acclimatization to reduced oxygen, and how do these functional shifts confer increased resistance to subsequent hypoxic stress? (3) How are the feedbacks between coral hosts and their microbiomes apparent in the recovery of coral communities from hypoxia and patterns of community structure at the seascape scale? This project aims at developing a mechanistic and predictive understanding of coral reef community responses to ocean deoxygenation by examining stability and resilience at two levels of ecological organization: the assemblage of coral species at the reef scale, and the assemblage of microbes at the holobiont scale. Moreover, this study examines how those responses are coupled by feedbacks at the colony scale through coral physiological responses and microbial functional shifts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy and momentum transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean through wind-wave generation is ultimately dissipated by waves. The resulting turbulence in the upper ocean causes mixing, and in the nearshore momentum transfer can force currents. Improved understanding of the bubble and foam formation processes during wave breaking is needed to better understand the impacts of wave breaking. The goal of this project is to develop and utilize a remote sensing technique to study bubble plume formation and associated wave breaking energy dissipation by exploiting the thermal signature of cooling residual foam left behind by the breaking process. A large-scale, outdoor laboratory experiment will be conducted to evaluate the technique for field-scale breaking waves and explore the effect of wave breaking type, breaking strength, and bubble distribution.<br/><br/>The investigators hypothesize that the time from when breaking begins to when the residual foam starts to cool provides a measure of both the bubble plume decay time and depth, which can be used to determine bubble characteristics and evaluate existing plume models related to the wave energy dissipation rate. Prior results indicate that the foam cooling time can be used to map the spatial variability of bubble plume depth and thus provide the spatially varying bubble plume volume. This project will use thermal infrared (IR) imagery and ancillary measurements to investigate and further establish these relationships. The resulting ability to remotely quantify bubble plume properties and energy dissipation due to wave breaking will provide a new and transformative tool for investigating and understanding the air-sea interaction processes driven by wave breaking in the open ocean and the surf zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Then personal computers ""moved in"" with users, and eventually mobile devices moved computing into users' pockets. More recently, wearable devices have brought computing into constant physical contact with the user's skin, which allows these devices to sense more of the user and act in a more personal manner.  The main question that drives this project is: what is the next interface paradigm that supersedes wearable devices? To study the next generation of human-computer interaction, this research will create new devices that stimulate a wide range of bodily senses, such as smell, temperature, and skin sensations, to inform the engineering of the technology we will use in the future to communicate with each other and with data.  While some posit that the next step will be to implant the interface within our bodies, much like what is already being done with pacemakers and insulin pumps, this project instead focuses on how new devices will integrate with the user's biological senses and actuators.  This body-device integration approach will allow the engineering of interactive devices that intentionally ""borrow"" parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body (for example, interactive systems based on electrical muscle stimulation that are able to move the user's muscles using computer-controlled electrical impulses and thereby to achieve the functionality of haptic devices such as exoskeletons without the bulky motors).  In particular, the work will develop new hardware for the senses of smell, temperature and touch, and will test applications in accessibility (for smell-impaired individuals) and skill-acquisition.  The work will leverage collaborations with neuroscience to ensure that project outcomes ultimately have broad impact by enabling the creation of more realistic and natural interactions, which are especially important for the success of virtual and augmented reality.<br/><br/>To these ends, three classes of challenges must be tackled.  (1) Hardware layer: devices that output to the body will require new types of actuators smaller than those found in wearables, and the project will realize this by leveraging the user's senses and actuators, respectively, for input and output.  (2) User layer: devices that influence the user's biology provide benefits (for instance, they can accelerate the user's reaction time) but also reduce the user's sense of agency, so the project will develop interaction techniques that prioritize the user's sense of agency while retaining the benefits of using the interactive device.  (3) Application layer: for any new interface paradigm to succeed requires determining in which application areas it performs well and why.  Special attention will be paid to investigating the effects of the new technology on accessibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Internal gravity waves are thought to be responsible for the bulk of turbulence production, dissipation and mixing in the stratified ocean interior. The cutting-edge one-way nesting approach would represent energy cascades realistically, in terms of the scales those cascades preferentially occupy. The goal is to examine the importance of isotropic vs. anisotropic turbulence and dissipation, which will transform the understanding of mixing. This is a necessary step to inform and improve modeling of heat and carbon storage and transport within the ocean. The project will involve high school and undergraduate interns recruited from local programs targeting under-represented minorities, focusing on gaining experience in manipulating, analyzing and visualizing large datasets.

The energy cascade would be tracked from wind-forced near-inertial waves in the surface mixed-layer through refraction and trapping in a baroclinic anticyclone, downward radiation into the pycnocline, critical-layer amplification at the vortex base, instability producing turbulence, and the cascade to dissipation. The coordinated set of simulations will produce a dynamically-coupled flow field consisting of mesoscale eddies, submesoscale filaments, near-inertial and higher frequency internal waves, shear-driven instabilities, and isotropic turbulent motions at sub-Ozmidov scales, allowing an oceanographically realistic energy cascade from the meso- to turbulent scales to be studied in detail. The work will test dynamical hypotheses linking disparate scales of motion that cannot be feasibly addressed in stand-alone simulations.

The energy sector is ramping up its digital transformation process as other sectors (e.g. automotive or information technology) have already seen tremendous progress in digitalization. Over the next five years, the markets for traditional drilling tools and digital oilfields are expected to reach $5 billion and $30 billion, respectively. Furthermore, with the increasing clean energy demand and regulations regarding eco-friendliness, the global geothermal energy market is projected to reach $9 billion by 2025, with a significant share held by North America. The proposed, automated, self-guided drilling tool targets this market to reduce the public, environmental, and economic hazards associated with deep oil and geothermal well development. Improved drilling operations will keep the overall drilling rig's footprint low, significantly minimizing sidetracks and non-productive time. Consequently, the intended semi-autonomous process will ultimately reduce costs and energy consumption resulting in more environment-friendly drilling and improved safety.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of technology stemming from previously funded drilling automation research. The proposed self-guided drilling tool is superior by at least two automation levels compared to the current market tools, resulting in significant cost savings and improved safety.  Developing a tailored prototype and a functional tool requires a much better understanding of potential customer needs. This I-Corps project aims to discover critical customer needs through comprehensive customer interviews to guide prototype development.

The goal of the proposed technology is to promote a culture of quality and patient safety by supporting administrative and clinical partnerships as they transition toward a goal of operationalizing High Reliability Organizational Hallmarks in healthcare. This change in culture may reduce the incidence of avoidable medical errors, and as a result, may make healthcare more affordable for the general population.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of software that seeks to both increase the reporting of near-miss and safety incidents by clinicians and the utilization of these reports by administrators to make informed system-level improvements in healthcare based on High Reliability Organizational (HRO) theory.

But the same characteristics that draw us in leave lakes vulnerable to human activities that can damage these environments, and in some cases, cause large, abrupt, and undesirable ecological changes. The goal of the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research Program (NTL-LTER) is to understand how and why lakes change over time and determine the consequences of these changes. For 40 years, the NTL-LTER has studied two sets of Wisconsin lakes and their surrounding landscapes. One group of lakes is located in the rural, forested, and tourist-dominated Northern Highland Lake District in northern Wisconsin and the other is situated in the agricultural and urban landscape around Madison, Wisconsin?s state capitol. Studying these two distinct groups of lakes and being able to document changes occurring over several decades provides essential information about how different types of lakes in different settings are affected by phenomena such as shifting climate conditions, urban expansion, the arrival of invasive species, harmful algal blooms, or changes in environmental policies. These research activities, in turn, improve current understanding and management of lakes, benefitting anyone concerned with the future of the region, its freshwater resources, and the welfare of its residents. Results are also integrated into multiple K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education activities. The NTL-LTER program is committed to supporting diversity in science, and to outreach efforts that communicate scientific findings to interested individuals, non-governmental organizations, academics, and local, state, tribal and federal agencies.<br/> <br/>New research activities will build on NTL-LTER?s strong foundation of long-term observations and deep ecological understanding of north temperate lakes to address the overarching question: What are the causes and consequences of abrupt ecological change in lakes and their surrounding landscapes? Research activities are organized around a central framework of abrupt ecological change intended to reveal mechanisms that lead to abrupt ecological changes in lakes, and involve studies inspired by four focal questions: (1) What are lake phenological responses to a warmer and more variable climate that may lead to abrupt ecological change? (2) How do interactions of land use and long-term climate change affect urban aquatic ecosystems? (3) How do external drivers interact with aquatic invasive species to regulate water quality? And (4) What causes intentional ecosystem manipulations to persist, revert, or lead to novel states? These questions consider ecological changes from organisms to ecosystems and provide potent opportunities to test, modify, and expand hypotheses regarding the causes and consequences of abrupt ecological change that are broadly relevant across diverse ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two algorithmic innovations, referred to as Innovation A and Innovation B, have been developed.  Algorithmic Innovation A is designed to enable UAVs and UUVs to perform autonomous maneuvers that facilitate their passage through narrow orifices that can be stationary or moving. There are multiple scenarios in air and underwater domains where small orifices may occur.  The small size of these orifices requires the maneuverability of the vehicle through the orifice with a high level of precision.

Water reclamation facilities in the U.S. discharge billions of gallons of untreated wastewater into the environment each year due to large storms that cause overflows in their collection systems. Failures in these systems can also result in basement backups of untreated water into citizens' homes, which can cause property damage and risk of serious illnesses. To overcome these challenges, water reclamation facilities rely on sewer flow data to get a picture of what is happening within their pipe networks; however, existing sensors have several shortcomings including inaccurate data, high costs, and an inability to detect low flows. The proposed technology seeks to overcome these challenges through a machine learning and video-based sensor for measuring sewer flows and water quality. This technology has the potential to provide water reclamation facilities with accurate and reliable data across all pipe flow conditions to inform decision-making on costly infrastructure and operations. In addition, by helping to reduce basement backups, this technology has broader social implications as low-income and minority communities are disproportionately affected by flood impacts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a low-cost, video-based sensor to measure flows in sanitary sewer systems using machine learning and spectral analysis. Specifically, the proposed technology captures video of sewer flow and processes using a machine learning algorithm to estimate velocity and water level. In addition, it uses spectral analysis to determine the clarity and color of water that can be used to identify sources of pollutants within the sanitary sewer system. This technology is novel in that for the first-time a video-based sensor is applied to accurately measure flow and water quality in sanitary sewers. The proposed technology has the potential to advance water reclamation operations through less expensive, more reliable, and more accurate data on the magnitude and quality of water flow in sanitary sewers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tantalizing possibility that subtle quantum effects may influence and optimize biological processes presents both an exciting frontier and an extreme challenge to the research community as they seek to understand mechanisms that govern life processes. This project addresses the experimental bottleneck that exists in unambiguously proving, or refuting, hypotheses about quantum effects in living systems. The Instrumentation for Quantum Biology Research Coordination Network (I-QuBio RCN) will bring together a diverse community of scientists from around the world to collaborate on method development for the field known as ?Quantum Biology?. Quantum Biology is a frontier scientific effort, requiring a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers who can communicate across scientific boundaries.

But what happens when disasters keep happening, one after another? How do health care workers cope with the constant demands of disaster conditions? This project documents how health care workers responded to disaster conditions, cared for patients, and worked to rebuild the health care system following a major natural disaster. The research is important because disasters and health emergencies are becoming more frequent and more severe. Therefore, gathering data on how the health care work force responds emotionally to prolonged crisis conditions can aid in designing more effective responses. The broader impacts of this project include the training underrepresented students in anthropology and broadening participation for students underrepresented in science. Data from the project will be disseminated to improve healthcare delivery in post-disaster conditions. This project is jointly funded by Cultural Anthropology, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) <br/><br/>This project examines whether the ethics of healthcare provisioning transform under conditions of ""compounded disaster,"" through an investigation of disaster recovery in Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, and was still operating under conditions of sustained emergency at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The central question of this research is: Did health care workers' experiences during and after Hurricane Maria transform their ethics of care? The ethics of care refers to the practices and self-understanding that guide and motivate those who do the work of caring for others. The investigators hypothesize that health care workers developed a new ethics of care that drew upon pre-existing cultural features, but reflects a new sense of solidarity, greater efficacy, and shared purpose forged in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The investigators anticipate that this new ethics of care has evolved or transformed through compounding disasters including earthquake swarms and COVID-19. The research design includes data collection through individual interviews, remote focus groups, and on-site participant observation. The project contributes to the scientific understanding of the underlying cultural processes through which disasters transform communities; whether compounded disasters have a geometric or exponential impact on these communities; and also, if the ethics of care fundamentally change under these circumstances. This project generates theory to explain the underlying cultural processes through which (1) disasters transform communities and (2) care workers forge practices and self-understandings that aid in the process of disaster recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to enable the possibility of bypassing the bulky and rigid battery systems that currently hinder the evolution of many electronic therapeutic devices toward a wearable system. It may lead to a platform technology providing self-powered and closed-loop electronics as a new wearable or implantable solution for achieving a variety of biomedical functions, such as health monitoring, information gathering, and providing therapeutic treatments.  Further, the self-powered, closed-loop electrostimulation cap may become an effective solution to cure the hair loss problem that plagues many human beings across a broad age range worldwide with an anticipated global market of $12 billion in 2024.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a self-powered, electrostimulation technology that directly converts biomechanical energy from random human body motions into continuous electric pulses without involving any battery or regulative electronics. Due to its unique energy resource and pulsed bi-phasic electricity form, directly applying the generated electricity to achieve certain therapeutic treatments may becomes effective for hair growth. This technology is distinguished from other battery-driven devices by directly coupling the biomedical functions with biomechanical energy sources, forming a closed loop of both energy flow and function feedback. In such a closed-loop electrostimulation, the stimulations are automatically responsive and synchronized to corresponding body motions, and thus impose efficient therapeutic effects without external manipulations. Successful pre-clinical results have been demonstrated self-powered electrostimulation hair regrowth on rats and nude mice. In addition, the results showed that the technology improved the secretion of a few key growth factors related to hair follicle growth, alleviating hair keratin disorder, and increasing the number of active hair follicles.

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years.  However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter.  To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The electron?s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM.  Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding.  The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers.<br/><br/>The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron?s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model.  The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered Mller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals.  The collaborative project described in this proposal will develop subsystem #3; namely the design, construction, and testing of the MOLLER Normalization and Systematic Control apparatus.  The work will be done over the period December 2020 ? November 2024. This includes the tracking system, background detectors, auxiliary asymmetry measurement detectors, and certain aspects of beam monitoring/control and beam polarimetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal of this project is to elucidate the walking and running capabilities of the earliest human ancestors, who ? the human fossil record indicates ? possessed only a subset of these anatomical traits. To achieve this goal, this project will integrate locomotor experiments of humans and chimpanzees with computer simulations using detailed models of the muscle and skeletal anatomies of humans, chimpanzees and Australopithecus afarensis, a ~3.5 million year old human ancestor. This integrative experiment-modeling/simulation approach will establish relationships between anatomical traits and walking and running capabilities. The project will link biological anthropology and computational science research, including the development of new tools that provide a rigorous, quantitative basis for inferring walking and running capabilities from fossils of human ancestors. It will also contribute to education and training at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and include a strong commitment to advancing academic diversity and inclusion. The knowledge generated will be incorporated into an annual biomechanics outreach event for high school students and a workshop providing computer modeling and simulation skills for researchers in biological anthropology. Data, models, and algorithms associated with this project will be shared online with other scientists, educators, and the general public.<br/><br/>Over the past 7 to 8 million years, our muscular, skeletal, and neural systems have been adapted for overground locomotion. How did our lineage become skilled walkers and runners, and what locomotor adaptations occurred among the earliest hominins? This question will be addressed by integrating empirical locomotion data with detailed models of the musculoskeletal system and the latest advances in predictive simulation. First, a comprehensive experimental dataset will be established for the 3-D limb motion, forces, and cost for bipedal chimpanzee and human locomotion at matched speeds. This dataset will be used to validate model-based, predictive simulations of walking and running in both taxa, and evaluate three ecologically-relevant performance criteria, including energy cost, muscle fatigue, and joint loading, as well as a weighted combination of all three. A 3-D model of Au. afarensis will then be used with the best-performing criteria to predict walking and running capabilities for this species, with uncertainty assessed via sensitivity analyses. Together, these data will provide the basis for developing an early hominin-like deformable ape musculoskeletal model to test the hypothesis that lower back and pelvis evolution enhanced bipedal walking and running capabilities as compared to bipedal locomotion in chimpanzees. Finally, a new bi-level predictive simulation approach will be developed for discovering the selective forces that drive anatomical trait evolution in bipedal locomotion. This integrative approach will provide critical information about walking and running capabilities in the earliest hominins that have been unapproachable using comparative fossil-based studies or experimentation alone.

Three hypotheses will be addressed: 1) Rapid gene turnover underlies the species-specific salivary proteome repertoires among mammals. 2) Gene duplications are a major mechanism through which protein dosage and function are fine-tuned in saliva. 3) Secreted proline-rich proteins are natural substrates for novel mucin formation through the expansion of subexonic repeats. This study will provide: 1) the most complete genomic and transcriptomic variation datasets for mammalian salivary glands; 2) a novel methodological framework where long-read sequencing data at the DNA and RNA levels will be integrated; and 3) a comprehensive database of specific genetic variations that will be of considerable evolutionary and biomedical significance for salivary phenotypes, such as lubrication of the oral cavity, breakdown of dietary starch, and host defense against pathogenic microorganisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Language plays a central role in this process. Yet in many cases in natural language, categorization is impossible without further information from the context. Such is the case, for example, with gradable adjectives such as 'tall', where meaning shifts from context to context, and even with nouns. How do children succeed at assembling their lexicon and determining reference when faced with such shifting, context-dependent meanings? This project pursues this question by examining the context-dependence that arises in one of the most basic and earliest-acquired categories: count nouns. The study of such nouns and corresponding concepts has stood at the center of research on infancy, the count/mass and object/substance distinctions, and language typology. Thus, the anticipated results from this research will have broad and interdisciplinary impact. In particular, the findings will offer insights into the ways language and cognition are intertwined in the course of development, and deepen our understanding of how contextual information influences meaning. <br/><br/>This project takes as its starting point a well-established finding that young children allow object fragments to be treated on par with whole objects as referents for corresponding nouns like 'fork' or 'cup'. The key hypothesis of this research is that this apparent non-adult behavior stems from children's difficulties in using contextual information to enrich an inherently context-dependent nominal meaning. A series of behavioral experiments with children and adults compares nominal gradability with gradable adjectives, with the goal of using these behavioral responses to (a) identify a developmental linguistic trajectory, (b) dissociate category/concept-specific from more general aspects of gradability and context-dependence, and (c) tease apart parts of meaning contributed by semantics and pragmatics. Significant efforts will be directed towards mentoring, hands-on training, and education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels, as well as community outreach. The findings will advance scientific discovery by being incorporated into classes and will be disseminated broadly in scholarly venues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will explore the causes and welfare consequences of automakers colluding on the adoption of emission control technologies.  The project focuses on automakers that have been alleged to have colluded on adopting Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) tanks that were too small to effectively clean up nitrogen oxide (NOx), a major contributor to air pollution.  The project will investigate how the alleged collusion by automakers concealed violation of NOx emissions regulation. The project will quantify the effects of the alleged collusion on NOx pollution damages, car buyer surplus, and firm profits.  <br/>These effects inform the proper amount of antitrust penalties to remedy welfare damages of such collisions.  Finally, the project will examine whether and how environmental and antitrust regulation can mitigate inefficiencies from technology collusion. <br/><br/>The project will build and estimate a structural model of consumer vehicle demand and automaker technology choice, and simulate counterfactual policies. The project utilizes a comprehensive new data set on vehicle prices, sales, and characteristics.  A novel feature of the employed structural model is that the probability of non-compliance detection for one firm depends on other firms' behavior as well as its own.  A more dispersed distribution in choices may cause a regulator to question why some firms need to use large DEF tanks while others apparently manage with small tanks.  By coordinating on small tanks, the automakers simultaneously reduce the probability of being detected by the regulator and make their vehicles more attractive to car buyers (as the tank reduces cargo space, a valuable vehicle feature).  With the model and estimates of consumer tastes and automaker costs, the project will conduct counterfactual simulation to explore the following issues: (i) quantify the benefit of strengthening the enforcement of emission standards; (ii) calculate the anti-competitive damage of technology collusion compared to the competitive counterfactual; and (iii) identify the demand and supply conditions most conducive to technology collusion. The project advances the economics research and has regulatory and policy implications on firm collusion, antitrust enforcement, and industry standards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Providing a targeted hybrid manufacturing solution may extend service life and reduce operational costs by improving strength and production quality. As a result, additive manufacturing becomes accessible to aerospace and biomedical applications that have strict functional design and reliability requirements or geometrically complex structures. Geometric complexity and lattice structures are becoming a staple in modern design. Current tools such as topology optimization are incapable of maximizing strength-to-weight ratios. This software platform provides a hybrid manufacturing solution that optimizes weight while it proactively increases strength through interlayer cold working. In aerospace components, this lowers the buy-to-fly ratio by saving weight, which lowers fuel cost. In addition, this software platform addresses maintenance and reliability issues of legacy aircraft and tool-and-die components by significantly reducing lead times for replacement parts with enhanced aftermarket performance. The technology may provide industry with software solutions to best manufacture components requiring weight savings or known times to failure.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a hybrid additive manufacturing technology that combines three-dimensional printing with secondary material strengthening processes, such as laser peening, to improve functional performance. Laser peening is a surface treatment that induces favorable compressive residual stress in components to increase hardness and strength throughout large build volumes. The technical barrier addressed by this technology is understanding when, where, and how much laser peening is needed throughout the build volume. The proposed technology provides computational solutions for hybrid additive manufacturing that identify optimal locations for interlayer peening needed to achieve the highest possible strength-to-weight ratios without compromising functionality or performance. The model is able to simulate distortion and strength from cumulative residual stress fields induced by interlayer peening. This technology has been shown to increase toughness of stainless steel by 50% and increase corrosion resistance of a biomedical-grade magnesium alloy by 70% compared to traditional additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way that individuals get a sense of their community?s values is through specialized media. This is especially so among members of marginalized groups, who are often excluded from or sidelined in mainstream conversations. This study examines the long-term changes in the coverage and discussion of law and legal ideas in media serving the LGBTQ+ community over nearly five decades. This provides the opportunity to understand which legal issues are most salient to the LGBTQ+ community, and to appreciate that community?s attitudes towards legal actions and actors. It does this by examining how broader events, such as legislation, judicial rulings, and social movement activism influence changes in the coverage of particular issues and their discussion as matters of law in LGBTQ+ magazines. In doing so, the project contributes insights into how legal issues rise and fall on the agenda of marginalized groups, how the legal consciousness of marginalized communities develops over time, and how legal decisions influence public awareness and attitudes toward law and legal actors. Further, by employing a diverse team of undergraduate and graduate research assistants, this project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the research process.  <br/><br/>This project represents the first-of-its-kind, large-scale examination of the portrayal of law and legality in LGBTQ+ media over an extended period of time. Theoretically, the researchers root their approach in the well-developed literatures on legal consciousness, issue salience, critical junctures, and judicial impact, while developing new expectations for how and when law and legality matter among affected communities. Methodologically, the researchers will combine computational text analysis with rigorous human coding to investigate depictions of rights claiming and court decisions in LGBTQ+ media in the United States from 1969-2015. The analysis of the data will, first, identify and examine how the salience of legal issues in the LGBTQ+ community changes over time, and evaluate what influences those changes. Second, the researchers will examine temporal shifts in the legal consciousness of the LGBTQ+ community, and identify the causes of those shifts. These analyses will shed new light on the ways in which cultural, social, political, and legal factors affect both the prominence of legal concepts in a marginalized community and the character of the legal consciousness of that community, including attitudes toward legal and political actors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the benefits of collecting user information, data breaches and insider attacks have disastrous consequences. For example, the Ashley Madison breach highlights the danger of a leaked social graph (and what it implies about users? relationships). Indeed, metadata (who, what, when, etc.) can be sensitive, but building services that are oblivious to certain information (e.g., which movies users watch, which messages are ?liked?, or the social graph) poses significant technical and financial challenges.  This project takes a provider-centric view to hiding metadata and sees companies not as adversaries, but as partners committed to safeguarding users? information, provided that the necessary mechanisms are reasonable in terms of costs, features, and assumptions. Grounded by the needs of companies, this project designs algorithms, tools, and infrastructure to help services continue to work without accessing or collecting certain metadata (e.g., the social graph), limiting the harm of data breaches and insider attacks.<br/><br/>This project improves widely applicable cryptographic primitives by making them more efficient; extends them with access control and accountability features so privacy is not at odds with functionality; supports private user feedback necessary to improve services (e.g., train spam filters); and makes the release of source code optional. This project also designs the first decentralized and verifiable ad exchange platform that allows users to receive targeted ads without violating their privacy. This platform will supplement other revenue sources to ensure the sustainability of metadata-private online services. Finally, the topics of this project cover critical and timely social issues such as privacy, fairness, and their impact on the financial stability of businesses.

The QCF is arguably the most active fault of its type in the world: the entire ~900 km offshore length has ruptured in seven >M7 earthquakes during the last century and it sustains the highest known deformation rates (>50 mm/yr). The fault system represents the largest seismic hazard to southeastern Alaska and Canada outside of Cascadia, and caused Canada?s largest recorded earthquake (M8.1) in 1949. Despite rapid response efforts following >M7 earthquakes in 2012 and 2013, first-order questions regarding how the fault system deforms and the processes controlling fault failure during earthquakes remain unanswered due to the lack of modern geophysical imaging. This experiment will be the first comprehensive attempt to characterize this plate boundary at depth on a regional scale. Using seismic energy from marine acoustic and earthquake sources, the project will measure the depth and extent of seismicity, image the fault zone at depth, and determine velocity and thermal structure across the fault. All these data will lead to an improved understanding of this, and other major strike-slip fault systems, for better hazard assessment and earthquake forecasting. The science team is a collaborative, international group of US and Canadian researchers, led by three early-career women. Outreach to local communities will be conducted through a residency at the Sitka Science Center in Alaska and lectures at local high schools and community centers. <br/><br/>Compared to convergent continental-oceanic plate boundaries, the time-space evolution of continental-oceanic transform margins is understudied, despite their important role in the planet?s plate tectonic system. Continental-oceanic transform faults are potentially one of the most favorable tectonic settings for subduction initiation due to the juxtaposition of lithospheres of contrasting density and thermal structure -- small degrees of convergence can lead to failure. The QCF system provides an ideal location to investigate how a continental-oceanic transform fault responds to systematically increasing degrees of convergence at the lithospheric scale. The study area includes two potential fault segment boundaries that mark abrupt changes in transpressive deformation mechanisms as suggested by changes in seafloor morphology and shallow seismic reflection structure: strain partitioning and underthrusting in the south transition to highly localized strike-slip deformation in the north. Lack of information on microseismic depths and locations, the deformation history and geometries of faults at depth, and lithospheric velocity structure leave multiple fundamental questions unanswered: Why has the QCF formed where it is, and what is its deformation history? What is the history of PAC underthrusting along the margin and the fate of underthrust material north of the area of maximum convergence? What are the primary physical conditions controlling seismogenesis along oceanic-continental transforms?  How are strike-slip and compressive strain accommodated and partitioned over geologic and seismogenic timescales? Using a combined active- and passive-source marine seismic imaging strategy, this research will characterize crustal and uppermost mantle velocity structure, fault zone architecture and rheology, and seismicity. Data will be acquired using long-offset 2D seismic reflection and wide-angle reflection-refraction capabilities of the R/V Marcus G. Langseth and a combined US-Canadian broadband ocean bottom seismometer array of 64 instruments deployed for ~1 year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With an advanced array of ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs), rock collection, and fault imaging, this research will produce a multifaceted understanding of two magnitude 6 earthquake zones and the regions that separate them. To ensure a continuous earthquake dataset over the period that next large earthquakes are expected, this project involves three research cruises: 1) to deploy the OBSs and collect rock samples; 2) to recover, refurbish, and redeploy the OBSs and to survey the fault-zone with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); and 3) to recover the OBSs.  The two-year dataset is expected to record hundreds of thousands of microearthquakes in addition to hopefully capturing the next two magnitude 6 mainshocks. This research will reach 6-12th grade students, by taking two teachers from low-income school districts in New England to sea and working with these teachers to develop curricula that can be used by teachers throughout the US. The teachers will work with project scientists and the University of New Hampshire's Center for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Education to develop a ""Curriculum Kit"" - a web-based set of resources that will include classroom-based earthquake investigations, background information, and periodic classroom video chats with the Gofar experiment scientists. This project will also enhance earthquake research at the university level both nationally and internationally through the support of graduate students and postdocs. Gofar fault was chosen for this project because previous work there allows for the planning of a precise experiment aimed at imaging transitions in fault behavior over just a few kilometers. This experiment will capture the temporal evolution of the fault in unprecedented detail and link these variations to the underlying geology and fault mechanics. <br/><br/>Specifically, the aim of this project is to understand why oceanic transform faults are dominated by aseismic slip, have such repeatable seismic cycles, and nucleate hundreds of thousands of small earthquakes in the rupture barriers that stop large earthquakes. In particular, previous work at Gofar indicates that rupture barrier behavior cannot be explained by basic bimodal frictional properties and requires more sophisticated rheological descriptions of the fault zone. This project approaches these questions by recording the time dependence of earthquake stress drops with a strong-motion array and by estimating seismic velocities within the rupture barrier using 4 mini arrays of short-period OBSs that will allow us to use a seismic technique known as double beam forming to determine the space-time evolution of shear velocity. The project will determine if the pre-seismic changes in S-velocity are contained to a narrow fault-zone or spread throughout the wider damage zone and to what extent they extend to seismogenic depths.  This research will compare the migration of the velocity anomalies, or lack thereof, with fault mechanics models to try to constrain the underlying rheology of the rupture barrier and investigate the role of dilatancy in stopping large ruptures. The project will also conduct the most comprehensive, high-resolution mapping of a RTF to date through a combination of AUV based bathymetry, backscatter, photomosaic imaging, and water column surveys along with rock dredging. This suite of studies will help clarify the roles of dilatancy and hydrothermal alteration in producing the contrasting seismic behavior between the rupture zones and rupture barrier regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ?megathrust? earthquakes, and the tsunamis they sometimes trigger, can cause extreme damage and loss of life in local and far-field communities. The Alaska Peninsula segment in particular hosted the second largest earthquake recorded anywhere and has been identified as a high-risk tsunami source for the west coast of North America. The Alaska megathrust also generates the most recorded earthquakes of any fault system in the U.S. In 2018-2019, the geophysical community deployed the first major shoreline-crossing seismic array off Alaska, placing 75 high-quality seismometers on the sea floor to complement several onshore synchronized deployments. This dataset, now openly available, provides the first comprehensive nearby sampling of signals from small to moderate earthquakes along the megathrust in Alaska. This project will analyze a range of earthquake-generated signals from this new dataset, to address questions such as: why are earthquakes more common in some places than others despite similar geology? where are the active faults in the region? and what is the nature of fault materials that allows earthquakes to be generated? The results will greatly improve the working models by which we understand the physics of earthquakes, of tsunami generation, and other related hazards. This project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>One of the best-known examples of along-strike variability of a megathrust is observed along the Alaska Peninsula. In a few hundred km, the plate interface varies from fully locked and capable of generating M9.2 earthquakes near Kodiak, to fully creeping near the Shumagin Islands. The fundamental controls on the rupture variability of megathrusts are poorly known, relevant to both along-strike variations as seen in Alaska, as well as updip/downdip changes that are seen along all subduction zones. A major new publicly available community seismic dataset has just been acquired along this segment of the Aleutian megathrust. The 15-month broadband dataset, termed the Alaska Amphibious Seismic Experiment, AACSE, provides extensive coverage far offshore and onshore of seismicity and structure, with uniform sampling. This project focuses on the megathrust sampled by the AACSE by characterizing and understanding the earthquake sources on it, the tremor produced along it, and by imaging the fine-scale structure using local-earthquake and teleseismic signals. Specifically, waveform-based methods will be used to greatly increase the quantity and precision of earthquake hypocenters along the megathrust, enabling characterization of along-strike variability. These will be complemented by studies of earthquake source properties to better understand spatial variation in rupture behavior, and to separate megathrust earthquakes showing upper plate and lower plate deformation. Modern tremor detection methods will be applied to the full dataset, to characterize any regions of downdip and potential updip tremor, and their along-strike variation. High-frequency mode-converted signals and autocorrelation of local-earthquake coda will be used to image the megathrust targeting spatial variations in its reflectivity strength and thickness; these analyses will be integrated with collocated receiver functions to generate a wide-band image of the plate boundary. This research will address several fundamental questions: Where is the plate boundary (as opposed to nearby regions in the upper and lower plate) seismogenic? How does the slip behavior and earthquake dynamics vary down-dip, and between locked and creeping sections? Do sharp boundaries in coupling correlate with strong variations in seismic behavior? How do earthquakes on the plate boundary relate to structure, and how does structure relate to dehydration or lithology? What explains the along-strike variability between locked and creeping sections? Do major potentially seismogenic splay faults exist in the upper plate? How is non-volcanic tremor related to regular earthquakes? The extensive amphibious array here allows an unprecedented opportunity to accurately resolve seismicity, tremor and structure in exactly the same place, with a variety of techniques, and in doing so provides an excellent opportunity to make progress on these issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the past 10 years, pharmaceutical companies have been experiencing a decrease in R&D returns on drug development. One of the reasons for the decrease, is that most of the drugs entering clinical trials fail in this final and most costly stage. Currently, screening begins with 2-Dimensional (2D) cell cultures and progresses to animal models. Both systems have inherent deficiencies in replicating human disease. The proposed technology uses more effective 3D tissue models for drug screening by providing a more physiologically-relevant drug response while being compatible with currently available, high-throughput screening platforms. This technology has the potential to increase the work efficiency of researchers and other end-users, reduce false positive drug candidates at early stages to increase R&D returns for the pharmaceutical companies, and reduce healthcare costs for patients. In addition, the proposed technology may enable faster development of new therapies.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of advanced 3D cell-laden hydrogel microspheroids for drug screening. Currently used models for pre-clinical drug testing have inherent deficiencies in replicating human disease. 3D spheroidal cell aggregates have been established as more effective models for cancer drug screening; However, existing systems lack the homogeneity, cellular microenvironmental control, and total cell numbers needed to perform high fidelity endpoint screening assays and obtain the quality and types of information that researchers require. In addition, many types of cancer cells do not consistently form 3D aggregates. Therefore, there is a need for more advanced 3D spheroidal models that can support high cell density, multiple cell types, and modulation of cellular microenvironment. Using a custom-developed microfluidic encapsualtion platform, cell-laden microspheroids may be produced at an extremely fast speed using photocrosslinkable hydrogel materials. Compared to self-aggregation and other competing technologies, the proposed technology may provide greater flexibility to manipulate the cellular microenvironment, such as stiffness, and may include multiple supporting cell types, such as highly important stromal and immune cells. Additionally, higher numbers of cells may be included per well compared to cell aggregates, making highly sensitive endpoint analyses feasible on a per well basis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is a rapidly expanding industry, impacting aerospace, energy, and medical industries, among others. However, the lack of in-process monitoring for part quality is recognized as a hindrance to rapid, wide-scale industry adoption. The monitoring system under development is designed to be implemented within the MAM process to measure the quality of parts and detect defects in an in-process fashion.  The proposed technology may allow for part qualification and increased part output while reducing the cost of the fabrication process and increasing US manufacturing competitiveness.  In addition, the proposed technology may reduce material waste when compared to traditional subtractive techniques.  The goal of this technology is to reduce the per-part cost of MAM by allowing immediate cancellation of builds that include defective parts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a structured light monitoring system (SLMS) for metal additive manufacturing (MAM). SLMS uses a projector and a camera to quickly measure the three-dimensional height of multiple features of a part during its fabrication in MAM settings. Dimensional results from the SLMS are compared against values predefined by technicians to determine if the part is within defect tolerance. A patented measurement model is included to gauge the uncertainty of each measurement point to further bolster the statistical part health monitoring method. Initial results show that the SLMS is capable of resolving porosity defects as small as 25 microns, and powder deposition defects as small as 80 microns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Language plays a central role in this process. Yet in many cases in natural language, categorization is impossible without further information from the context. Such is the case, for example, with gradable adjectives such as 'tall', where meaning shifts from context to context, and even with nouns. How do children succeed at assembling their lexicon and determining reference when faced with such shifting, context-dependent meanings? This project pursues this question by examining the context-dependence that arises in one of the most basic and earliest-acquired categories: count nouns. The study of such nouns and corresponding concepts has stood at the center of research on infancy, the count/mass and object/substance distinctions, and language typology. Thus, the anticipated results from this research will have broad and interdisciplinary impact. In particular, the findings will offer insights into the ways language and cognition are intertwined in the course of development, and deepen our understanding of how contextual information influences meaning. <br/><br/>This project takes as its starting point a well-established finding that young children allow object fragments to be treated on par with whole objects as referents for corresponding nouns like 'fork' or 'cup'. The key hypothesis of this research is that this apparent non-adult behavior stems from children's difficulties in using contextual information to enrich an inherently context-dependent nominal meaning. A series of behavioral experiments with children and adults compares nominal gradability with gradable adjectives, with the goal of using these behavioral responses to (a) identify a developmental linguistic trajectory, (b) dissociate category/concept-specific from more general aspects of gradability and context-dependence, and (c) tease apart parts of meaning contributed by semantics and pragmatics. Significant efforts will be directed towards mentoring, hands-on training, and education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels, as well as community outreach. The findings will advance scientific discovery by being incorporated into classes and will be disseminated broadly in scholarly venues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Larger data centers can comprise over a million servers, each of which house CPUs, memory and storage. Memory in particular, can consume as high as 46% of average system energy, and even so, memory usage in today?s data centers can be as low as 20?30%. A key contributor to this problem is poor provisioning and utilization of memory across various data center applications. To address this problem, recent proposals have argued for memory disaggregation, which physically separates memory and CPUs into separate blades and connects them via the network. This approach not only promises better memory and CPU utilization, signi?cantly improving data center energy ef?ciency, but also offers a number of additional bene?ts. Unfortunately, such a physical separation comes at a cost of performance for accessing memory ef?ciently, limiting its applicability. This project envisions a radically new design for memory disaggregation, which places memory management at emerging programmable elements in the network to enable high performance for disaggregated memory. If successful, this research will incentivize cloud providers to transition their data centers to disaggregated architectures, improving memory utilization, reducing energy consumption and consequently, total cost of ownership for their infrastructure. Planned outreach and curriculum development as a part of this project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups and educate high school, undergrad and graduate students on cloud systems and data center architectures. <br/><br/>Over the last few years, signi?cant improvements in inter-server network performance, coupled with stagnating intra-server interconnect performance, have driven advances in data center resource disaggregation ? where server compute, memory and storage resources are physically separated into network attached resource ?blades?. However, actualizing the bene?ts of resource disaggregation, while ensuring application performance, requires operating system (OS) support. Unfortunately, existing proposals to this end expose a hard tradeoff between application performance on one hand and resource elasticity on the other. The driving vision of this project is a fundamentally new network-centric design for the disaggregated OS ? one that places resource management and access functionality in the data center network fabric to break the above tradeoff. This proposal speci?cally focuses on in-network memory management for the envisioned OS, and will exploit recent advances in programmable network hardware to realize the memory subsystem design. The end-goal is a data center-scale shared memory abstraction, where each disaggregated core can ef?ciently access any memory word in the data center?s disaggregated memory pool. The research goals of the project are i) enable compute/memory elasticity and hardware ?exibility via network-assisted shared memory; ii) facilitate performant access to network-attached memory via network-driven optimizations; and iii) ensure scalability and fault-tolerance for the memory subsystem for data center-wide disaggregation. The project also provides a multidisciplinary platform to realize educational objectives of (i) developing system and experimental components for our systems and networking curriculum, (ii) involving undergraduate students in publishable research, and (iii) promoting science and engineering in high-school students and underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to examine the importance of isotropic vs. anisotropic turbulence and dissipation, which will transform the understanding of mixing. This is a necessary step to inform and improve modeling of heat and carbon storage and transport within the ocean. The project will involve high school and undergraduate interns recruited from local programs targeting under-represented minorities, focusing on gaining experience in manipulating, analyzing and visualizing large datasets.

The energy cascade would be tracked from wind-forced near-inertial waves in the surface mixed-layer through refraction and trapping in a baroclinic anticyclone, downward radiation into the pycnocline, critical-layer amplification at the vortex base, instability producing turbulence, and the cascade to dissipation. The coordinated set of simulations will produce a dynamically-coupled flow field consisting of mesoscale eddies, submesoscale filaments, near-inertial and higher frequency internal waves, shear-driven instabilities, and isotropic turbulent motions at sub-Ozmidov scales, allowing an oceanographically realistic energy cascade from the meso- to turbulent scales to be studied in detail. The work will test dynamical hypotheses linking disparate scales of motion that cannot be feasibly addressed in stand-alone simulations.

This class of models is broad. On the lattice, it includes first passage percolation and directed last passage percolation, directed polymers in random media, as well as random walks in both static and dynamic random environments, with general admissible steps. Continuum models like the continuum directed polymer and the associated stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise will also be considered. The main goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the infinite volume structure of such models through specific examples and to work toward a unified treatment of that structure in the greatest generality that can be achieved.  Concretely, the main goal of the project will be to characterize the existence and uniqueness properties of semi-infinite and bi-infinite volume measures (respectively geodesics). The work will also consider related problems, including investigating how infinite volume measures relate to the regularity properties of the limiting free energy (respectively shape function), developing computational tools in exactly solvable models and on understanding the structure of the environment viewed from the perspective of paths drawn from the infinite volume measure (respectively a geodesic).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years.  However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter.  To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The electron?s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM.  Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding.  The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers.<br/><br/>The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron?s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model.  The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered Mller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals.  The collaborative project described in this proposal will develop subsystem #3; namely the design, construction, and testing of the MOLLER Normalization and Systematic Control apparatus.

The proposed technology provides enhanced patient assessment using oxygenation levels to increase the standard of care in the wound care domain (including diabetic foot ulcers, chronic wounds, acute wounds, post-surgery plastic surgery skin flaps, and other applications in this wound domain).  In the long-term, the technology also may facilitate remote patient monitoring, improve patient compliance, minimize the need for amputations, and expand the availability of modern wound care monitoring to communities with health care disparities. Increasing costs of health care, an aging population, recognition of difficult-to-treat infection threats, and the continued increase of diabetes and obesity worldwide make chronic wounds a substantial clinical, social, and economic challenge.  The proposed technology may have a positive impact by objectively assessing wound treatment progression.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development a smartphone-based imaging technology to be used as a handheld, telemedicine oxygenation device for wound care prognosis of diabetic foot ulcers and other wounds.  Current mobile health-based diabetic foot ulcer assessment using a mobile phone?s digital color images provides only minimal clinical assessment in terms of visual wound coloration, size (or area), and depth measurement characteristics.  The proposed technology is designed to acquire digital photographs of wounds, measure wound size/area, and obtain tissue oxygenation maps of the wounds. The device is the only non-intrusive smartphone optical imaging device that measures 2-dimensional oxygenation changes of tissues apart from obtaining digital color images. The use of a smartphone makes the device user friendly and light enough for off premise use in multiple examinations per day. The preliminary studies on diabetic foot ulcers demonstrated that the proposed device could differentiate the physiological contrast between the wound and its surroundings, apart from obtaining digital color images of the wound.

The cost of implementing UV light-driven water disinfection is often a barrier to its utilization on smaller scales or in more vulnerable communities. By improving the affordability of UV light-driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), it may be possible to implement this technology in developing communities, especially for the disinfection of parasites like Cryptosporidium and Giardia, which pose a significant public health threat. By replacing chlorine-based oxidants, the proposed device may reduce harmful disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes (THMs). Research suggests that consuming THMs in drinking water may elevate the risk of certain cancers and result in adverse reproductive outcomes. More comprehensive implementation of UV-AOPs also may lead to the degradation of many emerging contaminants, including 1,4-dioxane, antibiotics, endocrine disruptors, and (potentially) SARS-CoV-2. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an immobilized photocatalyst with a high effective surface area, low mass transport limitations, deep UV penetration, and long-term chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability.

The primary figure of merit for judging the economic viability of UV AOPs is the electrical energy per unit order (EE/O), i.e., the amount of electrical energy required to reduce the concentration of a target pathogen or chemical contaminant by one order of magnitude (90%). While EE/O is largely dependent on the water quality, target contaminant, and reactor design, UV light disinfection systems with EE/O values below 10 kWh/m3 are generally considered commercially viable.

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years.  However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter.  To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The electron?s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM.  Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding.  The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers.<br/><br/>The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron?s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model.  The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered Mller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals.  The collaborative project described in this proposal will develop subsystem #3; namely the design, construction, and testing of the MOLLER Normalization and Systematic Control apparatus.

Currently, over 60% of the world lacks access to ultrasound imaging technology. In addition to prohibitive cost, training also is a barrier. With the implementation of machine learning algorithms, an aspect of guidance and image classification is introduced in the proposed device. This may facilitate the screening of potential complications during pregnancy and provide guidance during breast biopsies, among other applications. To train machine learning algorithms, large datasets need to be generated, but ultrasound data is expensive and slow to collect. In the United States, more than 125 million ultrasound studies are performed yearly at an average cost of $800 each. The main advantages of a broadly accessible ultrasound device are global accessibility to affordable medical diagnostic technology, and a platform for telemedicine software applications. Sonograms may then be shared wirelessly with physicians and healthcare providers, potentially eliminating the need for a physical office visit, which for many is a long, expensive, and complicated journey. This proposed point-of-care ultrasound system will address the needs of global users.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a hand-held, USB (universal serial bus)-powered device that generates 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional ultrasound sonograms and streams images in the same format as webcam video. This video may then be displayed or processed by diagnostic software. The hardware and software are user friendly and applicable for a range of audiences. In addition, artificial intelligence can be used to reduce the training burden for new users. The axial resolution of the proposed portable system is 0.6 mm, lateral resolution is 1.9 mm at 30 mm depth, and central frequency is 4.25 MHz  5%. When tested with tissue equivalent phantoms, the device rendered images of sufficient quality to extract value and critical information such as the size of internal structures as well as volumetric information, which may be used to guide clinical decisions. Cart-based ultrasound systems that provide the best-in-market 3-dimensional image quality and processing software can retail for $250,000, which is prohibitive in price for many markets.

The project will investigate how the alleged collusion by automakers concealed violation of NOx emissions regulation. The project will quantify the effects of the alleged collusion on NOx pollution damages, car buyer surplus, and firm profits.  <br/>These effects inform the proper amount of antitrust penalties to remedy welfare damages of such collisions.  Finally, the project will examine whether and how environmental and antitrust regulation can mitigate inefficiencies from technology collusion. <br/><br/>The project will build and estimate a structural model of consumer vehicle demand and automaker technology choice, and simulate counterfactual policies. The project utilizes a comprehensive new data set on vehicle prices, sales, and characteristics.  A novel feature of the employed structural model is that the probability of non-compliance detection for one firm depends on other firms' behavior as well as its own.  A more dispersed distribution in choices may cause a regulator to question why some firms need to use large DEF tanks while others apparently manage with small tanks.  By coordinating on small tanks, the automakers simultaneously reduce the probability of being detected by the regulator and make their vehicles more attractive to car buyers (as the tank reduces cargo space, a valuable vehicle feature).  With the model and estimates of consumer tastes and automaker costs, the project will conduct counterfactual simulation to explore the following issues: (i) quantify the benefit of strengthening the enforcement of emission standards; (ii) calculate the anti-competitive damage of technology collusion compared to the competitive counterfactual; and (iii) identify the demand and supply conditions most conducive to technology collusion. The project advances the economics research and has regulatory and policy implications on firm collusion, antitrust enforcement, and industry standards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each year, SABER hosts a national conference for biology education researchers and practitioners.  On average, about 400 participants have attended these in-person conferences.  However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 SABER national conference was held virtually, with no registration fees.  These changes led to a tremendous increase in participation, with over 1400 registrations for the meeting and over 500 active participants at conference sessions.  To sustain broad attendance at the 2021 conference and to increase the diversity of attendees, this proposal intends to expand conference activities through a regular series of special lectures, to design the 2021 annual meeting to include the option for virtual attendance, and to provide registration and travel fellowships to broaden participation in biology education research.  <br/><br/>Special interest groups within the SABER community will select 12 speakers for a series of live webinars that will be offered throughout the year.  The webinars will be freely available to any interested participant.  In addition, they will be recorded and archived on the SABER website.  In addition, the project will build virtual attendance options into all sessions of the 2021 SABER conference, which is expected to be an in-person conference scheduled for July 22-25, 2021.  Virtual participants will pay registration fees that are half as much as those required for in-person participation.  The virtual participation option is expected to enable participation by biology education researchers and practitioners who would be otherwise unable to attend the conference due to financial or logistical challenges.  Finally, the project will support travel fellowships to support in-person participation by individuals from diverse backgrounds. The availability of travel fellowships will be advertised to minority-serving institutions including Hispanic-serving institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as through partner organizations such as the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science.  Recipients of travel fellowships will be selected by SABER?s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee.  These efforts are intended to broaden participation in and access to SABER activities.

The main objective of the project is to gain insight into customer needs and to determine if there is a value proposition for this technology.  Waste is a feedstock that is difficult to handle and has large inconsistencies with high chlorine content. The team has developed a heat treatment that addresses these issues, producing a torrefied fuel product that will benefit energy intensive companies (cement kilns, metallurgy, power, etc.), encouraging them to use renewable energy and reduce costs.  Society will benefit from this project through reduced landfilling, which will preserve the land from future landfilling, reduce pollution by the toxic leachates, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and turn waste into a resource, thus supporting the circular economy. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will reveal customer needs and pain points in the area of solid fuel combustion and help to determine if torrefied waste can be considered as a solid fuel used in small-to-medium size power plants.  As part of the customer discovery process, problems in using waste for energy applications such as difficulty in handling, difficulty in transport, large inconsistencies, high chlorine content, and severe corrosion and emissions will be explored. The team has developed a torrefaction system that addresses these hindrances with a series of processes, including downsizing, melting, pyrolization, and pelletization which reduces chlorine and sulfur. This torrefied product is pellet-shaped with high uniformity, high density, high heat content, high consistency, and high durability.  The pellets are low in chlorine content, grindable, safe to store, safe to ship, and low in cost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Executive function is the brain?s ability to focus on what matters.  Paired with quick reaction time, executive function allows humans to make important, split-second decisions.  However, the methods currently used to measure these ?brain vital signs? are expensive, inaccurate, and overly reliant on computers.  Reaction time and executive function are known to be associated with concussion/TBI, aging, fall risk, sleep disorders, drug use, and driving safety.  The proposed technology has the potential for use in a variety of applications.  Athletic departments and the Department of Defense (DoD) have a clear unmet need for a portable, objective measure of cognitive function following head injuries, and emergency departments and hospitals would benefit from the speed, simplicity, and cost of this technology.  Geriatricians and physical therapists have expressed interest in allowing rapid testing of their patient?s brain speed.  Lastly, this technology tests the ability to make split-second decisions, so there may be applications for law enforcement and the Department of Motor Vehicles to enhance driver safety with this technology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a clinical neurologic assessment tool for the assessment of reaction time, short latency impulse inhibition, and executive function for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The proposed device is designed to measure reaction time and quick decision making based on a ruler-drop method.  Accurate measurement of reaction time has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis, prognosis, and recovery monitoring of those suffering from concussion. In addition, recent data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-DoD funded Concussion Assessment Research and Education (CARE) study indicate that the proposed technology is more effective than the industry standard computerized test (ImPACT) at diagnosing concussion, while being faster to administer, more portable, and more cost-effective. There is published evidence that the accuracy and precision of screen-based reaction time tests suffer due to hardware/software inconsistencies and due to the non-motivating quality of the tests.  The proposed technology has been shown to be inherently motivating and results in faster and less variable response times as compared with computerized testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But what happens when disasters keep happening, one after another? How do health care workers cope with the constant demands of disaster conditions? This project documents how health care workers responded to disaster conditions, cared for patients, and worked to rebuild the health care system following a major natural disaster. The research is important because disasters and health emergencies are becoming more frequent and more severe. Therefore, gathering data on how the health care work force responds emotionally to prolonged crisis conditions can aid in designing more effective responses. The broader impacts of this project include the training underrepresented students in anthropology and broadening participation for students underrepresented in science. Data from the project will be disseminated to improve healthcare delivery in post-disaster conditions. This project is jointly funded by Cultural Anthropology, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) <br/><br/>This project examines whether the ethics of healthcare provisioning transform under conditions of ""compounded disaster,"" through an investigation of disaster recovery in Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, and was still operating under conditions of sustained emergency at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The central question of this research is: Did health care workers' experiences during and after Hurricane Maria transform their ethics of care? The ethics of care refers to the practices and self-understanding that guide and motivate those who do the work of caring for others. The investigators hypothesize that health care workers developed a new ethics of care that drew upon pre-existing cultural features, but reflects a new sense of solidarity, greater efficacy, and shared purpose forged in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The investigators anticipate that this new ethics of care has evolved or transformed through compounding disasters including earthquake swarms and COVID-19. The research design includes data collection through individual interviews, remote focus groups, and on-site participant observation. The project contributes to the scientific understanding of the underlying cultural processes through which disasters transform communities; whether compounded disasters have a geometric or exponential impact on these communities; and also, if the ethics of care fundamentally change under these circumstances. This project generates theory to explain the underlying cultural processes through which (1) disasters transform communities and (2) care workers forge practices and self-understandings that aid in the process of disaster recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pace of these changes can lead to rapid shifts in the structure of marine communities due to changes in the distribution, abundance, and diversity of species. This collaborative project is among the first to examine the consequences of deoxygenation on coral reefs, which are sentinel ecosystems for studying ecological responses to global change because of their importance to human society, sensitivity to stress, and intricate relationships among their inhabitants. Specifically, the research team investigates why and how some coral species are more tolerant than others and the role that bacteria associated with the corals have in such tolerance. This predictive understanding is important to support conservation and management efforts by identifying stress-tolerant coral species and establishing indicators for assessment of hypoxia stress. The project provides training for multiple undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Findings from this project are disseminated through undergraduate and graduate courses taught at the University of Florida, a teacher training program at the Bocas del Toro Research Station at STRI in Panama, a workshop in Panama to build a community of scientists and informed practitioners, and webinars, toolkits, and other resources communicated through established networks of coral conservation and management practitioners. <br/><br/>Understanding the responses of coral reefs to ocean deoxygenation is limited to a few post hoc assessments of how unanticipated hypoxic events have impacted macrofauna. This project employs a predictive approach to examine the resilience of coral reef communities to ocean deoxygenation by examining both corals and their associated microbiomes. Complimentary manipulative laboratory and field experiments and surveys along natural gradients of hypoxic stress are being used to answer the following three fundamental questions about how variation in the tolerance of corals and their microbiomes predicts the resilience of reefs to deoxygenation: (1) How does the physiological response of the coral to hypoxia predict community shifts in the microbiome with deoxygenation? (2) To what degree do corals and their microbiomes show evidence of acclimatization to reduced oxygen, and how do these functional shifts confer increased resistance to subsequent hypoxic stress? (3) How are the feedbacks between coral hosts and their microbiomes apparent in the recovery of coral communities from hypoxia and patterns of community structure at the seascape scale? This project aims at developing a mechanistic and predictive understanding of coral reef community responses to ocean deoxygenation by examining stability and resilience at two levels of ecological organization: the assemblage of coral species at the reef scale, and the assemblage of microbes at the holobiont scale. Moreover, this study examines how those responses are coupled by feedbacks at the colony scale through coral physiological responses and microbial functional shifts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, natural speech communication rarely takes place in ideal listening conditions and we often listen to others when surrounded by background noise. Processing and comprehending foreign-accented speech in noisy backgrounds has thus become a common characteristic of everyday communication. This is also true for school-aged children, as their peers may be foreign-accented speakers and their classrooms can be noisy. Prior linguistic research has demonstrated that the addition of background noise can impact the understanding of foreign-accented speech, more so than native-accented speech, and increased cognitive demand has been proposed as the possible explanation. <br/><br/>This project measures cognitive demands during sentence processing, combining behavioral and neurocognitive (EEG) techniques, to examine three questions: What are the linguistic-cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of foreign-accented and native-accented sentences embedded in background noise and in quiet conditions in (1) adults and (2) children? (3) What are potential sources of individual variability in behavioral and neural responses to semantic anomalies in native- and foreign-accented sentences presented in background noise and in quiet? Two age groups will be tested in two experiments: young adults and children aged 9-11. In the EEG task, participants listen to native- and foreign-accented English sentences. Half the sentences in each accent condition will be embedded in background noise, and the remaining sentences in quiet; half the sentences will contain semantic anomalies and half will be semantically well-formed. Participants will also complete a language background questionnaire, reporting demographic information, language use, proficiency, and accent exposure, as well as behavioral tasks measuring individual differences in linguistic and cognitive abilities. This project provides foundational insights on the cognitive and neural bases of foreign- and native-accented speech processing in noisy and quiet environments. The outcomes also have real-life implications and can, for example, inform educators on facilitating optimal learning environments in their classrooms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by investigating best practices for online tutoring in college mathematics.  Face-to-face tutoring in mathematics is known to correlate with positive learning outcomes including higher course grades, greater persistence, and improved retention. Providing quality online tutoring experiences also benefits for tutors by helping them learn valuable skills such as organization, time management, teamwork, problem-solving, leadership, and technical communication.  The COVID-19 pandemic forced many university-based tutoring services to either stop offering help to students or move online.  Many chose to move online.  However, the effective implementation of online mathematics tutoring is not yet well understood.  Such understanding is important because online mathematics tutoring could benefit students long after the current pandemic has dissipated. Preliminary observations have shown that online mathematics tutoring sessions typically serve as a homework service: tutors solve problems brought to them by students and the students watch and copy down the solutions rather than actively participating. This study aims to make the online tutoring experience more like the in-person experience by discovering ways to ensure students are active participants in tutoring sessions. Through continued observation of online tutor-student interactions, the project will identify tutor behaviors that encourage greater student participation in online tutoring sessions.  The project will then design training materials to promote the most effective behaviors in tutors.  These training materials will be freely distributed to the mathematics education community through workshops, conference presentations, and online resources.  <br/><br/>This project?s online tutoring model will be tested and refined at West Virginia University and the University of Oklahoma, two large universities that server large populations of students.  The project will identify tutor practices that promote student-centered online tutoring interactions and generate training materials to optimize the frequency of such interactions in online tutoring sessions. Recorded online tutoring sessions will be analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis to identify tutor behaviors that promote student-centered tutoring interactions.  Pen and tablet technologies will be utilized and compared to online sessions without such tools to study specific impacts on tutor practices and student engagement.  Through multiple cycles of observation and implementation, a set of empirically tested training materials will be developed, including a Tutoring Manual for tutors and a Training Guide for tutoring center leaders/faculty. The Training Manual for tutors will contain resources such as technology suggestions (e.g., best collaborative whiteboard app; how to use your phone as a document camera; apps to scan written work to pdf), articles to read, and how to be an effective virtual coach. The Training Guide for faculty will provide resources such as how to host a one-day training before the semester starts, how to support tutors during the semester, and how to evaluate online tutoring offerings. This project is funded through the NSF IUSE:EHR program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  The IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

Such studies may allow scientists to infer distributions of temperature, water content, and deformation. This project aims to develop a multi-parameter seismic model for North America by using state-of-the-art full waveform inversion technology and high-quality waveform records collected by the USArray over the past decade. This community-shared, multi-parameter seismic model will include 3-D variations in velocities, anisotropy, shear attenuation and the associated uncertainties. Jointly interpreting these parameters will enable the investigators to address important scientific problems related to depth-dependent anisotropy and water distribution within the mantle transition zone. Solving these issues is important for our understanding of the physical characteristics of the lithosphere, asthenosphere and mantle transition zone. Furthermore, this CAREER project will support an early career PI and several Ph.D. graduate and undergraduate students. The PI will promote high-performance computation in Geophysics education, engage undergraduate students in research and participate in UTD STEM summer camps for high school students. The Dallas area has large African, Hispanic and Asian American communities, the PI will attract high school students from these communities to participate this summer camp program. The developed multi-parameter seismic model will be shared online for public and research usages. Results from this project will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national/international meetings.<br/><br/>This project will combine full waveform inversion and high-quality USArray records to construct a comprehensive seismic model for North America, which will enable the team to tackle the following scientific problems. (1) The 3-D azimuthal anisotropy structure in the developed comprehensive model will enable us to distinguish ?frozen-in? lithospheric deformation and present-day asthenospheric flows. In addition, jointly interpreting radial and azimuthal anisotropy enables them to test the anisotropy cause hypothesis for the mid-lithosphere discontinuity; (2) Considering the high water solubilities of wadsleyite and ringwoodite, the mantle transition zone might act as a huge water reservoir inside the Earth. Seismic attenuation has been considered as an important proxy for delineating the distribution of water. By jointly interpreting velocity and attenuation results taken from the developed comprehensive model, this project aims to answer the question: ?Is the mantle transition zone underneath North America highly hydrated?? (3) Quantifying uncertainty and resolution is still challenging in full waveform inversion applications. This project will develop algorithms to efficiently evaluate the posterior covariance and resolution matrix, which will be applied to quantify uncertainty of the developed, multi-parameter seismic model of North America. The PI will also promote interactions between students and experts from the energy industry through workshops and summer internships. This project will enable the PI to train graduate and undergraduate students for seismology related research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal of this project is to elucidate the walking and running capabilities of the earliest human ancestors, who ? the human fossil record indicates ? possessed only a subset of these anatomical traits. To achieve this goal, this project will integrate locomotor experiments of humans and chimpanzees with computer simulations using detailed models of the muscle and skeletal anatomies of humans, chimpanzees and Australopithecus afarensis, a ~3.5 million year old human ancestor. This integrative experiment-modeling/simulation approach will establish relationships between anatomical traits and walking and running capabilities. The project will link biological anthropology and computational science research, including the development of new tools that provide a rigorous, quantitative basis for inferring walking and running capabilities from fossils of human ancestors. It will also contribute to education and training at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and include a strong commitment to advancing academic diversity and inclusion. The knowledge generated will be incorporated into an annual biomechanics outreach event for high school students and a workshop providing computer modeling and simulation skills for researchers in biological anthropology. Data, models, and algorithms associated with this project will be shared online with other scientists, educators, and the general public.<br/><br/>Over the past 7 to 8 million years, our muscular, skeletal, and neural systems have been adapted for overground locomotion. How did our lineage become skilled walkers and runners, and what locomotor adaptations occurred among the earliest hominins? This question will be addressed by integrating empirical locomotion data with detailed models of the musculoskeletal system and the latest advances in predictive simulation. First, a comprehensive experimental dataset will be established for the 3-D limb motion, forces, and cost for bipedal chimpanzee and human locomotion at matched speeds. This dataset will be used to validate model-based, predictive simulations of walking and running in both taxa, and evaluate three ecologically-relevant performance criteria, including energy cost, muscle fatigue, and joint loading, as well as a weighted combination of all three. A 3-D model of Au. afarensis will then be used with the best-performing criteria to predict walking and running capabilities for this species, with uncertainty assessed via sensitivity analyses. Together, these data will provide the basis for developing an early hominin-like deformable ape musculoskeletal model to test the hypothesis that lower back and pelvis evolution enhanced bipedal walking and running capabilities as compared to bipedal locomotion in chimpanzees. Finally, a new bi-level predictive simulation approach will be developed for discovering the selective forces that drive anatomical trait evolution in bipedal locomotion. This integrative approach will provide critical information about walking and running capabilities in the earliest hominins that have been unapproachable using comparative fossil-based studies or experimentation alone.

In places, the plate boundaries must slide past one another to accommodate this motion.  Sometimes this occurs smoothly, but sometimes the plate edges are stuck together by friction and don't slide at all until enough stress builds to the point where the plates slip past each other suddenly in an earthquake. Over the past two decades, a different form of tectonic boundary slip has been studied in which built up stress is relaxed episodically, as in an earthquake, but at a much slower rate taking days, weeks, months, or even years to gradually slip.  These events are called ""slow slip events"" or ""slow earthquakes.""  Because the motions are gradual they do not generate seismic shaking (as normal earthquakes do), making them far less dangerous.  However, slow slip events occurring near areas that are frictionally stuck may trigger large earthquakes, a phenomenon that requires further study. This study focuses on searching for slow slip events in the offshore, shallow part of the Cascadia subduction zone, which lies offshore the western United States stretching from northern California to north of the Canadian border.  Here an oceanic tectonic plate is colliding with North America, producing very large destructive earthquakes and tsunamis every few hundred years. The lack of seismic shaking associated with slow slip events makes these events difficult to detect, especially offshore.  On land they are evident in precise, continuous GPS records which show plate motions of several centimeters that start and stop over a few weeks.  Such motions are much more difficult to observe on the seafloor because GPS signals do not penetrate sea water.  Consequently alternative methods must be devised to detect offshore slow slip events.  This research project will record very precisely the lengths of optical fibers stretched across the seafloor near the Oregon coast.  If a slow slip event occurs in the region near the optical fibers, the associated optical length change will be recorded by a battery powered laser system at the end of each optical fiber.  Studying such events offshore will help to build models of their influence on the timing and location of great earthquakes, and may lead to future advances in earthquake forecasting. The project supports the training of a student.<br/><br/>Widespread deployments of GPS sensors in the past decade have helped identify Slow Slip Events (SSEs), especially near subduction zone faults in Cascadia, Costa Rica, Japan, and New Zealand. Understanding SSEs presents an opportunity to gain new insights into the mechanism governing locking and unlocking of subduction zone and other faults, and may be important in assessing the hazard levels presented from potential great earthquakes and tsunami.  In particular, SSEs occurring at the downdip limit of the strongly locked zone may pose a risk of triggering large earthquake ruptures.  It is therefore critical to search for SSEs occurring at the base of the locked zone, which in Cascadia (as in most subduction zones) lies offshore.  In this study, two orthogonal optical fiber strainmeters will be installed on the seafloor above the Cascadia subduction zone to detect offshore SSEs.  A recent study of the cumulative effect of SSEs in Cascadia using onshore GPS data indicates possible offshore slow slip at the base of the locked zone which is hypothesized to occur simultaneously with onshore SSEs.  However, the detection of this slip using onshore GPS is very weak.  Confirming the presence or absence of offshore slow slip in Cascadia is important for understanding the potential role of SSEs in influencing the timing and location of the next great earthquake.  While GPS networks have sufficient sensitivity to map the location of SSEs onshore, they do not cover that portion of the crust under the oceans, nor are they able to distinguish the timing of sub-events because of the need for averaging over daily periods.  In contrast, optical fiber strainmeters can be deployed offshore and have their best signal to noise ratio at shorter periods, complementing onshore GPS both in location and frequency band.  Because SSEs evolve in complex patterns indicative of propagating stress fronts, it is important to resolve, both in scale and time, the deformation signals in order to understand more fully the evolution of the rupture plane.  In conjunction with GPS, the availability of highly sensitive and stable strainmeters offshore will enable such characterizations. The measurements in this study will be timed with an expected onshore SSE to capture the hypothesized offshore slip, testing this model and others that address the extent of an offshore locked zone. In addition to the detection of SSEs, a number of other studies will become feasible following the deployment of this offshore strainmeter, including investigation of strain from traveling seismic waves and tidal observations for inferring local Earth structure.  In addition, the work will advance the technology of optical fiber sensors and likely find applications in other disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, risk-adverse decision-makers are often interested in solutions that provide a good trade-off between the expected return and risk, which can be modeled naturally as the ratio function. Also, fractional objectives can be used for feature selection and clustering in data mining as well as for solving isoperimetric problems on graphs that can be applied for error-correcting codes and image segmentation. There are no adequate solution approaches for these classes of optimization problems if they involve integrality and/or combinatorial restrictions (constraints). Therefore, if successful, the proposed research will substantially enhance the ability to solve these hard classes of optimization problems and can lead to a more widespread use of single- and multiple-ratio fractional measures in existing and emerging applications.<br/><br/>The project's main goal is to develop computational approaches with the solid underlying theoretical foundation, that deliver provably good solutions and can be used to solve realistically sized instances of single- and multiple-ratio fractional combinatorial optimization problems. In order to do so, the investigators propose to systematically exploit the combinatorial structure of the feasible region and structural properties of the ratio functions to construct strong convex relaxations of the fractional combinatorial optimization problems. The investigators will also explore single- and multiple-ratio fractional combinatorial optimization problems under parameter uncertainty. The proposed research, unlike most of previous work in the related literature, does not enforce restrictive simplifying assumptions on either the combinatorial structure induced by the constraint set or the number of ratios. Furthermore, the research does not rely on assuming that the functions in the numerators and denominators of the ratios are affine.

The traditional approach is to use barriers and locks but they have several drawbacks that discourage non-expert users from writing concurrent programs. This project explores the recently emerged paradigm of transactional memory. This project explores this new paradigm in the context of the increasingly popular distributed multiprocessor systems, where concurrent tasks interact by sending messages to each other. This project establishes both theoretical as well as practical foundations. The specific goals on the theoretical foundations include developing a comprehensive set of techniques leading to impossibility results, lower bounds, and scheduling algorithms with provable performance guarantees. The specific goals on the practical foundations include developing a system, called GraphTM, that is robust enough to evaluate the designed algorithms against a wide range of benchmark applications.  Previously, this paradigm was studied mostly in the context of the symmetric multiprocessor systems, where concurrent tasks interact through reading and writing the same main memory. The main difference is the non-uniformity in memory access latency in the distributed multiprocessor systems. This non-uniformity is vital and affects not only the total execution time of all concurrent tasks but also other related network parameters such as communication cost and congestion. Therefore, the technical merit of this project is based on enhancing understanding of the effects of non-uniform latency in concurrency control through the development of new tools and techniques. <br/><br/>The outcomes of this project will have impacts on the principles and practice of concurrent programming.  Due to recent architectural and computational trends, each new generation of multiprocessor systems is having an increasing number of cores. Therefore, being able to program with concurrency will be an important and necessary skill in the future. The transactional memory paradigm is conceptually simple and it will encourage non-expert users in writing concurrent programs, reaching beyond the current use of concurrent programming only among expert users. Moreover, some results of this project will be a part of courses the PI teaches. The developed system will be made publicly available. The research results will be disseminated through presentations in major conferences, workshops, and seminars. Additionally, this project will mentor and educate K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students in concurrent programming, including female, minority, and first-generation computer science students.

This project will explore new techniques to transparently compose software into a unified enterprise, even if the individual pieces were never explicitly designed to inter-operate, similar in a way a traditional operating system managing various hardware resources for upper-layer user applications. Further, this project will contribute new ways to leverage global information for making effective local security management decisions. Finally, this project enables new innovations in programming dynamic, host-network coordinated, and intelligent security applications to protect the entire infrastructure.<br/><br/>This project will make significant contributions to how enterprise, data centers and cloud computing are securely built and managed.

These cities are often built on top of sedimentary basins which trap, focus and amplify earthquake seismic energy. Prediction of strong ground motions is critical in these areas to prevent the loss of life and property in future large events. Here, the principal investigators pioneered a new empirical approach which uses seismic ambient noise, for example generated by ocean waves, to predict large earthquake ground motions. They are also expert in 3D numerical simulations of ground-notion dynamics. The team join effort to cross-validate these approaches in the greater Los Angeles. They use ambient noise and small past-earthquake data to create a suite of large scenario earthquakes (magnitude 6.5 to 7.8) on the southern San Andreas fault. The simulations allow evaluating whether the underlying geological structure may channel earthquake waves and thereby strongly amplify the ground motions. This 2-year project will help mitigating seismic hazards in southern California. The developped methodology can be applied to other urban areas located in similar geological context. The project also supports an early career female scientist and provides training to three graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the coupling effect between the amplification due to seismic waveguides and that due to source directivity. This effect may enhance shaking intensity in sedimentary basins. The project uses southern California as a natural laboratory. Other large metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo, Mexico City, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Jakarta, are subjected to similar hazards. Here, the team innovates in using cross-validation between two state-of-the-art ground-motion prediction approaches: the ambient-noise Virtual Earthquake Approach and 3D dynamic simulations. This cross-validation allows i) establishing bounds of confidence in the two methods, ii) examining the coupling between path and source effects in enhancing ground motion, and iii) evaluating the extent of nonlinear effects on future ground motions. The novelty of the project is the unique combination of theoretical and observational seismology. In this effort, newly collected data from dense arrays including both broadband and nodal-seismic instruments will be exploited.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will explore how bacteria and fungi use chemicals they produce to interact with one another and their environment. The bacteria and fungi in this project are all derived from the remarkably stable communities of microbes that inhabit cheese rinds that are consumed around the world. Currently, there is a poor understanding of how the chemicals bacteria and fungi produce on fermented foods stabilize or destabilize the roles of the members of their communities. In the short term, this project will identify key chemicals and processes that bacteria and fungi use to interact with one another on cheese rinds. In the long term, studying these microbes will give insight into the key processes bacteria and fungi use to operate within a community. The key processes used in this relatively simple system will be extended to other complex systems to explore how microbes use their own chemistry to affect other members in their communities.  The project will create a series of K-12 outreach modules, which will raise awareness of the biochemical and microbial contributions nutritional foods.  Additional broader impacts is the training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Multispecies microbial communities (microbiomes) are important drivers of global ecosystems, human and animal health, and food production, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the formation of these communities remains a significant gap in knowledge. A contributing factor to this gap is the fact that few biological systems are available where in situ microbial communities can be deconstructed and experimentally recreated in the lab. Because of the challenges in manipulating microbiomes, very little is known about the genetic and chemical basis of species interactions. Bacteria and fungi are known to produce and dedicate a large part of their genetic material to the production of specialized metabolites. However, many of the pathways remain cryptic or have yet to be discovered because they have not been implicated in bioactivity screening. In this project innovative mass spectrometry techniques will be combined with microbial genetic and genomic techniques and a novel model community system to determine the molecular mechanisms of species interactions and how these interactions shape the formation and stability of microbial communities. This research will uncover conserved genetic pathways that underlie microbial interactions and their accompanying metabolites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Discrete geometry studies fundamental geometric objects, such as points, lines and circles, and their combinatorial properties. Thus most combinatorial problems in Discrete Geometry are quite visual and can be presented in a simple manner: What is the minimum total width of strips that cover a unit disk in the plane? Or, what is the maximum number of lines through the origin pairwise separated by the same angle? In contrast to the simple appearances of these problems, many of these problems, including the ones considered in this project, remain unsolved for an extended period or have been partly solved only recently following great efforts. This project aims to further develop the toolbox of available approaches, most of which are analytic or algebraic in nature. Simultaneously, the project integrates these research problems and themes into educational and outreach activities that extend from the high school level to the graduate.<br/><br/>The first topic of this project concerns extensions and variations of Tarski's plank problem: How to efficiently cover a convex body in the plane using planks? Generalizations of Tarski?s plank problem are central to geometric analysis and convex geometry, and continue to generate interest in the geometric and analytic aspects of coverings of a convex body. The second topic concerns equiangular lines ?- a collection of lines through the origin pairwise separated by the same angle. Investigation of the equiangular lines problem turns out to be fruitful and unearthed many challenging problems in algebraic graph theory. Solutions to some problems have practical consequences in Operational Research, Quantum Computation and Communication Theory. Previous foundational work, including some done by the PI, has shown that tools and insights from Ramsey Theory, Extremal Combinatorics, Probabilistic Methods, Spectral Graph Theory, Algebraic Combinatorics, Topological Combinatorics, and Algebraic Geometry can be helpful in solving the problems in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will answer some of the many questions remaining about tone by focusing on a language displaying a rich tonal inventory, and a typologically unexpected system of consonant patterns and vowel harmony. These features interact in complex and poorly understood ways in phrases and sentences. This project will describe and analyze these phenomena in detail with a specific emphasis on word building (morphology) and sound patterns (phonology).  The project will provide new insights into many questions remaining about tone and its scalar properties in this language, and on the behavior of complex tonal and vowel harmony systems in morphology and syntax. The results will be disseminated via journal articles on the descriptive and theoretical findings, a reference grammar and archived, annotated language data. In addition to its documentary goals, this project will support underrepresented students in international fieldwork and language documentation training. It will enhance the global competitiveness of the STEM workforce by fostering collaborative international relationships as sites of student learning.<br/><br/> <br/>This project will investigate Gubie, an understudied endangered Kru (Niger-Congo) language spoken in southwestern Cte d'Ivoire, as part of a collaborative effort by by linguists at Georgetown University, linguists at Flix Houphout-Boigny University in Abidjan, Cte d'Ivoire, and the Gubie community. Kru languages in general are underdocumented, though extant work shows that languages within the Kru family show typologically rare linguistic properties. These include: 1) complex tonal systems with four tone heights, where tone distinguishes both lexical and grammatical contrasts; 2) unexpected patterning of implosive consonants with liquid consonants like rather than stops; 3) large vowel inventories with multiple types of vowel harmony, often conditioned by morphosyntactic environment; and 4) phonologically determined noun class agreement within noun phrases. Investigating these four properties and others will increase the scientific knowledge that depends critically on these linguistic features that are not found in languages like English, Spanish or their Indo-European relatives. These patterns include such typologically rare phenomena as scalar tone alternations as the sole markers of case and aspect distinctions. Due to the atypical nature of the phonological inventory and morphological properties of Gubie, a complete understanding of the morphophonological system of the language has much to contribute to our collective understanding of the possible linguistic features of a natural language, and the theoretical tools most appropriate for modeling morphophonological phenomena. Prosodic and phonological features, like those exhibited by Gubie, are highly vulnerable as languages become more endangered, which is happening in the Gubie community.

The ability to accurately measure the production and consumption of oxygen in the marine environment is central to building an informed understanding of the past, present, and future of oxygen and Earth?s climate. Measurement of the abundance of different oxygen isotopes (i.e. oxygen-16, oxygen-17, and oxygen-18) in dissolved oxygen in seawater is a powerful analytical tool that can be used to determine the magnitude of photosynthesis and biological oxygen consumption. This is possible because biological reactions that produce or consume oxygen tend to preferentially utilize different isotopes of oxygen. This analytical tool has been used for two decades to investigate ocean primary productivity, however, there is still significant uncertainty in how biogeochemical processes such as respiration preferentially select and utilize different oxygen isotopes. To remedy this uncertainty, researchers at Harvard University will perform a lab-based calibration and sea-going field deployment of emerging oxygen isotope analyses that target molecules of oxygen that contain two rare oxygen isotopes inside of one molecule (a.k.a. ?clumps?, i.e. 17O18O and 18O18O). This work will quantify the clumped oxygen isotope signatures of several of the most consequential oxygen-involving reactions that occur in the marine ecosystem. These oxygen isotope signatures will be used to refine current methods and assumptions for the measurement of gross oxygen production in the global ocean. This research will also help train the next generation of Earth scientists through the mentorship of one graduate student and two undergraduate students. This project will also facilitate the participation of researchers in content creation for a national science competition for middle and high school students that reaches thousands of students annually. <br/><br/>The application of clumped O2 isotope measurements to dissolved oxygen in seawater is poised to give a greater mechanistic view of gross primary productivity and marine oxygen cycling than previously attainable. To realize the analytical potential of clumped oxygen isotope methods, these researchers will characterize the clumped oxygen isotope effects associated with enzyme-level reactions, whole organisms, and the marine water column. Enzyme-level studies will include isotope characterization of a terminal-O2 reductase and enzymes that metabolize reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Organism studies will target common and numerically abundant phototrophs and heterotrophs to explore the expected breadth of isotope signatures and fractionation factors in the marine water column. Marine water column dissolved oxygen samples will be collected during one of multiple candidate cruises and analyzed using both traditional triple oxygen isotope techniques and newly developed clumped oxygen isotope methods. Lastly, they will employ the results of lab-based study of clumped O2 to build a model for the interpretation of environmental data with the aim of improving the accuracy and precision of field measurements of gross primary production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team will facilitate that understanding by making use of a promising class of explanations that use counterfactual scenarios. Such explanations provide understanding by showing how outcomes change when hypothetical changes are made in factors that together serve to determine the decision outcome. As a concrete example, consider a person who applies for a loan from a financial company but is rejected by the loan distribution algorithm used by the company. To help the person understand why the decision algorithm rejected the application, the explanation algorithm would generate counterfactual scenarios in which the applicant's situation is hypothetically changed in viable ways (such as moving to a nearby city, or changing jobs) to see whether this affects the decision outcome. If this approach is successful, it would be applicable to a variety of societally critical domains where machine learning holds promise for improving decision making including healthcare, criminal justice, finance, and hiring. The project will have other impacts as well. The research team will release a public web site to engage the public with human-centered machine learning approaches. The PI will work with the University of Colorado Boulder's Science Discovery to present demos at events such as ""Family Engineering Day"" and ""Boulder Computer Science Week"". In addition to training graduate students, the PI will host high-school students as summer interns, integrate findings from the proposed work into educational activities at the University of Colorado Boulder, and make educational materials publicly available for use by instructors at other institutions. <br/><br/>This research project seeks to explain machine decisions by generating diverse and feasible counterfactuals and developing user-centered interactive processes.

Chiplet-based systems offer a promising solution by integrating small dies (chiplets) inside one package. Chiplets also enable heterogeneous integration of discrete chip architectures, such as CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, and FPGAs. However, the design of high-performance chiplet-based systems faces serious challenges: inter-chiplet communication is a critical bottleneck; resource needs to be efficiently shared among the chiplets to improve the performance-cost ratio; power and thermal management need to be optimized for better in-package integration. Consequently, such designs need to take a more holistic approach, and investigations are needed on the cross-cutting issues across the processing nodes, storage and interconnection fabric. <br/><br/>This research proposes to build ""virtual chips"" from heterogeneous aggregated chiplets, so that the system can not only reap the performance benefit of a monolithic super chip but also break the scalability bottleneck. A major outcome of the project will be a set of optimization methods that enable the design of a reconfigurable architecture, leveraging a hybrid wireless interconnection to seamlessly connect the computing and memory components. To this end, the research goals include: (1) design of reconfigurable architectures to break the chiplet boundaries for efficient resource sharing; (2) development of models to quantify interactions between the applications and hardware resources for fast design-space exploration; (3) design of a hybrid wireless interconnection network to seamlessly bridge the physical gaps between chiplets and enable reconfigurable architectures through the flexibility of wireless networks; and (4) design of novel wireless antennas to improve energy and thermal efficiency.<br/><br/>The proposed research bridges the gap between multiple layers of the design stack: hardware architectures, networks and devices. Due to its cross-cutting nature, the proposed research has the potential to transform the design of high-performance, energy-efficient and cost-effective systems that are able to meet the demand of emerging applications with growing bandwidth and performance needs.  The educational contributions of this research include integrating research with teaching and training, design of tutorials and workshops focusing on the training of future engineers, and interaction with industry to accelerate technology transfer.

This strongly motivates the need to anticipate event occurrences in advance in order to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. For example, for traffic congestion predictions based on social network reporting and traffic sensors, these methods would inform the authorities where the future congestion will occur and why certain ongoing traffic incident and congestion hot spots will worsen the problem on specific roads. In recent years, such model interpretability has attracted increasing attention as machine learning is beginning to be applied to ever more practical applications. As a domain with significant impact on society, the interpretability of spatio-temporal event forecasting models is particularly important in order to earn the trust of practitioners and become widely adopted in their everyday workflow. However, like conventional machine learning models, models for social event forecasting still primarily focus on prediction accuracy and are rapidly becoming too sophisticated and obscure to be easily understood by human operators. There is thus an urgent need to fill the increasing gap between data scientists and practitioners. To address it, this project focuses on developing a novel spatio-temporal social event forecasting framework that can jointly optimize the model accuracy and interpretability, and automatically illustrate the explanatory process of prediction generation. <br/><br/>To address challenges like spatial dependency and high-dimensional large data, the project aims at exploring the conditional independence and spatial topology to boost the sparsity of spatial dependence patterns. The project will then move on to exploit the hierarchical conjunction lattice of primitive data features to enforce the conciseness and sparsity of expository high-level representations of the data. To solve the formulated optimization problem for jointly maximizing accuracy and interpretability, this project also involves research on the corresponding optimization methods with rigorous theoretical analysis on efficiency and optimality. Finally, strategies for evaluating model interpretability in social event forecasting are systematically investigated. The success of this project will shed a light on the generic research in interpretable data mining and machine learning. The methods and tools developed in this project will help fill the gaps between data scientists and domain-specific forecasting experts. Finally, this project will provide valuable resources to support courses with new topics, datasets, techniques, and software, and gives more research opportunities for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All of these applications generate and inject a massive volume of data into the network for a wide range of complex ML/AI data analytics tasks, including but not limited to the training and/or inferences in computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, etc. However, most of the existing wireless network control and optimization algorithms rarely take the new characteristics of ML/AI data analytic traffic into considerations. Likewise, most ML/AI data analytics algorithms oversimplify the underlying wireless networks as ""bit pipes"" and ignore their complex networking and physical layer constraints, hence leading to poor overall data analytics efficiency. The overarching theme of this CAREER research program is to bridge the gap between the rapidly growing ML/AI data analytics demands and the existing networking and communication technologies. The principal investigator (PI) explore a cross-disciplinary understanding between wireless networking and data analytics through a unified research program, which consists of the development of tractable theoretical models, exploration of theoretical performance bounds and limits, and the development of low-complexity distributed algorithms and protocols that are easy to implement in practice.<br/><br/><br/>In this CAREER program, the PI will develop networking-computing co-designs to facilitate ML/AI data analytics with data and model parallelisms in wireless edge networks. The PI will focus on three complementary research thrusts, each of which addresses one key aspect in supporting distributed data analytics at a different protocol layer: (i) communication-efficient distributed optimization at the physical layer; (ii) joint-queueing-computing scheduling at the medium access control layer; and (iii) admission control and resource virtualization at the transport layer. Collectively, the results in this research contribute to a new direction of wireless network control and optimization theory and systems design. The proposed research will serve as a foundation of the next-generation wireless networking that supports a plethora of data analytics and ML/AI applications. Due to its unique scientific and engineering challenges, this research program encompasses strong and holistic expertise in mathematical modeling, optimization, control, queueing theory, stochastic analysis, as well as deep knowledge of ML/AI system operations in practice. The proposed research will support not only the networking, communications, control, and machine learning research communities, but also the general public, by developing new optimization technologies for substantially improved network and data analytics performances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, 39% of the over 600,000 highway bridges in the U.S. have exceeded their design life of 50 years. To ensure the safety and welfare of citizens, state Departments of Transportation are required to inspect bridges every two years. To make inspection and reporting objective and consistent, robots such as unmanned aerial vehicles have recently been introduced to perform autonomous surveys of bridges. These robots, equipped with cameras, will rapidly provide a large set of survey data that can be used to aid inspectors in assessing the condition of bridges. To transform these multidisciplinary topics into a new integrated bridge inspection capability, this multi-university team will develop and implement a cooperative robot-inspector system with assistive intelligence (AI) in order to make the future bridge inspection significantly faster, cheaper, safer, and more consistent. A robotic platform equipped with infrared cameras and a central processing unit with intelligent algorithms will operate in both flying and crawling modes, travel in proximity to various parts/elements of a bridge, and collect high-fidelity images of the entire bridge. Inspectors will be instrumented and monitored with a suite of wearable sensors to enable optimal robot-inspector cooperation during each bridge inspection. AI algorithms will be developed in modules to analyze the big data from human sensors and cameras in support of the pre-inspection workforce training, during-inspection element defect detection, and post-inspection condition evaluation of bridges. The robot-inspector-AI system will be integrated and validated at six bridge sites in collaboration with stakeholders.<br/><br/>This multidisciplinary project aims to explore and develop the scientific knowledge and underling methods of AI for a cooperative inspector-robot survey of bridges. The scope of work includes: (1) to develop an optimal screening-to-probing inspection strategy using fast and accurate detection of both surface and internal defects in reinforced concrete slabs (representative bridge elements) from active thermal and visible light imaging; (2) to create a causal model of inspectors? task performance to support an optimal job design, effective training, and onsite operation; (3) to develop adaptive AI algorithms with human inspectors in the loop for a rapid adaptation to future work contexts, and efficient and reliable data analyses; and (4) to enable a spatial correlation among the elements of an entire bridge with a maximum use of domain expertise, and thus improve the effectiveness and applicability of adaptive AI. The methods and technologies developed in this study will be transferred into the hands of stakeholders, researchers, policy makers, and end users (bridge inspectors) through publications, presentations, field demonstrations, and training. In particular, the world?s first bridge benchmark dataset of videos, labeled objects, and metadata established from real-world bridges, upon approval by stakeholders, will be shared with the international community via an AI-enabled bridge inspection competition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the hope is that the use of algorithms will improve societal outcomes and economic efficiency, concerns have been raised that algorithmic systems might inherit human biases from historical data, perpetuate discrimination against already vulnerable populations, and generally fail to embody a given community's important values. Recent work on algorithmic fairness has characterized the manner in which unfairness can arise at different steps along the development pipeline, produced dozens of quantitative notions of fairness, and provided methods for enforcing these notions. However, there is a significant gap between the over-simplified algorithmic objectives and the complications of real-world decision-making contexts. This project aims to close the gap by explicitly accounting for the context-specific fairness principles of actual stakeholders, their acceptable fairness-utility trade-offs, and the cognitive strengths and limitations of human decision-makers throughout the development and deployment of the algorithmic system. <br/><br/>To meet these goals, this project enables close human-algorithm collaborations that combine innovative machine learning methods with approaches from human-computer interaction (HCI) for eliciting feedback and preferences from human experts and stakeholders. There are three main research activities that naturally correspond to three stages of a human-in-the-loop AI system. First, the project will develop novel fairness elicitation mechanisms that will allow stakeholders to effectively express their perceptions on fairness. To go beyond the traditional approach of statistical group fairness, the investigators will formulate new fairness measures for individual fairness based on elicited feedback. Secondly, the project will develop algorithms and mechanisms to manage the trade-offs between the new fairness measures developed in the first step, and multiple existing fairness and accuracy measures. Finally, the project will develop algorithms to detect and mitigate human operators' biases, and methods that rely on human feedback to correct and de-bias existing models during the deployment of the AI system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computational and experimental methods are integrated in investigations that examine the genetic interactions involved in collective cell sensing. These investigations are used to produce models that advance the understanding of the nature of the cellular interactions. The models are then validated with experimental data. A better understanding of how cells cooperate will inform methods for the construction of synthetic multicellular systems that could be applied to biomanufacturing, environmental remediation or tissue formation for regenerative medicine.

Many people enthusiastically want to meet broad goals, such as health and fitness, but have trouble enacting the effortful, resource-consuming actions that are required to do so. For example, many people who are strongly committed to increasing their physical fitness may plan with all earnestness on getting to the gym every morning or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, but ultimately fail to do so. These kinds of self-control failures are common and have wide-scale consequences for mental and physical health. Psychological science has shown that to understand self-control, it is not enough to merely measure what people say they think and feel about a goal and the actions needed to get to that goal. Instead, it is necessary to also measure people's spontaneous and uncontrollable thoughts and feelings about goals and the means for achieving those goals. This type of implicit cognition can predict who will and who may not end up successfully enacting the difficult activities required to reach their goals. Laboratory experiments and a field study with high school students will improve our understanding of how people frame, strengthen, and bolster their behaviors in self-control dilemmas. The research will ultimately have applications in understanding health, education, and personal finances.<br/><br/>This project examines a neglected aspect of the psychology of self-control: people's implicit beliefs about the importance of means. In addition to knowing how much someone desires a broad goal, it is also necessary to know a person's beliefs about the importance of the actions needed to reach that goal. For example, one might greatly desire to be fit, but unless they regard the difficult actions required to become fit as important and critical, they may not enact those behaviors. The hypothesis tested across the studies in this project is that people's implicit beliefs about the importance of means will uniquely predict their success at self-control. Some of the studies use an established measure of implicit importance. Other studies develop an innovative new measure that captures people's nonconscious beliefs about the importance of goal-relevant actions. The studies also examine the self-control domains of physical fitness and academic performance among college and high school students. A final study includes high school students in underserved communities who are trying to get into college. This study follows these students across a school year, measures the students' implicit beliefs about the importance of school-related actions (using two different measures), and predicts critical outcomes such as grades and college entry. The fields of self-control and goal-pursuit might be transformed by introducing the role of implicit importance. By focusing on evidence that implicit importance predicts behavioral outcomes, this project offers the potential to advance an underdeveloped topic in the research literature on self-control.

Thus, the manganese cycle?the interconversion between bioavailable Mn ions (Mn(II)) and insoluble Mn oxide minerals (MnO2)?is globally important. Microorganisms play a significant part in driving the manganese cycle: some bacteria use MnO2 for respiration, in the process converting the mineral to dissolved Mn(II), while other bacteria can oxidize Mn(II), forming the MnO2 deposits that can be found in many environments. The latter process, biomineralization, is a less-understood field in manganese biogeochemistry. With this award, Dr. Bradley Tebo and Dr. Thomas Spiro will develop a comprehensive picture of bacterial manganese oxide biomineralization, which is essential for understanding how MnO2 are processed in nature, and how this insight might be applied to the burgeoning uses of MnO2 minerals in environmental remediation and bioenergy production. The project will enhance the training of the next generation of scientists and embrace outreach activities, including mentoring students and programs that seek to attract underserved/underrepresented middle and high school students to science majors. A set of artistic illustrations to communicate the project to a broader audience will be created and made available through various channels.<br/><br/>In many Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria, multicopper oxidase (MCO) enzymes have been implicated to be the catalysts for Mn(II) oxidation. In Mn(II)-oxidizing Bacillus species, dormant spores oxidize Mn(II) and form MnO2 minerals, catalyzed by MCOs residing in the exosporium?a complex structure that surrounds the spores. However, the molecular mechanism of MnO2 production remains to be elucidated. With the first purified bacterial manganese oxidizing complex, Mnx, and a collection of manganese-oxidizing bacteria, this project will reveal how bacteria control the formation of MnO2 nanoparticles. Specifically, investigators will characterize how the protein guides the formation of mineral units, how they are expelled into the solution and further grow to form the mineral found in nature, and how complexities of natural environment?biological matter of whole cells, complexing agents, and dissolved iron?affect the final biomineral. The project is highly leveraged through a collaborative and integrated approach of multiple state-of-the-art techniques, including cryoEM, SAXS, EXAFS, liquid-cell TEM, and computational methods to offer a unique molecular-level view of manganese oxide biomineralization. Additionally, the project will expand the use of state-of-the-art microscopic techniques, primarily used in biomedical and materials science research, to address questions of geochemical significance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will produce practice components for test and validation in a clinical setting with cardiac patients to determine their effectiveness for monitoring heart conditions. If successful, the project will provide patients and clinicians with a tool to improve health monitoring in natural environments. The research is expected to impact additive manufacturing methods, flexible electronics, health monitoring, and smart and connected communities initiatives. It will also provide training for undergraduate and graduate students and expose the next generation of scholars and workers to these technologies through a Summer Code Camp for high school students.<br/><br/>Next generation Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) must utilize resilient and reliable cyber/physical interfacing, be economically viable, and be capable of processing extremely large data automatically and reliably. Achieving this requires overcoming current technological barriers associated with seamless integration of computation and physical domains and meaningful interpretation of multimodal and multigrain data of scalable CPS. Balancing theory with experimentation, this project will: 1) produce foundational engineering process for CPS interface with thin-film flexible electronic electrodes and low cost sensors fabricated with inkjet printing; 2) develop new algorithms for autonomous processing of sensor data to detect context-aware events of interest and data reliability metric for closed-loop CPS using real-time machine learning implemented at edge; and 3) deploy CPS practice components in a real-life pilot study to explore detection of cardiac episodes and explore various closed loop feedback approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
