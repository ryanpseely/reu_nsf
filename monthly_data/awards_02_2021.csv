They are also investigating animal communities that gain energy indirectly from methane, as well as those that take advantage of carbonate rocks, the physical manifestation of methane consumption in seafloor sediments.

The goals of this study are to 1) examine the diversity of animals involved in methane-based symbioses and heterotrophic consumption of methane-oxidizing microbes and how these symbioses extend the periphery of seeps, contributing to non-seep, continental slope food webs; and 2) determine whether carbonates on the seep periphery sustain active methanotrophic microbial assemblages, providing a localized food source or chemical fuel for thiotrophic symbioses, via anaerobic oxidation of methane, or free-living, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria consumed by animals.

Gains from TDMR come from two directions, namely (i) the shingled writing mechanism whereby adjacent data tracks are written with partial overlap, like roof shingles, in order to squeeze many more tracks on the disk and increase data density, and (ii) powerful signal processing algorithms that enable efficient data recovery from noisy readback signals in the presence of high levels of interference both within and across data tracks. Techniques from machine learning (ML) will be used in developing such data recovery algorithms in the presence of two-dimensional interference, and data-dependent and colored media noise. The proposed work aims to achieve significant improvements in TDMR, eventually allowing exponentially increasing volumes of data to be stored on fewer disk drives with higher capacities. This award partially supports a PhD student to be trained in TDMR read channel design, ultimately creating career opportunities for the student in the data storage industry.<br/> <br/>The research objective is the development of efficient ML based equalization algorithms that outperform conventional communication-theoretic equalization for high density TDMR. The TDMR channel being highly nonlinear, ML approaches are expected to better learn its characteristics, potentially leading to higher bit-error rates when compared to conventional linear communication-theoretic schemes. The desired neural network equalization schemes seek to (i) incorporate the prediction and cancellation of the media noise, and (ii) be compatible with a novel read channel architecture, developed by the investigator, that extends the partial-response paradigm to the case of multitrack detection of asynchronous tracks. To realize this read channel, the developed equalizers will be followed by the rotating-target (ROTAR) algorithm, a multitrack detector of asynchronous tracks, also developed by the investigator. The resulting read channel is expected to yield gains in areal density and throughput over the communication-theoretic and single-track detection schemes currently used in the industry. The performance of the developed algorithms will be compared against that of conventional algorithms using realistic waveforms provided by international collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the lack of adequate theoretical understanding is limiting the capacity to fully exploit the potential of deep learning in realistic environments, such as in security-sensitive or resource-constrained scenarios. This project aims to provide a thorough and systematic approach to understanding why practical deep-learning models succeed, under models of the data capturing the properties of real-world problems. This project will develop such an approach and employ the revealed principles in designing more robust and efficient deep-learning methods.<br/><br/>The project will develop new theoretical models of properties of practical data leading to empirical success, and also provide frameworks for proving performance guarantees, including for learning in the presence of adversarial attacks or limited labeled data. It will also design new learning methods that are provably more robust and labeled-data efficient. This direction is still largely unexplored, despite significant recent research activities. The proposed theoretical and algorithmic solutions are possible through an interdisciplinary mix of tools from machine learning, statistics, and optimization. The proposed program is grounded in the investigator's prior work that includes both theoretical results and empirical validation. If successful, the proposed research can be transformational for modern intelligent systems by laying the foundations for further development. It will also help to solve new theoretical problems from practice that are not adequately addressed by current theory and will have lasting impacts on machine learning and optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems consists of a complex network of interactive systems that control the critical aspects of the physical world. Traditionally, these control systems have been designed for isolated environments with no communication with the outside world. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has played a key role in connecting ICS elements to the Internet. Their governing protocols, however, have not fundamentally changed to incorporate security principles into their design. There is a need for performing comprehensive security analyses on ICS protocols for their safe and secure operations over the Internet. The broader impacts include partnerships with industry, and broadening the research participation of students from underrepresented backgrounds.<br/><br/>This project aims to explore a viable path to conduct a security analysis on ICS system protocols. This is challenging as ICS systems implement a mix of closed and open-source protocols and logging all execution paths of these protocols is not feasible. The project leverages model inference techniques to gain insights into the working of ICS protocols. The key technique is to record the Finite State Machines (FSMs) of ICS protocols to infer their implementation models. The inferred model is then used to identify the protocols? states and their transitions which are then validated against the security properties for analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although many handcrafted watermarking schemes are available, these traditional methods run into difficulties due to the limited scope inherent to manual design. To implement image watermarking which adapts to the demands of increasingly diverse application scenarios, this project aims to develop novel schemes based on ideas from deep learning (DL). Two major problems will be addressed, namely (i) minimizing the requirement of domain knowledge, and (ii) achieving robustness without prior knowledge. Outcomes of this project will contribute to a new generation of robust and intelligent watermarking tools that can support cutting-edge applications such as camera scans and secured Internet-of-Things device on-boarding. The integration of the proposed research activities into university curriculum development and other educational programs will contribute to STEM education at various levels. <br/><br/>This project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in DL?based image watermarking through the development of image watermarking schemes that achieve a robust generalization of watermarking rules without requiring information about labeling, the original images, or distortions. The research agenda is structured around two complementary research activities: (i) DL?based automated image watermarking with similarity measures of distance functions, discriminator classifiers, or metric learning; and (ii) DL?based robust image watermarking that explores invariant image latent spaces and automatic rectification.

These research activities are expected to advance our understanding of watermarking on a number of fronts, namely (i) how to design deep learning components (such as architectures and layers) and novel algorithms (through similarity measures) to fully generalize image features and functions for image watermarking processes; (ii) how to design DL components to achieve robustness to different types of distortions in image watermarking, without requiring prior knowledge or adversarial examples; and (iii) how these designs can enable various novel watermarking application scenarios and use cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Varied DNNs serve as the state-of-the-art foundation and core enabler of many key applications, such as robotics, high-quality video stream processing, augmented reality, wearable devices, smart health devices, etc. Achieving high accuracy typically requires DNNs with large and complex model structures, which also translates into high computing requirements for both training and inference steps. Accelerating the training process on a modern High-Performance Computing (HPC) node or cluster and inference process on a lower-end power-efficient device have both emerged as major challenges. This project focuses on this problem, viewing DNN training and inference as HPC workloads that need to exploit available multi-level parallelism, complex memory hierarchy, and device heterogeneity; while automating the optimizations through a compiler. If this project succeeds, it will, for the first time, enable real-time machine learning for many edge devices, enabling the greater success of ML-based end applications that are important for the society, economy, and other science and engineering areas. This project will also make several contributions towards both education and improving diversity, including: (1) introducing HPC in an ML course, and ML workloads optimization experience in both undergraduate systems and graduate research courses, particularly with interesting demonstration videos; (2) outreaching to undergraduates with the goal of creating interest in (systems) research, and to K-12 with the goal of attracting underrepresented groups to computer science.<br/><br/>The key idea of this project to address the above challenge is sparsification-compilation co-design. It first introduces a general sparsification idea called fine-grained structured pruning, which prunes the weights according to certain fine-grained structures and preserves non-zero weights in a more regular way. Based on this idea, this project designs a high-level abstraction called layer-wise intermediate representation (IR) to capture the sparsity information with the goal of enabling aggressive compiler optimizations. Building on a successful application of this idea on two-dimensional DNNs, this project undertakes a comprehensive agenda to fully apply the benefits of this approach. First, it unifies Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks acceleration with a more general fine-grained structured pruning instance and a set of enhanced compiler-based automatic optimizations. Second, it improves the pruning or retraining process itself by extending the compiler optimizations from inference to pruning and exploiting domain properties to carry-out optimized application-level checkpointing. Third, it extends the (compiler automated) optimization framework to support high-dimensional and extremely deep DNNs. Finally, it explores data reuse across DNNs for situations where multiple DNNs are co-executed on the same device.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon is caused by the change in the electronic band structure of the materials at the quantum scale. Thermal radiation of quantum materials can be engineered for highly efficient waste heat recovery using nano-gap thermophotovoltaics as well as for radiative cooling and smart windows. Additionally, thermal radiation at the quantum scale has significant impact on thermal management of transistors and ultra-compact electronics. Despite this significance, how thermal radiation is emitted and exchanged at the quantum level is not well understood. This project will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying thermal radiation in the quantum regime. This research can lead to technological breakthroughs in energy harvesting and conservation. This will impact society by conserving  limited energy resources and  protecting the environment. Students with  disabilities, female students from rural areas of Maine, and high school teachers will be directly involved in this research. A new course and three lab sessions on radiative heat transfer will be developed at the principal investigator?s department.<br/><br/>Quantum size effects on thermal radiation are significant for two chief reasons. First, optical and electronic (and thus thermal radiative) properties of quantum materials (i.e., materials that are engineered at the atomic length scale) can differ drastically from bulk materials. This opens up a great opportunity for designing materials with tailored thermal radiative properties beyond the fluctuational-electrodynamics regime. Second, radiative heat transfer at the atomic length scale can play a significant role in thermal management of devices such as transistors, ultra-compact circuits, quantum computers, solar cells, and medical imagers. At atomic scale separation gaps, quantum size effects such as phonon and electron tunneling arise. These effects can modify radiative heat transfer compared to the fluctuational electrodynamics predictions. Although the effect of phonon tunneling on radiative heat transfer between two dielectric media has been studied, radiative heat transfer between metallic media in the presence of electron tunneling is not fully understood. This research project will elucidate quantum size effects on thermal radiation by (1) establishing a theoretical framework for modeling thermal radiation of quantum materials, (2) a theoretical study of thermal radiation by quantum materials of different dimensions, (3) experimental demonstration of quantum size effects on the magnitude and the spectrum of thermal emission, and (4) studying the effect of electron tunneling on radiative heat transfer at quantum-scale separation gaps.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By designing products with multiple perspectives and a longer time horizon in mind, companies can be more profitable, consumers can get better products, and environmental and social wellbeing will improve. Current sustainable design methods focus on individual phases of the product life cycle (e.g., production, use, disposal), decisions of particular stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, consumers, policy makers), or specific sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon footprint, water consumption, particulate emissions). This project goes beyond these focused methods by developing a holistic approach to sustainable design that accounts for all life cycle phases, stakeholders, and sustainability outcomes, using tools and techniques from the systems engineering and engineering design research communities. This holistic approach is expected to lead to more comprehensive and ubiquitous sustainable design practices, as well as business strategies and policies that influence long-term environmental, social, and economic sustainability from a systems perspective. Additionally, by enhancing the quality and availability of related educational materials at various levels, and by better understanding how people think about sustainability, the pipeline of students and professionals will be better prepared to address complex sustainability challenges.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to enable simultaneous consideration of a product?s relevant life cycle stages, sustainability metrics, stakeholder needs, and subsystem analyses in Design for Sustainability (DfS) by leveraging systems modeling and coordination techniques from the Design for Market Systems (DMS) and Concurrent Engineering (CE) fields. The research approach will: (1) assess coordination and modeling strategies from CE and DMS to connect sustainability-related design parameters and stakeholder decision-making across the product life cycle; (2) investigate the application of CE approaches to measure coupling strength across these decision parameters, life cycle phases, metrics, and models; and (3) survey practitioners to elicit and validate real-world sustainable design needs. This will lead to a new holistic approach that facilitates the design of more sustainable and successful products and systems. To improve knowledge transfer and accessibility of sustainable design concepts with a broad audience of students and professionals, this project includes three interconnected education and outreach activities: (1) raise awareness of sustainable design and systems thinking among pre-college students through a new GK-12 partnership program; (2) disseminate and iteratively update the Holistic Sustainable Design approach through a project-based graduate course; and (3) assess sustainable design thinking across diverse groups of individuals. These education and outreach activities will lead to new validated techniques for teaching sustainable design at various levels, student-generated case studies to support the research framework, and a foundational understanding of how people approach sustainability-related decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications include structural mechanics, epidemiology, image processing, medical imaging, search-engine technology, modeling of population dynamics, and stability of numerical algorithms. Eigenvalue problems are often challenging to solve, as solutions can generally only be found by generating sequences of successive approximations. This work will develop efficient, robust and theoretically sound technologies that will accelerate convergence to solutions of matrix and tensor eigenvalue problems. In response to the increased prevalence of remote-learning, the integrated educational plan will develop stand-alone apps to aid in the delivery of standard and advanced topics in numerical analysis and linear algebra. The apps developed will include exposition of ideas and methods closely related to the research program.<br/><br/>The technical aim of this work is the development and analysis of both novel and long-standing extrapolation techniques for eigenvalue problems. Extrapolation techniques are low-cost methods that combine a history of iterates and update steps to form the next approximation in a sequence. In this work they will be used to accelerate convergence of power-type iterations for challenging matrix and tensor eigenvalue problems. The main components of the research for matrix problems are development of novel methods that (1) damp multiple modes simultaneously; (2) resolve multiple modes simultaneously; and (3) extend the target problem class to indefinite matrices. For tensor problems, the main outcomes will be (1) development and convergence analysis of methods that accelerate robust but linearly converging power-type iterations; (2) extensions to accelerated versions of adaptively-shifted power-type iterations and generalized problems; and (3) studies on stability and clustering, and the development of fast techniques to capture complete sets of eigenvalues.

Examples of wave turbulence occur in classical surface water waves and also in quantum dynamical systems involving a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Even though wave fields describing the processes of random wave interactions in nature are enormously diverse, there is a common mathematical framework that models and describes the dynamics of spectral energy transfer through probability densities associated with weakly non-linear interactions in quantum or classical wave systems. The probability densities are solutions of wave kinetic (WK) equations, whose nonlocal interaction operators are of kinetic type. This project aims to tackle open challenges in the theory of nonlinear waves via the study of the associated wave turbulence theory. An integral part of the project is its educational component and the opportunities to involve students from all levels in the research. To this end, the principal investigator will organize summer schools for underrepresented and disabled K-12 students, design graduate courses on Partial Differential Equations, Wave Turbulence and Statistical Physics, and organize an undergraduate and graduate research internship program of excellence and a mathematics-physics conference for young researchers. In addition, the principal investigator will participate in the NSF RTG SMU summer undergraduate research program, with participants from both SMU and Texas Rio Grande Valley University (a Hispanic-serving institution) as well as the SMU Hamilton Undergraduate Research Scholars and the SMU Undergraduate Research Assistant Programs.<br/> <br/>This project concentrates on three main topics in WT theory. The first topic is to study the rigorous justification of 3-wave kinetic equations, by the Feynman diagrammatic approach.  The second topic is to establish a mathematical foundation for the Garrett-Munk spectrum of the ocean, using the renormalization group method. The third topic is the proof of the finite time formation of singularities of solutions to the finite temperature BEC system, with the addition of a new, previously missing, collision operator derived by Yves Pomeau and the principal investigator.

Their opposite charge causes the two kinds of polyelectrolytes, which can be very different from each other, to nevertheless attract each other and form an intimate mixture, or complex. An important example of a polyelectrolyte complex is the chromosome, which contains DNA, which is a negatively charged polymer and hence repels itself.  Nature therefore uses positively charged proteins to bind to the DNA and bundle it into the compact shape of the chromosome. Among the many other examples of polyelectrolyte complexes are biological membranes, underwater adhesives, drug delivery vehicles, and food processing agents. Despite their importance and the growing interest in them for advanced applications, basic understanding of how to control their structure and mechanical properties remains undeveloped. The proposed work focuses on measurements of the mechanical properties of these complexes, such as their viscosity and stiffness, and computer simulations to determine how these properties are controlled by the composition, including the polyelectrolytes, salts, and pH.  Understanding the relationship between the composition and mechanical properties will provide deep insight into why complexes have the properties they do, and how to design these properties for future applications. There may also be connections to biological function, which are affected by the micro-mechanical properties of these complexes.  The research will be integrated with education of graduate and undergraduate students, outreach, and creation of software.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The PI and his group will measure the linear rheology of polyelectrolyte coacervates of widely varying composition and containing different salts, and seek to test time-temperature, time-salt, time-hydration, and time-pH superpositions that allow data to be collapsed onto approximate ?master curves.? Specifically, they will measure the linear rheological properties of polycations poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium) with polyanions poly(acrylic acid) and poly(styrene sulfonate), and with salt ions Na+ or K+, and Cl- or Br-. They will explore the surprising differences and anomalies among coacervates, depending on the polyelectrolytes, salts, and the chain lengths used, including an asymmetry in relaxation time produced by changing the molecular weight of polyanion vs. polycation, anomalous dependence of viscosity on degree of polymerization, and  a low-frequency plateau modulus for some, but not all, coacervates. The systematic approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of the key determinants of rheological behaviour and overcome the limitations of existing data sets. They will also carry out molecular dynamics simulations to determine the nature of the local interactions among polyelectrolytes and salt ions that determine the rates of relaxation. This will be done in part through development of novel time correlation functions to determine whether local monomer diffusion is governed by ion-pairing dynamics, or by collective ?glassy? dynamics, or some mixture of the two.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graphite is a familiar example.  We now know how to isolate and measure one, two, or any number of such sheets in controllable combinations.  Discovered only in 2017, magnetic vdW layers will become the building blocks for novel quantum materials with numerous potential technological applications, starting with data storage.  In the near future, these materials may give engineers control over the quantum of magnetism, called spin, leading to additional applications in the nascent field of two-dimensional spintronics.  They may also exhibit ""topological"" order, which is robust against impurities and imperfections, making them suitable for applications in quantum computers.<br/><br/>The magnetic properties of vdW (i.e. two-dimensional) materials are different from those of bulk (three-dimensional) materials, creating new avenues for physics exploration.  The chemical composition of monolayers, multilayers and heterostructures (stacks of different types of layers) of vdW magnets can be tuned to design novel materials with desirable and potentially surprising properties.  The resulting number of candidate vdW monolayers, multilayers and their heterostructures is combinatorially large, with estimates far exceeding trillions of vdW materials.  Consequently, inspecting the entire set of possible combinations using experiments or direct computational simulations is impossible.  Nevertheless, the challenge of searching for new materials with desirable properties can be mitigated with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).  This project will leverage AI to search for new vdW materials with novel spin and topological properties.  In addition, AI will be harnessed to provide physical insight into the microscopic origins of spin order and topological order in these materials.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary research will train scientists at different stages of their careers to apply AI tools to their own research.

Novel spin phenomena in van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures are at the forefront of condensed-matter-physics research.  In particular, new behavior may emerge from an interplay between magnetic and topological order in vdW heterostructures.  It is well known that topological states emerge when electron spins are confined to two dimensions.  When two or more distinct monolayers are combined into a heterostructure, surprising behavior may arise, such as enhanced topological order or the formation of spin textures.  An estimate for the total number of vdW materials, multilayers and heterostructures is ~10^{21}.  This vast search space is overwhelming for first-principles calculations and experimental probes alone.  The project combines density-functional-theory calculations with new artificial-intelligence (AI) tools to facilitate efficient navigation through this large materials space.  The goals are to discover novel materials and to gain physical insight into spin properties and emerging phenomena of vdW materials at the electronic level.  This insight will pave the way to a fundamental understanding of how crystal structure influences magnetic properties in 2D materials, including monolayers, multilayers and heterostructures.  The AI architectures the research team develops will find use in other areas of condensed matter physics and the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>The research is interdisciplinary and will connect scientists and topics that span diverse areas.  Concepts from physics may enable advances in AI and vice versa.  Furthermore, the 2D materials discovered through this work will provide experimentalists with a materials playground in which to study novel and emergent spin properties.  In addition, the proposed research will have potential impact in industry - e.g., data storage and other spintronics applications, facilitating future memory technologies.  This research may also help create advances in future computer architectures, such as those for quantum computing.<br/><br/>This project will train scientists at different stages of their careers to apply AI tools to their own research.

The issues are more crucial when dealing with complex large-scale systems (for example, those arising in ocean and coastal modeling). The goal of this project is to advance the efficiency and fidelity of local time-stepping algorithms for multiscale multiphysics systems with application to multi-resolution simulations of large-scale geophysical flows. The developed algorithms will efficiently capture the wide range of scales in both space and time to produce accurate and robust simulations of these systems over a long period of time. The research plan is closely integrated with the educational activities of the project which include (i) developing curricular modules in computational mathematics at the Auburn University Summer Science Institute, an educational enrichment program for high school students, to provide young students early exposure to applied mathematics and inspire them to pursue a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); and (ii) providing interdisciplinary applied mathematics education and research training for both undergraduate and graduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Technically, the Principal Investigator will develop accurate and effective hybrid local time-stepping algorithms based on nonoverlapping domain decomposition: on the one hand, explicit schemes with local time steps are used to model processes at small time scales without suffering a severe restriction on the time step size dictated by the global CFL condition. On the other hand, localized exponential time integrators are employed to enable large time step sizes for processes occurring at slow speeds, and to accelerate the computation of matrix exponentials and their products by performing these calculations locally and in parallel. Three main research objectives will be pursued: (i) development and analysis of nonoverlapping localized exponential time differencing methods for stiff nonlinear equations; (ii) study of hybrid local time-stepping algorithms for various heterogeneous problems; and (iii) application of these algorithms to the three-dimensional primitive equations for modeling ocean/atmosphere circulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With direct detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from Advanced LIGO and Virgo, it is now possible to test GR in the fully nonlinear, dynamical, strong-field regime when black holes (BHs) merge with each other.  Gravitational-wave detection also opens the possibility to observe more subtle aspects of GR, like the permanent deformation to spacetime (""memory"") after a GW passes.  Both these new tests and the subtle effects of memory require higher precision predictions and more careful calculations than before.  Specifically, to carry out precision tests of GR requires performing supercomputer simulations of merging BHs, both in GR and in theories beyond GR. One aspect of improving the precision of tests of GR is gaining a deeper understanding of subtle effects in GR simulations, such as the fundamental coordinate freedom in GR, that makes it more difficult to compare between independent simulations.  Part I of the research component of this award is to better understand these GR subtleties.  As for simulations beyond GR, the PI and collaborators have developed a technique for classes of theories that are ""close"" to GR, but these simulations have not yet been advanced to the level of sophistication of GR simulations.  Part II of the research component of this award will advance the state of the art of beyond-GR simulations.  Simultaneously and independently, the educational component of this award will support development of interactive visualization to help educators teach GR and GWs to a broader audience.  These interactive tools will be made available online to reach beyond classroom education.<br/><br/>Part I of the research component consists of studies intending to push numerical relativity waveforms to higher precision, not by improving resolution or simulation methods, but rather by capturing a number of subtle effects.  These studies include: (i) high-precision multi-mode quasinormal ringdown fits, especially for precessing systems, with the goal of ultimately building a ringdown surrogate model; (ii) developing a framework for comparing waveforms after modeling out by transformations of the Bondi?Van der Burg?Metzner?Sachs (BMS) group, for apples-to-apples comparisons between simulations performed in different gauges, and for better hybridization with post-Newtonian or effective-one-body waveforms; (iii) statistically validating BMS (non-)conservation laws; and (iv) explaining the existence of an approximate symmetry of outgoing radiation from quasi-circular binary inspirals.  Part II of the research component focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art in simulating binary BH mergers beyond-GR theories of gravity.  This program includes: (i) bringing generation of beyond-GR waveforms into ""production"" mode; (ii) controlling the growth of secular effects (due to using perturbation theory) by applying the numerical dynamical renormalization group; (iii) building a surrogate model for beyond-GR waveforms; and (iv) validating this machinery by applying it to scalar-tensor theory, which can also be treated without recourse to perturbation theory.  Finally, the educational component involves producing interactive visualizations to help teach the principles of GR and GW physics.  These interactive visualizations will include particles orbiting around BHs, how GWs deform spacetime, how GWs get projected onto LIGO antenna patterns, and even how GWs from a BBH change as the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are varied.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reconfigurability and heterogeneity of accelerators, together with stringent performance requirements and complex dependencies in real-time workloads, bring daunting operational challenges. These issues, if left unaddressed, would slow down scientific discovery and waste lots of computing resources and energy. This project will develop a heterogeneity and reconfigurability aware framework to accelerate real-time artificial intelligence and machine learning without hurting other workloads. It will benefit the society by improving the efficiency of costly computing systems, which saves taxpayers' money and better utilize existing investments. Real-time artificial intelligence and machine learning powered by the framework can better serve the society, e.g., accelerating scientific discovery and enabling data-driven control. The project will bring innovative education, outreach and training opportunities for both academic and industrial participants to train the next generation of researchers and practitioners for the society.<br/><br/><br/>Today, managing heterogeneous and reconfigurable systems for diverse workloads with high resource utilization and performance guarantee is an extremely challenging task.

Global and local optimization will be used to accommodate multiple types of workloads and the configuring, partitioning, placement, scheduling, and execution of models in each workload. The developed framework will provide provable performance even with partial information in unknown environments, which is urgently needed due to the ever increasing system complexity and volatility in workloads. Novel global resource allocation policies will be developed based on optimization techniques in this project to provide performance guarantee such as fairness, strategyproofness, and Pareto efficiency.

Study of geometric singularities is important in mathematics and has application to mathematical models for a wide range of important physical, social, and economic systems. Researchers have long known that important types of singularities in classical geometric settings also appear naturally when studying geometric shapes in modular (or clock) arithmetic. In fact, algebraic geometry in the clock arithmetic setting is a key component of modern communications infrastructure. This project aims to develop a theory of singularities in mixed characteristic, a middle ground between the classical and clock arithmetic worlds (that possesses aspects of both). The project also aims to develop geometric applications of this theory and to develop open-source software to study singularities in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. <br/><br/>Techniques developed in number theory and arithmetic geometry have given rise to numerous recent breakthrough results in mixed characteristic commutative algebra.

The project includes two main educational efforts. The first is the creation of working groups for incoming graduate students; its goal is to prepare the students to develop a strong set of skills to apply for grants and to prepare them for teaching.

In the last few decades, this conversation has led to a fruitful exchange centered on the role of higher algebra (such as category theory and homotopical algebra) in quantum field theory (QFT). It has transformed and enlarged our view of QFT, and thus it plays an active role not only in the farther reaches of particle theory, but also in the concrete discoveries of condensed matter physics, notably in topological states and phases of matter. A recent innovation from this exchange is factorization algebras, which appear naturally in physics as the observables of field theories (both classical and quantum) but originally appeared in mathematics. This project explores the power of this tool  in the setting of 4-dimensional gauge theories. To pursue goals of this research, the Principal Investigator will collaborate with both mathematicians and physicists. This kind of interdisciplinary effort is an inspiring and motivating aspect of this area of research,  but effective communication is often difficult because, despite the long-running relationship of mathematics and physics, each community has its own prerogatives and modes of discourse. A key component of this project is thus to offer chances for researchers at all levels to become fluent in speaking to both disciplines and, moreover, to build direct personal bridges. At the graduate and postdoctoral level, the project will run annual summer schools for both mathematicians and theoretical physicists, focused on topics of mutual interest. In addition, each academic year, it will produce high-quality, online masterclasses by experts about such topics, with lecture notes and exercises. Finally, the project will support summer research for undergraduates, tackling problems between mathematics and physics,  from the University of Massachusetts and nearby Five Colleges.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project orbits around two foci. The first is the study of holomorphic theories on complex surfaces, particularly those related to moduli of holomorphic G-bundles.  The PI will pursue analogs of relationships between affine Lie algebras, moduli of bundles, and chiral CFT, which involve holomorphic theories on Riemann surfaces.  The long-term target is a holomorphic version of Seiberg duality (arising from N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories), which bears natural analogies to mirror symmetry. This first project uses a toolkit, developed by the PI with collaborators, for constructing BV quantization of holomorphic field theories and then analyzing their factorization algebras of observables. The second focus involves topological theories on manifolds with boundaries and corners, where the long-term target is a rigorous demonstration of the Frenkel-Gaiotto conjecture about how vertex algebras and ribbon categories arise from the Kapustin-Witten gauge theories, which play a key role in the physical approach to the geometric Langlands correspondence. This second project will approach the conjecture using both global methods (by developing, via derived algebraic geometry, the AKSZ procedure with manifolds with boundaries and corners, and thence a higher categorical deformation quantization) and perturbative methods (building upon an extension of the BV/factorization package for field theories on manifolds with boundary, which yields stratified factorization algebras of observables).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples are Japanese swords and Damascus steels. Current manufacturing methods can produce layered structures on a large-scale by bonding separate metals through rolling, but with limited improvements in mechanical properties. Recent studies demonstrated the applicability of severe metal deformation techniques, which introduce high pressure and mechanical shearing to refine the microstructure of metal composites and greatly increase their strength, but the non-continuous nature of these techniques has been a barrier to scale-up and commercialization. This award supports fundamental research needed for the development of a continuous manufacturing process to produce high strength nanocrystalline sheet metals. This project uses a new cold angular rolling processing, which employs a single roller for shearing and compressing metals in a continuous process to create layered nanocrystalline sheets. The value of this process comes through efficient bonding and microstructural modification of low-cost sheet metals in a continuous, energy-efficient process. The project increases U.S. metal manufacturing capability to design and manufacture nanostructured alloys with superior properties for applications requiring lightweight structural metals, promoting the progress of science and advancing national prosperity and economy. University students engaged in this research are being prepared for careers in advanced materials engineering and manufacturing in research laboratories and industries.<br/><br/>Non-ferrous metals, including aluminum and magnesium alloys, have a broad range of industrial applications, but they typically suffer from low mechanical strength and poor fatigue resistance. To enable broad use of lightweight ultrafine-grained metals and alloys, there is a critical need for the development of a continuous processing method to simultaneous bond and refine the microstructure of bulk lightweight alloys. This project uses a new cold angular rolling process (CARP) which combines equal-channel angular pressing and single-roller cold rolling in a single-step enabling the production of continuous sheets of hierarchically structured, nanocrystalline alloy sheets without any length limitations. To further improve the refinement of the microstructure and increase in material properties, the project uses layers of dissimilar metals to incorporate interface-induced plastic deformation. By combining CARP, finite element method (FEM), and microstructure and mechanical property characterization, the project provides new fundamental knowledge of (i) relationships between stress-strain state and the microstructure, (ii) interface-induced flow, plastic deformation, and tribomaterial formation, and (iii) microstructure and mechanical properties that develop in layered metallic tribomaterials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three other major coastal cities?Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban?have also felt increased stress on their water supply and sanitation infrastructure, a growing issue thanks to climate change and underfunded infrastructural maintenance. This project responds to this crisis by exploring the history of water management and its relationship to public health in these four major port cities of British-occupied Cape Colony and Natal between 1850 and 1910. While scholars in public health and sociology have examined how municipal administrators and urban residents manage cities? clean and wastewater, few have considered them together. This research establishes how both residents and governments construct ideas about how to control urban sanitation and water supply. Water is a valuable resource to understand municipal public health priorities because of its widespread necessity and increasing scarcity.  This project examines the relationship between municipal authorities and urban residents to illuminate the colonial legacies of water management and infrastructure in these cities. It aims to help those municipalities, among others, better understand the different perspectives and voices involved in clean and wastewater management.<br/><br/>The main goals of this project are to reveal how municipal and resident actions come into conflict or cooperate with one another; explore how colonial municipalities and their residents use definitions of sanitary water in daily public health prevention; and demonstrate how and why the non-human environment complicates and influences sanitary engineering and infrastructure. The project addresses these goals by using historical methods to analyze documents from the Western Cape Archives and the UK National Archives, including correspondence, resident petitions, public health and nuisance inspector reports, municipal statutes, newspaper articles, and municipal committee reports. These sources uncover administrative and resident perspectives across the four cities that depict the day-to-day realities of water supply and management. In doing so, this project exposes the racial, class, and gendered interests and values driving water use and management. It deepens our understanding of public health by addressing how disease outbreaks and water shortages create the need for more efficient and better-maintained drainage and water delivery infrastructure. This is a pressing issue in postcolonial cities, where municipalities often continue to use infrastructure built under colonial governments and thus reckon with its legacies. The project expands on environmental studies by showing how the natural world?plants, animals, and other non-human phenomena?is constantly present in the decisions people make, particularly when it threatens elements like water that are necessary to a city?s existence. Ultimately, this research demonstrates that it takes cooperation and understanding between administrators and residents to recognize and redress disproportionate access and delivery of utilities to municipal inhabitants, particularly the most vulnerable members of society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even in cities, sites where biomedicine has allegedly taken hold, there is a growing interest in medical alternatives. This contemporary phenomenon challenges the teleological framework of traditional histories of medicine that have long been interested in explaining the emergence of biomedicine, the professionalization of medicine, and relatedly, the medicalization of society, and calls for a longer examination of the history of folk medicine. Following a long tradition of scholarship that questions unilinear narratives of scientific or medical modernity, this project argues that folk healers were, and remain to be, essential medical providers. Progress narratives that have presented them as superseded or ousted by the professional doctor are always created retrospectively by historians and fall into the trap of teleology. This project establishes a conversation between past and present to investigate how present-day concerns shape the knowledge that is produced about the history of folk medicine, and conversely, how the past resonates in the lives of its current practitioners. <br/><br/>This longitudinal study reconstructs the lives of unlicensed midwives, healers, and surgeons, people who provided the bulk of medical care before the rise of biomedicine in towns and villages where there were few or no doctors. Three main questions drive this research: First, who provided the lion's share of medical care regionally before the rise of biomedicine, and what were the key medical practices involved that have so far eluded historical analysis? Second, how did race and gender shape the medical interventions of folk healers? And third, how do contemporary narratives of scientific modernity inform the ways of understanding the history of folk medicine? This project focuses on the role of midwives, healers and surgeons as medical experts in criminal trials, civil trials, and their participation in municipal councils, all instances in which they provided medical certifications to townspeople. Drawing on qualitative data gathered in multiple archives, this project analyzes how diverse actors (patients, judges, lawyers, and witnesses) upheld ideas of proper/improper behavior according to gender and race ideologies, and how medical practitioners challenged or reproduced such imaginaries in their medical practice. This project supplements archival research with interviews involving current folk healers, in order to reflect on: 1) how they conceive of the body, disease, and healing today; 2) how they understand their own past and history. In doing so, this study aims to articulate the role of gender and race in the construction of medical expertise, and to elucidate how present-day concerns shape the knowledge that is produced about the past, and how the past resonates in the present.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Domestic accidents make up over half of these totals. Despite the centrality of physical hazards to domestic life, historians have generally left the subject of home accidents to researchers from sociology and public health. Using the term ?safety work? as shorthand, this project reveals how experts and laypeople tried to control mishaps and their consequences over time. It charts the history of domestic accidents and safety work from 1900 to 1980, analyzing how and why public health education, voluntary product standards, and markets for insurance and consumer appliances came to delineate American risk management. This research describes how corporations and nonprofits established influential models for accident prevention research and policy and presents new insights into the changing realities and cultural meanings of risk and responsibility. Even as Americans have become more conscious of household risks, the burden of injury prevention continues to fall heavily on citizen-consumers. Ordinary men and women shop for ?safe? products; install and repair equipment; review the latest safety advice; and perform many other tasks to keep their homes running smoothly. This project considers the historical limitations of this individualized approach to accident management and illustrates the benefits of state-centered alternatives like strict presale product regulation and subsidies for childcare and home nursing. Discussing this history with policymakers and public health practitioners has the potential to bolster existing consumer protection laws and to expand government aid programs. <br/><br/>Drawing on trade catalogues, advertisements, insurance policies, magazines, case histories, product safety tests, warning labels, and other sources, this research interprets domestic accidents as part of a longer sequence of events from risk prevention to long-term recovery or disability. This project analyzes shocks, burns, falls, and choking to make four related interventions. First, its stress on safety work recenters the study of accidents on the home and the lives and labor of ordinary Americans. It represents mishaps less as results of fate or individual carelessness than as predictable byproducts of overwork and the complexity of domestic space. Second, this project clarifies how safety concerns became embedded within markets for insurance and consumer products, which left households to buy physical and mental security from for-profit corporations. Third, work itself is redefined to include learning about common hazards and shopping for ?safe? appliances, factoring self-education and consumption into the labor of risk management. Finally, it shows how experts papered over differences between communities with distinct racial, economic, and geographical profiles to make middle-class white suburbia the ?one-size-fits-all? model solution for home accident prevention. Overall, this project analyzes how Americans kept up with new safety practices and technologies and why they did or did not follow available social prescriptions for safe living. Accidents manifested not only as causes but also as effects of housework and compelled stakeholders to reconcile the ideal of the home-as-sanctuary with its risky and toilsome reality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project aims to further develop systematic rules for understanding and counting such pseudoholomorphic curves in a large class of physical systems, by establishing formulae reducing the study of area-minimizing surfaces of different shapes (spheres, surfaces with many holes, etc.) to the study of a simpler type of area-minimizing surfaces (disks), and subsequently by understanding the degree to which such latter counts (of disks) can be assembled from a decomposition of the physical system into elementary pieces. Applications will be studied to mirror symmetry, a far-reaching geometric duality first discovered in string theory involving (on one side) counts of such curves. The educational component of the project aims to create a series of online virtual research activities in symplectic geometry and related areas, including organization of a virtual seminar (ongoing), workshops, and mini-courses.

Dick of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill aims to develop an innovative approach to the synthesis of high entropy alloy nanoparticles at room temperature.  High entropy alloy nanoparticles contain five or more equimolar metallic elements homogenously distributed through the particle.  Such nanoparticles may display unusual chemical properties and have implications in catalysis, energy storage and conversion devices.  However, it is challenging to synthesize these nanoparticles at room temperature with precise control of their shape, size, compostion, and surface coverage on different substrates.  Dr. Dick's group is developing a novel electrochemical methodology to deposit high entropy alloy nanoparticles on conductive surfaces at room temperature.  This research strives to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the electrodeposition process in order to enable precisel control of the nanoparticle structure and properties.  Students working on this project will gain experience in synthesizing nanomaterials. Students will also use state-of-the-art nanoscience tools to study high entropy alloy nanoparticles and reactivity. This project will enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities through the Nanomaterials Outreach via Education, Research, and Scientific Engagement (NANOVERSE) program.  The NANOVERSE program will engage students in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in North Carolina.  The workshop activities are designed to inspire them to pursue graduate work in nanoscience, electrochemistry, and materials science. Finally, the NANOVERSE program will give secondary education STEM teachers resources to introduce students to nanoscience in their high school classrooms. <br/><br/>The Electro-Shock synthesis being developed involves the electrodeposition of high entropy alloy nanoparticles from metal salt precursors in sub-femtoliter water droplets that are suspended in a non-aqueous phase.  The overarching goal of this project is to understand the electrodeposition mechanism and factors that influence the nanoparticle shape, size, morphology, microstructure and surface coverage. A high level of control requires a detailed understanding of the reactivity and the boundary between the water droplet, the oil continuous phase, and the electrode surface. The first goal is to understand and quantify the nucleation and growth mechanisms at the single nanoparticle level and probe ion transfer thermodynamics and kinetics. The second goal is understanding the effect of surfactant, applied potential, and annealing on nanoparticle morphology and microstructure. The third goal is probing substrate effects and how surfaces influence the nanodroplet geometry and the resulting high entropy alloy nanoparticle. These results could have broad implications on the fields of electrocatalysis, energy storage and conversion, nanomaterials, and next-generation biosensors that take advantage of high entropy alloy nanoparticles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyzing these structures can tell us who is well-connected, who is important in the network, and more advanced structural properties like how information will flow through the network. Yet, these analyses are typically conducted without references to where the network is located in geographic space. Mapping the locations of the people or organizations (nodes) in a social network and the relationships between them (edges) allows us to measure new properties such as obstacles to meeting, important nearby facilities, and paths of knowledge and information flow across space. Using models, technologies and methods from Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Social Network Analysis (SNA), the project will create a public Spatial Social Network (SSN) data repository that includes SSNs from a wide variety of subjects including epidemiology, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, organization science, and public health. In addition to the data, the project will develop new models and statistical tests to help better understand these networks. To help promote and communicate the study of SSNs, the investigator will lead the development of educational and research infrastructure through software, tutorials, curriculum guidance and the support of an online community of SSN researchers. <br/><br/>This Faculty Early-Career Development (CAREER) award will support the investigation of how the features of the built environment and physical environment play a role in how social networks form and develop, and the relationships that ensue within the provisions of geographic space. The investigator will fuse both SNA and GIS principles by measuring node and graph properties, and linking these properties to environmental features for simultaneous assessment (e.g. hot spots and network centrality). She will compare real SSNs to simulations of those networks based on principles of movement, distance decay, city formation and the urban hierarchy, as well as social network characteristics such as preferential attachment, structural holes and small-world models. This research will show how choices in scale, scope, sampling, and simplification affect statistical results, and design best practices for analyzing and modeling social networks in geographic space.

This project also emphasizes the visualization of SSNs on maps, which helps both exploratory spatial data analysis and engagement with a broad audience.

From the cytoskeleton within cells up to animal swarms and flocks, nature abounds with examples of collective organization and collective motion with critically important functions, such as cell division and foraging for food. Recently, insights from statistical and soft materials physics have helped to uncover general principles underlying such collective behaviors across many size scales and species. This physics of active matter, because of its wide applicability, is guiding the design of new, advanced materials that mimic functionalities of living systems, such as the capability to sense their environment, internally rearrange, move, divide, or self-heal. <br/><br/>Active nematics constitute one prominent class of active matter, with examples including intracellular biofilament assemblies, colonies of growing or swarming bacteria, and tissues of epithelial or neural stem cells. Two basic factors unite these diverse systems: the active forces exerted by each unit, for example a cell or biofilament, along an axis of extension or contraction, and the tendency for neighboring units to align their long axes in parallel, like a crowded collection of tree logs floating on a river. This latter phenomenon, known as nematic order, can be interrupted at certain locations by topological defects, which are point-like or thread-like places within the nematic where the neighboring units unavoidably fail to align. Like a vexing bump in a rug, topological defects can be moved around or combined, but cannot be smoothed out of existence except by special operations such as moving them out to a boundary. In active nematics, far from being vexatious, topological defects are fundamental to the emergent collective motion: Active forces continually produce and destroy topological defects, whose chaotic motions continually rearrange the underlying, force-exerting units. <br/><br/>Therefore, in order to understand active nematics in biology and exploit these phenomena in life-mimicking technologies, it is imperative to understand the creation, motions, and effective interactions of topological defects. Significant progress has been made in recent years on this front for thin layers of active nematics. However, the behavior of topological defects becomes substantially more complicated in fully three-dimensional systems, which presents a challenge for developing robust technologies based on active nematic physics. To address this challenge, the principal investigator and his research team will develop a computationally guided theoretical understanding of active nematic dynamics in 3D, with topological defects as the central focus. This research will uncover the rules governing how thread-like topological defects are born, reshape themselves, and eventually merge with other defects or disappear. In turn, these findings will reveal the defect-driven rearrangements of active nematic material, illuminating how the material responds to stimuli such as damage or a change of chemical environment. The understanding gained from this project will guide experimental investigations of phenomena universal to diverse 3D active nematic systems in nature, and will enable design of advanced materials capable of autonomous functional responses with a wide range of applications in biomedical, industrial, and consumer devices. <br/><br/>The PI and his research group will design and lead education and outreach activities closely integrated with the research project. Modeling of nematics is incorporated into a new graduate course on Advanced Soft Matter and Statistical Physics at the University of California, Merced. Professional development workshops build undergraduates? skills in critically analyzing, visualizing, and writing about scientific data. Additionally, outreach to high-school students in California?s San Joaquin Valley employs soft matter computer simulation activities as accessible, relatable, and visually appealing introductions to physics research and scientific computation.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research on topological defect lines in three-dimensional (3D) nematic liquid crystals, together with an integrated program of education and outreach incorporating soft matter research. The research goal is to understand both equilibrium structure and non-equilibrium active dynamics of 3D nematics, through development of a coarse-grained theory for interaction and motion of curvilinear disclination defects. This goal is motivated in part by the recent demonstration of a bulk-3D active nematic model system, exhibiting creation and annihilation of topologically neutral disclination loops along with a network of disclination lines. This project, employing a coarse-grained framework for disclination geometry alongside relaxational and active-hydrodynamic computational modeling, will calculate effective pair potentials governing deformation and reorientation of nearby disclinations. Hydrodynamic calculations will illuminate how and why activity causes disclinations to curve, stretch, reconnect, and change winding character. Fundamental properties of the 3D active steady state will be determined, including chaotic self-mixing and the disclination network?s continual topological self-reconfiguration. <br/><br/>The perspective of disclinations as active quasiparticles has been central to understanding active nematic chaotic dynamics in 2D. As exploration begins of the 3D case, a major challenge is the far greater complexity of topological defects: While 2D disclinations have fixed winding numbers such as +1/2 and ?1/2, in 3D these winding geometries can continuously transform into one another, as seen both in active defect loops and in heterogeneous defects of equilibrium nematics frustrated by surface anchoring. There is a need for theoretical tools to predict and characterize such geometrically variable but topologically robust features in complex 3D orientation data. Addressing this need, this research applies a new definition of disclination orientation and winding character via an orthonormal frame construction directly computable from the nematic director field. This frame provides a set of unambiguous coarse-grained variables to systematically generalize recent findings on disclination translation and reorientation from 2D into 3D. The project will produce a widely applicable framework for effective interactions and active dynamics of 3D disclinations.<br/><br/>The PI and research group will design and lead education and outreach activities closely integrated with the research project. Liquid crystals modeling is incorporated into a new graduate course on Advanced Soft Matter and Statistical Physics emphasizing computational techniques alongside theoretical methods. Professional development workshops build undergraduates? skills in critically analyzing, visualizing, and writing about scientific data as they engage in research projects in various scientific and engineering disciplines. Additionally, outreach to high-school students in California?s San Joaquin Valley employs soft matter computer simulation activities as accessible, relatable, and visually appealing introductions to physics research and scientific computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team analyzes the system-wide impacts of collaborative water governance efforts that have been implemented over the past 2 decades in an increasingly-threatened watershed: the Colorado River Basin (CRB). Located in the western United States and northern Mexico, the CRB faces sustainability challenges due to both historical water over-allocation and continued aridification from climate change. Demands for water now regularly exceed available supplies, creating negative impacts for the people, economies, and environments that depend on the Colorado River. Although policy making in the CRB has become more participatory in recent decades, addressing the roots of this evolving sustainability crisis requires a deeper transformation in the way the basin?s diverse stakeholders work together to govern the Colorado River. Through an assessment and comparison of past and on-going collaborative water governance processes, this research provides timely lessons for improving governance of the CRB that are also transferrable to other complex socio-environmental systems facing resource scarcity challenges. Additionally, this project engages a diverse team of students in interdisciplinary policy research and supports outreach and education activities for decision makers, water management professionals, and the broader community.<br/><br/>Through the development of a synergistic research and education program, this CAREER project addresses a knowledge gap at the nexus of two core concepts in environmental governance: polycentricity and collaboration. Polycentric arrangements, characterized by multiple semi-autonomous centers of decision-making authority, are assumed to be well-suited to govern complex socio-environmental systems, in part because they support diverse, adaptable institutions that can be matched to local conditions. A polycentric system?s ability to perform, or achieve desired goals at the system level, however, is often challenged by insufficient coordination among the numerous actors and entities involved at different scales of governance. Collaborative governance processes, which have become nearly ubiquitous in the environmental policy domain over the last 30 years, may help to solve some of these coordination problems by engaging diverse policy actors in consensus-oriented deliberation and decision making around shared problems. Though intuitive, there is a paucity of empirical evidence about the broader impacts of collaborative governance processes on the performance of polycentric systems. Guided by the Ecology of Games Theory, this project integrates longitudinal content analysis of policy documents, elite interviews, and large-n surveys of policy actors to model and assess how various collaborative processes have impacted the structure (i.e. connections among actors and forums) and function (i.e. cooperation, learning, and resource distribution) of the Colorado River Basin?s polycentric water governance system from 2000 to the present. Addressing the evolving sustainability challenges in this basin requires enhanced collaboration among the fragmented entities that govern its water through an intricate set of interlocking federal, state, local, and tribal institutions. Comparing the impacts of different collaborative processes on basin-scale governance over time and in relation to changing social and environmental conditions provides new practical and theoretical insight into approaches for solving complex environmental governance challenges across the globe.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Decision, Risk and Management Sciences Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advancing the science behind risk-informed regulation is essential as systems become more complex and new challenges emerge. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project investigates how principles from two domains of reliability engineering can be systematically integrated to advance this science. This research that Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) have complementary characteristics that can offset their individual weaknesses. The research will establish and validate a conceptual framework along with mathematical and computational methods to systematically integrate PRA and PHM methods, data, and models. Direct engagement with interdisciplinary stakeholders from nuclear power plant and hydrogen transportation infrastructure applications will facilitate both validation and adoption of the new methods. The results will provide new knowledge about the range of data and models that can be used in regulatory design and decision making. Integrated educational initiatives include design of the first public museum exhibit on energy system risk assessment, enhanced reliability engineering coursework, and diversity and inclusion initiatives for women and underrepresented minorities in engineering.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to establish a strong foundation of integrated research and educational activities centered on energy system risk assessment. The research focuses on transforming risk-informed regulation for energy systems through systematic integration of concepts, data and methods drawn from PRA and PHM and rigorous validation using both energy system case studies and expert stakeholder engagement. The educational activities enhance K-12 and public education through a new museum exhibit on energy system risk assessment that will be displayed in the nation?s only nuclear history and science museum and that will also be made available to a broad network of affiliated museums. Graduate coursework in reliability engineering will be enhanced through development of new active learning exercises based on this research. The research draws upon engineering techniques of PRA, which provides a comprehensive quantitative approach for synthesizing data, scenarios, and probability models to assess risk under uncertainty for complex engineering systems; and PHM, which provides powerful algorithms for using sensor data and failure models to understand and predict health of components. To date, there has been little work at the intersection of PRA and PHM. Unlike previous approaches which seek to make PRA more dynamic or to extend PHM to more complicated components within their current architectures, this research seeks to deconstruct PRA and PHM and engineer a new approach which leverages the benefits of both approaches. The research starts by defining the conceptual framework and then defining mathematical and computational structures. The candidate structures will be compared and validated using energy system case studies and stakeholder-based validation. Nuclear power plants and hydrogen fueling stations are used as testbeds to ensure that the results are generalizable beyond a single energy system or regulatory process.  The research has broader societal impact by creating new knowledge and methods that will impact the design of regulations for nuclear power plants, hydrogen infrastructure, pipelines, and other energy systems and critical infrastructures. The integrated educational activities broaden K-12, graduate student, and public understanding of the science behind energy system safety. Broader participation of women and underrepresented minorities in engineering will be encouraged via the enhancement of graduate student recruitment and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modeling complex patterns, such as cellular structures, is intrinsic to several areas of national interest, including consumer products, protective gear for sports and the military, and curved miniaturized electronics. Making complex geometric modeling accessible to more designers and engineers is key to facilitating disruptive innovations in many engineering disciplines, including the automotive, aerospace, construction, additive manufacturing, mechanics, thermo-fluids, and acoustics fields. Current tools for generative design and modeling are highly automated, which makes it difficult for designers to explore new ideas and ask ?what-if? questions. A new representation of geometric solids is needed that will allow designers to apply their expertise, ideas, and creativity in designing cellular structures. Such a representation should also simultaneously support computationally efficient mechanical evaluation, such as finite element simulation. This research will make complex geometric modeling available to all, real-time and intuitive to interact with, useful for serious engineering design, and usable for recreational learning. As a result, novice and expert designers will be able to creatively apply their knowledge in applications ranging from the design of new materials to new architectural forms and safe products. This grant will further enable a new type of learning mechanism, where younger audiences will be able to easily generate complex shapes, prototype them as puzzles through 3D printing, and play with the puzzles to discover basic principles of geometry. This will fundamentally transform the way children develop their spatial reasoning ability through hands-on design and prototyping activities.<br/><br/>This research will introduce space-filling shapes as the underlying novel shape representation for partitive solid geometry, which will enable forward design workflows for the creation of complex shapes and structures for generative and procedural design. With this representation, the grant will integrate currently disparate methods such as implicit modeling, medial axis representations, and Voronoi tessellations into a single unified methodology for shape representation. Efficient and robust algorithms will be developed and embedded within interactive software workflows that will allow users to directly and intuitively create shapes that were not possible before. Human subject studies will be conducted to investigate how these new workflows can promote creative thinking in engineering design. A hypothesis-driven approach will be taken to investigate partitive solid geometry for designing a wide variety of interlocking shapes, functionally graded cellular structures, and auxetic materials. User-generated geometric models will be evaluated numerically and through mechanical tests to discover the relationship between the input geometry provided by the user and the behavior of the resulting shapes. A comprehensive education and outreach plan will include undergraduate internships and a new graduate course. The project will disseminate a free web-based modeling tool to researchers and the public. The research will also create a large online encyclopedia of complex geometric models for the public to use.

As the productivity of traditional agriculture becomes compromised by urbanization and climate change, new methods of food production are needed. Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) is an emerging discipline that fosters year-round food production within local communities while reducing water use and transportation costs.  However, the industry has struggled to thrive due to a limited skilled technical workforce. The proposed project aims to meet the needs of the CEA industry by creating an interdisciplinary certificate for students enrolled in agriculture, automation and robotics, business and entrepreneurship, and/or computer technology associate degree programs. To do so, the project team will develop four new CEA courses and provide professional development to upskill faculty in the technologies that set CEA apart from traditional agriculture. This effort will be supported by an engaged industry board representing horticulture industries, extension specialists, and economic development experts. The project expects to develop a strong CEA curriculum that is responsive to workforce needs and builds on targeted outreach that includes underrepresented minorities, women, and rural high school students.  Consequently, the project can help ensure that the Nation maintains a well-prepared, diverse CEA workforce.<br/><br/>The project is designed to create a pipeline of well-educated technicians for the emerging CEA workforce.  A skilled technical workforce is critical to the success of the CEA industry and one expert has predicted the need for 100,000 workers in the next decade.  This project develop coursework in Aquaculture and Aquaponics, Automated and Smart Technologies, Integrated Facilities Management, and Project-based Study. These courses will use higher learning pedagogy that fosters interdisciplinary engagement of ""ill-defined problems"" to help students develop complex problem solving, higher-level thinking, and creative thinking skills. Project-based learning will expose students to real-world applications of smart-factory automation, growth of tilapia, and remote data collection and analysis. A virtual Internet of Things teaching platform utilizing webcasting equipment for online learning and remote access for data collection and monitoring of automated systems will give students a concrete advantage when entering the CEA workforce, where these technologies play a central role. The four new courses will be paired with agriculture classes already part of the Ivy Tech Community College system to create an interdisciplinary CEA Certificate. Professional development will be designed to upskill faculty who will teach these new and related courses at Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, K-12 partners, and other community colleges across the country.  All project products will be disseminated through a project website and national conference presentations.

Strongly correlated quantum materials are solids in which the electrons behave collectively rather than an individual particles, while topological phases exhibit behavior that is insensitive to noise, defects, and impurities.  Over the past decades, driven by these two topics, condensed-matter physics has witnessed great progress, with examples ranging from high-temperature superconductors to topological insulators and topological superconductors.  These advances not only deepened our understanding of the quantum physics of many-body systems but also hold enormous potential for revolutionary applications, from commercial MRI machines and lossless power transmission to quantum computers that are no longer a futuristic concept.  While historically the two areas of research have, in large part, developed separately, in recently years it has become increasingly clear that their synergy reveals even richer novel phenomena and greater potential for applications.  One prominent example is the so-called moire flat-band materials, including the recently discovered magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene superconductor.  When two layers of graphene are twisted relative to each other and the electron density varied, the system exhibits a variety of topological phases and unconventional superconducting phases.  While potential applications abound, the fundamental mechanism for forming these phases is still under intensive investigation.  These developments present an exciting opportunity for breakthroughs at the intersection of topology and correlation effects.<br/><br/>The PI will pursue the research goal in multiple directions.  The PI will develop the ideas needed for a new topological quantum-computing platform based on the notion of higher-order topological phases, which seem featureless in the bulk and on the edge but host nontrivial states on the corners.  The PI will uncover various kinds of topological superconducting phases in topological semimetals, which form an ideal playground for examining topology and interaction effects.  To properly address the role of strong correlations, the PI will develop new theoretical and numerical approaches for quantum many-body systems that are not captured by perturbation theory and apply these approaches to topological systems, including morie flat bands.  The closely related research topics addressed in this project will advance the forefronts of topological phases and their applications.<br/><br/>An integral component of this project is an education plan at high-school, undergraduate and graduate levels, with a specific emphasis on enhancing inclusion and diversity in academia and the STEM workforce.  The PI will participate in existing programs at the University of Florida to reach out to high school students through lectures and direct mentorship on summer research projects.  The PI will host a series of seminars in the physics department that focuses on career development within and outside academia.  Via adapting and developing graduate-level courses, the PI will fill a gap in the training of junior condensed-matter physicists by bridging traditional topics and modern aspects such as topological phases.<br/><br/>By integrating outreach and education into the research plan, this work will provide young citizens of diverse backgrounds with unique learning and research experiences at the forefront of quantum physics and its potential applications, ensuring the success of the fundamental ""Quantum Leap"" identified by NSF as one of the ""10 Big Ideas for Future Investment"".<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project focuses on the intersection between topological phases of matter, in particular topological superconductivity, and strongly correlated systems.  In the first part of the project, the PI will establish a new classifying framework for higher-order topological phases based on characterization of topological defects in topological insulators and topological ordered states.  The PI will demonstrate the potential application of higher-order topological superconductivity as a new platform for braiding non-Abelian anyons.  The second part focuses on demonstrating interacting topological semimetals as natural hosts of novel topological phases, including higher-order topological superconductivity and ultra-nodal topological superconductors with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces.  The final part is devoted to a close examination of theoretical models that admit topological superconducting instabilities.  These models involve low-energy fermions in the vicinity of a quantum-critical point interacting with soft bosonic modes, which induce unconventional superconducting instabilities.  To further understand the strong correlation and rich phases in these models, the PI will adopt and develop Quantum Monte Carlo methods and a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev-like model that is exactly solvable in a large-N limit.  In broader terms, these results will connect two thriving fields of condensed matter physics: unconventional superconductivity and topological phases of matter.  Combining tools and ideas from both rapidly developing fields will tremendously deepen our understanding of quantum many-body physics.<br/><br/>The project also has three main educational components targeting students at different career stages.  In collaboration with the University of Florida's Center for Precollegiate Education and Training, the PI will actively engage motivated high-school students through lectures on the basics of quantum computing and through individual research projects.  With an emphasis on enhancing inclusion and diversity in academia and the STEM workforce, the education plan includes a series of seminars focused on career development for physics majors and physics graduate students.  Through a long-term plan of special-topic and regular graduate courses, the PI will develop a new pedagogical framework for quantum many-body physics that naturally incorporates perturbative, non-perturbative, and topological aspects of these systems, which better suits modern research activities in condensed-matter physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To develop effective resistance management strategies, it is important to understand how the different combinations and concentrations affect the evolution of resistance. This knowledge could be used to understand how resistance evolution changes under varying exposures or as concentrations wane over time. The aim of this project is to fill the gap in this knowledge by focusing on insecticide resistance evolution in mosquitoes as a model system. A comprehensive evolutionary framework of insecticide resistance evolution will be developed by measuring the selection acting upon resistant and susceptible mosquitoes under different insecticide combinations and concentrations. Furthermore, with problems as complex as resistance evolution that is predicted to continue globally in the foreseeable future, a diverse workforce is urgently needed. This project will develop research and inquiry-based experiences for undergraduate and K-12 students around insecticide resistance evolution. The focus will be on students from lower socio-economic or underrepresented backgrounds to bolster student engagement in science and expose a diverse group of students to the process of science.<br/><br/>Resistance evolution is driven by increased survival of resistant organisms in a xenobiotic environment (an environment with pesticides, antibiotics, or other ""-cides"") relative to susceptible organisms. The window of selection is the range of concentrations at which differential mortality is observed and is used as a framework to identify concentrations at which selection occurs, or identify the length of time this window is open at inevitably waning concentrations. Often missing from this framework is the role of interspecific competition at concentrations for which both strains survive: at low concentrations. The research goal is to test the hypothesis that the window of selection contains one or more sub-windows of competition, followed by a window of negative selection. The specific aims are to: 1) establish the selection coefficient of insecticide resistance alleles at different doses within the window of selection, 2) determine the magnitude of fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance alleles and 3) determine selection following various resistance management strategies using experimental and mathematical approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research part of this project focuses on the development and application of new computational tools to study the electronic properties of heterogeneous interfaces formed between molecules and solid substrates. Such interfaces find broad applications in energy conversion materials, such as photovoltaics that convert solar energy into electric current and photocatalytic materials that harvest solar light to drive chemical reactions. To understand and control these complex processes at a fundamental level, it is essential to accurately describe the electronic structure based on quantum mechanical simulations of the materials. Given the large system size and the accuracy needed to quantitatively understand the energy conversion mechanisms at heterogeneous interfaces, most conventional simulation methods are unfortunately either inefficient or inaccurate.<br/><br/>The objective of the research part of this project is to develop a suite of new computational schemes that are both accurate and efficient in the characterization of the electronic structure at heterogeneous molecule-substrate interfaces. These methods will significantly expand the scope of materials and interfaces that can be routinely modeled as compared to the current state of the art. The basic idea is to divide the interface into its smaller constituents or building blocks and then treat each component with high-level theory while considering it embedded in the environment of the others. Using this embedding approach, the team will quantitatively investigate how the electronic structure of each component of the interface is affected by the others, and how the electronic structure of the entire interface is different from those of the individual constituents. The team will apply the new computational approach to a few emerging systems of experimental significance, especially interfaces involving multiple light absorbers and interfaces featuring electronic and optical properties which differ considerably when measured in different directions.

The research part of this project focuses on the development and application of new computational methods to study the quasiparticle electronic structure and optical excitations at heterogeneous interfaces formed between molecules and solid substrates. Such interfaces are ubiquitous in nanoscale energy conversion applications, such as photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Although many-body perturbation theory such as the GW-BSE formalism (G is the Green?s function, W is the screened Coulomb interaction, and BSE stands for Bethe-Salpeter equation) provides a rigorous theoretical framework, first-principles calculations of large molecule-substrate interfaces are computationally expensive. Lack of efficient yet reliable computational schemes for large heterogeneous interfaces hinders fundamental understanding of the molecule-substrate interactions and interfacial charge dynamics.<br/><br/>The research part of this project aims to develop a suite of new tools, termed as ?dielectric embedding GW-BSE?, to make such calculations practically affordable for large interfaces without sacrificing accuracy. The essential idea is to confine explicit GW-BSE calculations within each component of the interface while treating the effect of the others as a dielectric environment. This project will leverage the newly developed methods to study a few systems of experimental significance, including: (1) interfaces formed between monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and (metallo)phthalocyanines, where the gaps and excitons of both components as well as the valley pseudospin of the TMD substrates within the interface will be studied; (2) interfaces involving black phosphorus, where the anisotropy of the dielectric screening at such interfaces will be scrutinized; and (3) charge-transfer systems modulated by interfaces, such as molecular donor-acceptor pairs adsorbed on metal or semiconductor substrates and large organic adsorbates on bilayer TMDs featuring inter-layer charge-transfer excitons.<br/><br/>The research activity is closely integrated with the education and outreach parts of this project.

Control over the phonon-spin interaction, achieved here via nano-structuring and applied strain, has crucial implications for a number of applications, such as quantum computing. In the course of this project, a new generation of undergraduate and graduate students are being trained with expertise in nanoscale fabrication, cryogenics, and microwave measurements.

It plays a pivotal role in relaxation and decoherence (in case of multiple spins) of electronic spin states and is predicted to mediate many-body phenomena. An immense body of research on tailoring it in fields as varied as superconductivity and thermoelectrics exists. Insight from these fields has never been applied to experiments in few-spin systems. This is a new and impactful opportunity, since few-spin systems are the fundamental prototype for rationalizing spin dynamics in more complex systems, important for quantum information applications. This project bridges the gap via an experimental effort focused on control and measurement of electron-phonon processes in silicon gate-defined quantum dots. The phonon bath is engineered through nano-structuring and spin-orbit coupling is controlled via applied strain to investigate the theoretically predicted ?protected? states. Measurements of spin relaxation and decoherence time are performed. Controlling the coupling of spins to the phonon bath has profound implications. First, it can be used for the design of ?hot? qubits and spintronic devices. Second, it leads to an examination of hitherto untested theoretical predictions. Third, the novel protocols developed in the project for sensing nanoscale electron-phonon thermalization are foundational for future quantum thermodynamics studies on the quantum dot platform.

However, the increasing adoption of learning-based components in the robotics perception and control pipeline poses an important challenge: how can we guarantee the safety and performance of such systems? As an example, consider a micro aerial vehicle that learns to navigate using a thousand different obstacle environments or a robotic manipulator that learns to grasp using a million objects in a dataset. How likely are these systems to remain safe and perform well on a novel (i.e., previously unseen) environment or object? How can we learn control policies for robotic systems that provably generalize well to environments that our robot has not previously encountered? Unfortunately, existing approaches either do not provide such guarantees or do so only under very restrictive assumptions. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to establish a foundational framework for learning-based control of safety-critical robotic systems with guaranteed generalization and safety. The project will impact challenging application domains such as aerial inspection and manipulation (e.g., for infrastructure repair tasks) and includes activities for (i) engaging regulatory agencies and industry entities in discussions regarding the certification of learning-based robotic systems, (ii) partnering with teacher preparation programs and other educational programs to engage high-school and undergraduate students in robotics, and (iii) widely disseminating materials from a new robotics course which uses hands-on labs with drones. <br/><br/>Motivated by the need for guaranteeing the safety of learning-based robotic systems, this project is developing a principled theoretical and algorithmic framework for learning control policies for robotic systems with provable guarantees on generalization to novel environments (i.e., environments that the robot has not previously encountered). The key technical insight of this project is to leverage and extend powerful techniques from generalization theory in theoretical machine learning.  The resulting framework provides bounds on the expected performance of learned policies (including ones based on neural networks) across novel environments. The project is developing algorithms (based on convex optimization, gradient-based methods, and black-box optimization) for learning policies that explicitly optimize these bounds. The project also seeks to guarantee the robustness of learned policies to shifts in the distribution of environments that the robot encounters. An important part of the effort is to thoroughly validate the technical approach on hardware platforms including micro aerial vehicles performing navigation, inspection, and aerial manipulation tasks motivated by infrastructure repair applications. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The detection of gravitational waves has opened new avenues to explore the universe and some of its most fascinating phenomena. When two compact objects, black holes or neutron stars, collide, they emit gravitational waves which encode the properties of their sources, for example masses and spins. To date, more than a dozen binary black hole and 2 binary neutron star mergers have been found in the data of the NSF-funded LIGO observatories and the Virgo detector. Over the next five years, we expect to detect more than one binary black hole source per week, and roughly one binary neutron star per month. This project will enable a broad scientific exploitation of gravitational-wave data by developing methods to combine information from a large number of sources. At the same time, it will deal with the main sources of systematic error, which might otherwise hinder astrophysical inference, limiting its usefulness for the scientific community. In addition to enabling a reliable analysis of the population of gravitational-wave sources, this project will also increase the representation of underserved communities and underrepresented minorities in STEM. The project includes a professional development program for high school teachers which will target low-income areas and expose the teachers and their students to the main ideas behind gravitational-wave astrophysics and highlight the many transferable skills acquired with a physics degree.<br/><br/>Given the tens to hundreds of compact binary systems that will be detected in the next few years, their full exploitation will bear fruit on key physics and astrophysics questions. Such a wealth of detected systems, some of which at large signal-to-noise ratio, constitutes both an opportunity and a challenge. To fully exploit the available data, sophisticated data analysis algorithms and a full control of systematic errors will be needed. The work has on two main goals: a) to develop tools to characterize the population of compact binaries while accounting for marginal sources and for the possibility that some triggers might not be of astrophysical origin and b) to quantify and mitigate the effect of an important type of systematic errors, those those arising from the calibration of the gravitational-wave detectors. The work will thus advance key questions in gravitational-wave astrophysics and help maximize the science output of LIGO and the international network of gravitational-wave detectors. Despite some progress over the last twenty years, the fraction of bachelor physics degrees awarded to students from under-represented minorities, and in particular African Americans, is still too low. Among the many factors that might contribute to these low numbers, is the perception that a degree in physics does not open many doors to the job market. The project includes a professional development program for high school teachers, with schools in districts with low per-pupil expenditure. The program will have two main goals: expose the teachers, and hence their students, to the main ideas behind general relativity, gravitational waves and astrophysics, and provide examples, directly from this research program, of ideas and methods that can be directly transferred from a physics degree to a job in industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Riemannian manifolds appear everywhere in physics, modeling the membrane of a cell as well as spacetime in general relativity, and Riemannian geometry offers fundamental tools to study their properties.  One concept of paramount importance, when studying physical objects as well as Riemannian manifolds in general, is that of symmetry, that is, the degree of ""self similarity"" of a geometric object, which make it invariant under certain length-preserving transformations (called isometries). Symmetry can be further generalized with the idea of partitioning a geometric object into ""sheets"", which stay parallel to one another. This idea, formalized by the mathematical concept of singular Riemannian foliation, is at the center of the mathematical investigation of this project.  Here, we use ideas introduced by the PI and collaborators to study the local behavior of these structures, as well as use them globally to produce new  manifolds with desirable curvature.  In this project, geometry is also used as a broad concept to encompass a number of activities for the mathematical community and society in general, such as:  1) Organizing a four-weeks-long thematic program in Metric Geometry, with schools for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a week-long conference.  2) Organizing a weekly math camp for girls in 3rd grade and up which is aimed at addressing the gender imbalance in the mathematical disciplines.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to study singular Riemannian foliations, both to further understand their structure and to apply them to Invariant Theory and Riemannian Geometry.  The local study of singular Riemannian foliations, namely foliations on a Euclidean space with the origin as one leaf, generalizes orthogonal representations of Lie groups. The PI proved in a recent joint work that infinitesimal submetries have an algebraic counterpart, given by certain polynomial algebras called Laplacian algebras. This opens the door to a novel approach called ""Invariant theory without groups"", consisting in understanding how to read geometric properties of manifold submetries off of their Laplacian algebra, and apply these techniques to the special case in which the submetry comes from an orthogonal representation.  Globally, singular Riemannian foliations can conjecturally arise from collapsing sequences of manifolds with a uniform lower sectional curvature bound: One project will try to prove this locally. Furthermore, singular Riemannian foliations will be used to produce new examples of manifolds with non-negative and positive curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the containment measures can rapidly succumb to human mobility not accompanied by adequate precaution. Absent treatment or vaccine for mass inoculation in the near future, it is indispensable to adopt target-oriented intervention to avert the infection resurgence and eschew mounting economic fallout before the return to normalcy. This entails an accurate spatiotemporal predictive model that accounts for the spatial heterogeneity and human motion. Notably, research in human mobility and contagion dynamics cannot be done in isolation, and innovative solutions are increasingly emanating from cross-border intellectual interactions. However, with lockdown and travel restrictions in play, the traditional academic activities have ground to a screeching halt, and the academia is embracing virtual mobility and connectivity. This has also triggered concerns over the quality and engagement of participants, and sustainable international collaboration over the long run. This EAGER project will investigate how spatiotemporal human mobility will affect the contagion dynamics of COVID-19, which is conducive for optimal design of nonpharmaceutical intervention. It also brings research scholars from the U.S., Japan and Australia to study the impact of COVID-19 prevalence on international collaboration, and design innovative mechanism to render such cross-border cooperation resilient and sustainable against future disturbances.<br/><br/>Part 2. <br/>This interdisciplinary collaborative research integrates epidemic dynamics, computational social science, statistical learning and systems engineering at an unprecedented scale. The PI?s team will pursue the following research thrusts: (1) Spatiotemporal modeling for human mobility and contagion dynamics and the connection to intervention policy: A spatiotemporal compartmental model considering human motion and asymptomatic infection will be developed to delineate dynamical geographical prevalence of the contagion and the inherent uncertainty. (2) Dynamic graph modeling for collaboration network: International publication co-authorship will be represented as dynamic networks, which along with disease prevalence will uncover the contagion impact on cross-border cooperation, reveal weak coordination in existing partnerships and identify future trend of international collaboration. (3) Innovative mechanism design for sustainable international collaboration: Leveraging the emerging novel digital infrastructure, the team will collectively explore open-science initiatives for research interaction, documentation, protocol formulation and assessment for resilient and sustainable collaboration. This project is anticipated to decipher the impact of COVID-19 on international collaboration and design strategic mechanism to foster future resilient and sustainable cross-border cooperation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this project is to systematically integrate these geospatial components in LCA of conventional and renewable energy systems to improve the accuracy of their ?carbon footprints? at higher spatial resolutions, and to disseminate this methodology and its results to inform sustainable location-specific design, siting, and implementation decisions for the energy transition.<br/><br/>The research objectives are to: (1) first update the baseline comparison to fossil fuels by including DLUC and albedo change impacts of their expansion in the US; (2) develop geospatial LCA models for selected solar and ocean renewable energy technologies and determine their life cycle climate change impacts on potentially available land and water in the US; and (3) adapt the geospatial LCA models to future conditions under climate change. Parametric LCA models of these energy system scenarios will be developed in open-source Python code, informed by publicly available GIS datasets, the physics of these technologies, and algorithms developed for flexibility to variable environmental conditions. In order for the methodology to be disseminated and used by energy stakeholders and future LCA practitioners, the education objectives are to: (1) design and share a course in geospatial LCA modeling; (2) develop and promote a workshop and website on these methods and their results for industry and policy stakeholders; and (3) provide a research group structure designed to recruit, train, and retain students from underrepresented backgrounds in sustainability engineering fields. This project will develop methodology for determining life cycle climate change impacts of energy technologies that is more precise than previously used methods in LCA. The results will be statistically compared against non-geographically-specific LCA results of the same modeled technologies and against the impacts of fossil fuels to determine the significance of incorporating geospatial components in energy system LCAs.

These novel materials provide the foundation used to create new technologies that impact and improve nearly every facet of modern life. Unfortunately, some of the new materials, such as ionic liquids and eutectic solvents, are difficult to handle by themselves, and they require containment of some kind, limiting their use in practical systems. This research work addresses these current limitations by developing methods to prepare capsules with cores of the specialized liquid wrapped in polymer shells. This approach is made possible by the use of a water-free emulsion that is composed of droplets of the active liquid dispersed in an oil, coupled with polymerization techniques. The water-free emulsions are critical to the development of this encapsulation system, as they allow the specialized liquid to remain pure and unadulterated. The work addresses how the composition of the polymer shell impacts performance properties of the capsules, namely mechanical properties and the uptake of gaseous carbon dioxide. This research promotes progress in the areas of composite materials with applications in critical areas such as energy storage and gas separations. In addition to the research, this project will support the training of undergraduate and graduate students and development of How-To Videos. These videos are planned to be publicly available and to show new researchers how to use scientific instruments to characterize polymer-based materials, thereby supporting the development and training of scientists and engineers more broadly. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The goal of the planned research is to develop methods to prepare capsules with cores of active liquids (e.g., ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents) and polymer composite shells of varied permeability, stability, and mechanical properties. This will be accomplished by leveraging interfacial polymerizations in non-aqueous emulsions. Alkylated graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets will be used as particle surfactant to stabilizing Pickering emulsions, toluene or octane will be used as the continuous phase, and ionic liquid or deep eutectic solvent as the discontinuous phase. Aim 1 focuses on preparing capsule shells of varied permeability and mechanical properties using telechelic oligomers as monomers, as prepared by ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), reversible-addition fragmentation-chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and radical dead-end polymerization (DEP). In Aim 2, the stability of the capsule shell will be tuned by incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds; this will enable destruction or fusion of the capsule shells. In Aim 3, the capsule shell thickness will be minimized and the core fluid purity maximized by using reactive particle surfactants and thiol-ene chemistry. The capsule composition, morphology, thermal properties, permeability, and mechanical properties will be established. An unfunded collaboration with Prof. Burcu Gurkan will reveal the relationship between shell composition and permeability to gaseous CO2.  An unfunded collaboration with Prof. George Pharr will support evaluation of individual capsules using micromanipulation techniques, producing force-displacement profiles. The scientific research is complemented by support of undergraduate and graduate researchers, as well as How-To Videos (HTVs) which demonstrate working principles and practical considerations for techniques used to characterize soft matter.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Importantly, despite the increasing amount of data generated by the remote-sensing revolution currently underway in Ecology (e.g., photos from satellites and camera traps), the use and integration of this information with field data on biodiversity is limited by the absence of modeling methods that can integrate multiple data streams and that can properly account for the characteristics of the data generated by these sensors. The long-term goal of this project is to advance cyberinfrastructure by creating broadly applicable methods for biodiversity datasets and by training the next generation of quantitative environmental scientists. This project will focus on substantially improving Mixed Membership (MM) models. These models were originally developed for text-mining purposes but have been widely used for biodiversity research in a wide range of ecosystems. Unfortunately, the current formulation of these models still has important limitations. This project will develop improved MM models that can account for the characteristics of the data generated by these sensors, can integrate multiple sources of data, and enable biodiversity predictions to be made. Ultimately, these improved MM models will be critical to enhance our ability to quantify and predict impacts on biodiversity. This project will also increase the awareness of the impact of climate change on biodiversity among high-school teachers and students. <br/><br/>Evaluating and forecasting how species composition has been and will be altered by anthropogenic stressors is key to sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but existing methods to quantify biodiversity change have important limitations. Biodiversity data are highly multivariate (e.g., an assemblage can contain hundreds of species in tropical forests) but many of the dimension-reduction methods typically used to interpret these data often generate results that are not easily interpretable (e.g., nonmetric multidimensional scaling axis scores), rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., hard clustering of sites), and are ill suited for wildlife studies because they do not account for imperfect detection. Critically, many of these methods do not allow for formal inference and/or predictions to be made and these methods do not leverage multiple data streams. To circumvent these limitations, this project will develop methods to generate new insights on the drivers of spatial and temporal variation of biodiversity. The overall objective of this project is to significantly improve MM models for biodiversity research. The specific objectives of this project consist of a) creating MM models that can generate reliable inference and predictions, integrate disparate data streams, and account for detection issues; and b) disseminate and train scientists on the developed models; and increase awareness of the impact of climate change on biodiversity among high-school students while addressing important science, math, and statistics standards.

Starting with the initial detection of gravitational waves (GW) from a binary black hole merger by The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and the French-Italian Virgo detector, and continuing with the first detection of GWs from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 170817A, the era of true GW multimessenger astronomy has begun. The electromagnetic follow-up campaign of this event discovered associated afterglows across the electromagnetic spectrum, and has had a significant impact on the understanding of the progenitors of short GRBs, kilonovae, and the interior state of neutron stars. This award supports an integrated research and education plan focusing on the continued search for GWs associated with extreme energy astronomical events, including GRBs and fast radio bursts (FRB), over the period when the worldwide GW detector network will expand from 3 to 5 detectors, and their sensitive range will increase significantly.  This expansion of capabilities will greatly increase the capability of GW astronomy to probe deeply into the sources of these events and uncover the details of their creation.  The award supports both undergraduate and master's student researchers in conducting these searches, continuing analysis of detector and search performance, and engaging the Hampton Roads, VA community through four annual outreach events held at the local Virginia Living Museum.  These outreach events will be tied to an existing free skygazing program and provide an opportunity for hundreds of members of the local community to learn about multimessenger astronomy in an engaging, active learning setting with both hands-on demonstrations and a combination lecture-demonstration show.  The award supports the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through the engagement of students of all ages at these events and the training of undergraduate and master?s students to become competent scientific researchers able to conduct research at the internationally recognized level as the next generation of gravitational-wave astronomers.<br/><br/>As was demonstrated with the multi-messenger observations of GW170817, combined detections of GWs with electromagnetic detections have significantly advanced the understanding of the astrophysics of high-energy events. Additional detections of GWs associated with GRBs in the fourth and fifth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA), and LIGO-India data will enable the astrophysical properties of neutron stars and the full electromagnetic emission model for binary neutron star merger sources to be far better constrained. Any detection of a GW associated with a FRB would result in a significant increase in the understanding of the astrophysical origin of these mysterious events. FRB progenitor models are very poorly constrained, and the recent observation of an FRB associated with magnetar SGR 1935+2154 have pointed to a potential for multiple populations.  If no coincident detections are made in this search, it will better constrain models of the FRB progenitors. Finally, improved sensitivity of the LIGO interferometers through continued detector characterization efforts will directly result in an increased number of GWs detected.  The award supports both prompt and higher latency, deeper searches for GWs associated with GRBs using the PyGRB data analysis pipeline, which conducts coherent, matched-filter searches that extend the effective sensitivity of the GW detection network. Prompt searches will allow detected GWs to be announced to the astronomical community for immediate follow-up. The award also supports both template-based searches and unmodeled searches for GWs associated with FRBs, and leadership of the effort to characterize the noise in the LIGO interferometers that impacts the GRB and FRB searches, with the particular focus on improving search sensitivity and assessing the validity of the GW detections.

Such datasets include personal relations in social and communication networks, protein-protein interactions within an organism, and particle interactions in physics simulations, among many other examples. By studying these graphs, researchers can develop techniques to identify harmful actors in social networks, discover novel protein interaction pathways, and better model interactions within a physical system. However, the large scale and complexity of these datasets makes them particularly challenging to study, and studies often require computationally-expensive analytical techniques. These challenges are further exacerbated by the complexity of the modern large-scale parallel computational systems on which such studies are often performed. Solving these challenges enables the real-time analysis of large-scale constantly-evolving social networks, in-depth studies of full-scale brain neural connectome graphs, and the general application of computationally-intensive analytics to other massive relational datasets. The research in this project presents a set of highly inter-related approaches designed to concurrently address these challenges. Educational initiatives of this project include the development of classes that will introduce students in computer science, the physical sciences, and the social sciences to various aspects of graph theory and computational graph analytics. High school through graduate students are being engaged as contributing members of the project's various research goals. These initiatives are further fostering involvement of students in research, high performance computing, and open source software development.<br/><br/>Specifically, the research in this project is aimed at developing methods to enable complex computations on quadrillion+ edge graphs using current petascale and forthcoming exascale high performance computing platforms. These methods fall under three broad thrusts. The first thrust relates to ""Graph Layout"", which is the way in which a graph dataset is partitioned, ordered, and stored in-memory and out-of-core on a computational system. An outcome of this thrust is a high quality and scalable means to optimize graph layout under consideration of data type, algorithmic pattern, and hardware platform. The second thrust considers ""Architecture-centric Processing"" of these datasets under consideration of modern high performance systems. This thrust is researching how to efficiently map complex graph analytic problems to complex heterogeneous architectures, while considering multilevel computational models, asynchronous computations, and various graph layout methodologies. The third thrust involves the ""Development of Scalable and Open-source Software"" to enable the broader scientific community to easily address the challenges of the prior thrusts as it relates to their specific dataset, analytical problem, and hardware. This thrust is investigating how to best develop software frameworks and toolkits that are designed to scale to the massive (quadrillion+ edge) and irregular power-law graphs arising from these various domains, while efficiently running on next-generation exascale hardware.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional electronic elements use electron charge to store and transmit information. For example, the amount of charge accumulated on a capacitor may determine whether it contributes a ?0? or a ?1? binary digit.  On the other hand, spintronic devices exploit another property of electrons, called spin (up, down, or canted), to encode information.  These devices can in fact use spin currents to control logic operations faster and more energy efficiently than charge currents can accomplish in conventional semiconductor transistor-based logic.  Spintronics devices typically consist of ferromagnets as the source of the spin current. Incorporating elements that are superconductors, which have no electrical resistance, can enhance the overall device performance and offer new functionalities, such as remarkably low-dissipation (energy loss) spin transport.  Such ferromagnetic-superconductor structures are also constituents of schemes for topological quantum computing, an architecture that is predicted to be robust to environmental noise that plagues other quantum device platforms.  This project investigates ferromagnetic-superconductor devices that could form building blocks of novel computing architectures by imaging nanoscale magnetic fields throughout the device and determining the effects of temperature and an applied current on the device operation. This effort also contributes to the development of a globally competitive quantum workforce in the U.S. by designing a novel lab course that teaches foundational skills for careers in quantum sensing and computing, and providing training in electronics to K-12 students at a local elementary school. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Ferromagnet-superconductor (FS) heterostructures are promising platforms for superconducting spintronics and topological quantum computing. In FS heterostructures, it is theoretically predicted that skyrmion-vortex pairs can form that are desirable for computing applications. The objective of this program is to design, fabricate, and study a system in which skyrmions and vortices co-exist and interact. Specifically, the research team studies proximity coupling in two different FS heterostructures:  iron germanium telluride (FGT) - superconductor bilayers and arrays of FeGe islands under a superconducting layer. For both heterostructures, they employ magnetic force microscopy and electrical transport measurements to study the dynamics of magnetic textures that emerge in these devices under variable temperatures (down to 1.6 K) and magnetic fields (up to 12 T), determining the conditions under which skyrmions and vortices co-exist and bind. Proposed work includes studies of the effects of thermal energy and current-induced forces, and comparing the results to semiclassical theories describing skyrmion-vortex pair dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The potential scientific impact of this project will be in providing engineering guidelines for the design of safer and more effective nanoparticles made possible by a deeper quantitative understanding, and thus better control, of nanoscale interactions.

This project will establish a new research paradigm to systematically study the mechanisms and kinetics of nanoscale interactions based on unique label-free and in situ quantitative bio-analytical methods at single particle and single cell levels via three research objectives. In Objective 1, inter-nanoparticle interactions will be quantified. Nanoparticle-cell interactions will be assessed in Objective 2. In Objective 3, nanoparticle intracellular transport will be determined with unique spatiotemporal resolution. These quantitative and mechanistic studies have the potential to inform the engineering of nanoparticles that efficiently overcome biological barriers for safe and effective biological and medical applications. This research will additionally enable a better quantitative and mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle environmental interactions and associated ecological effects.

To help prepare this needed workforce, the project aims to develop engineering students? environmental awareness across multiple levels, from knowledge acquisition to career decisions. Typically, a change in students? environmental awareness alone does not translate into workforce development for renewable energy industries. This exploratory research intends to address this gap by offering interventions that target environmental awareness across a diverse group of undergraduate engineering students at Tuskegee University and Auburn University.   <br/><br/>This project seeks to advance understanding of the gap between environmental awareness and behavior, as well as determine the necessary technical competencies and soft skills that sustainable energy industries demand from new engineers.  To do so, this project will: (1) examine the link between engineering students? environmental awareness and their willingness and preparedness to pursue careers in renewable energy fields; (2) offer mechanistic educational design to maximize sustainability competencies and behaviors; and (3) create a paradigm for building a pipeline between academic institutions and renewable energy and related industries.  This project from two institutions in Alabama features strong associations with relevant industries in the Southeast. Activities intended to support development of a diverse renewable energy engineering workforce include a renewable makerspace, horizontal integration of sustainability concepts in multiple courses, and enhanced university-industry engagement, such as student field trips to industrial sites and feedback from industry representatives regarding workforce needs. A mixed-methods research study will provide insight on the skills and competency levels associated with participation in each intervention. Four components of environmental awareness (knowledge, attitude, willingness, and perceived preparedness) will serve as indicators.

Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own investigators and component of the work. Random scattering, refraction and focusing of ocean surface gravity waves by submesoscale currents results in spatial modulation ? or patches ? in the wave field. Within these patches the significant wave height may vary by as much as 30% on horizontal scales of 10 to 100 km and time scales of a few hours to a day. As a result, patches pose a major challenge for the modelling and prediction of surface gravity waves and of their impact on the ocean circulation. Patches affect the wave-breaking rate, and climate-relevant air-sea interaction such as gas exchange rates, aerosol production and wind-stress coupling to the ocean. Patches are likely important contributors to sea-state bias errors that complicate altimetric inference of currents. The project will contribute to improving the performance of operational surface gravity wave models by including the statistical effects of unresolved currents, consequently removing errors related to delayed swell arrival. This will improve predictions of wave activity with naval, commercial, and recreational applications. <br/><br/>This project will apply kinetic theory, and a new version of generalized Lagrangian mean theory, to demonstrate the effect of submesoscale currents on waves and the reciprocal effect of waves on submesoscale currents. New statistical models of the scattering of surface gravity waves by submesoscale turbulence will be developed. These models will in turn be used to explain the main features of patch variability, including a recently discovered relation between the power spectrum of significant wave height and the submesoscale kinetic energy spectrum, and to develop a parametrization of surface gravity wave scattering by submesoscale turbulence that will be incorporated into WAVEWATCH III. Spatial and temporal fluctuations in significant wave height are reflected in other properties of the surface gravity wave field including the Stokes velocity, and hence the wave-averaged vortex and Stokes-Coriolis forces which control the forcing of currents by surface gravity waves. The hypothesis that the interaction between waves and mean flows is strong on patch time and space scales will be investigated and new modeling tools will be developed and tailored to these scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter (DM) is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. Directional dark matter detectors have access to a smoking-gun signature of dark matter ? an order unity asymmetry in the angular distribution of recoils induced by Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Although the leading limits on WIMP dark matter currently come from non-directional experiments, these experiments are rapidly approaching the solar neutrino floor, where the signal will be dominated by neutrinos from the sun and which will make future advances with those technologies more challenging. Directional detectors, however, can reach below the neutrino floor to constrain WIMP dark matter. This EAGER award will leverage Machine Learning (ML) techniques to further enhance the sensitivity of directional DM experiments. The ML techniques and analyses developed under this award would be broadly useful to experiments that employ gas-based Time Projection Chambers. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a culturally and socioeconomically diverse set of female undergraduate students at Wellesley College, and the enhancement of the physics curriculum through the integration of particle physics experimentation in both teaching and research laboratories. Wellesley is a women's college traditionally ranked in the top 10 for ethnic diversity among liberal arts colleges. By integrating students at Wellesley in all aspects of this experimental particle physics program, the proposed work will broaden the participation of members of underrepresented groups in physics.<br/><br/>This work will be applied to existing DRIFT (Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks) data and will establish an analysis pipeline that can be used with new data from directional experiments. Preliminary work using very basic ML techniques has already shown significant improvement in the nuclear recoil detection efficiency, with associated gains in the sensitivity to the WIMP-nucleon cross section. Under this award, the group will undertake a more complete exploration of the ML landscape to further enhance the sensitivity of DRIFT to dark matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By other measures, the internet has increasingly become a key platform for personal expression, fundamentally transforming the way that people communicate, and fostering opportunities for new forms of sociality. This doctoral dissertation project examines how online platforms are being leveraged to create and maintain communities among individuals who are socially marginalized. Because these contexts are relatively new, and by some measure anonymous, the project has the potential of helping scientists better understand what creative processes are necessarily to the formation of new and durable social networks. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, data and findings from the projects with be shared with companies and other organizations to help optimize interaction and communication.

For example, many of the EDA problems such as Boolean optimization are combinatorial optimization problems, which are unlikely to be solved by polynomial-time algorithms. In practice, those problems can be solved using scalable optimization algorithms with approximations and domain-specific heuristics, which are mostly developed by extensive hand-engineering efforts with strong domain knowledge. However, recent progress in developing  such algorithms and associated heuristics is slowing down significantly due to the high barrier of technical knowledge, time-consuming hand-engineering, and several misleading designing strategies. This project aims to employ reinforcement learning and neural networks to enable self-learning high-performance algorithms and heuristics over graphs, which can outperform existing hand-crafted approaches without human supervision and domain knowledge. This will can be generalized to autonomously learn and discover novel graph-based combinatorial optimization heuristics at a wide range of application domains without any human guidance. This project will produce open-source software and conference tutorials to facilitate technology transfers and fruitful industry-academia interactions in a multidisciplinary community.<br/><br/>This project develops the OneSense system, a graph learning driven reinforcement learning framework for exploring self-learning novel algorithms and heuristics over graphs, with special focuses on graph-based large-scale Boolean optimization problems.

The reinforcement agent with the various reward formulations and novel training methodologies and algorithms will enable effectively learning novel combinatorial optimization heuristics with a wide range of performance customization. OneSense system will be integrated with an open-source end-to-end EDA design space exploration system, which will allow productive exploration and deployment of self-learned optimization heuristics over graphs in Boolean optimization. Moreover, the OneSense reinforcement learning framework will be released to allow exploring self-learned graph optimization algorithms in other research domains and be used as an educational platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surprisingly, for such a general context, we can say meaningful things, discovering new general laws on the one hand and giving new methods for concrete mathematical theories on the other. Model-theoretic classification theory gives an approach to discovering the general laws: informally, it aims to isolate so-called dividing lines where a significant structural change in the class of theories may be detected, and in parallel to develop the internal theory to understand what is producing the phenomena observed. One such dividing line has to do with whether theories have nontrivial randomness.  Current methods have been successful in many ways on the non-random side. This project concerns independent theories, those on the random side. The randomness complicates to varying degrees the ability of current methods to gauge the full structure. This research works towards a more fundamental understanding of such theories, using a range of classical and newly developed tools able to detect average behavior and changes in the complexity of model-theoretic randomness. Along with the research developments, the project will support the training of students at various levels.<br/><br/>More precisely, the project aims to study independent theories, those with the independence property. The following interrelated test problems guide the work in this project. The first concerns characterizing saturated models of simple theories in a way analogous to the known characterization for stable theories, as a test problem for understanding of the building blocks of simple unstable theories. An approach to this question, of independent interest, involves developing a recently introduced generalization of forking. A second problem involves characterizing and developing a structure theory for a certain interesting class of simple theories 'near' the random graph. A third is to investigate the structure of quotients of Keisler's order. A fourth is to find true dividing lines within the class of independent theories and in parallel to develop the internal theory justifying these as dividing lines. These questions themselves connect to the classical problem of understanding the so called Keisler order, whose structure on dependent theories is known but whose structure on the independent theories remains in some senses mysterious.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced ceramic materials play a vital role in numerous applications with strict requirements or under harsh conditions, such as those in the biomedical, aerospace, chemical, and energy industries. Traditional manufacturing methods for ceramic parts have severe geometric constraints, long production time, and high cost. Binder jet additive manufacturing can overcome these drawbacks. However, it is currently unable to produce dense ceramic parts, significantly limiting its applications. This research aims to increase understanding of how powder granule characteristics (density, structure, and strength) and powder compaction affect resulting part density. In addition, this CAREER plan includes a series of education activities to strengthen and diversify the advanced manufacturing workforce, impacting K-12 teachers and students, undergraduate and graduate students, and professionals in the industry.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to enable a new density improvement approach for ceramic binder jet additive manufacturing, using a tailored feedstock powder and an emerging powder bed formation method. The feedstock powder consists of granules composed of numerous nanoparticles that are weakly bonded together. In the powder bed formation method, compaction is performed after spreading each layer of powder. It is hypothesized that the required compaction pressure to achieve dense ceramic parts is affected by granule characteristics in the following manners: (1) granules with a low density require a lower pressure to fracture or plastically deform (a positive effect), but have a lower initial packing density (a negative effect); (2) granules with a porous structure can be more easily fractured or plastically deformed, but have more initial intragranular pores; (3) granules with a low strength can also be more easily fractured or deformed, but have a reduced initial granule rearrangement. Experimental research will be conducted to identify the tradeoffs associated with each granule characteristic and to determine the conditions under which its positive or negative effect is dominant. Afterward, numerical simulation at the granule and nanoparticle scales will be performed to explain the experimental results and to provide physical insights on underlying compaction mechanisms. This research will generate new knowledge about compaction of multiple thin layers of granules that is critical to binder jet additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These OICs play an important role in technologies such as catalysis, batteries, and shape-memory alloys. Their application space is limited, however, because these materials can only be prepared at high temperatures, often eroding control over important material parameters. Making the low-temperature synthesis of OICs possible requires a precise understanding of how atoms move within solid materials. This Faculty Early Career Award (CAREER) will support research in the laboratory of Dr. Anthony Shoji Hall at the Johns Hopkins University to examine pathways that allow for the control of atom movement at low temperatures and thereby enable the preparation of ordered intermetallic nanomaterials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. By enabling the synthesis of these materials at low temperatures, this work will substantially broaden the application space of OICs because it now allows for more fine control over important materials parameters. Dr. Hall?s laboratory will actively share their scientific passion and discoveries with the broader community by engaging in outreach at inner-city Baltimore high schools and universities. The first activity will leverage an established program, STEM achievement in Baltimore elementary schools (SABES), to encourage elementary students to pursue a degree in STEM. This project will also create a new program to encourage URM high school students to pursue degrees in STEM and to improve the retainment of URM (under)graduate students in STEM careers.<br/> <br/>Technical Summary:<br/>Despite decades of intense research, OIC nanoparticles have failed to replace conventional nanomaterials due to (1) lack of low-temperature synthetic methods that can overcome slow solid-state diffusion rates which inhibits atomic ordering, (2) inability to tune composition and phase to optimize the desired application, and (3) lack of fundamental understanding needed for progress on these issues. The purpose of this CAREER proposal is to examine the phase transformations of low melting point alloys to higher melting point OICs richer in the nobler and more active metal at ambient temperature and pressure by removal of the less noble component (e.g., transforming PdBi2 to Pd3Bi, or CuZn4 to Cu5Zn8) via a process known as dealloying. Fundamental insights from this project will enable the rational development of OIC nanostructures for applications of technological relevance and improve our understanding of material stability under electrocatalytic conditions. To understand the origin of the electrochemical dealloying-mediated phase conversion process,  the PI will investigate the following objectives: (1) Elucidate the role of melting temperature on bulk diffusion and lattice reorganization. (2) Develop synthesis methods for controlled compositions of de-alloyed OICs. (3) Elucidate dealloying via in-situ spectroscopic methods. Materials made by this electrochemically mediated phase conversion process will be evaluated as anodes for Li-metal batteries to demonstrate the utility of the synthetic method. The broader impacts of this proposal will encourage underrepresented minority (URM) K-12 students and (under)graduate students to pursue careers in STEM through engagement in outreach programs.  URM students lack access to relatable role models in STEM fields because of underrepresentation. To address this issue, Dr. Hall will make himself available for informal ?coffee hour discussions? to serve as a mentor and role model for URM students (high school-aged, undergraduate, and graduate students) in the Baltimore area. The Hall group will also work with K-12 aged URM students on inquiry-based scientific projects by participating in the STEM Achievement in Baltimore Elementary Schools (SABES) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One view emphasizes the role of resource misallocation in poor countries. An alternative view emphasizes the role of coordination failures: Individual firms do not find it profitable to adopt advanced technologies unilaterally, even though everyone will benefit from coordinated adoptions. The latter view has a long tradition in policy circles, known as the Big Push. The proposed research bridges these two views in a quantitative framework using granular data. The project explores the notion that the complementary in firms' technology adoption decisions can powerfully amplify the effect of other sources of economic inefficiency. This amplification operates even when there is no coordination failure, and coordination failures can be thought of as an extreme form of amplification. This mechanism not only helps explain the vast differences in income per capital across countries, but also illustrates the conditions under which reforms or industrial policies can have positive impact on the economy and are more likely to succeed.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the model elements that cause the complementary in firms' technology adoption decisions, which is necessary for the equilibrium multiplicity central to the coordination failure view. This research considers complementary rather than multiplicity for implications to be more widely and robustly applicable as equilibrium multiplicity hinges on several restrictive assumptions. The project develops a model of entry and technology adoption by ex-ante heterogeneous firms, which produce differentiated goods, are subject to idiosyncratic distortions, and are connected to one another through input-output linkages. Firms first choose whether to pay a fixed cost and enter the market. Active firms can operate a traditional technology or, upon paying adoption costs, a more productive modern technology. The input-output linkages are the source of the complementary in technology adoption. The project identifies the conditions under which the complementary in firms' technology adoption decisions supports multiple equilibria, which are stronger than the conditions for amplification. Utilizing microeconomic data, the project examines how complementary substantially amplifies the effect of distortions on aggregate productivity, sometimes through equilibrium multiplicity but also when the equilibrium is unique. The project then extends the framework to multi-sector models and dynamic models. The research further explores how complementary in technology adoption may amplify economic shocks over the business cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, the future promise of science is crucially reliant on our ability to analyze such massive and complex datasets. To gain deeper insights here, modern data analysis relies on mathematical abstractions called models. In particular, a central desideratum of machine learning is to find simple models which fit a given dataset. Accordingly, theoretical computer science, machine learning and statistics have developed both mathematical and algorithmic frameworks in this pursuit. The goal of this project is to put this agenda under the lens of computational complexity theory. In particular, using tools and insights from complexity theory, the investigator will study (i) efficient learning algorithms for several high-dimensional models which appear in machine learning and statistics, and (ii) explore the tradeoffs between robustness, efficiency, data size and accuracy for these models. Besides the mathematical foundations of machine learning, the underlying questions also appear in a wide variety of applications ranging from evolutionary biology to signal processing. Through the introduction of new courses at the intersection of complexity theory, machine learning and statistics, as well as other activities such as workshops and seminars, the project will train the next generation of graduate students who will achieve fluency in all of these areas leading to a further cross-pollination of ideas between these disciplines. The project will also support activities aimed at attracting undergraduate students to research in theoretical computer science, especially those from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The project has two principal thrusts: (1) Noise tolerant learning algorithms for high-dimensional models: The project will study both supervised and unsupervised models such as linear separators, Gaussian mixture models and trace reconstruction (which is an abstraction of the problem of ancestral DNA reconstruction from evolutionary biology). For these models, the project will explore the three-way tradeoff between sample efficiency, computational efficiency and noise tolerance. (2) Algorithms to test high dimensional models for sparse representations: Examples of such models include Boolean functions over the hypercube and high-dimensional matrices. The overarching goal here is to design algorithms whose complexity is independent of the ambient dimension, thus avoiding the proverbial curse of dimensionality. Underlying this broad agenda is the insight that Boolean function analysis -- a suite of tools developed in complexity theory which combines combinatorics, harmonic analysis and probability theory -- is an effective algorithmic tool for learning and testing high dimensional models in machine learning and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project from two institutions in Alabama features strong associations with relevant industries in the Southeast. Activities intended to support development of a diverse renewable energy engineering workforce include a renewable makerspace, horizontal integration of sustainability concepts in multiple courses, and enhanced university-industry engagement, such as student field trips to industrial sites and feedback from industry representatives regarding workforce needs.

Recently, prototypes of quantum computers have demonstrated computing power on tasks that are difficult or impossible to be carried out by a conventional computer. However, to achieve a full-scale quantum computer which can carry out universal computation tasks, the critical issue of quantum decoherence ? a process that causes the loss of quantum information and the generation of errors, needs to be addressed first. One promising way to tackle this challenge is to utilize a kind of exotic quantum particles, known as Majorana fermions, that are indistinguishable from their antiparticles. Such unique property allows one to construct the basic element of quantum computing, i.e. a quantum bit or qubit, using a pair of coupled Majorana fermions, which can give rise to a new type of qubit that is naturally protected from decoherence. This project aims to integrate the needed elements to build prototypes of such qubit using new superconductor materials. The project emphasizes on the education and outreach program for graduate and undergraduate students, and K-12 students and schoolteachers, which are combined with the research endeavors to build a next generation quantum-literate workforce.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>The project establishes the material and device foundation for building a topological qubit ? the kind of qubit that is protected against decoherence. The research exploits new materials known as topological superconductors, which have superconducting energy gap in their interiors and harbor Majorana zero modes at their boundaries. The candidate materials are two-dimensional (2D) systems and heterostructures, in which superconductivity, magnetism and spin-orbit coupling co-exist, such as the surface state of (111)-oriented gold coupled to a superconductor and a magnetic insulator. Such materials feature a high degree of tunability and allow the control of Majorana zero modes by manipulating the properties of the superconductor materials themselves. At the same time, the focused materials are scalable, which allows them to be easily fabricated into the needed nano structures/devices by following standard fabrication procedures. The research follows the ?measurement-based? scheme for quantum information processing, which utilizes the concept of quantum state teleportation through a pair of Majorana zero modes. The project aims to achieve several milestones towards achieving a topological qubit, which includes: 1. prove the quantum non-locality of a pair of coupled Majorana zero modes; 2. control Majorana zero modes using tunable superconductor materials; and 3. demonstrate interferometer devices for topological qubit. The success of the project offers a path towards understanding the novel quantum phases emerging in material heterostructures and will stimulate quantum information sciences. The outcome will advance both basic science and information technology, paving the way for the next generation computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While every atom, and hence every material, has some spin-orbit coupling, the symmetry of the arrangement of atoms in certain crystalline compounds may lead to specific types of spin-orbit effects that are beneficial for future technological applications. These applications include the spin transistor, which enables the control of the spin-current of the electrons. If realized on a commercial scale, the spin transistor could lead to a spintronics revolution in the electronics industry. The PI and his team will utilize computer simulations and a field of mathematics, referred to as the group theory, to understand how the crystal structure can be externally manipulated to induce different spin-orbit effects. This fundamental understanding is expected to lead to the prediction of new materials that could help realize spintronics technologies on a commercial scale. <br/><br/>In addition to research efforts, this award also supports the training and education of graduate and undergraduate students and the development of a new teaching approach for concepts related to crystal structures. This new approach will take advantage of the widespread and low cost availability of 3D printers, which will be used to make models that will facilitate learning for undergraduate and graduate students. The computer files for these models will be disseminated publicly along with a set of accompanying exercises for the students. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>This award supports research and educational activities that aim to develop fundamental understanding on the origin of different spin-orbit coupling related effects in nonmagnetic crystalline materials and the connection of these effects with the space group symmetry. These include the well-known Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, as well as numerous higher order terms in the electronic Hamiltonians. While there are many spintronics device proposals that take advantage of spin-orbit coupling, there is a gap between the model Hamiltonians and the real materials where the desired spin-orbit effects are often small, or the Hamiltonians have higher order terms that complicate the observed phenomena. This award aims to fill this gap by extracting realistic models with materials specific parameters by a combination of first principles calculations (Density Functional Theory and Dynamical Mean Field Theory) and group theory. Group representations will be utilized to elucidate the coupling between crystal structural distortions and the electronic structure, and novel means to achieve the electric field control of spin-dependent electronic structure and materials that realize these means will be discovered. Additionally, the effect of strong spin-orbit coupling in the crystal structures of strongly correlated transition metal oxides and their phonon spectra will be studied using first principles correlated electron approaches.  <br/><br/>In addition to supporting the education of a PhD student, the award also provides support for the development of educational materials for more effective teaching of crystallographic concepts to materials science, physics, and chemistry students. The educational part of the award aims to develop low cost educational models of crystal structures and tools for teaching symmetry-related concepts. This will be achieved by using commercially available setups for additive manufacturing. With the help of an undergraduate student, the PI will develop a library of 3D symmetry and structure models, which can be produced at low cost by widely available 3D printers.

Why do the beach-goers not sink into the sandy depths? Though we have the experience to understand that sands, powders, and other granular systems will flow like a fluid or support load like a rigid solid under certain conditions, nobody can reliably or precisely predict when, how, or why these systems will become rigid or flowing. This uncertainty is characteristic of a broad class of rigid, amorphous materials. Examples include sand as well as glass and plastics. Thus, by studying the origins of rigidity in granular materials, the principal investigator hopes to gain insight into a wide variety of systems. The focus of this project is the transmission of stress through the internal structure of a granular material is related to the bulk mechanical response of the material. The research team uses an imaging technique to measure the forces between particles throughout the material. The primary goal is to identify structures, not in the particles' spatial arrangement, but the patterns of force transmitted through the system. To understand these structures, the team leverages new methods to describe complicated networks and geometries. A secondary goal of the project is to manipulate these force-transmission structures to design materials with specific properties. The project will contribute to several educational goals, as well. Specifically, the principal investigator will provide training and mentorship to undergraduate and postdoctoral junior scientists involved in the research and integrate experimental techniques and ongoing research within the project's scope into the core physics curriculum. Additionally, the principal investigator will develop a workshop that prepares research mentors to train a diverse and effective population of junior scientists.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to understand the multi-scale origins of rigidity in amorphous granular materials. The research team will leverage photoelasticimetric imaging, a state of the art spatially- and force-resolved measurement technique, combined with high-resolution, composite imaging to characterize the structure and internal stress state of large granular packings in either biaxial compression or pure shear. The project's primary goal is to identify correlations between the bulk mechanical response of the material and the force-resolved measurements of the material's internal stress state. Prior observations suggest that structures at all scales contribute to the mechanical response of granular materials. Thus, both mean-field descriptions and particle-scale metrics are ill-suited to predicting material rigidity. In contrast, the principal investigator is developing a novel analytic approach based on algebraic topology and the science of networks, which identifies topological features that represent structures at all length-scales. To identify correlations between these topological features and the bulk material response, the research team uses the Support Vector Machines method. This machine learning technique has been effective in predicting local plasticity in colloidal glasses and wet, granular pillars. A secondary goal of the project is to develop strategies for materials design to reproducibly manufacture packings with prescribed topological properties in an approach reminiscent of the design of topologically insulating electronic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In ceramics engineering, many phase diagrams for two and three component systems (components can be elements; such as Zr-C, or groups of elements; such as ZrC-NbC) have been developed. However, as the number of components in the system increases, the number of available phase diagrams decreases due to the complexity involved. Additionally, high temperature ceramic phase diagram data is typically unavailable due to their ultra-high melting points. Some carbides do not melt until ~4000 ?C. This project remedies both of these issues by integrating computational methods with advanced ultra-high temperature experimental techniques to more efficiently develop multi-component (5 component) phase diagrams at ultra-high temperatures (~ 4000 ?C). These multi-component ultra-high temperature phase diagrams will be essential for materials engineers to develop next generation ultra-high temperature materials for applications in hypersonics, nuclear (fission and fusion) reactors and shielding for space craft. In addition, this project is building mentoring chains across age and demographics to facilitate diverse next generation science and engineering leaders. This is achieved through a variety of outreach activities that connect high school students to university students (at the undergraduate and graduate level), and university students to professionals in industry.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The core focus of this research is developing a computer-assisted experimental phase equilibria (CAEPE) methodology that utilizes CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) modelling in combination with Bayesian inference and Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo for error quantification that enable strategic targeted experiments. Core experiments involve collecting thermodynamic and physical data from room temperature to ultra-high temperatures (~4000 ?C) using a series of advanced synthesis, calorimetry, diffraction/scattering, and aerodynamic levitation laser heating techniques. This experimental data is essential for processing and engineering next generation ultra-high temperature materials systems for applications in hypersonics, nuclear (fission and fusion) reactors and shielding for spacecraft. The first material system to be targeted with CAEPE approach is the 5-component monocarbide ZrC-NbC-HfC-TaC-TiC pseudo-quinary system, as it contains the highest melting point material known. Finally, this project will prepare graduate students to think using an integrated computation materials engineering  (ICME) approach, and train them on pioneering, advanced high temperature experimental techniques.

The dominance of synthetic polymers is largely driven by their excellent stability and versatile mechanical properties. However, due to their high durability, waste materials composed of these polymers have accumulated in the land and oceans, causing serious concerns for the ecosystem. In addition, since over 90% of these polymers are derived from finite fossil feedstocks, the production of these materials is unsustainable if they cannot be recycled and reused. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing recyclable polymers that can be broken down into the constituents (monomers) from which they are made. The recycled monomers can be reused to produce the polymers, allowing for a circular use of materials, which not only helps to preserve the finite natural resources used in plastics production, but also addresses the issue of unwanted end-of-life accumulation of plastic objects. Besides demonstrating the recycling of the polymers, the PI plans to tune the thermal and mechanical properties of the polymers to meet the needs of a variety of applications. This project will also contribute to education and broadened participation in materials science and sustainability through developing undergraduate and graduate courses, recruiting underrepresented minority researchers, and reaching out to local high schools and museums. A multimedia exhibition called ?Polymers and Life?, which will include cards, videos and hands-on projects, will be developed in collaboration with the Akron Children?s Museum.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>A promising solution to address the challenges in plastics sustainability is to replace current polymers with recyclable ones in order to achieve a circular use of materials. Despite the progress made thus far, few recyclable polymers exhibit the excellent thermal stability and high-performance mechanical properties of traditional polymers. This project aims to address those challenges by developing polymers that can undergo catalytic depolymerization to yield their constituent monomers. When the catalyst for depolymerization is absent or removed, the polymers will be highly stable and their thermal and mechanical properties can be tuned to meet the needs of various applications. The objectives of the research include design and synthesis of the polymers, demonstration of depolymerizability and stability, and establishment of structure?thermal property relationships and structure?mechanical property relationships. Research results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses. These courses are expected to bridge the knowledge gap between fundamental physical organic chemistry and materials science, integrate experimental and computational research, and enhance student awareness of sustainability. The proposed research will also provide opportunities to attract and nurture a diverse group of future scientists who can participate in research activities on sustainable polymers. In addition, demonstration materials based on the research findings will be developed for use in outreach efforts to local high schools and museums in order to inspire an interest in science in the younger generation.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biofilms are crucial for the environment, industry, and medicine. Biofilms can be beneficial, for example in the microbiome and in bioremediation, but biofilms can also be harmful, for example during infection and because biofilms foul many types of surfaces. Biofilm dispersal is crucial for bacterial spread and for disease transmission, but very little is known about this important process. One aim of this project is to determine the mechanisms that coordinate biofilm dispersal. Another aim of this project is to determine how communication between bacterial cells helps maintain biofilms. An exploration of the role of phages in driving biofilm formation and dispersal will also be a focus of this work   This work will advance the progress of science by revealing the mechanisms that provide bacterial biofilms their resilience and they will reveal biofilm vulnerabilities. Highly talented students will be trained by working on this project. Efforts to increase diversity among those who participate in science research and efforts to expand public access/public understanding of science are central to the project and will be accomplished through a variety of nation-wide science outreach efforts.<br/><br/><br/>The overall goals of this research are to explore the mechanics, spatial and temporal cell-cell communication processes, and signal transduction networks that enable bacteria to build and subsequently disassemble multicellular biofilm communities. An exploration of the role of phages in driving biofilm formation and dispersal will be a focus. The studies will span biological scales - from the molecule, to the protein, to the network, to the cell, to the community. At a basic science level, the work will define the mechanisms bacteria use to uniquely detect and respond to kin and non-kin in communities, how genes and mechanics interact to drive community morphology, and how inter-domain interactions influence multicellular community dynamics. At a practical level, these investigations could lead to synthetic strategies to manipulate biofilm formation and dispersal, quorum-sensing-mediated communication, and phage infection of bacteria. Consequently, the results should reveal the principles underpinning the evolution and maintenance of traits that are not essential under laboratory conditions but are crucial and precisely regulated in nature. With this knowledge in hand, the field should be able to rapidly move forward to develop synthetic strategies to prevent or promote quorum sensing, to prevent or promote single-species and mixed-species biofilm formation, and to prevent or promote biofilm dispersal, as required. Such applications will have industrial, agricultural, and medical relevance.

To advance understanding of cellular materials, the PI will use an interdisciplinary approach that combines knowledge and techniques from physics, geometry, and biology.<br/><br/>Organ surfaces are covered with dense layers of cells, acting as physical barriers. While normally non-migratory, cells can undergo active rearrangements during basic processes such as embryo development, morphogenesis, repair, and remodeling. In these events, the cell layer transitions from a solid-like state to a fluid-like state. This striking transition is traditionally studied in the context of cells on a flat surface. However, most organ surfaces are naturally non-flat, and comprised of curved surfaces such as spheres, saddles, or cylinders. How surface curvature affects cell motion remains largely unknown. To address these questions, the principal investigator will study how cells move collectively on a curved surface and the role of curvature on whether they behave like a solid or a fluid.

Another approach to populate this unoccupied territory in the 2D materials properties space, is to exfoliate new bulk layered materials to produce novel 2D materials. Most of the known thermodynamically stable vdW bonded layered materials have been exfoliated already into the 2D materials. Therefore, novel approaches are necessary to synthesize new bulk layered materials that can be exfoliated. In this project, topochemical reactions are utilized to render strongly bonded ceramic materials into metastable exfoliateable vdW layered materials. To achieve the goal of this project, three specific aims are pursued. The first aim is to develop understanding for the formation reaction mechanism of metastable vdW layered materials. The second is to understand the exfoliation mechanism of these metastable vdW layered materials. The third focuses on heterostructures of 2D materials with aim to unveil the role of interfaces between 2D heterostructures in electrochemical energy storage. In addition to developing a novel family of 2D materials, the understanding and knowledge in this project can be employed to other compositional and structural materials spaces. Part of the educational plan in this project involves integrating a new service-learning section into the Materials Science and Engineering undergraduate course. Undergraduate students develop new hands-on materials activities to engage and educate middle school students in materials science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses a fundamental question about the microbial communities that inhabit the subseafloor sedimentary environment ? to what extent and in what ways are they adapted to the low temperature, high pressure conditions where they are found?  Or, alternatively, are they just accidentally introduced from the shallower and lower-pressure world where the organic matter that feeds them largely originates?  This project is examining how these organisms metabolize organic matter in sediments.  The project is also advancing the development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It introduces 10 or more students to sea-going research, by including them as shipboard scientists. The project especially focusses on creating and funding opportunities for students from minority groups under-represented in STEM fields, students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and students from Puerto Rico, and from multiple educational stages (ranging from community college to graduate school), with diverse STEM interests. Study of samples and data from the expedition are central to graduate and undergraduate research by students from these multiple institutions. The project also supports the broader science community by collecting and providing diverse samples for additional studies, including, but not limited to, studies of deep-water residence time in a deep-sea trench, past oceanographic conditions, and subseafloor microbes. <br/><br/>The fundamental objective of this project is to determine how the subseafloor microbial communities and activities across a gradient of oceanic depth zones (sublittoral, bathyal, abyssal, hadal) are impacted by the pressure of the surrounding water. The primary hypothesis being tested is that ?microbial communities in subseafloor sediment are adapted for in situ pressure.? The null hypothesis is that these ?communities are merely remnant populations introduced from shallower depths and poorly adapted for in situ pressure.? To test these hypotheses, the project compares the subseafloor communities and rates of activity that occur in anoxic subseafloor sediment at ocean depths ranging from 50 to ~8400 meters below sea level in the Puerto Rico Trench region. To collect the samples and shipboard data, the project includes a 26-day coring program. The project interrogates the genomic composition and community metabolic rates of the subseafloor sedimentary communities over this full range of ocean depths. Experiments are being conducted to determine the pressure-dependence of potential processes (sulfate reduction and methanogenesis) and genes that are preferentially expressed at in situ pressures by sublittoral, bathyal, abyssal and hadal subseafloor communities. These results are synthesized to identify the nature and extent of adaptations to in situ pressure in subseafloor communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Performance issues can lead to severe consequences, including budget overrun, project delay, and market loss. In past decades, Moore?s Law greatly benefited software performance by offering exponentially more powerful hardware resources. Unfortunately, in recent years, advancement on the hardware side is reaching physical limitations. Therefore, the need for transforming performance-engineering techniques on the software side becomes more critical and urgent. This research aims to develop a framework composed of cutting-edge techniques that can transform how practitioners manage, identify, and address real-life software performance issues.<br/> <br/>This project focuses on three gaps in the current research and practice of software performance engineering. First, there is a lack of a large-scale database and comprehensive understanding of common performance issues in real-world projects. Second, despite the ubiquity of software architecture, there is inadequate understanding of how complicated architectural connections contribute to performance issues and of how fixing harmful connections leads to rewarding optimization. Finally, there is a lack of a systematic understanding of different levels of optimization tactics -- reusable resolution patterns -- for addressing real-life performance issues with different concerning scopes. This project bridges these gaps through three progressive research thrusts. Thrust 1 will construct and maintain an open database of common types of real-life performance issues, leveraging natural-language-processing techniques. Thrust 2 will contribute an architecture-centric approach that identifies architecturally connected performance-optimization opportunities, based on novel graph-embedding techniques. The proposed approach will seamlessly integrate architecture modeling and performance analysis. Thrust 3 will provide developers with actionable guidance in mitigating performance issues. This thrust will first curate multi-level performance optimization tactics from extensive empirical studies, and then build a recommender system to suggest the proper tactics to developers in performance optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our nation?s military veterans and service members deeply reflect these groups and represent a robust and diverse community of highly trained and skilled residents who, through their military affiliation, possess substantial opportunities for education-related financial support. Despite their strong and tangible potential for strengthening and diversifying the engineering workforce, military-connected students remain overlooked and understudied in higher education research, generally, and engineering education research, specifically. Focused on the development of U.S. military veterans and service members as engineers, this project will support the National Science Foundation (NSF) Professional Formation of Engineers program and contribute to NSF?s efforts to broaden participation in engineering, promote re-entry of women and women veterans into the STEM workforce, and provide alternative pathways for veterans into STEM-related industries. This project will advance NSF program goals by generating new knowledge about how student veterans and service members experience engineering education and by producing innovative and inclusive programs, web-based resources, and trainings aimed at improving the participation and persistence of military-connected students in engineering education. <br/><br/>The objectives of this CAREER project are to 1) characterize the community cultural wealth of student veterans and service members (SVSM) and critique the educational structures impacting their participation and persistence in engineering, 2) construct a SVSM identity model, and 3) conduct an asset campaign to cultivate broad awareness of SVSM community cultural wealth, infuse asset-based counter narratives into dominant educational discourses of deficit and deviance about military veterans, and dismantle structural inequities that inhibit the participation, persistence, and professional formation of military-connected students in engineering. The project will enable a theoretically rich, contextualized, and longitudinal qualitative research plan to tell, share, and examine narratives of experience with diverse, military-connected undergraduates over a five-year project period. The project will engage military-connected undergraduates enrolled in engineering programs across five public universities and community colleges, two of which are emerging Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Using a relational ontology and viewing narratives of experience that are situated in time, place, and social milieus as research phenomenon and research method, the project will be guided by two research questions: <br/><br/>1) How do SVSM participate and persist in undergraduate engineering education? <br/>2) How do SVSM produce engineering identities during their undergraduate engineering education? <br/><br/>This project will address critical gaps in the research literature about asset-based frameworks and targeted professional identity development supports for SVSM in engineering. Project outcomes are transformative in that they will 1) add to and refine an emerging Veteran Critical Theory through in-depth accounts of the community cultural wealth of military-connected students and provide counternarratives that redress current discourses of veteran deficit and deviance in education,  2) add to current theoretical understandings of the professional formation of engineers by proposing a model of student veteran and service member engineering identity development, and 3) advocate for military-connected students across key support communities at five partner institutions and nationally online. Sustained project impact will occur through the broad dissemination of tested educational resources, including accessible military-connected student peer ally and professional mentorship programs and sensitivity- and awareness-trainings and online resources for engineering administrators, faculty and staff.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project studies the properties of surfaces, which fall into two categories: finite-type and infinite-type. The theory of finite-type surfaces has been historically more developed than that of infinite-type surfaces, partly because there is a simple classification of all finite-type surfaces. The primary goal of the research project is to significantly deepen understanding of infinite-type surfaces, which are ubiquitous in topology, geometry, and dynamics. The first part is aimed at characterizing their geometric symmetries (isometry groups). The second and third parts concern their topological symmetries (mapping class groups), with the long-term goal of completely classifying the different types of topological symmetries.  The educational component of this project consists of three parts. The first part is a research training and professional development graduate student workshop for students in algebra, geometry, topology, and number theory. This workshop is aimed at early-career graduate students and intended to serve as a bridge between successful programs like the EDGE summer program and research-focused workshops for advanced graduate students. One of the goals is to support the participants in their transition between coursework and research-based mathematics. The second part of the educational component is the expansion of an existing high school outreach program in Salt Lake City. The third part is a speaker series featuring prominent individuals in STEM. <br/><br/>The research focus of this project is on infinite-type surfaces and their groups of symmetries. Infinite-type surfaces arise naturally in many contexts, such as in the study of group actions on the plane, and are intimately related to the study of quasiconformal maps. The first part of this project, aimed at characterizing isometry groups of infinite-type surfaces, is inspired by Felix Klein's suggestion from 1872 that groups of geometric symmetries be used to better understand the geometry of Riemann surfaces. The results regarding isometry groups are used in-turn to produce algebraic invariants of the mapping class group. This group can be thought of as the group of topological symmetries of the surface and is the focus of the second and third parts of the project. In particular, the second part is aimed at producing algebraic invariants of the mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces via subgroup constructions, and the third part focuses on using the actions of mapping class groups on hyperbolic graphs to produce a Nielsen-Thurston type classification for these surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These spaces play important roles in the mathematical areas of topology and geometry, as well as in models of important physical systems. Because humans cannot visualize four spatial dimensions, it is necessary to develop mathematical and diagrammatic tools to study these spaces.  Historically, 4-dimensional spaces have displayed unusual phenomena, distinct from spaces of either lower or higher dimensions. A persistent theme in the discovery of such phenomena is the role of symplectic geometry. Although symplectic geometry was initially formulated to encode the equations of Hamiltonian physics, it has grown into an important abstract mathematical topic that is particularly powerful for studying 4-dimensional spaces. This project aims to use cutting-edge tools to make novel advances in 4-dimensional symplectic geometry. Because this is a rapidly growing field, training a well-prepared and diverse next generation is particularly important. To that end, the PI will create a new undergraduate course, run speaking workshops for graduate students, develop a paired graduate-undergraduate reading program, and organize workshops, summer schools, and conferences.<br/><br/>The project will study symplectic 4-manifolds and singular symplectic surfaces. The first primary goal is to create diagrammatic methods to study the subtleties of diffeomorphism classes of symplectic 4-manifolds. The second goal is to produce new symplectic isotopy classifications for smooth and singular symplectic surfaces. The third goal is to perform new calculations of existing symplectic invariants and to define new invariants for symplectic 4-manifolds and their submanifolds. The project will employ four mathematical methods to study symplectic 4-manifolds and surfaces: branched coverings of braided surfaces, trisections, (de)singularization, and Weinstein handlebodies. The fourth goal is to create a pipeline of new mathematicians well trained in the study of manifolds and skilled in scientific communication and research. The project includes training of students at the graduate and undergraduate levels in geometry, topology, and 4-dimensional spaces, as well as in clear communication and mentoring skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Discovery of new materials has historically been achieved by diligent but expensive experimentation, but the advent of the computer changed this process.  A rapid rise in computing power brings with it the possibility of simulating chemistry and physics to understand material processes at a microscopic level and to run programs that design new materials from the atoms up.  In principle, such simulations are easy to formulate, as the equations of quantum mechanics that govern the constituent electrons can be written down on the back of an envelope.  In practice, however, the equations become impossible to solve in all but the simplest situations, and the search for approximate models that are both accurate and efficient to compute is ongoing.  Many of the most successful approximations to date fall into the class of ""density-functional theory"" (DFT), in which the complexity of the electronic quantum wave function is eschewed in favor of manipulating the simpler electron density function.  This CAREER award supports basic research around density functional development, analyzing the fundamental quantum-mechanical nature of how electrons repel each other by interrogating the ""exchange-correlation hole"", a key object describing how finding an electron at one position reduces the chance of finding another electron elsewhere.  The exchange-correlation hole will first be analyzed in some simple systems that challenge current DFT approximations, and this information will then be used to build more advanced DFT approximations.  The resulting approximations will be tested in more complex systems relevant to technological applications.  This research project will support, and be supported by, a high-school, undergraduate, and graduate education program that places importance on encouraging the participation of under-represented groups.  The project's work and teaching will support outreach to community members in the New Orleans region who do not typically have access to high-quality opportunities for STEM mentorship.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>A disconnect has emerged between applications of electronic-structure calculations and the underlying analyses that inform when and why a particular theory is successful.  Of the many electronic-structure methods available, density-functional theory (DFT) has become the most popular.  This project will analyse and improve approximations to the DFT exchange-correlation (XC) energy by modelling, interpreting, and visualizing the underlying XC hole, one of the most fundamental aspects of DFT.  The results will be validated for a variety of molecules and solids, in particular transition-metal compounds.  Whilst DFT is exact for the ground-state energy and electron density in principle, in practice the accuracy and efficiency are limited by the approximation of the XC energy, which can be formally defined by connection to the XC hole.  Historically, developing an understanding of the XC hole has played a vital role in developing density-functional approximations and explaining their successes, though recent research into the XC hole has fallen behind the development of XC energy approximations.  This has occurred for two reasons: 1) a practical DFT calculation needs only an XC energy approximation, resulting in developers overlooking XC holes in favor of energy densities and a gap in user understanding of XC holes, and 2) the formally defined XC hole is complicated to compute and only available for a few simple many-electron systems.  This project will close the gap between users and developers as well as accelerating research in XC holes, and thus DFT generally, by i) accurately computing the formally defined XC holes for carefully chosen systems with interesting properties that are challenging to existing density-functional approximations, ii) reverse engineering holes for popular XC energy approximations and visualizing them against reference XC holes, iii) improving XC energy approximations using knowledge obtained from XC hole research, and iv) validating the existing and improved XC energy approximations on difficult systems with emphasis on transition-metal compounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials also have large spin-orbit coupling, which makes these perovskites a candidate for spintronic devices. Spintronics combines electronics with spin, an intrinsic property of elementary particles, to enable novel technologies such as energy efficient devices for data storage or advanced computing. Spintronic devices based on quantum wells made by alternating layers of inorganic semiconductors such as silicon or germanium are expensive to make by epitaxial growth. In contrast, a two-dimensional hybrid perovskite with a natural quantum well structure consisting of alternating organic and inorganic layers can be fabricated via low-cost, facile solution processing. Although perovskites meet several important prerequisites for viable spintronic devices, there is lack of fundamental understanding of the spin-related phenomena in this new type of quantum well. In this project, the research team will optically probe and manipulate spins in hybrid perovskite quantum wells. The project will yield a fundamental understanding of spin degree of freedom in these materials.

These materials have strong spin-orbit coupling, high-charge mobility, and an intrinsic quantum well structures with many interfaces and facile solution processability. Giant Rashba splitting was experimentally confirmed in these materials, highlighting their potential for cost-effective room temperature spintronic devices. However, a few key questions remain that need to be answered to clear the pathway to viable devices. The central question is how spin photocurrent is generated and manipulated in two-dimensional HOIP multiple quantum well. The goal of the project is to deepen the fundamental understanding of this new type of multiple quantum well by conducting a comprehensive study on spin photocurrent dependence on quantum well structure, crystal symmetry and imperfection. The quantum well structure in a HOIP can be easily tuned from pure two dimensional to quasi three dimensional by varying the number of inorganic layers. Hypothetically, the roles of excitons (dominant in two dimension) and free carriers (dominant in three dimension) will shift. The focus of this proposal is to characterize the difference of spin photocurrent behaviors in ?excitonic? and ?free carrier? quantum wells using photogalvanic spectroscopy. The objectives of the study are to measure spin photocurrent for free carriers and extract the information about Rashba/Dresselhaus effects, investigate the origin of spin-polarized current from excitons, and characterize the spin polarization of free and bound excitons through photogalvanic spectroscopy. The knowledge gained from this project is expected to complement the spin-photophysics well studied in two-dimensional electron gas quantum wells, and be informative to scientists working in optoelectronic and spintronics applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research project is to better understand how these collective motions appear by employing simple three-dimensional biomimetic materials. These active materials are composed of proteins that can self-propel by harvesting energy from their environment. Two types of 3D liquid crystals will be investigated where the propulsion is driven by either molecular motors or by biofilaments that grow from one end and shrink from the other, recapitulating two fundamental mechanisms employed by living cells to migrate.

Nearly 80% of undergraduate degrees are awarded in non-science majors. However, no consensus currently exists about the purposes of science laboratory experiences in the general education undergraduate curriculum. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this a critical time to examine the value of laboratories for non-majors.  As enrollment shrinks and financial strains grow, higher education institutions need to cut costs.  This need places non-majors? laboratories at risk because of costs in student and faculty time, physical resources, equipment, and consumable supplies. The goal of this project is to identify the highest priority biology laboratory experiences for non-majors taking general education biology courses with laboratories and to examine gaps in practice.  The results of this study can help shape the future of science and laboratory instruction in general education curricula.  <br/><br/>The project will explore the research question, ?What is the role of the biology laboratory in the general education curriculum?? The first phase will be completion of a Delphi study, which is a vetted consensus-building process.  Through this study, the research team will engage a panel of disciplinary experts in a dialogue to identify the role and goals of laboratories for non-majors in general education biology courses. The outcome of the Delphi Study will be increased disciplinary engagement in the issue and an agreement about the role of biology laboratories for non-majors. The second phase will be a gap analysis in which the Delphi Study findings will be used as the ?optimal state? to explore gaps between the expert ideal and current practices.  The gap analysis will use data from syllabus reviews, practitioner surveys, and focus group interviews.  The gap analysis process is expected to result in increased practitioner awareness of laboratory goals and objectives, thus informing practice. By focusing on the role of biology laboratories for non-majors, this project has the potential to advance a general framework for optimizing the role and objectives for science laboratories in the general education curriculum. In addition, the data could be used to create more meaningful and purposeful laboratory experiences.  Consequently, the findings may be transformative for general education science curricula. The research findings will be disseminated to a broad audience via a combination of peer reviewed manuscripts and other communications, with the intention of making explicit the role of laboratory experiences in achieving a scientifically literate public.

Condensed matter physics concerns itself with systems composed of a large number of interacting constituents. Materials are a common example as they contain many atoms and many electrons. It is common to think of such complex systems not in terms of the individual constituents, but rather in terms of properties that emerge from their collective behavior. The concept of phases of matter is an important example of a collective property. Systems that show the same phase have similar properties. Ferromagnets have the collective property that the constituent atoms or electrons align in such a way that the magnetic axis of each one points in the same direction. Ferromagnets made of different materials are all ferromagnets. However, a ferromagnet is qualitatively different from an antiferromagnetic phase in which the magnetic axis of one atom points in the direction opposite that of its neighbor. So, systems that belong to the same phase have similar qualitative properties, while systems that belong to different phases have different properties. When quantum mechanics mingles with strong interactions among constituents very strange phases can emerge,  such as the topological phases of the fractional quantum Hall effect; the latter occurs when electrons confined to a two-dimension plane by semiconductors are exposed to an intense magnetic field.<br/><br/>Recently proposed fracton phases of matter are another turning point in this development. These phases have the interesting and distinct property of being hypersensitive to the geometry of the underlying material, for example the way atoms are organized on a lattice, as well as the presence of geometric distortions of the lattice. The PI will undertake a careful study and characterization of these phases, which necessitates the development new concepts and new theoretical tools. New tools will help advance understanding of the physical properties of fracton phases as well as suggest routes for experimental detection of fractions in materials. This is fundamental research; however, fractons could play an important role in developing quantum memory, and suggest new ways to think about quantum computing. Finally, it is already becoming clear that some fracton phenomena may have been discovered long ago in superfluids and liquid crystals, without realizing that these are but a page of a much bigger story. The PI will utilize the new techniques developed in the fracton context to gain new insights into the problems of vortices in superconductors, turbulence, and quantum liquid crystals.<br/><br/>The education component of this CAREER project includes training undergraduate and graduate students.

The project is focused on the physics of systems that support emergent fracton excitations. These excitations possess two remarkable properties: (i) they are topologically non-trivial and (ii) they cannot freely move through space. The constraints on their motion arise dynamically, while the underlying physical system is translation invariant. <br/><br/>More concretely the research concentrated on three major efforts. (i) Fracton excitations can emerge in gapless correlated spin liquids. The PI will explore how the existence of these excitations affects observable properties of these systems. (ii) The constrained mobility of fracton excitations can be formally imposed by introducing additional symmetries. The variety of all possible mobility constraints roughly corresponds to all possible symmetries of this kind. The PI will develop a general theory of such symmetries and their manifestation in low energy properties of the physical systems constrained by these symmetries. (iii) A particular form of fracton behavior is already present in well-known systems such as superfluids, liquid crystals and quantum Hall states, where vortices, crystalline defects and composite fermions have a subtle version of constrained motion. The PI will investigate this tantalizing connection with the expectation that fracton machinery will provide a fresh look at these systems.<br/> <br/>The education component of this CAREER project includes training undergraduate and graduate students.

To describe the specific problem to be investigated, note that a theorem of Ando from 1963 says that if T is a pair of commuting contractions on a Hilbert space, then, for any polynomial p, the norm of p(T) is at most the maximum modulus of p on the bidisk. This fails for 3 or more commuting contractions, but it is unknown whether the inequality still holds with a constant or not. This has proved to be a huge stumbling block in developing multivariable operator theory from two to three or more variables.

Which cancer treatments are best for which patients?  Does incarceration impede or encourage recidivism? Causal inference is concerned with formulating such questions mathematically, exploring whether answers can be obtained from data, and if so, determining how well and with what methods. The classical setup in causal inference explores effects of simple interventions, and presumes confounding relationships are straightforward enough to estimate with relatively low error. However, simple ""all-or-nothing"" effects may mask underlying heterogeneity, and can be practically unrealistic or nearly impossible to estimate, for example if some subjects have no chance of receiving treatment. Further, in modern contexts, confounders are often high-dimensional and relate to exposures and outcomes in unknown and possibly very complex ways. Accommodating realistic confounding and heterogeneity are two of the most central challenges in modern causal inference. These pursuits yield myriad open questions, from understanding fundamental limits of causal inference in high dimensions to exploring entirely new effects altogether. This project aims to help address these questions by developing novel theory and methods and advancing the application of causal inference in fields such as public policy and medicine. Outreach is also a major component. New software will be made freely available in R. The PI will design an undergraduate course on quantitative causal reasoning, to help push data literacy forward from association to causation. A textbook will be written, and there will be numerous opportunities for broad participation, including summer programs, workshops, and short courses.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new theory and methods for the study of more nuanced - yet practical - effect measures, accommodating the complex data structures often found in practice. The research will focus on (1) adjustment for high-dimensional confounding and (2) flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects and optimal treatment regimes. Extensions will also be pursued for multivalued time-varying exposures subject to unmeasured confounding. For (1), the PI aims to develop novel non-asymptotic risk bounds for both classical and new propensity-based effects, as well as minimax lower bounds. This is accomplished in a high-dimensional discrete model (new to causal inference) as well as with continuous data. For (2), the PI plans to determine the fundamental limits of heterogeneous effect estimation in flexible nonparametric models, develop and analyze novel heterogeneous effect estimators, and study optimal treatment regimes under novel ""contact constraints."" This work has the potential to help transform our understanding of causal inference in the modern big data era. The projects will also directly contribute to research on specific applications in sociology, criminology, and medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacterial transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA and turn nearby genes on or off in response to environmental or internal cues. Regulation is essential so that the bacteria can survive stress and reproduce as efficiently as possible.   Presently, the DNA binding sites for most bacterial transcription factors are unknown. The lab has developed a novel selection method that can be conducted in a test tube and allows them to screen billions of DNA sequences to find ones that a transcription factor can bind.  Having identified those sequences it is possible to find those sequences in the genome sequence of the bacterium and then infer a likely biological role for the transcription factor.   This project aims to identify the DNA binding sites for transcription factors in the extremophile Thermus thermophilus, a model organism whose proteins are widely used in biotechnology and biomanufacturing.  This project has implications for many industries, ranging from agribusiness and medical testing to consumer products and waste treatment. These applications could be improved through better understanding gene regulation in such extremophiles.  This project will also train both undergraduate and master?s students in the biochemistry and bioinformatics of protein-DNA interactions, thereby providing future scientists with expertise in these fields.  <br/><br/>This research project seeks to better understand transcriptional regulatory networks in the model extremophile T. thermophilus HB8. The binding specificity of putative transcription factors will be determined using the iterative selection method Restriction Endonuclease Protection, Selection, and Amplification, followed by massively parallel semiconductor sequencing and Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation analysis. Potential binding sites will then be mapped to the Thermus thermophilus HB8 genome using Find Individual Motif Occurrences and functionally validated in vitro (electrophoretic mobility shift assays, biolayer interferometry) and in vivo (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reactions, microarray data). Information from this study will provide a better understanding of regulons within a model bacterial extremophile. They will also contribute to ongoing collaborative projects, for example, the Structural-Biological Whole Cell Project, which seeks to understand the molecular constituents of life at an atomic level. Finally, this project's methods should broadly apply to characterizing orphan transcription factors and defining regulons in many other organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PIs integrate political science and cognitive science to understand the conditions that influence the formation and revision of false beliefs, and how to foster the spread of accurate information. The insights that the PIs generate will help to advance theories around belief updating by reconciling apparently contradictory results regarding the role of political knowledge and sophistication from political science and cognitive science. The PIs' work advances emerging theories concerning motivations for online sharing. In addition to these intellectual benefits, the work will also directly inform efforts to encourage people to be more responsible and informed citizens, especially online. Reducing belief in, and sharing of, inaccurate information benefits democratic societies by helping citizens make decisions that reflect their preferences.<br/><br/>The PIs identify the cognitive basis of belief in misleading information. Prior research typically emphasizes one of two factors: political knowledge or cognitive style. However, by examining these two concepts in isolation, previous scholars have been unable to disentangle the independent influence of each factor. Across a series of proposed correlation and experimental survey studies, the PIs  juxtapose political knowledge and cognitive style, in order to understand whether, and in what ways, these two factors independently shape belief in and responses to inaccurate information. Based on the results of this first strand of work, the PIs develop a set of behavioral interventions to encourage people to become more responsible citizens. While previous approaches to correcting misleading information have primarily involved the provision of specific pieces of factual information, such as fact-checking messages, They instead favor two alternative sets of strategies: (1) improving the quality of content that individuals encounter online, and (2) inducing individuals to pay greater attention to accuracy when evaluating this content. The PIs evaluate the effectiveness of such approaches using survey experiments and social media field experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, parametric methods are often inadequate in the analysis of complex high-dimensional data arising from genomics, epidemiology, and bioinformatics. This necessitates the development of procedures that are agnostic to the distribution of the data, computationally efficient, and yet statistically powerful for large nonparametric classes. Similarly, the classical assumption of independence is routinely violated in combinatorial datasets arising from social networks, making it increasingly important to develop realistic and mathematically tractable methods for modeling structure and dependence in high-dimensional distributions. This project leverages ideas from recent developments in optimal transport theory, random geometric graphs, and statistical physics to gain a deeper understanding of (1) multivariate distribution-free inference and (2) dependent network data. The educational and outreach component of this project will aim to foster undergraduate research and prepare graduate students in mentoring, through curriculum development, directed reading groups, and summer programs. <br/> <br/>The first component of this project will study the efficiency properties of nonparametric, distribution-free two-sample tests based on the emerging theory of multivariate ranks, which include, among others, the rank analogue of the celebrated energy distance test. The project will also explore the asymptotic properties of tests based on optimal matchings and their applications to detecting balance in observational studies. The second component of this project will focus on modeling dependence in complex relational data, using the Ising model and, more generally, higher-order (tensor) Markov random fields. The goal here is to build a framework for simultaneously modeling the network dependency (arising from neighborhood interactions) and the individual node effects, and to develop a holistic theory of parameter estimation in these models using recent advances on random tensors and tools from statistical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As they serve in high need schools, the new teachers will receive resources, support, and incentives to help them succeed and persist in a teaching career.   These highly skilled mathematics teachers can help improve the mathematics skills of middle and high school students, helping to ensure the students build a foundation for STEM careers.   <br/><br/>This five-year project at Otterbein University includes a partnership central Ohio?s Columbus City Schools, Ohio?s largest public school district. Project goals include: (1) Recruit, retain, and graduate 20 mathematics undergraduate majors who also earn an Adolescent to Young Adult Teaching Licensure; (2) Implement academic programs to support pre-service mathematics teachers to use research-based pedagogies for achievement in high-need, urban settings; (3) Provide induction support for new mathematics teachers in high-need, urban schools to foster teacher success and retention; and (4) Advance the knowledge base for pre-service teacher preparation through rigorous assessment and evaluation of project interventions. The project team will investigate the research question: ?What is the impact of a five-day, intensive urban teaching workshop and participation in a professional learning community on knowledge, perception, interest, and attitudes of pre-service teaching candidates?? The findings from this research can contribute to the knowledge base regarding factors that attract STEM students to teaching and effective methods to prepare teacher candidates for high-need urban schools.

While problems in this area are often simple to state, they can be fiendishly difficult to solve. The subfield of function field number theory aims to obtain insight on these problems by considering a kind of model or parallel universe where numbers behave differently. We consider what happens when we add or multiply numbers as normal but, except, instead of carrying digits, we simply drop the excess. Certainly arithmetic is a little easier with this modified rule, but more surprisingly, some of the most important problems in number theory become easier as well, with even some of the most difficult ones becoming solvable. (Technically, we should work in binary, or any prime base, rather than our usual base 10, for this.) Alternately, we can describe this variant arithmetic as the addition or multiplication of polynomial functions in a single variable. In this setting, we can connect number-theoretic questions to geometry, by viewing the graph of the polynomial as a geometric object. In this award  the PI's research uses geometric tools to solve new problems in this area.<br/><br/>The PI's research has resolved function field analogues of classical problems in number theory, including the twin primes conjecture and Chowla's conjecture (both joint with Shusterman), cases of the Ramanujan conjecture (joint with Templier), and conjectures about moments of L-functions. In this award the PI will continue along these lines, proving additional results about the distribution of prime numbers, L-function moments, and automorphic forms, and work in further directions such as non-abelian Cohen-Lenstra heuristics. These works are all based on etale cohomology theory, where the foundational result, Deligne's Riemann Hypothesis, allows many different analytic problems (problems about proving some inequality) to be reduced to cohomology problems (problems about calculating some of the cohomology groups of a variety or sheaf). The relevant varieties are high-dimensional, and calculating the necessary cohomology groups requires techniques like vanishing cycles theory and the characteristic cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, a fundamental problem in Earth sciences is the intrinsic difficulty in recognizing sediment derived from the erosion of primary crystalline rocks versus sediment that may represent multiple episodes of weathering, erosion, and transport. Resolving these differences is essential to understanding the growth of the continental crust, continental-scale river drainage reversals, and glacial-interglacial landscape change. This project will focus on the signals of recycling on the geochemistry of detrital minerals during the evolution of the Sierras Pampeanas province of South America. The Sierras Pampeanas are the modern archetype for the lithospheric response to flat slab subduction and an ideal setting to develop improved metrics for geochemical signatures of recycling needed to better understand the evolution of the continental lithosphere. Educational activities focus on increasing participation and retention of under-represented groups in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) by bridging high school through graduate school laboratory and field experiences. Partnership with the University College Access Program at the University of Connecticut will develop summer internships designed for high school students to gain early exposure to Earth sciences. Geologic field trips in the Hartford Rift Basin, hands-on and virtual laboratory experiments in thermochronology, and mentoring by undergraduate and graduate students will broaden student interns? experiences and success in higher education STEM opportunities. Graduate student training in thermochronology will contribute towards a stronger technical workforce in support of major instrumentation and technological initiatives in the Earth sciences. Project collaborations will enhance research infrastructure and education technology transfer among collaborating U.S. and Argentine institutions.<br/><br/>This project centers on advancing scientific knowledge of the controlling factors and diagnostic geochemical signatures of sediment recycling during the evolution of the continental lithosphere. By using the emerging detrital monazite thermochronometer alongside established zircon geochronology, thermochronology, and sedimentary compositional archives, an integrated sedimentary provenance analysis will capture the discrete polycyclic histories of continental growth and basin evolution in the Sierras Pampeanas. Research components of the program include: (1) fieldwork and sample collection, (2) detrital zircon geochronology and thermochronometry, (3) development of detrital monazite double-dating thorium-lead-helium (Th-Pb-He) thermochronometry, (4) compositional provenance analysis, and (5) synthesis and thermal history modeling of datasets to explore how different sediment recycling scenarios impact detrital datasets. This research will generate detrital fingerprinting and source characterization of the Sierras Pampeanas to track the influence of pre-existing structures and basin inversion on sediment transfer during flat-slab deformation; streamlined analytical workflows for detrital monazite geochronology, geochemistry, and thermochronometry; and development of a new multiproxy metric for sediment recycling in polycyclic settings. These fundamental advances have wide-ranging applicability in the Earth sciences for correctly quantifying continental weathering and erosion rates, crustal growth, source-to-sink sediment budgets, and constraining rock deformational histories tied to tectonic and earthquake cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, refined techniques have been developed to treat nonlocal differential aspects, and it is the aim of the investigator to further develop and implement these techniques for geometric-topological aspects. The fundamental issues the project aims to understand are optimal shapes under such nonlocal equations, and the controllability of geometry and topology via nonlocal models.

The methods, in particular from harmonic analysis, provide bridges between different areas of analysis, geometry, and topology, and the underlying goal is to find and further study these links. A large part of this project is concerned with applications of fractional harmonic analysis in geometric partial differential equations and the geometric calculus of variations. Problems include nonlocal self-repulsive knot and curvature energies (existence and regularity), the half-wave map equation motivated from physics (well-posedness), and analysis of the free boundary of variational problems with geometric constraints (regularity). A second part is concerned with application of harmonic analysis in quantitative topology for problems with maps that have less than one derivative (i.e., Hlder maps, maps in fractional Sobolev spaces): sharp estimates of the topological degree and the topological-analytical study of the Heisenberg group are treated.

Far from being esoteric, this world describes the procession of the days of the week (p = 7), the fundamentals of computer architecture (p = 2), and is also the setting for important cryptosystems.  Characteristic p algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects (""varieties"") given by solutions to polynomial equations in this world (e.g., the elliptic curves fundamental to the aforementioned cryptosystems), whereas mixed characteristic algebraic geometry is the study of varieties in a ""hybrid"" world serving as a bridge from the characteristic p world to our more familiar world where all directions go on forever.

This project brings new algebraic techniques to bear on the topic of singularities in mixed characteristic algebraic geometry, with one main goal to explicitly analyze what processes are necessary to ""resolve"" them, i.e, smooth them out. The educational plan for the project provides opportunities at levels from high school to graduate school. Specifically, the PI's graduate students will work directly with the PI on the main research project, the PI will advise undergraduate research in related areas of number theory, the PI will help plan events for Baruch College's chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics, and the PI will continue his commitment to mathematics education in Liberia by running a mathematics competition for Liberian high school students, as well as a series of remote workshops for their teachers.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is dedicated to applications and generalizations of Mac Lane valuations, which give explicit, computationally useful descriptions of normal models of the projective line over a valued field.

The PI will apply Mac Lane valuations to (1) refine his previous results on conductor-discriminant inequalities for hyperelliptic curves and extend them to superelliptic curves and (2) shed light on the relationship between regular models, semistable models, and the ramification theory of ``purely arithmetic'' covers of Berkovich spaces. Furthermore, he will work to build a theory of Mac Lane valuations for higher genus curves. The second part of the project is devoted to understanding when branched Galois covers of curves lift from characteristic p to characteristic zero and to obtaining information about the geometry of the space of lifts.

The stackable certificates will combine coursework in Precision Agriculture and Unmanned Aircraft Systems and be designed specifically for high school students.  Participants will complete this curriculum while obtaining industry experience through apprenticeships with industry partners. The project will focus on increasing the diversity of the agriculture workforce by increasing involvement of female and minority secondary students.  Food security and agricultural exports are a major part of the US economy.  Thus, improving training opportunities in agriculture is essential to continuing the strong presence of US agriculture on the world stage.    <br/><br/>The goals of the project are to establish a new Early College and Career Academy Program; establish work-based learning opportunities with regional employers; and increase participation of traditionally underrepresented students in agriculture.  The precision agriculture sector continues to modernize and the importance of well-trained students is becoming increasingly critical.  Many precision agriculture companies struggle to fill open positions as the workforce ages out and the younger generation is drawn away from careers in agriculture. Creating new pathways to encourage secondary students to explore careers as technicians in precision agriculture will ensure the availability of a robust workforce.  Project participants will be well prepared to enter and advance in the growing precision agriculture industry. By developing credentials and apprenticeship opportunities for secondary students the project will be educating future technicians in line with industry needs.

This project addresses a fundamental question about the microbial communities that inhabit the subseafloor sedimentary environment ? to what extent and in what ways are they adapted to the low temperature, high pressure conditions where they are found?  Or, alternatively, are they just accidentally introduced from the shallower and lower-pressure world where the organic matter that feeds them largely originates?  This project is examining how these organisms metabolize organic matter in sediments.  The project is also advancing the development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It introduces 10 or more students to sea-going research, by including them as shipboard scientists. The project especially focusses on creating and funding opportunities for students from minority groups under-represented in STEM fields, students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and students from Puerto Rico, and from multiple educational stages (ranging from community college to graduate school), with diverse STEM interests. Study of samples and data from the expedition are central to graduate and undergraduate research by students from these multiple institutions. The project also supports the broader science community by collecting and providing diverse samples for additional studies, including, but not limited to, studies of deep-water residence time in a deep-sea trench, past oceanographic conditions, and subseafloor microbes. <br/><br/>The fundamental objective of this project is to determine how the subseafloor microbial communities and activities across a gradient of oceanic depth zones (sublittoral, bathyal, abyssal, hadal) are impacted by the pressure of the surrounding water. The primary hypothesis being tested is that ?microbial communities in subseafloor sediment are adapted for in situ pressure.? The null hypothesis is that these ?communities are merely remnant populations introduced from shallower depths and poorly adapted for in situ pressure.? To test these hypotheses, the project compares the subseafloor communities and rates of activity that occur in anoxic subseafloor sediment at ocean depths ranging from 50 to ~8400 meters below sea level in the Puerto Rico Trench region. To collect the samples and shipboard data, the project includes a 26-day coring program. The project interrogates the genomic composition and community metabolic rates of the subseafloor sedimentary communities over this full range of ocean depths. Experiments are being conducted to determine the pressure-dependence of potential processes (sulfate reduction and methanogenesis) and genes that are preferentially expressed at in situ pressures by sublittoral, bathyal, abyssal and hadal subseafloor communities. These results are synthesized to identify the nature and extent of adaptations to in situ pressure in subseafloor communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The agents may be investors, drivers, or viruses, and the large systems may be financial markets, highways, or epidemics, for example. The most widely used framework for modeling competition between many interacting agents, known as ""mean field game theory,"" is fundamentally limited in scope to symmetric models, in which each agent interacts equally with each of the others. Many important phenomena, on the other hand, are governed by networks---such as those formed by social ties or financial obligations ? that determine which agents interact with each other. Network structures have important implications that the standard theory cannot capture. This project tackles this limitation by developing new mathematical frameworks to handle large-scale models of competition with heterogeneous interactions governed by networks. Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the research activities, and local K-12 outreach efforts are designed to foster an interest in applied mathematics and continued education.<br/><br/>This project builds a rigorous foundation for a new era of network-based mean field game theory and applications. The first goal is to identify the range of network structures for which the standard mean field approximation is valid, in order to substantially extend the scope of the mean field paradigm. For those network structures for which the standard mean field approximation fails, the second goal is to identify and analyze tractable alternatives. Certain important features of mean field approximations, such as asymptotic independence, fail in sparse (as opposed to dense) networks, and the third goal of the research is to identify precise sparsity thresholds for this and other phenomena. This project adapts and extends recent methodologies of graph limit theories and large deviations, which have a strong track record of solving network-based problems in statistical physics. New mathematical challenges arise in the game-theoretic setting due to the long-range dependencies induced by competitive equilibrium, and new techniques must be developed to address these challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER research will use four projects and modern economic approaches to study discrimination against under-represented groups in broad areas of economic activity.  The first project investigates discrimination against under-represented groups in access to metal health services, the second project investigates whether discrimination in mental health care has been exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic, while the third project investigates discrimination against under-represented groups in mortgage markets.  The researchers develop new analytical tools to deal with economics research that uses text data in the fourth project.  This research will develop a large scale mentoring program for under-represented graduate and undergraduate students in economics.  The research project provides a broader understanding of the causes and consequences of discrimination in several areas than has been studied before and therefore provide inputs into policies to reduce discrimination against under-represented groups.  This research will therefore help to establish the USA as the global leader in the fight against discrimination. <br/>   <br/>This five-year CAREER development project is a comprehensive research and education program on quantifying, understanding, and mitigating discrimination against under-represented groups.  The project includes two audit field experiments to study access to mental health care, based on under-represented minority status and mortgage loans, based on a sub-set of under-represented groups. These audit field experiments use the experimental method to isolate discrimination from other factors and observing discriminatory behavior in actual scenarios. The audit field experiments also make important scientific  contributions since little is known about discrimination in access to healthcare or discrimination against under-represented people in broad areas of social and economic interactions. Both projects extend the methodology of audit field experiments by using computational linguistics and machine learning methodologies to detect subtle discrimination in language. The audit field experiment of access to mental health care also includes a timely extension to quantify access to mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, by exploring how the intensity of the pandemic and pandemic-related policies, such as shelter-in-place ordinances, affect access to counseling and therapy appointments. These research projects are paired with educational plans that seek to increase research and mentorship opportunities for under-represented minorities.  The results of this research project will provide inputs into policies to reduce discrimination against under-represented groups.  This research will therefore help establish the USA as the global leader in the fight against discrimination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall goal of the project is to improve students? performance and persistence in online STEM courses, while simultaneously improving their attitudes toward STEM itself. To achieve this goal, the project focuses on introducing practices that reduce extraneous cognitive load, while also improving educators? instructional and social presence, and students? social and cognitive presence.  The project will study a specific practice: a faculty-student learning community that uses discussion forums and other online components to minimize non-relevant technical complexity.  The project intends to produce guidelines for creating a productive online learning community that does not require additional effort that is unrelated to the intended learning.  The project will provide professional development to support instructors? implementation of the guidelines.  It is anticipated that the guidelines may be transferable to other online STEM courses.  The projects? data about student retention, persistence, and attitudes toward STEM will provide a base for additional research on online STEM learning.  <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to positively impact student persistence, performance, and perspectives in asynchronous online STEM courses.  It expects to do to by supporting learning communities in ways that mitigate the impacts of extraneous cognitive load. To this end, the project will design and test a pilot program for infusing the components of the Community of Inquiry framework into asynchronous course discussions, including a best practices redesign of the discussion prompts, rubrics, and instructions by subject matter experts and instructional designers.  The pilot program will use existing institutional structures to support the redesign and to provide faculty with the related professional development. In a mixed-methods research study, information will be collected about students? academic success (course grades, discussion transcript analysis), persistence (withdrawal rate), and perspectives (surveys on STEM attitudes, cognitive load, and community of inquiry).  These data will be complemented by results from focus group interviews.  The project intends to generate a Community of Inquiry ? Cognitive Load framework for asynchronous online STEM courses that supports student outcomes by promoting social, teaching, and cognitive presences via the Community of Inquiry, while mitigating cognitive load that is disconnected from disciplinary learning. The framework may be transferrable and scalable to other asynchronous online STEM courses. By identifying reasons for persistence and retention in online STEM courses, the project expects to lay the foundation for further research on interventions that improve student outcomes in online STEM courses.  The NSF IUSE:EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

In the past few decades, researchers and practitioners have invented many static-analysis algorithms for bug detection and program verification. To take advantage of the theoretical advances, static-analysis algorithms are often implemented as configuration options in static-analysis tools. For example, taint-analysis tools for Android apps incorporate different algorithms, underlying frameworks, and programming styles to support language features that complicate the detection of critical security vulnerabilities. These configuration options allow developers and users to tune the tool behavior to achieve the right balance between precision, soundness, and performance. However, the unique challenges of the large and complex configuration space in configurable static-analysis tools have prevented them from being broadly adopted in practice. Improving configurable static-analysis tools will lead to higher software quality, a potentially large societal impact.<br/><br/>This project proposes to improve the maintainability, correctness, usability, and performance of the configurable static-analysis tools through configuration analysis, testing, evaluation, refinement and adaptation. The project will initially focus on the configurable taint-analysis tools for Android apps to address the following specific research goals. First, unspecified relationships between configuration options, which makes it difficult to tune the tools? configurations, will be identified and analyzed. The result will be presented to users via a unified configuration-aware user interface. Second, configurable static-analysis tools will be better tested and evaluated via test-case generation and benchmark collection. Third, a human-in-the-loop iterative-refinement process will be designed to explore the configuration space and classify the results to significantly reduce the manual efforts needed in this process. Fourth, learning-based adaptive analysis will be developed to selectively apply analysis algorithms at fine granularity to produce practical results. The practical impact of the research will be evaluated in terms of the tools? capabilities of detecting real-world vulnerabilities. Once the key research problems are addressed in Android taint-analysis tools, the project will generalize the research to configurable static-analysis tools for different programming languages. The project will significantly improve the state-of-the-art of configurable static-analysis tools and result in their broader adoption in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the critical importance of urban transportation systems that are affordable, reduce congestion, and are associated with low greenhouse gas emissions, developments over the last decade suggest that many multi-modal travelers eventually migrate to single-occupancy automobile travel. A key to understanding these shifts may be the way in which past travel experiences, satisfaction with travel, and subjective well-being during travel shape future traveler decision-making, but these effects are not sufficiently captured by current modeling approaches. This research develops a novel analytical framework to model and forecast such feedback effects, which will lead to a richer understanding of the long-term dynamics of urban travel and an improvement of travel demand forecasting tools. Thus, the research supports the development of policies and infrastructure investment decisions that aim to increase the environmental and social sustainability of urban travel and the provision and maintenance of high-quality public transportation services. Such efforts are central to providing accessible and affordable transportation options and access to opportunities to communities of concern, to meeting climate goals, and to enhancing the nation?s economic resilience. The research activities are integrated with educational activities to improve critical skills of transportation engineering students and build early excitement and awareness of transportation engineering among elementary school students in Columbus, Ohio. Comprehensive outreach activities engage transit practitioners early and throughout the project and ensure the relevance and applicability of the research to practice.<br/><br/>Based on prior research, several behavioral mechanisms are hypothesized through which past travel experiences, satisfaction with travel, and subjective well-being (SWB) during travel shape future travel behavior. These mechanisms are investigated using detailed travel diary data from multi-modal travelers in a major US metropolitan area and appropriate econometric models. The novelty of this research lies in that, for the first time, the dynamics between satisfaction/SWB, beliefs, and choices are systematically studied.  The research focuses on transit use but aims to derive generalizable insights about behavioral processes that tie in with the scientific community?s theoretical conceptualization of traveler choices. This supports the transformation of the field toward an emerging, holistic model that adds affective components to the traditional neoclassical economic elements of the traveler choice framework. The results will be translated into novel performance metrics that can be used by transit agencies and metropolitan planning organizations to quantify the link between transit service quality and passenger behavior and to better quantify the impacts of public funding for transit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, lithium metal components suffer from severe interfacial instabilities, leading to efficiency losses and serious safety concerns. In the region between the negative electrode and the liquid electrolyte, a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is produced by the spontaneous breakdown of electrolyte compounds. The SEI in lithium metal batteries is hypothesized to play a key role in lithium deposition but is challenging to assess with traditional materials characterization methods. In this proposal, we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques to create a molecular-level description of the chemical reactions that occur at lithium metal interfaces to ultimately mitigate the formation microstructures for safe and efficient battery operation. This research program is strongly coupled with educational activities to bridge gaps in NMR training through a hands-on ?In Situ NMR of Energy Materials? workshop aimed at local researchers and industry partners. These efforts are complemented with plans to broaden the participation of underrepresented and underprivileged women in undergraduate research through a partnership with the Science Pathways Scholars Program at Barnard (women's college). We will leverage connections within the community to host a TEDx conference to improve NMR education for the general public and generate excitement for aspiring youth and their families by highlighting the use of NMR for vaccine development, energy storage, disease treatment, and the arts.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to use NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the chemical mechanisms underpinning SEI formation and function, and to use that knowledge to achieve the desired smooth Li deposition in Li metal batteries. The key challenge in obtaining this information is that the complex SEI structure evolves during Li deposition/dissolution and is easily disturbed when removed from its native operating environment. In order to overcome these issues, we propose to use a combination of solution and solid-state NMR, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide a comprehensive assessment of the composition, arrangement, and dynamics of the SEI that forms on the surface of Li metal anodes. In situ NMR/MRI provides accurate chemical, spatial, and temporal information on multiphase interfacial phenomena to elucidate the role of electrolyte decomposition, anode/cathode crosstalk, and ion transport on lithium deposition behavior. Assignment of the interfacial chemistries and transport phenomena that dictate the formation of electrochemically inactive Li will allow us to describe, at the molecular-level, chemical mechanisms underpinning low Coulombic efficiency. We will also educate students and industrial researchers on in situ NMR methods using cost-effective electrode fabrication techniques and widely available electrochemical and NMR equipment so that they can go beyond current, ?black box? approaches to collect and analyze data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant barriers exist that discourage STEM majors from pursuing careers in secondary STEM teaching.  For example, it often takes longer than four years to meet both STEM degree and licensure requirements, thus raising time to degree and college costs. Additionally, limited strategies and structures are available to encourage and support diverse students? pursuit of a STEM teaching career. In this project, the University of St. Thomas will work to encourage STEM teaching careers by streamlining its curricular requirements, identifying and addressing barriers to teaching careers, and partnering with a community college to connect with a greater diversity of future STEM teachers.  The University expects this effort to increase the number of secondary STEM teachers in Minnesota that match the state?s diverse urban student population. <br/><br/>The University of St. Thomas, in partnership with Normandale Community College, aims to create a mechanism for recruiting diverse STEM majors to consider becoming secondary STEM teachers while completing their STEM degrees. The partnership intends to collaborate to streamline STEM and secondary education curricula, and to identify barriers to a teaching career. Few students at the University choose to become secondary teachers, and completing a dual degree program in STEM and education can be even more challenging for community college transfer students. The absence of strategies and supports for these double majors contributes to the low graduation rates of secondary teachers. The goals of this Capacity Building project are to: 1) restructure STEM degree programs to allow for a B.A. double major in a STEM discipline and secondary teacher education that enables graduation in 4 years; 2) complete needs assessments to identify barriers encountered by University of St. Thomas students and transfer students to completing a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline and in secondary education; and 3) partner with Normandale Community College to align their STEM courses and develop strategies for a seamless transfer pathway for community college students to St. Thomas University. The project anticipates achieving these goals can lead to development of a Noyce Track 1 proposal in the future to provide scholarship support to both community college and four-year college students to complete dual degrees and become secondary teachers of a STEM discipline.  Findings from the curriculum analyses and needs assessments could serve as a model for other colleges and universities in addressing curricular and non-curricular challenges of preparing more secondary STEM teachers for the future. This Noyce Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

This is of scientific interest because these fish use their thin and lightweight fins to apply very large forces to move on land. Through biological experiments, engineering device design, and mathematical modeling, the project seeks to uncover relationships between the form and function of fins used to move on land.  The knowledge gained in this project will impact several fields. Understanding the mechanics of walking fish will help address the substantial challenges in designing agile robots capable of traversing diverse environments. This is important for future use of such robots for search and rescue operations and remote ecological studies to go where it is impossible or unsafe for humans to go.  Learning about amphibious fish is also critical for understanding how terrestrial vertebrates evolved from an aquatic ancestor that used its fins to move on land around 400 million years ago. The project?s synergistic education and outreach activities include curriculum development, a multi-year scaffolded mentorship plan for high school students, and student-developed hands-on museum exhibits on amphibious fish that will also serve as novel teaching aids for school teachers. These will be designed to broaden participation in STEM from K-12 through college and incubate the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary research objective is to discover how the mudskipper, an amphibious fish, has specialized its fin design and biomechanics to withstand forces for moving on land and test the hypothesis that they resist ground forces using the nonlinear effect of curvature-induced stiffness. The curvature-induced stiffness principle helps human feet withstand ground forces, and aquatic fish fins also manifest elements needed for that effect. But the anatomical manifestations are quite different in fins and feet, raising the question of how amphibious fish stiffen their fins on land. The project will combine experiments with theory to investigate the multi-scale, hierarchical, and composite structure of the fins of amphibious (mudskippers and bichirs) and aquatic fish (gobies and mackerels) from the whole organism (~10?100 millimeters) down to the fin?s internal structure (~10?100 micrometers). The specific aims, with fundamental impact on locomotion biomechanics and fish fin structural mechanics, are to (i) measure in vivo forces on mudskipper fins using a novel optical force sensor, (ii) identify critical stiffness-contributing anatomical elements using in vitro mechanical tests on amphibious and aquatic fish fins, and (iii) discover the specializations of amphibious fish fins and derive generalizable biomechanical principles of a fin morpho-functional space by combining 3D micro-computed tomography (microCT), in vivo force, and in vitro stiffness data with multi-scale, composite-elastic fin models. Discoveries on the fin?s form-function relationships could be crucial for biologists studying the development and evolution of fins and limbs. Also, novel appendage designs may considerably enhance the effectiveness of multi-terrain robots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When faced with economic insecurity, many Americans take on debt.  Although access to credit can provide families a resource in times of crisis, debt is often burdensome to repay for low-income families, and can exacerbate, rather than relieve, economic strain and insecurity.   With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, many Americans faced sudden and new sources of economic insecurity, and official responses to the pandemic were diverse. This study contributes to understanding the combined effects of debt and official responses in low-income communities when a crisis strikes.  One important goal of this project is to inform decision-makers about low-income debt and economic insecurity during the COVID-19 crisis in order to increase the effectiveness of future interventions. <br/><br/>The research questions are addressed through linkages of consumer credit, alternative financial services, and state data sets.  Levels of indebtedness in low-income communities are captured with zip-code level quarterly data on consumer credit, such as mortgages and credit cards.  Alternative financial service use?e.g., payday and title loans?is obtained from Q1 2019 through Q4 2020.  These data are linked to state and zip-level data that include sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-related constraints, and state-level social safety net procedures.  Analysis involves, first, description of debt patterns in vulnerable communities in the United States before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, a variety of statistical models are used to investigate associations between debt problems and official responses to the pandemic in these communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This opens new pathways to address the entire petroleum system and Li geochemical cycle. This project will develop a transformative characterization framework for Li in source rock brines, thus laying the foundation for converting source rock brines into a sustainable source of Li. Thus, the goal of this project is to identify a new source of Li?rich brines in organic?rich source rocks for sustainable energy storage. This outcome will help address the urgent need to enhance and diversify the domestic supply of Li, given the recently found potential of organic?rich source rocks as a source of Li.<br/><br/>To attain the goal, the research objectives are to (1) experimentally determine the reaction mechanisms of Li originating from kerogen (solid organic matter of source rocks creating oil and gas) in natural geologic systems, (2) enhance modeling capability for characterizing the transport of Li as a function of mineral compositions and structures through pore?scale modeling, and (3) promote the identification and utilization of Li?rich brines by integrating this information into basin?scale modeling. This research program is integrated with the educational goal of enlightening students in subsurface processes related to sustainable resources for energy storage. Students will be engaged in the research program by conducting basin?scale modeling and compositional characterization of source rock brines to find optimal locations for Li recovery. The PI plans to disseminate the findings of these integrated research and educational efforts to industrial collaborators through the development of short courses, panel discussions, and e?newsletters. Additionally, the educational program will build upon the PI?s existing mentoring program for high school students on the topic of sustainable subsurface energy systems with computer programming applications and leverage a Program for Mastery in Engineering Studies to engage with undergraduate students in STEM. This project will integrate geochemical experimental characterization techniques and multiscale modeling approaches for addressing the fate and transport of Li originating from kerogen in geologic systems. Merging elemental, isotopic, pyrolytic, kinetic, and thermal?compositional theories into a finite volume pore?scale model and an integral finite difference basin?scale model is targeted to provide an insight into observed laboratory behavior and help progress toward a solution to a complex and expensive problem. The PI will utilize integration of a suite of experimental characterization techniques and advanced pore and basin scale modeling techniques to guide engineering efforts that aim to successfully recover sustainable resources for energy storage. Results from the research program are intended to create new opportunities of supplying Li for sustainable energy storage by transforming the source of oil and gas into a source of Li.

Additive manufacturing, which is the ability to 3D-print materials of arbitrary shape, is currently revolutionizing the way in which products are made. However, most additive manufacturing methods, especially for metals and oxide materials, are conducted on the millimeter scale or larger. Small length scales are important for products such as sensors, electronics, and medical diagnostic devices which are becoming miniaturized and portable. Further, most additive manufacturing methods are tailored for fabrication of parts containing a single material and are not well-suited for parts combining multiple different materials. This research initiative will explore the use of laser-based manufacturing to address such challenges. The ability to additively manufacture microscale parts with tailored composition will enable advances in areas such as healthcare, chemical and biomedical sensing, and energy storage. This research will use techniques from multiple different fields of study, including chemistry, materials science, optics, mechanics, and thermal modeling, to tackle the manufacturing challenges from a range of angles. Educational initiatives will be pursued, including outreach to diverse students at the K-12 level, summer camp development, and curriculum innovation at undergraduate and graduate levels. The educational outreach will focus on examining how light is used in manufacturing methods. <br/><br/>In this research, the focal volume of a laser will be used as a high-temperature femtoliter-scale solvothermal reactor, wherein materials will be synthesized and deposited at the laser focus from fluid precursors. This method will exploit solution phase chemistry, but confine the synthesis to the microscale, thereby taking advantage of the three-dimensional control inherent in laser direct-write manufacturing. This method will be studied for processing a wide variety of inorganic materials directly from solution precursors, including metals, oxides, alloys, ceramics, and composites thereof. A key focus of the research will be on the manufacturing of high entropy oxides. Aims include synthesis of high entropy materials, characterization and modeling of the thermal reaction environment, exploration of effects of processing conditions such as laser power, scan parameters, and precursor chemistry, and investigation of parallelization and scalability for high-throughput fabrication.

As a consequence, the security of the web ecosystem, its billions of users, and the global economy are critically dependent on how websites manage password authentication. Yet each year, attackers successfully hijack millions of online accounts, highlighting a salient need to improve real-world password authentication. Towards this end, prior research has explored understanding and improving user password behavior, but to date, there has been limited consideration for how websites and their operators actually handle password authentication.  Taking a website-centric perspective, this project will systematically investigate the password authentication practices employed by websites to identify root causes of insecure methods. Drawing on the insights gained, this project will also develop innovative technical and non-technical approaches for improving the practices actually adopted by website operators. Ultimately, this research will help advance online authentication security across the web, by impacting the way web-site operators manage password related security. This could possibly lead to better security standards (e.g., web standards or password standards). Research outcomes will be widely disseminated and integrated into open-source tools that website developers and administrators can directly use.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, this project will pursue three interconnected thrusts. The first thrust will develop web crawling and analysis techniques to measure website password authentication practices at scale and evaluate their implications, providing new visibility into the state of online authentication security throughout the web ecosystem.  The second thrust will employ user studies and experiments with website operators to establish a socio-technical understanding of why insecure practices manifest in reality, considering human, organizational, policy, legal, and technical factors.  Finally, the third thrust will build on the insights gained from the other two thrusts and develop practical technical and non-technical solutions for improving how website operators manage password authentication. These solutions will include hardened designs and implementations of existing authentication mechanisms, tools that reduce the barriers to adopting secure practices, and methods of raising operator awareness of poor practices.  Together, these complementary thrusts serve as a comprehensive effort to improve web authentication in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the 1980s, 99% atomic ordering in two-element materials was developed, wherein two elements alternate nearly perfectly in their atomic site occupations. This enabled high-frequency transistors, which led to the cell phone revolution and high-efficiency solar panel technologies. Theoretical predictions tout revolutionary new material properties in complex (3+ elements) materials that will make possible new devices with broad application in information technology, solar cells, lighting, microwave communications, thermoelectrics, and power electronics.  However, achieving the 99% atomic ordering required to realize those properties has remained elusive. The goal of this project is to systematically gain an understanding of the fundamental ordering mechanisms in complex materials. This research integrates computational theory and experimental results to create a set of criteria that can be used to design materials of sufficiently high atomic ordering (99%) to realize their intrinsic properties. This research directly integrates educational activities to impact underrepresented minorities, women, and underserved rural communities in STEM fields, and ensure that undergraduate education includes research experience. This mentor-based strategy focuses on elevating science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) educators in underrepresented communities in rural Alabama and Mississippi. K-12 educators gain access to university faculty and specialists at the Alabama Science in Motion program to plan classes and laboratory sessions, and through the Alabama Math, Science and Technology Summer Institute receive training to qualify their rural school district for program/equipment funding. Undergraduate summer researchers are recruited from local Historically Black Colleges and Universities, minority-serving institutions and the American Physical Society?s Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics. Undergraduate students will also work as research assistants during each school year.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Imperfect atomic ordering in complex materials is a pervasive issue in the condensed matter and materials communities: A model that accounts for entropic mixing disorder is required before complex materials can be applied widely. First principles calculations can accurately predict the intrinsic (structural, electronics, magnetic/magnetodynamic) material properties of an ordered system, but near-perfect (>99%) atomic ordering is needed to manifest those properties. At present, it is a complex and computationally expensive task to determine if the system can form with the required atomic ordering in the presence of thermal and growth energies. The central hypothesis of this research is that high atomic ordering can be predicted by incorporating existing metallurgical metrics that indicate the level of entropic mixing. To test the hypothesis, computational predictions of ordering and properties are produced for a range of three-element L21-ordered Heusler alloys, chosen specifically due to decades-long frustration in realizing predictions of high spin polarization due to atomic disorder. Although applications often prefer highly ordered systems, materials with a range of ordering levels are selected to refine a robust quantitative model and provide a roadmap for material design. Thin films of each material system are grown with low energetics by the Sputter Beam Epitaxy method invented by the principal investigator, such that atomic ordering and material properties of each system can be compared to predictions with minimal extrinsic contribution. The results form a feedback loop between theory and experiment to establish and refine a quantitative model of atomic ordering when three or more elements are used. A quantitative predictive model for atomic ordering in complex alloys broadly translates to the many other fields whose material systems are plagued by entropic mixing.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, for nearly every type of defect, the specific reason for these effects can be traced down to a basic set of questions: What atomic species are involved? And how are they bonded to each other? If one can answer these questions, then one can better figure out how to either harness or mitigate defects. In the world of electronics, the growing need for new materials and technologies with higher performance, broader range of useful functions, and better reliability often drives scientists and engineers away from the limited palette of traditional materials and towards various combinations of different materials, which frequently possess fundamental dissimilarities. However, this approach can lead to the formation of detrimental defects. For the kinds of semiconductors that are used to create many vital technologies, including LEDs, lasers, solar cells, infrared sensors, high-power/speed transistors, and more, the atomic-scale nature of many defects remain a mystery. Therefore, this project seeks to identify the atomic structures of important defects and understand how they degrade the parent materials? electronic and optical properties. Knowing this, researchers can figure out how to get around the challenges caused by defects, and perhaps even find new, beneficial uses for them. To further broaden the overall impact of this project, the principal investigator is working to combine this new science with existing knowledge to develop fresh and exciting course curricula, while the entire research team will share their expertise by creating highly accessible experimental methods training videos. Furthermore, the team is engaging with the local community through inclusive outreach events to help participants, children and adults alike, discover the connections between fundamental semiconductor materials properties, like those under investigation in this project, and the operation of the vast range of devices that they use throughout their day-to-day lives, igniting and encouraging the imaginations and interests of the new generations of diverse individuals that will not only contribute to fields of science and engineering, but will serve as positive influences to society.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Dislocations within III-V semiconductors commonly arise as a result of dissimilar (e.g. lattice/symmetry mismatched) materials integration, and lead to detrimental sub-bandgap electronic defect levels that severely limit the usefulness of such materials systems. However, the fundamental, atomic-scale structure of III-V dislocations (especially the core), and thus the specific source of said defect levels, largely remains a mystery. The goal of this project is to fill this critical knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that the characteristic defect levels resident at III-V dislocations can be directly attributed to specific, atomic-scale structural features. Employing a novel, correlative characterization framework of optoelectronic and structural spectroscopies and microscopies, with resolutions spanning from the macroscale to the atomic, the researchers are identifying the specific elemental species and bonding configurations that result in detrimental electronic defect levels. By combining this analysis with well-controlled sample epitaxy, they will further determine how these defect structures, and their associated properties, are impacted by the alloy composition, bandgap, and doping of the host material. Ultimately, this research is helping to build and support a true bottom-up compound semiconductor materials and process design approach, with defect mitigation as an achievable target, that is particularly valuable in applications where dissimilar integration is needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has led researchers to think beyond worst-case analysis, and to study models under which formal guarantees can be obtained.

Automated vehicle technologies have emerged as a promising mechanism to prevent these crashes, to increase personal mobility, and to lower emissions. Delivery on these promises has been limited by a growing public concern over the safety of automated vehicles, particularly during transfers of control between automated systems and human drivers. Trust between human drivers and automated systems is a central concern during these interactions. Prior research in human-automation trust has established that the safety and performance of human-machine systems requires calibrated trust?a state where a human driver?s trust in an automated system matches the system?s capabilities. Trust calibration in automated vehicles is an elusive challenge because of limitations in trust measurement and methods that illuminate the impact of technology design decisions on trust and driver behavior. This project will promote the progress of science and advance the national health by advancing an understanding of human-automation trust. Specifically, the project will address the limitations of existing trust measures, model trust and driver behavior, and determine how autonomous vehicles that incorporate trust calibration models can influence dynamic trust and driving behavior. The approach will provide guidelines and technology design recommendations that could significantly reduce the human lives lost and injuries associated with vehicle crashes. Broader impacts of the work include undergraduate and graduate course development, focused research opportunities for underrepresented undergraduates at Texas A&M University, as well as student-leg outreach activities to local high school students.<br/><br/>The project will consist of three phases designed to (1) develop a novel and objective measure of dynamic trust using real-time measures of neural activation during AV interactions, (2) model driver interactions with automated vehicles along the spectrum of dynamic trust, and (3) validate the trust measure and driver behavior model with a trust calibration intervention-based driving simulation experiment. The measure development will be supported by data from human subjects studies in which drivers in a simulated automated vehicle will encounter a series of realistic driving scenarios designed to modulate trust in the system while physiological, neurological, behavioral, and subjective measures are collected. Neurological data will be analyzed with regression and connectivity analysis methods to identify correlates with trust states validated by the physiological and subjective measures. The correlates will be used to train and test novel process models of driver trust and responses to automation events that extend existing driver decision-making and control frameworks. The models and measure will be validated in a second driving simulation study including a trust calibration intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation research examines how different social groups?rural communities, urban state bureaucrats, and corporate officials?attempt to reach agreements on complex issues arising from variation in approaches to resource management. Examining how and under what conditions consensus may be reached in a diverse society is essential to understanding how different peoples holding varied worldviews, modes of living, and means of self-expression co-exist.

Miniaturizing such devices makes them lighter in weight, more energy-efficient, and often higher in performance because of the ability pack more functional components closer together in a smaller package. A current challenge is how to miniaturize three-dimensional (3D) components in devices that have elements smaller than 150 nm, which is about the same size as a virus, and only a bit smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Consumer-grade 3D printers have resolution that is ~1000 times worse than this. This proposal aims to develop new, relatively low-cost techniques to design and assemble 3D structures for photonic devices with elements as small as ~50 nm. In addition to device performance improvement tied to miniaturization, the creation of structures with such small elements can lead to materials with exotic optical properties that are not found naturally. These exotic optical properties can enable devices such as lenses with resolution beyond those of glass lenses, or devices like optical cloaks that bend light around an object. The research will be incorporated into courses at the University of Arizona, and the course modules will be shared with other educators via websites, professional meetings, publications, and outreach events. High schoolers and undergraduate students will also partake in the research.<br/><br/>Ultimate control over light requires control of the relative permittivities and permeabilities of materials over all three dimensions of space with deep sub-wavelength resolution. In a steady-state system, the behavior of light depends entirely on the 3D distribution of these properties. For example, studies of photonic metamaterials have shown that the patterning of heterogeneous materials at such deep sub-wavelength scales can enable negative refractive index, permittivity near zero, and ultra-high refractive index. Generally, the higher the resolution of the fabrication approach, the more compact the optical system and the higher its resulting optical resolution. However, a significant barrier to realizing this ultimate control over light is that there are currently no means to achieve deep subwavelength heterogeneous patterning in 3D structures for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The goal of the proposed project is to design, fabricate, and test 3D nanophotonic components assembled out of precisely-positioned metallic and high-index dielectric colloidal building blocks of various shapes with ~50 nm, high-resolution feature sizes. Design approaches will use the coupled multipole method. High speed optical tweezers and biochemical linkages will be used to fabricate structures and devices out of >1000 building blocks. Devices that have previously only been theoretically proposed will be experimentally tested, including superresolution imaging devices and devices based on transformation optics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is one of the oldest and most practically applicable subfields of algorithms research. Linear-algebraic routines lie at the core of many large-scale scientific and engineering simulations, signal-processing methods, statistical- and machine-learning algorithms, and beyond. Recently, the field has been revolutionized by work on algorithms that make carefully chosen random choices during the course of their execution, allowing much faster approximate solutions for very large-scale problems. This project aims to build on the success of these randomized methods and extend their reach. The work will also identify fundamental limits on the potential for faster algorithms and on today's most popular techniques. Beyond impact in the above mentioned application areas, the project will deepen the theoretical foundations of computational linear algebra and strengthen ties to theoretical computer science, approximation theory, optimization, machine learning, and other fields. The work is interdisciplinary in nature, and will be complemented with curriculum development focused on preparing students with an interdisciplinary mathematical and computing toolkit.<br/><br/>The project breaks down into three main thrusts. The first will consider the computational complexity of fundamental linear-algebraic problems, which is not well understood. In the process, the work will explore the role of randomization and approximation in fast linear algebra and endow the field with missing complexity-theoretic structure to guide algorithmic progress. The second thrust will focus on algorithms and lower bounds within the restricted matrix-vector query model of linear-algebraic computation. This model encompasses a large fraction of known approaches, and the project aims to both explain its dominance in practice, and to develop new algorithmic tools. Finally, the third thrust will focus on applying randomized methods to structured matrix problems arising in machine learning, signal processing, and beyond.

Large amount of training data is often required for achieving the desired performance, however this limits the generalization to other tasks. Hence, this project is to explore the new RL strategies to enable CPS with the capabilities of autonomous learning and generalization to rapidly adapt in unknown situations that were not assumed in the design phase.

As a whole, they exhibit superior properties than their individual constituents, and they are responsible for novel applications in numerous nanoscale energy technologies. A vital application of oxide heterostructures is their use as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes, which facilitate easy passage of oxygen ions for generating electricity in the cell.

An important application of oxide heterostructures is their use as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes. The research component of this project is motivated by experimental observations: Several experiments report that misfit dislocations ubiquitous at interfaces of mismatched oxide heterostructures enhance ionic transport, while some experiments suggest that they slow down ionic transport. Conventional approaches cannot predict the atomistic origin for this enhancement or impediment since the basic atomistic mechanisms governing ionic transport at misfit dislocations are not well understood.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to elucidate the fundamental ionic transport mechanisms at misfit dislocations by studying their intricate interaction with point defects and dopants. The principal hypothesis is that the fundamental nearest neighbor model of defect diffusion will come into play at misfit dislocations. The PI and his team will build a novel multiscale framework that integrates density functional theory and molecular dynamics to study defect thermodynamics with a new kinetic lattice Monte Carlo model to study defect kinetics at misfit dislocations. This multiscale framework will assist in establishing the basic connection between misfit dislocation structure and functionality. The research will advance the state of knowledge pertaining to the crucial role of interfaces and extended defects in shaping new functionalities of oxide heterostructures. The fundamental science thus unraveled will offer strategies to ultimately control the impact of misfit dislocations and guide future design and synthesis of next-generation solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes.<br/><br/>The research component of this project will be tightly integrated with the educational activities to increase public awareness regarding alternative energy resources and their benefits to the society.

These new solar cells are showing great promise as they are not only highly efficient in converting sunlight into electricity but also potentially very inexpensive to manufacture. However, the mechanical properties of these new solar cell materials are not known, especially under operating conditions of a solar cell: in sunlight, and also when electric current is passing through them. Thus, it is very important to study and understand these properties because they determine the long-term durability of the new solar cells, which are expected to operate efficiently for twenty years or more in the element. To that end, systematic research is conducted, where the following relevant mechanical properties of the new solar cell materials are studied under light and/or electric current: (1) cracking and healing of the cracks; (2) plastic deformation; and (3) time-dependent deformation. These studies are conducted on materials of well-defined chemical compositions, configurations, and morphologies. The results from these studies are analyzed critically to understand the behavior of the new solar cell materials. This is expected to have a broad impact on the ability to make highly durable, low-cost solar cells of the future, and to help this new solar-cell technology then reach its full potential. As part of this effort, underrepresented minority undergraduate researchers from Tugaloo College are trained. This leverages the fifty-year old partnership between Brown University and Tugaloo College -- an Historically Black College or University. The public outreach effort is aimed at enhancing the public's understanding of concepts in science, engineering, and technology. This entails leveraging the well-established science cartoons (SciToons) program at Brown University for creating two new SciToons on: ?Emerging Solar Cells Technologies? and ?Strength of Materials.?<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>There are compelling reasons to suggest there are fascinating, rich opto-mechanical and electro-mechanical coupled behavior in halide perovskite materials, yet there is extreme paucity of research in this area. Considering the unprecedented promise of halide perovskites for new types of solar-cell and other devices, it is imperative to have a more in-depth understanding of the mechanical degradation of halide perovskites coupled with optical and/or electrical stimuli that are ubiquitous in devices. To that end, this project comes at a highly opportune time, and it entails four interrelated Tasks, and several Subtasks within. In Task 1, the effect of electric field on the fracture and crack-healing behavior in halide perovskite single-crystals and thin films is studied experimentally and quantified. Task 2 involves the quantitative study of plastic deformation of halide perovskite single-crystals, and the effect of light (photoplasticity). In Task 3, the effect of electric field on the time-dependent creep deformation of halide perovskite bulk polycrystalline pellets is studied. The efficient generation of photocarriers and facile ion migration in soft halide perovskites are expected to mediate crack-healing, plasticity, and creep phenomena, through their interactions with point and line (dislocations) defects in halide perovskites. Finally, in Task 4 the manifestation of photoplasticity effects, as an example, are demonstrated in devices. The considerable research infrastructure needed for the project developed at Brown University is leveraged fully. This research contributes to the scientific foundation for the development of next-generation perovskite solar-cell and other devices that are more efficient, and importantly more durable over the long term. As such, this research is expected to be highly impactful, and useful to researchers and technology developers alike.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to interrogate such defects is therefore of great importance in producing reliable, high-performance electronics that underly the modern economy. Existing methods often measure properties without sufficient resolution to resolve defects on the length scales that they occur. Thus, existing methods provide limited information about the unique local properties. This CAREER project aims to establish an innovative measurement platform that can directly observe the carrier dynamics of microstructured optoelectronic devices. Solar cells based on metal halide perovskites will be the focus of this work. Such devices have remarkable performance, but poor stability, posing a basic challenge for real-world applications. Defect chemistry, ion migration, and microstructural characteristics have all been considered as culprits for the poor stability, but the underlying physical mechanisms are not fully understood. The PI?s research team will use local optical and electrical probes under controlled environmental conditions to study the microstructure of perovskites and elucidate reasons for performance degradation. This fundamental understanding will help to guide the rational design and synthesis of perovskites for robust and reliable solar cells. The PI?s research vision is integrated with an educational plan that aims to generate curiosity and excitement for solar energy and electron microscopy for a broad range of students, with a particular focus on young women students in Utah. The PI will involve undergraduate and graduate students in research and promote the participation of students from underrepresented groups in STEM. An interactive website with streaming videos and educational resources will assist in disseminating the research findings to the general public in the US and abroad.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Metal halide perovskites are ideally suited for photovoltaic applications, particularly solar cells. This novel class of semiconductors features low-cost processing, rich chemical and structural diversity, tunable bandgaps, and unique defect tolerance and ?self-healing? capabilities. Despite considerable efforts, the underlying physical mechanisms for the inferior stability of perovskite solar cells are not fully understood. Many established characterization techniques measure the averaged properties, on a length scale far greater than that of the electronic and structural inhomogeneity, which is on the order of the typical grain size (< 1 micrometer). To tackle this challenge, the PI uses an innovative measurement platform that can directly observe the degradation kinetics of perovskites at the level of individual microstructures, surfaces, and interfaces in real-time. By integrating optoelectronic probes (e.g., low-energy electron beam, near-field photon source) with isolated/mixed environmental stressors in a scanning electron microscope system, the research team aims to visualize the local defects (e.g., mobile ions) and charge carrier dynamics during deterioration and recovery in the perovskites. In addition to the in-situ electrical and optical imaging, the team is designing and fabricating small nanocontacts on individual grains and grain boundaries for quantitative analysis of ion migration and local carrier transport within the microstructures under both individual and mixed stressors. The research team will apply 2D/3D analytical and numerical models based on modified Poisson drift and diffusion to analyze the quantitative datasets collected with nanocontacts. This CAREER research will provide comprehensive knowledge on the ?performance-microstructure-stressor? relationship of single-junction perovskite solar cells and general guidelines to mitigate the environmental deterioration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This capability is needed because lipids contribute to nerve generation and impulse conduction, and they are essential signaling molecules and sources of energy.

Current diagnosis methods of AD are either invasive, expensive, low-resolution, low-sensitivity, or subjective and are not capable of probing complex molecular actions down to the level needed to study neurodegenerative diseases. These limitations will be addressed by combining two existing microscopy techniques that enable precision measurements at depths not possible with current techniques. The development of the proposed technology will advance our understanding of the pathology of AD and could lead to early detection as well as better therapeutics for AD.

The causal inference literature has heralded the role of randomization in getting answers to such ?what if?? questions, treating randomized controlled experiments as a gold standard for testing simple causal hypotheses. However, hidden behind this powerful tool are a series of assumptions and design decisions that are difficult to control for and are untenable in the context of complex and changing social processes. The PI will develop novel theory and methodology that will directly address the role of these social processes in causal inference. The new tools can be used across disciplines to study interventions whenever social processes are present such as in the study of important societal questions relating to vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions, implications of different education policies and the like. The PI's education plan integrates the research products from this project into courses that will engage students from a wide range of academic backgrounds, presenting and linking the methodological contributions to substantive applications. Research products will be widely disseminated to the scientific community and the general public through popular and scientific publications, presentations, and open-source software.<br/><br/>This project addresses the nascent areas of causal inference in the presence of network information and text data. While much of the work in these areas has concentrated on the analysis of existing experimental designs, little work has gone into designing experiments specifically for such complex social processes. The research will demonstrate the inadequacy of classical designs and the importance of developing specialized experimental designs that adapt to underlying complex social processes. For network and text data, the PI will provide a comprehensive framework for defining causal quantities of interest that exploit the structure in such data. The PI will work on three main thrusts: (1) Conditional design in the presence of network information: this thrust will develop restricted randomizations to target the testing and estimation of peer effects, total effects and other network quantities; (2) Unconditional design where the experimenter can control the social process: this thrust will draw on results from graph sampling to develop experimental designs that simultaneously design an interaction graph (that can represent how study participants will be allowed to interact) and a treatment allocation; and (3) Text as a social process: this thrust will provide guidance and tools for extracting causal quantities from text data that can play the role of treatment, outcome, confounder or mediator in a causal analysis. The output of the research will include practical guidelines for experimental design as well as adaptable tools and algorithms that can be deployed to address a wide range of social processes and applied problems beyond those studied in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the disregard for how past societies actually experienced time results in a discrepancy between generalized models of socio-cultural change and the diverse experience of life?s rhythms, thus perpetuating the creation of dehumanized histories. How people organize around life?s rhythms, whether as members of a generation or as a society responding to broader environmental or socio-cultural challenges, profoundly impacts the decisions made in the present, thus shaping the course of actions in the long-term. Archaeology is well positioned to solve this tension between absolute and lived time by offering a long-term perspective on the unfolding of human experience. This project will undertake research that uses radiocarbon dating to investigate people?s lived experience of time in past communities.The project also speaks to a wider anthropological conversation regarding the understanding of time as a social construct and the artificial separation between society and ?clock time?. The research includes broad scientific collaboration and encourages training in archaeological science among students and scholars.<br/><br/>The project will investigate how to identify different dimensions of lived time from material remains, which will offer a new approach for archaeologists studying socio-cultural changes in the unwritten past. This archaeological study, covering a remarkable duration, offers an ideal opportunity to analyze how alternative lived rhythms contribute to socio-cultural stability in the long-term. Contrary to previous approaches, this work will interpret the radiocarbon-based chronology of sites by referring to real lifespans, such as those derived from age at death and generational distance observed in collective burials, thus humanizing the history of single sites. This humanization of chronology will also consider alterations in climatic stability, as demonstrated by previous studies, and the interruption of daily life as documented by layers of abandonment in site stratigraphies. Relevant samples suitable for high-resolution radiocarbon analysis will be collected from museum collections and ongoing excavations. In addition to producing a robust radiocarbon dataset, the project will ultimately enhance the possibilities of archaeological chronology and help close the gap between short-term and long-term perspectives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental theory and algorithm principles will be validated using simulators, small-scale testbeds, and full-scale CAVs field demonstrations, to form a new framework for future connectivity, learning, and control of CAVs and networked CPS.  The technical contributions are as follows. (1). With shared information, we will design a cooperative prediction algorithm to improve hybrid system state and model uncertainty representations needed by learning and control. (2). Given enhanced prediction, we will design an integrated DRMARL and control framework with rigorous safety guarantee, and a computationally tractable algorithm to calculate the hybrid system decision-making policy. This integrates the strengths of both learning and control to improve system safety and efficiency. (3). We will define formally and quantify the value of communication given and propose a novel learn to communicate approach, to utilize learning and control to improve the communication actions. This project will also integrate an educational plan with the research goals by developing a learning platform of ``ssCAVs'' as an education tool and new interdisciplinary courses on ?learning and control?, undertaking outreach to the general public and K-12 students and teachers, and directly involving high-school scholars, undergraduate and graduate students in research. <br/><br/><br/>This project is in response to the NSF CAREER 20-525 solicitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiple species work together to recycle nutrients, detoxify water and soils, and maintain water availability. It is important to understand how species contribute to these functions if we want to maintain healthy ecosystems. While dispersal is an important element of how species live in nature, it is unclear how dispersal processes influence ecosystems. Plants, animals and microbes can move across the landscape and colonize existing and new habitats. This project investigates how colonization influences biological diversity and function. Specifically, this research focuses on carnivorous plants that capture insects yet depend on their microbial communities to access the nutrients. How do these plants maintain this digestive function despite receiving different microbial colonists? First, the researchers will determine differences in the plant?s microbes along the West and East coast of the US. Then, they will use experiments to establish whether the microbe?s ability to recycle nutrients for the plant depends on dispersal and colonization. Results from this research will inform how to manage biodiversity and function while considering dispersal. These findings may have major societal impacts by informing how to maintain ecosystem functions critical for life on planet Earth. Additionally, this work will advance our understanding of the microbiome and its role in human health and agriculture. This project will support training for students at a Hispanic Serving Institution who will gain skills in methods relevant for careers in ecology and biotechnology.<br/><br/>The shape of the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship remains a lingering question in ecology. As a result, it is still challenging to predict how the ecosystems will respond to environmental change and habitat loss, and how we should manage biodiversity to optimize functioning. This proposal will investigate the causes of colonist functional diversity and its consequences for ecosystem function. Traditionally overlooked, the number and type of colonists may hold the key to understanding variation in ecosystem function rates of communities interconnected by dispersal. Colonization can contribute functional species that were absent from a site or non-functional species that consume resources and impede community function. Specifically, it will explore how environmental factors generate functional diversity in colonist pools, and whether these colonist pools mediate the effect of (1) distance between communities, (2) dispersal rates and (3) habitat filters on diversity-ecosystem function relationships. This project will focus on the degradative function of microbial communities associated with the carnivorous pitcher plants Darlingtonia californica and Sarracenia purpurea. These natural microcosms have distinct colonist pools along their geographic ranges and tractable degradative functions. This project will use a combination of field sampling and microcosm experiments to investigate microbial communities within pitcher plants. The microbial communities and their functions will be profiled using amplicon sequencing, metagenomics and degradation assays. Specifically, this research will establish the role of colonist pools and habitat filters in driving ecosystem function. Additionally, this CAREER project includes educational efforts such as (1) developing inquiry-based activities in two undergraduate courses, (2) cultivating and evaluating explicit mentoring plans for students in research labs, and (3) founding a Biological Sciences Bioinformatics Group. Overall, the work described here will lead to a better understanding of the role of dispersal in community function and contribute to training of a diverse next-generation of scientists specializing in ecology, molecular biology and bioinformatics<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These features bring great challenges to computing solutions in a scalable and efficient way. This project aims at addressing the computational difficulties in optimization algorithms that arise from large-scale data analysis problems. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and involved in this project.  <br/><br/>In the big data era, scalability is one most important factor in designing computational algorithms.

Specifically, the project aims at advancing saddle-point structured non-smooth optimization techniques applicable to large-scale data analysis problems. With problem-specific information on structure that a first-order method can acquire, information-based complexity analysis will be conducted to reveal the intrinsic difficulty of the specified class of problems, and numerical approaches will be designed. Deterministic first-order methods, randomized and greedy block gradient methods, stochastic first-order methods, and their asynchronous parallel versions adequate for multi-core machines or clusters will be developed.

The push and pull of cells on each other are a critical part of biological development and tissue formation. This is particularly true for the growth of muscles, bones, and connective tissues in our bodies. Cells are stimulated by these local forces, responding in ways that help create the complex structures needed for more mature tissues to function properly. Direct measurement of cellular-scale forces is difficult, particularly in cell-dense, 3D samples. The information gained from this work will fill a knowledge gap in developmental biology and tissue regeneration.

When faced with economic insecurity, many Americans take on debt.  Although access to credit can provide families a resource in times of crisis, debt is often burdensome to repay for low-income families, and can exacerbate, rather than relieve, economic strain and insecurity.   With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, many Americans faced sudden and new sources of economic insecurity, and official responses to the pandemic were diverse. This study contributes to understanding the combined effects of debt and official responses in low-income communities when a crisis strikes.  One important goal of this project is to inform decision-makers about low-income debt and economic insecurity during the COVID-19 crisis in order to increase the effectiveness of future interventions. <br/><br/>The research questions are addressed through linkages of consumer credit, alternative financial services, and state data sets.  Levels of indebtedness in low-income communities are captured with zip-code level quarterly data on consumer credit, such as mortgages and credit cards.  Alternative financial service use?e.g., payday and title loans?is obtained from Q1 2019 through Q4 2020.  These data are linked to state and zip-level data that include sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-related constraints, and state-level social safety net procedures.  Analysis involves, first, description of debt patterns in vulnerable communities in the United States before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For example, wearable devices such as physical activity trackers, continuous glucose monitors and ambulatory blood pressure monitors are worn concurrently to provide measurements of distinct subjects? characteristics. There is enormous potential in integrating that concurrent information from the distinct vantages to better understand between-view associations and improve prediction of health outcomes. Existing tools for data integration are sensitive to outliers, and are not designed for mixed data types (e.g. continuous skewed glucose measurements, zero-inflated activity counts, binary indicators of sleep/wake). The PI will develop a more robust framework for multi-view data integration that is better able to account for outliers, better match the mixed types of data actually collected, and be more accurate in separating common from view-specific signals. The new methods will be implemented in open-source software accompanied by reproducible workflow examples, providing immediate and easy access for other researchers. The educational component centers on the development of structured research experiences (SRE) for students. SRE enhances students written communication, software development and reproducible research skills, all of which are lacking in traditional curriculum. This will improve students? preparation for conducting research, and widen their STEM employment opportunities. The involvement of students from traditionally underrepresented groups will positively impact their retention rate and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>Popular dimension reduction methods, such as principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, are tailored for single-view data, and thus fail to discover coordinated multi-view signals on a global level. On the other hand, existing multi-view dimension reduction methods suffer from reliance on the Gaussianity assumption, an inability to capture joint functional signals, and a lack of theoretical guarantees. The PI will address these drawbacks by (i) developing a joint dimension reduction framework for skewed continuous, binary and zero-inflated view types; (ii) a joint dimension reduction framework for mixed functional multi-view data and (iii) a new paradigm for simultaneous extraction of signals across views based on hierarchical low-rank constraints.  This work will lead to critically needed new statistical methods for data integration with direct relevance for researchers working with wearable monitors, microbiome and multi-omics data through interdisciplinary collaborations of the PI.

Questions under study in knot theory will emphasize the interplay between topology and geometry. As geometric applications to topology are some of the most subtle and significant discoveries in the last thirty years, these questions are part of an active and vibrant area of mathematical research and are also of interest because of their potential applications. Student participants will be recruited nationally, with emphasis on recruitment from those institutions that have limited research opportunities for their students, and from populations underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The differential geometry component of the project has three main topics. The Riemann curvature tensor is an object that encodes a manifold?s curvature at every point. It is known that this object can be expressed as a combination of other types of curvatures, and students will explore how different curvature tensors could be expressed according to this decomposition. Second, students will investigate novel invariants for curvature tensors. Thirdly, students will seek geometric realizations illustrating these concepts. The knot theory component of this project focuses on hyperbolic links?links whose complements admit a hyperbolic structure. Projects will focus on the class of links called fully augmented links, which have particularly tractable geometric structures but are nevertheless quite useful since they can be used to construct all links via Dehn filling.

However, producing these metals from domestic sources is becoming more difficult as easy-to-mine deposits are exhausted; what remains are lower-grade ores with complex mineralogy. Current extractive processes are designed for simpler ores and are inefficient, sometimes ineffective, with the more complicated remaining resources. This project will instead develop a geometallurgical approach to mining and extracting energy metals and other critical elements. This consists of tailoring extractive processes to the detailed mineralogy and composition of individual ore zones, enabling more efficient extraction of energy metals and less mine waste. This will help to maintain a sustainable supply of the metals that support low-carbon energy in the future. Ancillary benefits from this project include an education and outreach program that will broaden engagement with mineral resources topics among teachers and the public.  <br/><br/><br/>This project will integrate geological data and metallurgical experiments to develop tailored geometallurgical approaches to the extraction of critical energy metals, starting with uranium, vanadium, and cobalt.

Research will begin with detailed characterization of ore properties and ore mineral distribution in the globally important sediment-hosted ores of U, V, and Co. A series of leaching experiments will illuminate the connections between ore mineral properties (crystallinity, composition) and fluid-mineral reactions, enabling optimized extraction design. The initial results will be used to develop geometallurgical models of optimized extraction parameters for ore zones in the Colorado Plateau U and V deposits, where this approach will be tested.

However, different datasets often encode corresponding sociopolitical categories with different variable names, at different scales, and different points in.  These different encodings must be translated across datasets before merging, thereby creating a substantial bottleneck to interdisciplinary, comparative social science.  This project will build a new data analysis platform called SocioMap that will help overcome this bottleneck by providing tools for translating across a large and growing body of international social science datasets and for building new datasets from diverse existing datasets storing ethnic, religious, linguistic, and administrative boundaries in disparate, and non-compatible formats.<br/><br/>SocioMap will be a user-friendly set of tools to help translate sociopolitical categories and classification schemes across multiple, external datasets.

Furthermore, SocioMap is designed to grow by permitting registered users to add new categories and translations for re-use in future projects.

One project will focus on the role that movement has in ecological systems or that redistribution has in economic systems.  The objectives are to understand what movement strategies are optimal and why clustering of competing populations work.

Effective and rapid antibiotic-susceptibility testing (AST) for biofilms is urgently required to guide effective antibiotic use and to survey the spread and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Conventional AST techniques are not generally suitable for biofilms, thus the overall objective of this project is to provide an innovative, practical, and reliable AST for disease-causing biofilms. This AST will enable rapid, high-throughput, and real-time monitoring along with controllable manipulation of bacterial microenvironments and rapid biofilm formation from a low volume sample. This is accomplished by continuously monitoring bacterial extracellular electron transfers (EEFs) through their metabolic activities, which are impaired by effective antibiotics. Furthermore, a novel strategy will be created to rapidly construct a 3-D polymicrobial biofilm and to establish various biofilm models that mimic natural polymicrobial communities. The project will address grand challenges in microbial infections critical to U.S. healthcare and the economy.

Studies are designed to test a two-fold central hypothesis that: (1) the electrons collectively harvested from a group of cells in a biofilm can be strong enough as a transducing signal to sensitively and continuously monitor both bacterial growth and antibiotic susceptibility, and (2) a 3-D multi-laminate paper stack can provide a new strategy for rapid layer-by-layer biofilm formation in a high-throughput format.  The research plan is organized under three aims:  (1) create a real-time, sensitive biosensing platform to electrically evaluate antibiotic effectiveness of bacteria in a high-throughput (96 wells) and rapid (<5 hours) manner using microbial fuel cell (MFC) based biosensors previously developed by the investigator; (2) develop a multi-layer hydrophilic paper-based culturing platform for rapid biofilm formation with control of biofilm thickness and microbial concentration; and (3) demonstrate integration as a system and practical use with model biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. In summary, the AST array developed will contribute to an in-depth understanding of the underlying dynamics of antibiotic resistance evolution in biofilms and test the effectiveness of an antibiotic regime for treating biofilm-associated infections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivated by observations of phenomenal cooperative behavior in nature, large teams of simple robots promise unprecedented task efficiency and resilience benefits over sophisticated standalone systems. These beneficial capabilities are fundamental to the future of disaster response, environment monitoring, military operations and space exploration, and to the continuing scientific leadership of the U.S. in these domains. However, most existing approaches to designing the behavior of mobile robots that operate as large collectives suffer from two key limitations: the lack of predictable performance guarantees at the swarm level and the inability to adapt to different uncertain environments and scales of operation. This award supports theoretical research to concurrently tackle these limitations by leveraging machine learning tools combined with rigorous engineering design approaches that enable systematic analysis and tailoring of how knowledge representation and the physical design of individual robots influence their collective behavior. These theoretical contributions will be reduced to practice by designing and testing new small aerial and ground robots for swarm applications with broad societal impact in the areas of time-critical emergency response and pollution clean-up. Outreach efforts engaging local emergency-response stakeholders will allow understanding of potential barriers to transitioning such swarm-robotic technologies to practice. This multidisciplinary project will also enable novel experiential learning environments and diversity initiatives for engineering students at the intersecting fields of design and robotics, and facilitate advanced skill development in these fields by enriching the graduate curricula and organizing a new workshop at a flagship Robotics conference.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to investigate the central hypothesis that dependable swarm systems can be computationally designed via imitation learning of individual agent behavior from provably-optimal expert solutions and concurrent tailoring of agent morphology. Here ""dependability"" encompasses the generalizability, scalability and mathematical explainability of the ensuing collective behavior, which will be analyzed in the context of decentralized swarm robotic systems, comprising palm-sized wheeled robots and multirotor drones, that are tasked to provide target search and collective transport operations. To accomplish this goal, the following three key fundamental contributions are envisioned in this research: 1) develop learnable scale-agnostic representations of the individual agent's knowledge that regulates its task-planning processes embodied by novel Bayesian search and graph-theoretic models; 2) identify hybrid imitation learning approaches for adapting the individual agent behavior over varying environments, while minimizing the deviation of the ensuing collective behavior from provably-optimal offline solutions; 3) develop computational methods based on novel constrained policy gradient and co-evolution approaches to concurrently design agent morphology along with the learning of agent behavior, such that the ensuing morphological complexity optimally facilitates the necessary behavioral adaptations. These contributions will provide an increased understanding of ""dependability"" and the ""interplay of form and behavior"" that is expected to impact a broad range of multi-agent and decentralized systems beyond swarm robotics, such as various cyber physical systems. The integrated education plan involves the creation of 1) new experiential learning programs for engineering students, including underrepresented minorities, based on swarm computer games and conservation-focused drone flight experiments, and 2) a new graduate course and conference workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This consequently increases the risk of exposure to the virus in confined indoor spaces, such as, restaurants, offices, and dormitories. Although they are generally not designed for pandemic situations, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, if properly designed and controlled, can significantly mitigate the spread of diseases in indoor spaces. This collaborative research project between MIT and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) synergies research activities in control theory, fluid dynamics, and machine learning to enable optimal design and control of HVAC systems for built environments so as to minimize the exposure risk of occupants. The project will establish a new theoretical framework for optimal control of HVAC systems employing realistic computational models of the disease transmission as well as the indoors thermofluid dynamics. This will provide business owners and building managers with general guidelines for the HVAC operations. <br/><br/>The research will integrate the proposed framework with data-driven, reduced-order models and employ reinforcement learning techniques to develop computationally tractable algorithms for adaptive, online control of the HVAC systems in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

Despite their shortcomings passwords continue to be the most widely adopted form of authentication. The goal of the project is to develop cryptographic tools to improve the security and usability of human authentication, especially password authentication. <br/><br/>The project investigates new combinatorial techniques to design and analyze memory hard functions, a cryptographic primitive which can be used to protect low-entropy secrets such as passwords and biometrics against brute-force attacks.

Whether it is browsing the web, making a purchase, or sending a message to a friend, cryptography is everywhere.  Despite the fact that users (often unknowingly) rely on the security of systems that use cryptography, recent years have seen a number of serious vulnerabilities in the cryptographic pieces of systems, some with large consequences.  These have been caused by various problems, including poor designs, difficulty of implementation, and use (or misuse) of (in)secure primitives.  There is a common denominator in all of these problems: the human element.  Many of the errors that are found when analyzing these insecure systems could have been prevented if both designers and software engineers had better tools to help them navigate the complex cryptographic space.  Cryptographic automation is a relatively new and promising area that is designed to help solve many of these issues and make developing secure systems far easier and less error-prone, even for a non-expert.  This project focuses on removing the human element from the deployment and analysis of cryptographic systems.  Through the use of cryptographic automation and the development of tools, the project's aim is to make it easier to design and securely deploy new and complex cryptographic systems while preventing insecurities from occurring in such systems.  Additionally, the project contains an education plan designed to help make cryptography more accessible to a broader audience.  The creation of the Midwest Women in Computer Security Workshop, as well as the project's goal to not just develop but also disseminate tools, will allow more students of all ages, and more software engineers, to explore cryptography and computer security, instead of being intimidated or afraid of it.<br/><br/>The project has three main thrusts.  The core of the project centers around the first thrust of building tools to aid in the deployment of complex cryptography.  This will principally focus on automating the end-to-end development of zero-knowledge proof code, from expressing the proof statement to realizing the implementation, with additional applications to anonymous credentials.  The second thrust focuses on automating the discovery of cryptographic vulnerabilities in applications that use zkSNARKs, a popular zero-knowledge proof instantiation.  This thrust will leverage fuzzing to help both programmers and end users detect inconsistencies and errors in existing, already deployed zkSNARK circuits and applications.  The third thrust works to automate the discovery and identification of modern cryptographic algorithms and techniques in both traditional as well as heavily obfuscated binaries, through a novel combination of various dynamic analysis and machine-learning based approaches.  If successful, the combination of these three thrusts will, for expert and non-expert developers alike, make it both easier to discover the use of cryptography and potentially vulnerable algorithms in existing systems as well as design and securely deploy new and complex cryptographic systems while preventing these insecurities from happening.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of luminescent materials has been recognized globally, designated by the United Nations, 2015 was celebrated as the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies. To further illustrate this, it is estimated that energy-efficient solid-state lighting (e.g., LEDs) could reduce lighting energy use by 75% in 2035. In this CAREER award, jointly supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Prof. Bayram Saparov and his group aim to develop a new type of affordable, easy-to-prepare, earth-abundant and robust luminescent materials based on inexpensive metal halides. The project has a potential transformative impact on understanding of the links between the light emission properties and atomic structures of metal halides. This, in turn, will allow us to control and manipulate the materials chemistry of halides to prepare custom design light-emitting materials with full range color-tunability. In addition to brand new avenues for energy-saving solid-state lighting technologies, this project will also provide an excellent platform for promoting materials chemistry research and developing a diverse, competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce in Oklahoma through our Research Experience for High School Students (REHSS) program.

Low-dimensional crystal structures of the proposed halides exhibit narrow discrete energy bands, strong charge localization and high exciton binding energies, characteristics and should enable their performance as highly efficient light emitters.

Studying random matrices enables one to develop better tools to analyze data, to understand properties of complex quantum systems, and to estimate performance of algorithms. The Principal Investigator (PI) will consider various models of random matrices with the goal of obtaining results that hold with very high probability. Graphs (collections of points connected by edges) have been extensively used as models of communication networks and of data organization. For example, social networks and the World Wide Web can be efficiently modeled as random graphs. Understanding characteristics of random walks on graphs helps to evaluate the speed of information exchange in networks. Moreover, random walks on certain graphs have been used for sampling, that is, constructing typical instances of complex objects. The PI will study properties of random walks on graphs by employing tools of functional analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>The two main parts of this research are analysis of singular spectrum and eigenvalues of certain models of square random matrices, and functional inequalities on graphs.

Further, the PI will consider limiting laws for the spectrum of random matrices for previously unexplored models. The tools developed as part of this research should find applications in other problems within combinatorial and non-asymptotic random matrix theory.

Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), Daytona Beach, Florida, will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in experimental and computational multidisciplinary aerospace research, focusing on mechanics, materials science, and aerospace physiology by inviting ten undergraduate students for a 10-week summer program. The students will gain experience in materials synthesis, coating, sampling characterization, computer modeling directly related to various fields of aerospace, mechanical, materials, and environmental engineering, as well as space microbiology and aerospace physiology. The REU participants will publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals and/or present at professional meetings leading to broad dissemination of new knowledge created in the undergraduate research projects. Moreover, seminars will expose the students to various aspects of graduate school (applications, scholarships, presentation skills, scientific writing) and professional life.

Finally, participants will have a chance to engage K-12 students through STEM summer camps at Embry-Riddle and inspire the next generation of young people to consider a career in science and engineering. Believing in both theory and practice; the REU site is interested in experimental as well as mathematical modeling of difficult problems while at the same time building real systems for demonstrating those solutions in real-life situations.<br/><br/>The REU-research projects are organized around three main axes: (1) thermal applications; (2) biomonitoring in space; and (3) biomimetics. The undergraduate research projects contribute to the fundamental understanding of aerospace sciences, materials science, aerospace physiology, and topics including space thermal management, bioinspired hierarchical structures, and space health (e.g., effects of microgravity and space radiation). The projects are focused on two main ideas for expanded space exploration: (1) the need for technology supporting human space travel and extended stays, and (2) the need to investigate the effects of space travel on the body. Some examples of research projects include the fabrication of a flexible, stretchable, and self-healable platform for aerospace applications, a study of intracellular reactive oxygen species when exposed to space radiation, or biomarker sensing using flexible transistors on skin. The site will initiate the establishment of a mentoring relationship by conducting regular Golden Eagle Meetings with their mentors.

Despite progress in the availability of computer science (CS) coursework in secondary school settings, a number of student groups remain substantially underrepresented in computing. This project aims to broaden youth participation in computing by focusing on innovative technology experiences centered around coding-based music. The project will engage Black, Latinx, and female youth during the critical middle school years when many students decide whether future opportunities in CS merit consideration. Through week-long summer programs held on college campuses, the project will develop and study a series of culturally relevant activities where participants learn how to play, manipulate, and create by coding authentic-sounding hip-hop beats using Sonic Pi music software. The project extends prior research into CS learning through coding beats by (1) enhancing the depth of technical analysis, (2) moving students from beat modification to beat creation, and (3) increasing the range of concepts that can naturally be included in a course. This collaborative effort across two universities, a local school district, and a community organization will engage musicians who utilize Sonic Pi in performances and host annual competitions and concerts featuring student work to help broaden youth perspectives of CS and computing-related careers. The project team will also prepare 40 teachers and community instructors to facilitate similar programs in their own settings, ensuring sustainability beyond the duration of the project. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>The project employs design-based implementation research to iteratively refine the instructional approaches across 160 middle school students and two settings to best address the mismatch between CS culture and the culture and learning experiences of students underrepresented in computing. This project will design and investigate a summer program instructional approach that highlights how particular coding technology (e.g., Sonic Pi), scaffolding techniques, and learning activities work to support youth's computer science knowledge, confidence, sense of belonging, and career awareness. The project will build upon previously funded NSF STEM education research (e.g., EarSketch) by grounding in the Use-Modify-Create framework, which articulates a trajectory of youth learning in computing. Mixed methods will inform the research. Qualitative data from observations, focus groups and computational artifacts will explore the promise and effectiveness of the program in promoting expected youth outcomes. Quantitative data (e.g., validated pre- and post-surveys) will identify emergent patterns that will help strengthen the feasibility, sustainability, and social validity of the scaffolded approach. The knowledge and insights gained from this research will provide evidence to support future programs across other regions and develop strong CS learning experiences for students underrepresented in computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The great potential of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has not yet been fully utilized in this domain due to the lack of holistic, resilient, flexible, and cost-effective monitoring protocols. This project will develop UAS-based fire management strategies to use autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an optimal, efficient, and safe way to assist the first responders during the fire detection, management, and evacuation stages. The project is a collaborative effort between Northern Arizona University (NAU), Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech), Desert Research Institute (DRI), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The team has established ongoing collaborations with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in Pacific Northwest Research Station, Kaibab National Forest (NF), and Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management to perform multiple field tests during the prescribed and managed fires. This proposal's objective is to develop an integrated framework satisfying unmet wildland fire management needs, with key advances in scientific and engineering methods by using a network of low-cost and small autonomous UAVs along with ground vehicles during different stages of fire management operations including: (i) early detection in remote and forest areas using autonomous UAVs; (ii) fast active geo-mapping of the fire heat map on flying drones; (iii) real-time video streaming of the fire spread; and (iv) finding optimal evacuation paths using autonomous UAVs to guide the ground vehicles and firefighters for fast and safe evacuation. <br/><br/>This project will advance the frontier of disaster management by developing: (i) an innovative drone-based forest fire detection and monitoring technology for rapid intervention in hard-to-access areas with minimal human intervention to protect firefighter lives; (ii) multi-level fire modeling to offer strategic, event-scale, and new on-board, low-computation tactics using fast fire mapping from UAVs; and (iii) a bounded reasoning-based planning mechanism where the UAVs identify the fastest and safest evacuation roads for firefighters and fire-trucks in highly dynamic and uncertain dangerous zones. The developed technologies will be translational to a broad range of applications such as disaster (flooding, fire, mud slides, terrorism) management, where quick search, surveillance, and responses are required with limited human interventions. This project will also contribute to future engineering curricula and pursue a substantial integration of research and education while also engaging female and underrepresented minority students, developing hands-on research experiments for K-12 students. <br/><br/>This project is in response to the NSF Cyber-Physical Systems 20-563 solicitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Connected vehicle technologies provide unique opportunities for cooperative travel to improve mobility and safety through innovative traffic management procedures. However, these procedures introduce coupling effects between information and traffic that could reduce traffic flow stability. These coupling effects are the result of the feedback loops between information and traffic that are highly dynamic and prone to disturbances transmitted from one system to the other. It is both important and challenging to ensure traffic flows are robust in response to these effects. This CAREER award supports research that will lead to new paradigms for the design and operation of robust traffic management to foster mobility, safety, and sustainability. The findings will directly benefit society in terms of more effective use of both cyber and physical infrastructures, leading to more sustainable and efficient transportation planning and operations that fully consider dynamic supply-demand interactions. The award also supports educational efforts contributing to transportation workforce by training the professionals with the dynamic systems perspective in traffic engineering. The project will disseminate research and educational outcomes to a wide audience, including K-12 students, professionals, and the public using Virtual Reality-based and simulation platforms. <br/><br/>The research goal of this CAREER project is to develop a theoretical framework with solid scientific foundations to model the information-traffic co-evolutionary process to address the challenges created by CVS. The framework is built on a stochastic, coupled dynamical system that can model connected vehicle traffic dynamics at the local and network scales. The primary tool used in this project is the notion of non-equilibrium flow robustness, which will advance the instability analysis and attraction domain analysis of the coupled dynamical system. As the foundation, the non-equilibrium flow analyses help the algorithmic development related to detecting non-equilibrium flow transition, quantification and prediction of CVS robustness, and design of adaptive control principles by leveraging the complex network theory, stochastic optimal control, and variational principle.

A major challenge for environmental sustainability is to help semi-arid communities thrive by ensuring that cities, agriculture, and the environment are jointly water-secure. One successfully demonstrated option to meet growing water demands with the same water supply is reducing urban water use through efficiency. Urban lawn irrigation is now the primary target for reducing urban water use, as it dominates annual water use in many semi-arid cities. Cutting urban water use through irrigation efficiency could play a critical role in water-scarce river basins, but is presently limited by the potential unintended consequences of streamflow reduction from less runoff and groundwater flowing into streams. If we transform semi-arid cities to use less water outdoors, will urban streams run dry? Will major rivers flowing through semi-arid cities become trickles, with all the associated damage to ecology, recreation, and downstream water availability? The lack of fundamental scientific knowledge on how urban irrigation affects streamflow has limited the implementation of water-efficient urban irrigation systems in some parts of the semi-arid U.S. The purpose of this work is to predict the effects of reduced urban irrigation on streamflow, enhance the capacity of urban areas to manage scarce water resources, and ultimately contribute to the goal of thriving, sustainable semi-arid communities. The project will establish a mentoring program for underrepresented minority students interested in water careers and engage these students in hands-on urban water research. This project is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences Program and the Environmental Sustainability Program.<br/><br/>Reducing urban irrigation could play a critical role in achieving water security and sustainability in river basins where water is scarce. Urban irrigation may be reduced through smart, efficient irrigation systems or lawn conversion to xeriscaping and impervious surfaces. This work will quantify the present contribution of lawn irrigation to streamflow in small, semi-arid urban watersheds. This will be achieved in the Denver, Colorado, U.S. area by developing and applying a novel method combining water isotopes as a tracer of tap water with water provider reports, and monitoring in experimental watersheds. Then, using irrigation plots and integrated subsurface-surface-land surface hydrologic modeling, this research will determine the effects of reduced urban irrigation on semi-arid groundwater recharge and surface runoff. Lastly, this work will evaluate the hydrologic significance of present and reduced urban irrigation on streamflow in the semi-arid urban corridor of a large river basin. This research will integrate tightly with an education plan to diversify the urban water workforce in Colorado.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most natural gas is burned for its heating value or to generate electricity, the light hydrocarbons that comprise natural gas are also attractive feedstocks for manufacturing readily-transportable liquid fuels and chemicals.  Catalysis plays an important role in natural gas up-conversion processes by accelerating reaction rates and improving energy efficiency.  Even with catalytic assistance, however, the conversion of natural gas to higher-value liquid products remains challenging.  The project addresses that challenge through research aimed at new catalysts capable of oxidizing methane to methanol, thus supporting U.S. energy security and economic competitiveness in the chemical sector.  The project includes educational activities focused on inspiring undergraduate students to pursue research, and outreach activities aimed at public science engagement with the local community.   <br/><br/>Low-temperature transformation of light alkanes to useful fuels and chemicals is a persistent challenge in the catalysis community.  Porous catalysts with mononuclear Fe active sites have been studied extensively for alkane oxidation reactions, motivated by metalloenzymes that oxidize methane to methanol at ambient temperature.  Metal-containing zeolites and metal organic frameworks are particularly attractive for emulating the reaction environment in metalloenzymes, given the presence of primary binding sites with the requisite local configurations that are housed in reaction pockets of molecular dimensions.  However, heterogeneity in the arrangements of atoms in binding sites, and the size and shape of the cavities that confine them, complicate both physicochemical characterization and description of prevalent reaction pathways.  Circumvention of these complications is possible if both the local coordination and the secondary confining voids that comprise the active centers are well-defined.  A promising route towards this aim is encapsulation of molecular complexes within the supercages of faujasite zeolites.  Specifically, the project explores hydrothermal synthesis of metal phthalocyanines (MPCs) encapsulated in faujasite to control the identities and ligands of metal-central atoms, and to perform a combined spectroscopic and kinetic study of coupled light alkane oxidation and nitrogen oxide reduction reactions over these materials.  An over-arching goal is to assign spectroscopic signatures and chemical events to active centers of known structures, thereby overcoming complications inherent in existing metal-containing porous catalysts, while simultaneously creating a materials platform that allows for control over the electronics of active centers in hydrothermally stable, single-site heterogeneous catalysts.  These experiments will allow straightforward quantification of turnover frequencies and intrinsic kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, while also evaluating hydrothermal stability, time-on-stream stability, and broader utility of these materials in gas-phase oxidation reactions.  Undergraduate students will be heavily involved with the research and will gain valuable skills to prepare them for graduate studies in Chemistry or Chemical Engineering.  Public science outreach will communicate findings and research goals to the local community through experimental demonstrations.  Results from the project will also serve as lecture material in a new graduate-level elective on spectroscopic characterization of inorganic solids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This half, furthermore, has been better captured by local or regional financial technology (fintech) firms, that, assisted by artificial intelligence (AI), have managed to successfully lend to and assess borrowers without robust credit histories via the use and sophistication of other sources of information. The goal of this project is to understand the role of credit scoring and other financial technologies in the recent but sustained expansion of credit and indebtedness in the Southern Cone region of Latin America, which includes Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. This is explored by empirically tracking and comparing the work of Equifax with that of local and regional fintech firms. By tracing the development of financial technologies in South America, this research makes intelligible the role of STEM disciplines in generating new forms of credit and indebtedness in a context where indebtedness rates are on the rise worldwide and credit remains crucial to access education, healthcare, housing, and subsistence. This project contributes to understanding the potential of financial technology to continually reshape socio-economic life.<br/><br/>Drawing on qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews with local experts and industry insiders; participant observation in fintech conferences and seminars; and archival research on company, industry, and public polices, this project responds to two main research questions: a) How are AI and related technologies expanding financial services and reshaping socio-economic life in Latin America? b) What techniques have local fintech firms employed to capture excluded populations, generating knowledge regimes that far surpass what information giants like Equifax can assemble? These questions are explored by looking at the combination of technologies, innovation, and expertise that bring Latin American consumer credit markets into being. Such an approach yields valuable insights on how value and knowledge are produced through technical innovation and on how algorithms generated through machine learning are used to predict economic behaviors, especially in contexts of socio-economic uncertainty. This project builds on a hypothesis that states that the shallow reach of formal financial infrastructures in South America placed limits on Equifax?s capacity to expand, whereas regional fintech firms were able to take advantage of this infrastructural deficit by developing techniques for assessing creditworthiness by translating novel forms of data into commercially useful knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rapid growth of such data is putting increased pressure on datacenter networks, where enormous amounts of data must be processed.   To aid in this task, the underlying datacenter network switches, which are responsible for moving data from one server to another, should provide the fastest possible switching with high bandwidths, while minimizing the energy required. To address these requirements, this project involves transformative research to design and optimize a new class of network switches based on silicon photonics technology that will be capable of transferring large amounts of data with ultra-low latency.  The project includes research on this new technology and its system application in large-scale datacenter networks.  It will incorporate opportunities for students (including underrepresented groups) at K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels to work on real-world problems. It also includes a new outreach program to K-12 schools in Northern Colorado and Southern Wyoming with low college-attendance rates.<br/><br/>This project proposes a long-term, integrated program of research to optimize the scalability and reconfigurability in silicon photonic switches for future high-performance computing and datacenter systems. In particular, the researchers propose comprehensive optimizations across the entire design space of silicon photonic switches, including device, network, and control layers, to realize ultra-fast reconfigurable, large-scale, and energy-efficient silicon photonic switches. At the device layer, a new class of interferometric silicon photonic switching devices will be designed and optimized to realize fast switching elements with ultra-low optical losses and crosstalk noise. At the network layer, topology-aware optical power loss and crosstalk noise models will be developed to be integrated into a new network-optimization platform, creating and optimizing various types of high-radix networks specifically for large-scale silicon photonic switches. The new research at the control layer will analyze traffic flows in the switch fabric to develop an ultra-fast and energy-aware switch reconfiguration solution. Last, a new open-source silicon photonic switch cross-layer design and co-optimization tool will be developed to incorporate the new models and optimization solutions at each design layer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through surveys and interviews, we will develop and test a multilevel theoretical framework for understanding engineers? concerns for public welfare and for examining cultural, institutional, and identity factors that shape these concerns. We will develop a research-informed graduate seminar that will provide a model for engineering programs at other institutions to enhance professional responsibility training among their students.

The project will also contribute to the knowledge base on engineering workforce onboarding and training, and will serve as a benchmark for research on engineers? understanding of their public welfare responsibilities.<br/><br/>We will examine possible factors that impact engineers? concern for public welfare across three levels: professional cultural ideologies, institutional contexts (engineering education, engineering workplaces, and professional societies), and professional identities. We will use this multilevel framework to address several primary research questions: (1) to what extent do engineering professionals and students recognize, strategize about, and act on concerns for public welfare as part of their professional responsibilities? (2) What cultural, institutional, and identity factors promote or undermine these outcomes? (3) To what extent can a research-informed seminar teach students to recognize public welfare responsibilities and to understand strategies for intervention? We will investigate these questions with a representative survey of US engineers (N=500) and a longitudinal interview study following a cohort of electrical and computer engineering master?s students into the workforce (N=60).

Pathogenic soil fungi can cause seedlings to die while other soil fungi form beneficial symbiosis with seedlings that can help them thrive by obtaining key nutrients in the soil. The goal of this project is to better understand the contexts in which fungi promote seedling growth and maintain tree species diversity, in the context of a reforestation project. Degree of relatedness between adult trees will be a particular focus of this work, with the hypothesis that seedlings will interact with more beneficial fungi when they are planted near adult trees that are more genetically different from themselves. This project will take place in Ecuador, in a species-rich region that is increasingly threatened with deforestation, which releases carbon into the atmosphere. Reforestation, in contrast, creates a sink for carbon and habitat for many endangered species. This research on seedling-fungal interactions can aid in designing reforestation efforts. The broader impacts further include training a U.S. based post-doctoral associate and graduate student.<br/><br/>This project provides a novel, multi-species test of the idea that, by selecting against more common genotypes and favoring survival of rarer genotypes, within-species specialization by pathogenic soil fungi promotes and maintains genetic diversity within plant species. At the same time, the research also explores whether and in what contexts soil fungal communities have positive impacts on seedlings. To do so, the team will implement a shade house experiment made possible by a large-scale reforestation project in Ecuador. The study design allows an assessment of seedling performance as a function of how related a given seedling?s maternal tree is to the conspecific tree in whose soil the seedling is planted. The design allows 36 within-species pairwise comparisons with 8 replicates each, for each of 16 different tree species, as well as controls with sterilized inoculum. Genetic relatedness of trees and profiles of fungal community composition and function will be assessed via high-throughput sequencing. This work is expected to provide novel data on the extent to which within-species specialization by soil fungi occurs; the degree to which genetic similarity between conspecific maternal trees predicts magnitude and direction of soil fungal impacts on seedling performance; and how specific combinations of soil and root fungal communities impact seedling performance. These findings are expected to advance our understanding of the ecological and microevolutionary factors that control the diversity of tropical trees<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop UAS-based fire management strategies to use autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an optimal, efficient, and safe way to assist the first responders during the fire detection, management, and evacuation stages. The project is a collaborative effort between Northern Arizona University (NAU), Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech), Desert Research Institute (DRI), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The team has established ongoing collaborations with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in Pacific Northwest Research Station, Kaibab National Forest (NF), and Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management to perform multiple field tests during the prescribed and managed fires. This proposal's objective is to develop an integrated framework satisfying unmet wildland fire management needs, with key advances in scientific and engineering methods by using a network of low-cost and small autonomous UAVs along with ground vehicles during different stages of fire management operations including: (i) early detection in remote and forest areas using autonomous UAVs; (ii) fast active geo-mapping of the fire heat map on flying drones; (iii) real-time video streaming of the fire spread; and (iv) finding optimal evacuation paths using autonomous UAVs to guide the ground vehicles and firefighters for fast and safe evacuation. <br/><br/>This project will advance the frontier of disaster management by developing: (i) an innovative drone-based forest fire detection and monitoring technology for rapid intervention in hard-to-access areas with minimal human intervention to protect firefighter lives; (ii) multi-level fire modeling to offer strategic, event-scale, and new on-board, low-computation tactics using fast fire mapping from UAVs; and (iii) a bounded reasoning-based planning mechanism where the UAVs identify the fastest and safest evacuation roads for firefighters and fire-trucks in highly dynamic and uncertain dangerous zones. The developed technologies will be translational to a broad range of applications such as disaster (flooding, fire, mud slides, terrorism) management, where quick search, surveillance, and responses are required with limited human interventions.

Archaeology provides a deep-time perspective into the impacts of climate change on human populations, as our species has coped with varying degrees of environmental change for most of our existence. This project seeks to investigate the relationship between settlement choice and environmental conditions in coastal foraging populations over the last 4000 years. This project will provide important insight into the interlinked social and environmental factors that affect settlement choices. By investigating community settlement choice in an area known for its extreme environmental conditions, we can better understand variability in human responses to environmental change. Clarifying the connection between human behavior and environmental change is vital, as environmental change impacts on livelihoods are intensifying. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the methods proposed here will also assist communities in conserving their cultural heritage by systematically recording human activities on the landscape through time.<br/><br/>Three main questions are posed by this project: 1) How important are natural resources in human settlement choice? 2) Are major climate events accompanied by shifts in the distribution and density of settlements? and 3) Do social factors, such as community ties or networks, influence settlement patterns, and if so, to what degree? Using an automated remote sensing procedure, this project will systematically record archaeological deposits in this coastal foraging community and researchers will survey and excavate identified locations to establish site chronologies. Next, environmental conditions over the past several thousand years will be reconstructed using fossilized corals. Finally, these data will be incorporated into spatial statistical models to analyze the relationship between environmental conditions and settlement distributions over time. The project would advance archaeological knowledge about human-environment interactions, and the role of mobility in human adaptations to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins must be ?active? in biological samples and pharmaceutical formulations to carry out therapeutic functions. To improve the reproducibility of biological research studies and to screen the integrity of biopharmaceutical products, convenient low-cost methods are needed for determination of the amount of active protein in a sample, as opposed to the total amount of a target protein. The Linz Lab is addressing this need by developing technology to rapidly determine the fraction of protein molecules in their active states. A technique called thermal gel electrophoresis is being created that uses temperature-responsive materials to help distinguish active and inactive protein molecules. The methods created in the Linz Lab target rapid and inexpensive analysis of biological samples and biopharmaceuticals. The group is also developing associated outreach activities for elementary and middle school students to teach children how temperature impacts the properties of materials.<br/><br/>Protein bioactivity is governed in part by folded conformations, multimeric complexes, and post-translational modifications. Screening for these higher order structures when validating biological samples or biopharmaceutical formulations can help determine and control the amount of active protein in the sample, rather than just total protein mass. The Linz Lab is developing methods in a microchip gel electrophoresis format to conveniently interrogate tertiary and quaternary structures and post-translational modifications. Thermal gel electrophoresis uses thermoresponsive polymers to integrate distinct analytical capabilities within a single microfluidic device including sample preparation, separation, and detection. These disparate functions are achieved by controlling temperature in the device with high spatial and temporal resolution to locally adjust gel viscosity for each analysis step. This approach minimizes complexity and cost of the microdevices and streamlines analyses to increase sample throughput. Ultimately, this rapid, inexpensive gel electrophoresis screening technique is expected to enhance the precision of biological research and enable the integrity of protein drug and vaccine formulations to be assessed in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These samples come from a variety of tissues in human or other organisms under numerous conditions and are an invaluable resource for other scientists to reanalyze and discover new biology. However, these data are severely underused because finding the samples one is interested in from the sea of all samples is still very hard. This is because most sample descriptions are written using language that is hard to search unambiguously or are incomplete in reporting every critical aspect of the sample source. This project seeks to democratize data-driven biology by annotating publicly available samples from six species (human and five animal models) on a massive scale, which will enable researchers to discover relevant published data for further analysis. A web-interface will be developed to provide researchers a single access point to all these annotations and the related search tools. The insights and tools from this project will have far-reaching implications for how the biological researchers will submit, store, manage, access, reuse, and re-share data. Improving data discoverability and reusability will increase the accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility of biological research overall, saving resources by accelerating scientific discovery. The educational/training activities that will be developed in this project will result in formalizing and openly disseminating the ?hidden curriculum? in modern bioinformatics: the abstract experiential skills critical for holistic, practical competency in conducting large data analysis and research in a rapidly changing bioinformatics landscape. This effort will create openness and equity in professional training in applying computing to study biology.<br/><br/>This project will develop new machine learning methods that use both text and molecular data to assign comprehensive, standardized annotations to publicly-available omics samples.

The major challenges in modeling protein-DNA complexes are accurate assessment of the quality of complex models and a small number of known protein-DNA complex structures. This project aims to better understand protein-DNA interactions from a structural perspective by developing methods for assessment of the quality of protein-DNA complex models.

The major challenges are accurate assessment of the quality of complex models and the assessment of the similarity between protein-DNA complexes. While standard protocols have been developed for comparing protein-ligand complexes, they are not suitable for assessing the similarity of protein-DNA complexes due to their unique structural and chemical features. DNA has a double-helical structure and the hydrogen bonds between protein and DNA bases are crucial for protein-DNA binding specificity. New methods are clearly needed for accurate comparison of protein-DNA complexes, which in turn can help develop methods for accurate quality assessment of protein-DNA complex models. In this project, a novel method will be developed for accurately capturing the essence of similarity between protein-DNA complex structures and new algorithms will be developed for assessing the quality of protein-DNA models. In addition, these newly developed methods will be applied to assess the quality of homology protein-DNA complex models and structure-based transcription factor-binding site prediction with these models.

This project aims to broaden youth participation in computing by focusing on innovative technology experiences centered around coding-based music. The project will engage Black, Latinx, and female youth during the critical middle school years when many students decide whether future opportunities in CS merit consideration. Through week-long summer programs held on college campuses, the project will develop and study a series of culturally relevant activities where participants learn how to play, manipulate, and create by coding authentic-sounding hip-hop beats using Sonic Pi music software. The project extends prior research into CS learning through coding beats by (1) enhancing the depth of technical analysis, (2) moving students from beat modification to beat creation, and (3) increasing the range of concepts that can naturally be included in a course. This collaborative effort across two universities, a local school district, and a community organization will engage musicians who utilize Sonic Pi in performances and host annual competitions and concerts featuring student work to help broaden youth perspectives of CS and computing-related careers. The project team will also prepare 40 teachers and community instructors to facilitate similar programs in their own settings, ensuring sustainability beyond the duration of the project. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>The project employs design-based implementation research to iteratively refine the instructional approaches across 160 middle school students and two settings to best address the mismatch between CS culture and the culture and learning experiences of students underrepresented in computing. This project will design and investigate a summer program instructional approach that highlights how particular coding technology (e.g., Sonic Pi), scaffolding techniques, and learning activities work to support youth's computer science knowledge, confidence, sense of belonging, and career awareness. The project will build upon previously funded NSF STEM education research (e.g., EarSketch) by grounding in the Use-Modify-Create framework, which articulates a trajectory of youth learning in computing. Mixed methods will inform the research. Qualitative data from observations, focus groups and computational artifacts will explore the promise and effectiveness of the program in promoting expected youth outcomes. Quantitative data (e.g., validated pre- and post-surveys) will identify emergent patterns that will help strengthen the feasibility, sustainability, and social validity of the scaffolded approach.

While this simplifies circuit operation, it hides a lot of real-world operational details. In the real world, circuits behave continuously, with voltages ranging between 0 and some higher level. Voltage fluctuates in the short- and long-term due to the operating environment changes, circuit age, and computation. Traditionally, both hardware designers and attackers have ignored these low-level details. This project shows that it is possible to harness these low-level behaviors, using existing digital design techniques, to create new hardware attacks and associated defenses.<br/> <br/>This project changes how hardware designers across government and industry reason about and validate the security of their designs. By exploiting analog-domain effects for increased stealth, the project represents a fundamental change in the capabilities of hardware Trojans. Two significant outcomes of the project are a new dimension of hardware Trojan stealth, namely reproducibility, and exposing the ability to harness analog-domain properties at the hardware description language level. The artifacts of this project are a Field-Programmable Gate Array-based System-on-Chip that demonstrates the novel analog-domain hardware Trojans as well as serves as a defense evaluation platform, representative of commodity systems.<br/> <br/>This project brings together research in the areas of computer security, computer architecture, and digital circuits to create novel design-time hardware Trojans and new defenses against them. Other broader impacts include extending the technical work's impact to society, developing partnerships with government labs and industry, and providing mentorship to the next generation of leaders.

The synergistic use of statistical mechanics and AI enables the automatic, human bias-free modeling of very slow processes in chemistry and biochemistry that unfold across many time and length scales. The tools Dr. Tiwary and his team are developing are to be incorporated into efficient open-source computational platforms for widespread use by the scientific community. One of many applications he is pursuing is the quantification of time spent by small molecules inside biological hosts, a property fundamental to the chemistry of life processes, yet very hard to calculate through experiments or simulations. The results of Tiwary?s modeling will be compared against experimental investigations by his partners at Stony Brook University and the National Cancer Institute. Under this award, Dr. Tiwary will also be developing platforms to introduce coding and AI to high school/college students and educators in physical sciences through workshops and online tutorials, providing the workforce of the next generation with transferable skills for today's job markets. These efforts are being carried out through collaborations with Prince George?s Community College, Bowie State University and through virtual means with other partners across the country.<br/><br/>Pratyush Tiwary?s research seeks to develop the next generation of ultra-long timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods by integrating AI with statistical mechanics through a ?learning to learn? framework. This framework uses AI to learn the reaction coordinate (RC) characterizing a generic molecular system, interpreting it as a past-future information bottleneck. The knowledge of the RC is used through biased sampling methods to systematically sample more of the configuration space and thereby generate more relevant data to train AI. Furthermore, the use of statistical mechanics helps AI in different ways, by (i) making ?black box? AI techniques more transparent, and (ii) dealing with the problem of poor training data from which AI can produce misleading results. The iteration between AI and MD continues till the RC converges, leading to estimates of thermodynamic constants, rates and rate-limiting steps in one shot. These methods will be applied to the study of protein-ligand and riboswitch-ligand interactions, both of which are central to life processes, yet poorly understood. These long timescale all-atom simulation methods are designed to unravel the complexity and richness that arises from the interplay between different degrees of freedom in these and other generic molecular systems. Finally, this research program also strives to demonstrate how mixing statistical mechanics and AI can lead to interpretable and trustworthy use of AI, thereby increasing confidence in large-scale deployments of AI across chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, an imbalance in the presence or types of these bacteria has been linked to gastrointestinal disorders, gynecological disorders, and a greater susceptibility to infectious bacteria.  Dr. Bertucci?s work focuses on a subset of these commensal microbes, known as lactic-acid bacteria, that regulate colony-wide communication through small peptides that serve as signals of bacterial density.  The anticipated outcomes of this investigation include a novel method for synthesizing these peptides, the development of a library of peptide probes capable of enhancing or silencing lactic-acid bacteria cell-cell communication, and a greater understanding of how these communication pathways influence the positive health effects elicited by these bacteria.  As a part of this interdisciplinary research program, planned education activities include a new course-based research experience and first-year research mentorship program at Moravian College, a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a significant population of first-generation and Pell-eligible students.  Additional educational goals include leveraging social media to increase scientific engagement and literacy and establishing a science education training program for graduate and post-doctoral students seeking careers at teaching-focused institutions.  <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to synthesize and evaluate peptide-based modulators for the ubiquitous density-dependent chemical communication process known as bacterial quorum sensing (QS).  The model system for this investigation is Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), a species with documented probiotic properties and a QS pathway controlled by a cyclic peptide (LamD). The stated objective will be accomplished by first studying the factors affecting peptide cyclization to develop a novel method for the synthesis of peptide thiolactones.  Then, derivatives of native thiolactone LamD will be synthesized to conduct a series of systematic structure-activity scans in engineered L. plantarum mutants incapable of producing LamD.  By harnessing this data, potent QS agonists and antagonists will be developed and employed to modulate QS in co-culture experiments to characterize the influence of QS on interspecies, intergenus, and host-microbe interactions.

Phase diagrams are roadmaps of materials that indicate how atoms organize themselves at different temperatures, compositions, pressures, or other variables. Computational thermodynamic modeling of metals and alloys could reveal their stability under various temperatures and compositions, providing guidance for manipulating the properties of alloys. However, currently missing in the mathematical models commonly used by computational thermodynamic approaches is the description of atomic-scale short-range order. When atoms bond with each other to form a solid, they prefer to have specific kinds of atoms as their neighbors which leads to atomic-scale (short-range) order. <br/><br/>This CAREER award supports the PI and his team to pursue a fundamental improvement in computational thermodynamics by developing a new cluster-based model which incorporates atomic-scale order into the mainstream thermodynamic modeling framework. This new framework is implemented in a software platform and accessible to the broad materials science community. The computational prediction of atomic-scale order is experimentally validated in several alloys with experiments that use intense high-energy X-rays to obtain different kinds of images of the locations of atoms. The developed computational framework represents a new methodology that enables atomic-scale order to be exploited for materials design, which potentially leads to novel complex concentrated alloys or improved commercial alloys that may appear in automobiles, airplanes, or other applications.<br/><br/>This CAREER award provides support for education and outreach activities including: mentoring local K-12 students through the NanoDays events at the University of Virginia, holding annual summer programs for underrepresented minority students through the Virginia-North Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation, developing a thermodynamics-related course and learning modules, and creating a Python code library for 3D visualization of concepts in thermodynamics, making this subject fun and intuitive.<br/><br/>TECHINICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports computational and theoretical research, experiment, and education to advance the ability to calculate phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of materials, particularly metals and alloys. The PI aims to explore a cluster-based thermodynamic approach that enables the prediction of chemical short-range order (SRO) in multicomponent materials using the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method. CALPHAD is a leading method for computational thermodynamic modeling of materials. However, the current approach used in CALPHAD, the sublattice model, is a mean-field model with the ideal entropy of mixing. This makes CALPHAD inadequate for properly describing order-disorder transitions or chemical SRO in alloys, such as the Guinier-Preston zones or nanoscale clusters, which are critical for alloy mechanical properties. First-principles alloy theories, using the cluster variation method (CVM) or the cluster expansion method, can describe SRO but are generally limited to binary or ternary systems due to the large number of configuration variables.<br/> <br/>The PI plans to develop a hybrid framework by marrying unique advantages from CVM and CALPHAD through incorporating SRO into CALPHAD with a novel cluster-based solution model. The key is to use the Fowler-Yang-Li transform to decompose the cumbersome cluster probabilities in CVM into fewer site/point probabilities of the basis cluster, thereby considerably reducing the number of minimizing variables for multicomponent systems. The configurational and non-configurational, for example vibrational and elastic, free energies are modeled separately to gain insight into their respective effects on phase stability. Modern, efficient algorithms are employed to minimize the non-linear cluster-based free energy functions. The resulting codes are implemented in an open-sourced platform, OpenCALPHAD. The predicted chemical SRO is validated in selected alloys with synchrotron X-ray experiments. This hybrid CVM-CALPHAD framework represents a new methodology for thermodynamic modeling that enables atomic-scale order to be exploited as a dimension for materials design, which potentially leads to novel complex concentrated alloys.  <br/><br/>This CAREER award provides support for education and outreach activities including: mentoring local K-12 students through the NanoDays events at the University of Virginia, holding annual summer programs for underrepresented minority students through the Virginia-North Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation, developing a thermodynamics-related course and learning modules, and creating a Python code library for 3D visualization of concepts in thermodynamics, making this subject fun and intuitive.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the many electroactive polymers, electrostrictive polymers exhibit many unique and appealing attributes. This project incorporates an integrated experimental/theoretical approach to understand the fundamental physics of electrostriction in polar semicrystalline polymers. It is proposed that the liquid-crystal-like oriented amorphous fraction contributes significantly to the electrostrictive actuation. Capitalizing on this hypothesis, a closed loop of theoretical prediction, synthesis, and property characterization will be implemented to obtain fundamental understanding and accelerate the discovery of new materials.

This will include summer research opportunities for undergraduates and high school students.  <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>In response to the fast development of flexible electronics, this project aims to understand the origin of electrostriction and develop new electrostrictive polymers for better performance. Recently, a unique component in the complex semicrystalline morphology of ferroelectric polymers, i.e., the liquid-crystal-like oriented amorphous fraction (OAF), was identified. Unlike the ferroelectric crystals, these highly mobile OAFs can actuate at a much lower electric field via a field-induced conformational transformation (i.e., mechanoelectrostriction) and the electric repulsion of aligned ferroelectric domains. In this project, computer simulation with full-atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics will first be used to unravel both the mechanoelectrostriction and the electric repulsion mechanisms and to understand their theoretical limits. This information will guide the experimental preparation of electrostrictive polymers, including both poly(vinylidene fluoride)-based random copolymers/terpolymers and relaxor-like n-nylon copolymers. In-situ X-ray diffraction during electric poling will be performed to understand the complex semicrystalline morphology and differential contributions from the crystallites and the OAFs. The experimental findings will be fed back to the computer simulation for refinement. Through this cycle of computer simulation, synthesis, structure/property characterization, and feedback, enhanced electrostriction in ferroelectric polymers will be fully understood, and new electroactive materials will be implemented.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this dichotomy, metals are materials that can conduct electricity via a ""Fermi surface"" of electrons, and insulators are materials that do not conduct electricity and have no such Fermi surface.  But the last decade has uncovered whole new classes of materials, ""topological materials,"" that defy the established dichotomy.  Topological materials are able to conduct electricity but have no Fermi surface of electrons.  The possibilities for new technology and new physical phenomena inherent in this combination of properties remain largely to be explored.<br/><br/>This award supports an integrated plan of research, outreach, and education.  The research activities aim to explore, theoretically, the possibilities for new bulk phenomena in topological materials.  The research focuses in particular on thermoelectric properties (the conversion of heat to electric power) and on the nature of the transition from conducting to non-conducting states.  Key questions include these: 1) which conditions and which materials are conducive to achieving an efficient conversion of heat to electric power?, and 2) what new forms of the metal-to-insulator transition are possible, and what are their experimental signatures?<br/><br/>New topological thermoelectric materials may have applications in both waste-heat recovery and more efficient cooling.  Understanding new forms of the metal-insulator transition could lead to new generations of electronic devices.<br/><br/>The outreach and education activities make concrete steps toward improving the visibility and accessibility of condensed matter physics as a field, and toward broadening participation within it.  Activities include (i) developing lesson plans that introduce electricity and electric materials to elementary school students in underserved communities, (ii) developing problem sets and lectures for the community of high school students participating in olympiad-level physics competitions, (iii) building an inclusive research group and developing new courses at the graduate and undergraduate level, (iv) mentoring students from underrepresented demographic groups through the Bridge Program at Ohio State University, and (v) developing social media content that introduces condensed matter physics to the public.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This award supports an integrated plan of research, outreach, and education that is based on the transport properties of electronic materials.  The research focuses primarily on topological materials, which harbor the possibility for fundamentally new kinds of transport properties and electronic phases compared to those possible in traditional metals and insulators.  Exploring these possibilities requires theories that go beyond the non-interacting, free-particle descriptions that led to the discovery and classification of topological materials.  The aim of this research is to produce such theories, focusing in particular on bulk thermoelectric transport and on the nature of the metal-insulator transition.<br/><br/>One thrust of the research is concerned with the thermoelectric response of topological semimetals and its dependence on magnetic field.  The PI and his research team will consider magnetic Weyl semimetals, compensated topological semimetals, and other topological materials beyond Dirac/Weyl.  The goal of this work is to identify conditions and material properties that are conducive to achieving large thermopower and large thermoelectric efficiency.  A second thrust considers how topological systems admit novel bulk metal-insulator transitions, beyond the canonical Anderson and Mott perspectives.  The research team will consider different scenarios for such transitions, including in strongly disordered systems, hydrodynamic systems, and in electron systems with nonperturbative electron-phonon coupling.  The goal of these works is to uncover possible new electronic quantum phenomena, which have strong manifestations in the electrical conductivity, and to illustrate how they may appear in real materials.<br/><br/>Integrated with these research efforts is a comprehensive plan for outreach and education that will take concrete steps toward improving the visibility and accessibility of condensed-matter physics as a field, and toward broadening participation within it.

It considers dynamic settings, where humans interact with their visual environment and refer to the encountered objects, e.g., ?Carefully put the tomato plants in the ground? and ?Please put the phone down and come set the table,? and captions written for a human audience to complement an image, e.g., news article captions. The challenge of using such language-based supervision for training detection systems is that along with useful signal, the speech contains many irrelevant tokens.  The project will benefit society by exploring novel avenues for overcoming this challenge and reducing the need for expensive and potentially unnatural crowdsourced labels for training. It has the potential to make object detection systems more scalable and thus more usable by a broad user base in a variety of settings. The resources and tools developed would allow natural, lightweight learning in different environments, e.g., different languages or types of imagery where the well-known object categories are not useful or where there is a shift in both the pixels as well as the way in which humans refer to objects (different cultures, medicine, art). This project opens possibilities for learning in vivo rather than in vitro; while the focus here is on object categories, multimodal weak supervision is useful for a larger variety of tasks. Research and education are integrated through local community outreach and research mentoring for students from lesser-known universities, new programs for student training including honing graduate students' writing skills, and development of interactive educational modules and demos based on research findings. <br/><br/>This project creatively connects two domains, vision-and-language, and object detection, and pioneers training of object detection models with weak language supervision and a large vocabulary of potential classes. The impact of noise in the language channel will be mitigated through three complementary techniques that model visual concreteness of words, to what extent the text refers to the visual environment it appears with, and whether the weakly-supervised models that are learned are logically consistent. Two complementary word-region association mechanisms will be used (metric learning and cross-modal transformers), whose application is novel for weakly-supervised detection. Importantly, to make detection feasible, not only the semantics of image-text pairs, but their discourse relationship, will be captured. To facilitate and disambiguate the association of words to a physical environment, the latter will be represented through additional modalities, namely sound, motion, depth and touch, which are either present in the data or estimated. This project advances knowledge of how multimodal cues contextualize the relation between image and text; no prior work has modeled image-text relationships along multiple channels (sound, depth, touch, motion). Finally, to connect the appearance of objects to the purpose and use of these objects, relationships between objects, properties and actions will be semantically organized in a graph, and grammars to represent activities involving objects will be extracted, still maintaining the weakly-supervised setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most organic molecules only contain spin-paired electrons.  This ensures environmental stability but limits the capabilities of molecular materials for optoelectronic applications. In this project, Dr. Chen and his students are using rational design principles to construct new molecular radicals that are expected to have high environmental stability, ultimately leading to enhanced device performance when employed as luminescent and charge transport materials. The project involves a combination of chemical synthesis, followed by physical characterization studies to identify and optimize molecular structures and properties. This interdisciplinary research facilitates the development of educational course materials, which are designed to inspire science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students to think outside the boundaries of formal disciplines. Interconnections within STEM will be promoted through outreach events aimed at recruiting student groups from the mid-Atlantic region who are underrepresented in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Research activities in this project are aimed at the development of new electronic materials which can exploit the effects of open-shell electronic structure.  For stability, most organic molecules possess closed-shell electronic structures, where all electrons within a molecule are  spin-paired. This inherently limits optoelectronic applications due to unfavorable energies related to emission mechanisms and charge transfer kinetics.  In this project, Professor Chen and his students will synthesize and systematically explore the structure-property relationships of air-stable, pi-conjugated molecules with bisphenalenyl structures that possess persistent unpaired spin. This research builds on an efficient synthetic route already developed by the Chen research group. Synthetic modifications of bisphenalenyl structures are designed to control emission wavelength and quantum efficiencies during luminescence, while also enhancing electron mobilities and conductivities during charge transport.

These platforms will enhance testing capabilities and enable the rapid development of life-saving personalized treatments, supporting NSF?s mission of advancing the national health.

A solid theoretical foundation for TSDAs will be established through the development of a multiphysics model accounting swirl flows, mass transport, binding kinetics, and single-molecule digital signal transduction. The experimental validation of this model will unveil the fundamental mechanisms and key parameters behind the nanoswirl-based transient-state biorecognition. This fundamental knowledge will allow the development of optimization guidelines for the TSDA biosensing of multiple analytes in different sample media, significantly improving the speed and sensitivity of existing microarray assays. The implementation of TSDA in microarray chips compatible with fast and portable laser scanning optics will achieve unprecedented high assay speeds, low limits of detection (LOD=0.05-1pg/mL), large dynamic ranges, and multiplexity (up to 24 biomarkers) in the same portable platform. The optimal control of the nanorobots during TSDA using a compact magnetic actuation system will result in assay reaction times as short as 1 min, which is more than 100 times shorter than those of conventional ELISA kits.

For example, an autonomous flying camera can locate infected plants in an agriculture field to prevent the disease spread. Similarly, in an industrial plant, self-flying gas sensors can swiftly identify gas leaks. Most electronic sensors, thus enlivened by machine learning-based self-navigation, can have dramatically elevated use-cases. For practicality, however, the flying vehicle (i.e., drone) must be small enough to be inconspicuous and non-intrusive to users, such as people in offices. The small size of the drones is also necessary to navigate through constricted spaces. Since a tiny drone can only carry a tiny battery's payload, minimizing power dissipation for onboard processing of machine learning-based navigation is quite critical. Furthermore, flying space can be highly dynamic, e.g., there will be a movement of people and changes in lighting conditions in indoor applications. Therefore, drone's navigation must be resilient against these factors. This research is expected to develop new hardware implementations for machine learning-based autonomous navigation that can sustain on a tiny battery. The new hardware will also have a minimal footprint for easy integration with tiny drones. The platform will also robustly handle real-world's uncertainties, such as changes in indoor lighting conditions and people's movement. The investigator will also pursue various synergistic educational activities such as organizing workshops on machine learning at local high schools, developing a new course on machine learning hardware, and mentoring undergraduate students through this research.  <br/><br/>The investigator will specifically develop a platform for deep learning-based continuous tracking of drone's position and orientation. The platform will operate on visual inputs alone from a camera to minimize the necessary cost and hardware footprint. A compute-in-memory approach will be employed to minimize the power dissipation of the platform. Specifically, the research will investigate the co-designing of navigational models with physical and operating constraints of compute-in-memory to dramatically improve the platform's computational efficiency. To improve the robustness of prediction, deep learning framework of the low-power chip will also be augmented with a probabilistic inference. Using the procedure, not only the prediction itself, but the prediction confidence will also be extracted. Thereby, a drone will be made self-aware of when the mispredictions from deep learning models are likely due to dramatic changes in the flying scene. To operate under uncertainties, the drone will also encompass a computing framework based on probabilistic reasoning. The probabilistic framework will operate by considering many predictive hypotheses and sequentially filtering out the unlikely ones based on measurements. Unlike deep learning-based predictions which are extracted through a single-shot processing flow, predictions from reasoning are more energy expensive by considering a multitude of hypotheses and measurements. Therefore, deep learning and reasoning-based frameworks are also synergistically integrated to concurrently optimize robustness and energy efficiency. Processing cores in the developed platform will be reconfigurable for both deep learning and reasoning models to minimize the necessary resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is only in the past few years, however, that research in oxides comprised of metallic elements lower in the periodic table has gained prominence. Oxides composed of these metals exhibit unusual properties when they conduct electricity making them strong candidates for use in quantum computation technologies. This project focuses on the synthesis of oxide thin films comprised of elements in the fourth and fifth rows of the periodic table. Researchers are studying the unusual behavior derived from materials comprised of two different elements made with atomically sharp interfaces using a technique called molecular beam epitaxy. By alternating layers of each material in a sandwich structure to produce repeating interfaces, the research focuses on making a material that exhibits the properties of the interface many times over. Through two outreach programs, exposure to science in rural and underserved areas of Alabama is broadened to groups that are not introduced to science in their daily lives. The investigator teaches annual seminars in Alabama prisons through the Alabama Prison Arts and Education Project about the applications of physics and materials science to new technologies, offering non-traditional students scientific enrichment and education during their rehabilitation that is not otherwise available. The researchers also lead the annual Gameday Physics outreach event to perform science demonstrations and introduce physics research to a broad and diverse audience at highly-attended football games on the Auburn University campus. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Complex oxides comprised of 4d and 5d transition metals exhibit significantly higher spin-orbit coupling than those comprised of 3d elements. These materials have been predicted to exhibit high temperature superconductivity and other emergent topological phenomena when formed in epitaxial thin film heterostructures and superlattices. These properties make 4d and 5d materials promising for use as materials to enable topological quantum computation. In this project, systematic studies of synthesis of several candidate 4d and 5d complex oxides via hybrid molecular beam epitaxy are performed. Using this novel approach, a metal-organic precursor replaces the traditional elemental source for the transition metal, enabling easier synthesis and producing higher quality materials. Exploration of emergent interfacial phenomena includes high-temperature superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and topological electronic states. By synthesizing superlattice films comprised of repeating interfaces, the research focuses on the development of materials that exhibit interfacial phenomena in a bulk film. This project provides educational experiences for undergraduate students to learn about materials characterization through machine learning analysis of diffraction and spectroscopy data. Computational codes to analyze such data are shared for the research community to advance real-time analysis of film synthesis. Graduate student researchers gain experience in materials synthesis and characterization in the lab and at user facilities around the world. Such experiences help prepare students for careers in materials research in the integrated circuit and electronic device industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main aim of the project is to advance our understanding of quantum matter composed of electrons that interact strongly with one another. These systems are at the heart of many fundamental physical phenomena, ranging from magnetism to superconductivity (flow of electrons with no resistance). The problem at hand can be explained with an analogy from everyday life: one might learn to play individual musical notes yet not know how to put them together to produce a melody. Similarly, we now know the quantum-mechanical laws that govern individual electrons and nuclei but find it difficult to predict the emergent behavior of many such interacting components. Just as a collection of atoms organizes itself into a solid, liquid, or gas depending on external conditions, electronic matter can exist in ""valence-bond solid,"" ""quantum spin liquid,"" or ""Fermi gas"" phases, among other possibilities. Reliably predicting the behavior of electronic systems will aid future technologies and searches for quantum materials with desirable properties.<br/><br/>The PI and his team will investigate geometrically ""frustrated"" magnetic materials found in nature and laboratories worldwide. Frustration arises when multiple spatial arrangements of electron ""spin"" orientations each have similar collective energy, so there is no clear winner. This feature results in unusual quantum dynamics that have been observed in modern-day experiments but for which theoretical explanations are limited. Thus, a major focus of this proposal is to develop efficient computer algorithms to predict how such quantum materials behave under different conditions (change in temperature and application of a magnetic field) and how they respond to external probes (involving light or neutrons).  The PI and his team will also employ existing state-of-the-art numerical methods to address outstanding fundamental questions associated with this class of magnetic materials.<br/><br/>The PI's education and outreach programs are synergistically coupled to his research. The focus is on communicating the workings of computational methods for quantum systems to graduate students and the wider research community. With input from expert authors, the PI and his team will write an e-book that will train the next generation to embrace a rapidly evolving lexicon of quantum-mechanical concepts.  Through multiple outreach activities at his home institution, including open houses and public seminars, the PI will convey the importance of quantum physics in our everyday lives. To inspire more students to pursue higher education and careers in science, the PI will conduct tutoring and mentoring activities at a local K-12 school that enrolls a large number of students from underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports an integrated research, education, and outreach program in theoretical and computational condensed-matter physics. The main aim of the project is to advance our understanding of strongly correlated quantum systems, those not approximated by a non-interacting model of electrons. Reliably predicting their behavior from computer simulations remains a major challenge in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Additionally, the quantum mechanics of correlated systems in the time domain, central to both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena, is not as well-characterized and understood as its time-independent counterpart. Many experiments collect a wealth of dynamical information, but one needs theoretical inputs to interpret them. For example, evidence for fractionalized spinons in one dimension is indirectly inferred from comparison of neutron scattering data and theory.<br/><br/>The PI and his team will investigate geometrically frustrated magnets, which harbor valence-bond-solid, quantum-spin-liquid, and spin-nematic phases.  Efforts in this area will further the PI's goal of predicting properties such as transition temperatures, magnetization profiles, and dynamical responses, given minimal knowledge of the quantum material.<br/><br/>The PI and his team will perform research in the following directions:<br/><br/>1. They will numerically simulate and analyze spin dynamics at zero and finite temperature for spin-orbit-coupled, spin-ice, and spin-1 magnets on kagome and pyrochlore lattices in an applied magnetic field. Comparisons to measurements from dynamical probes such as inelastic neutron scattering and terahertz spectroscopy experiments will be carried out.<br/><br/>2. They will explore a toy lattice model of frustration that harbors ""three-colored"" exact ground states. The model offers a way to understand non-equilibrium dynamical phenomena (such as glassiness) and has potential pedagogical value.<br/><br/>3. They will develop the ""density-matrix-downfolding"" technique, a form of Hilbert-space operator renormalization, to generate effective Hamiltonians. This method will help connect real materials to strongly-correlated lattice models.<br/><br/>The PI's education program will focus on communicating the workings of computational methods for quantum systems to graduate students and the wider research community. With input from expert authors, the PI and his team will write an e-book focused on many-body-wavefunction and density-matrix based approaches. Through multiple outreach activities at his home institution, including open houses and public seminars, the PI will convey the importance of quantum physics in our everyday lives.

Students with ADHD comprise as many as 10% of U.S. college students.  College students with ADHD earn lower grades and may be less likely to graduate when compared to their peers without ADHD.  However, little is known about how to increase the academic success of this growing, underserved population.  This project will study the academic success, such as grades and persistence) of STEM college students with ADHD. Through statistical modeling and student interviews, the project plans to determine the relationship between student characteristics, the college classroom experience, and academic outcomes of STEM college students with ADHD. As a result, the project will describe the influence of the STEM classroom environment on students with ADHD.  This information, in turn, is expected to provide actionable information for classroom teaching practices that better support the academic success of this growing, understudied population of STEM college students.<br/><br/>This project aims to fill a research gap surrounding college students with ADHD by investigating relationships between precollege factors, classroom teaching practices, and academic success of STEM college students with and without ADHD, and by identifying evidence-based teaching practices that may improve the college experience. The project includes three universities having different organizational contexts, and it seeks to address the following four research questions:  1. What precollege factors are associated with academic success of STEM college students with ADHD compared to those without ADHD?  2. What teaching practices are associated with academic success of STEM college students with ADHD compared to those without ADHD? 3. How do teaching practices mediate the relationship between precollege factors and academic success of STEM college students with ADHD compared to those without ADHD?  Q4. How does organizational context influence the relationships between precollege factors, teaching practices, and academic success of STEM college students with ADHD compared to those without ADHD?  Study 1 will address research questions 1 and 2 by applying multinomial logistic regression models using secondary data from approximately 20,000 first-year STEM students, including approximately 750 with ADHD. Study 2 will address research questions 2, 3, and 4 using a student survey (with responses from approximately 2,500 students, including approximately 100 with ADHD) and in-depth interviews of 30 STEM college students with ADHD. Ultimately, this project should provide empirical evidence about teaching practices that can improve the college experience for STEM college students with ADHD. The project will increase awareness of STEM students with ADHD and strategies to integrate inclusive teaching practices by disseminating project findings through conference presentations, journal publications, and professional development workshops. Expected long-term  contributions include improving STEM education, attracting more students with ADHD to STEM, and increasing the diversity of the future STEM workforce.

In applications ranging from catalysis to astrophysics to material science, molecules and materials can be subjected to high temperatures. Nevertheless, relatively few theories exist to predict how these materials will behave at such temperatures,thwarting our ability to engineer materials such as high-Tc superconductors and next-generation thermally-responsive technologies. As part of this project, the Rubenstein Group will develop a suite of complementary theories and simulation techniques that will enable the high-accuracy modeling of complex materials at finite temperatures. In addition to this research, the Rubenstein Group will bolster its ongoing efforts to actively mentor historically-underrepresented high school students in Rhode Island through the science fair process via the Rhode Island American Chemical Society Project SEED and Advocate Programs (which Dr. Rubenstein leads) and grant area high school students opportunities to engage in real experiments through the Brown University Chemistry Department?s STEM Day Program. Dr. Rubenstein also is developing a new Accelerating Chemical Discovery course and related textbook with the aim of familiarizing undergraduates in the chemical sciences with how data science can be leveraged to solve everyday problems in chemistry.<br/><br/>The central aim of this proposal is to develop a suite of new finite temperature electronic structure techniques to elucidate the electronic phase diagrams of correlated materials. In plasmonic catalysis, astrophysics, materials science, and many other applications, molecules and materials are subject to high temperatures at which their electrons populate a wide distribution of energy levels. Nevertheless, most electronic structure methods to date have focused on the ground state, and those methods that do account for temperature either do not accurately account for electron correlation or have overwhelmingly been developed to study lattice models that do not capture the unique qualities of real materials. To rise to this challenge, the Rubenstein Group recently developed a new, fully ab initio, fully correlated finite temperature Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (FT-AFQMC) method that proved to be able to yield exact results on a wide variety of benchmark molecules and simple solids. In this CAREER proposal, the Rubenstein Group aims to extend this technique to the study of heavier materials, including iron oxide, nickel oxide, vanadium oxide, and chromium triiodide, whose finite temperature electronic phase transitions have yet to be fully understood, while also developing a set of novel supporting mean field, selected CI (configuration interaction), and sampling techniques. These will not only improve FT-AFQMC?s performance, but can also serve as cheaper, stand-alone methods in their own right.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will develop a novel method for filler selection based on a combination of human and machine measures of facial similarity.<br/><br/>The project builds upon a new paradigm for the design and conduct of lineups for eyewitness identification. Drawing upon perceptual scaling, well-established in sensory psychology, this approach will be used to estimate the strength of eyewitness memories, and thus to generate large libraries of facial images in which the degree of facial similarity is quantified. This research will help to reduce susceptibility of the eyewitness to decision bias and will provide quantitative measures of the perceived similarity of faces. These measures, in combination with a machine learning algorithm, will be used to create a model witness, which is an algorithm that reproduces similarity judgements of human observers and predicts perceptual similarity for new faces.

Current point-of-care testing (POCT) technologies are inexpensive and easy to use, store, and transport. However, their simplicity causes a significant loss of sensitivity and specificity comparing to lab based diagnostic tests. The major goal of this NSF CAREER research program is to develop a new nanopore testing technology to enable ultrasensitive detection of infectious diseases at a reasonably low cost. Upon the successful completion of this project, the proposed nanopore test will meet the urgent need for a POCT technology with accuracy that exceeds current POCTs or even lab-based testing technologies. This platform technology presents great potential for changing the current paradigm of POCT for existing infectious diseases.  Also, it can be readily modified with minimal optimization as soon as new diseases and biomarkers are identified for rapid deployment in clinics and at the point of care. This project also includes education and outreach activities, such as organizing a summer research workshop and internship for high school students on the fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering and Nanotechnology, broadly presenting our research to local communities, and starting an infectious disease research symposium that brings an additional synergy among local clinicians, biomedical engineers, and scientists. Special attention will be given to students from underrepresented groups and first-generation college students, who constitute a significant part of our student population. This CAREER program should result in achievement awards and authorships on research publications for undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>In the era of personalized medicine, rapid and accurate quantification of multiple biomarkers at the point-of-care is fundamental to a successful control and management of infectious disease outbreaks. Classical point-of-care testing (POCT) technologies are inexpensive and easy to use, store, and transport. But their simplicity causes a significant loss of sensitivity and specificity comparing to lab based in vitro diagnostics. The nanopore technology is a promising alternative because of its single-molecule analysis capacity, portability, and low cost. However, existing nanopore technologies are not suitable for detecting analytes in complex human samples, can only analyze charged biomarkers of certain sizes, and are not device compatible. The major goal of this CAREER program is to develop a next generation nanopore biosensor to enable ultrasensitive detection and quantification of multiple infectious disease biomarkers from human blood at the point of care. The program has three research objectives: (1) Develop and optimize a nanopore biosensor with unprecedented sensitivity, robustness, and reproducibility for various purposes; (2) Enable sensitive and specific biomarker detection by automated immunoprecipitation and novel signal transduction mechanisms; (3) Demonstrate ultrasensitive multiplex quantification of circulating proteomics biomarkers and its applications in infectious disease diagnosis and prognosis. Proposed approach has several innovative elements: several amplification methods are employed to achieve the sub-femtomolar level detection limit; special single strand DNA structures are used as detection surrogates for biomarkers, so that the readout signal can be easily differentiated from other biomolecules to prevent false-positives; an integrated microfluidic automatic immunoprecipitation module can reduce sample-to-answer time and human errors in the assay protocol.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The great potential of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has not yet been fully utilized in this domain due to the lack of holistic, resilient, flexible, and cost-effective monitoring protocols. This project will develop UAS-based fire management strategies to use autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an optimal, efficient, and safe way to assist the first responders during the fire detection, management, and evacuation stages. The project is a collaborative effort between Northern Arizona University (NAU), Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech), Desert Research Institute (DRI), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The team has established ongoing collaborations with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in Pacific Northwest Research Station, Kaibab National Forest (NF), and Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management to perform multiple field tests during the prescribed and managed fires. This proposal's objective is to develop an integrated framework satisfying unmet wildland fire management needs, with key advances in scientific and engineering methods by using a network of low-cost and small autonomous UAVs along with ground vehicles during different stages of fire management operations including: (i) early detection in remote and forest areas using autonomous UAVs; (ii) fast active geo-mapping of the fire heat map on flying drones; (iii) real-time video streaming of the fire spread; and (iv) finding optimal evacuation paths using autonomous UAVs to guide the ground vehicles and firefighters for fast and safe evacuation. <br/><br/>This project will advance the frontier of disaster management by developing: (i) an innovative drone-based forest fire detection and monitoring technology for rapid intervention in hard-to-access areas with minimal human intervention to protect firefighter lives; (ii) multi-level fire modeling to offer strategic, event-scale, and new on-board, low-computation tactics using fast fire mapping from UAVs; and (iii) a bounded reasoning-based planning mechanism where the UAVs identify the fastest and safest evacuation roads for firefighters and fire-trucks in highly dynamic and uncertain dangerous zones. The developed technologies will be translational to a broad range of applications such as disaster (flooding, fire, mud slides, terrorism) management, where quick search, surveillance, and responses are required with limited human interventions.

To work toward societal equity, mathematics teachers have shown increased interest in both improving students? achievement and supporting students? ability to use mathematics to analyze these inequities to create change. For instance, a mathematics task may use rate, ratio, and proportion to explore the gender wage gap, and then use functions to explore disparities in earnings over time.  Few resources, such as textbooks, coaching protocols, or video examples of classroom teaching, however, exist to support mathematics teachers? efforts to teach the mathematics content while investigating relevant social issues. In addition, research indicates several dilemmas teachers face in maintaining the cognitive demand of the task, addressing state standards, and improving student agency through such investigations. Research is needed to understand how teachers learn to adapt and implement mathematics tasks that facilitate students? mathematics learning and investigation of social issues. This project team partners with the mathematics department of one urban public charter high school that serves 65% students of color (most of whom identify as African American). At the school, 70% of all students qualify for free or reduced lunch, and 25% of the students have Individualized Education Plans. This project investigates: 1) how mathematics teachers learn to teach the mathematics content through investigation of relevant social issues, 2) how teachers negotiate classroom dilemmas related to this approach, and 3) how students feel about mathematics and their ability to enact change toward an equitable society. The professional development will be co-designed with mathematics teacher leaders from the school and the research team and will last three years. Teachers will invite students to become advisory board members to center students? voices and solicit feedback about the relevance of the social issues embedded in the tasks. Classroom videos will be captured to share on a project website for use by mathematics teacher educators and professional development providers. The website will also host mathematics tasks designed through this project for teachers? use in their own classrooms. This is a Faculty Early Career Development Program project responsive to a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. It is funded by the Discovery Research K-12 program, which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. <br/><br/>This qualitative, participatory design study partners with the mathematics department to investigate the following research questions: (1) How do teachers learn to adapt mathematics tasks to make them cognitively demanding and socially relevant for their students? How do contextual factors (e.g., specific school context/location/history, student backgrounds, teacher backgrounds, such as race and class) influence teacher learning? (2) What dilemmas become salient and how do teachers negotiate them while implementing the tasks? (3) How do these tasks improve students? attitudes about mathematics and feelings of empowerment?  In the first year, the research team and two mathematics teacher leaders from the school will co-design the professional development experience focused on designing and implementing mathematics tasks grounded in issues that are socially relevant to students. In years 2-4, the mathematics department will engage in this professional development, with continual input from teacher participants. Participants will create student advisory boards who will offer feedback to teachers about the relevance of the mathematics tasks. Participants will video tape their own classrooms to share brief vignettes (5-8 minutes long) that highlight dilemmas and/or successes for video club sessions as part of the professional development series. Video club sessions offer opportunities to discuss challenges and successes with colleagues and offer peer support. These video clips will also become video case studies, along with the mathematics task and teacher reflections, for use by mathematics teacher educators and professional development providers through a project website. In addition, years 3-4 the project team will develop four detailed classroom case studies, accompanied with coaching support from the research team. To answer research questions 1 and 2 regarding teacher learning and dilemmas, teachers? perspectives will be captured through professional development artifacts, coaching debriefs, teachers? written reflections, and one-on-one semi structured interviews. To answer research question 3 regarding student agency and attitudes about mathematics, student sentiments will be explored through student work, open-ended surveys, and focus group interviews with eight focal students per classroom case study. A project website will share mathematics tasks and video cases with the broader community of mathematics educators. Through distribution of such materials, the project aims to offer much-needed resources and supports for mathematics teachers to use cognitively demanding and socially relevant mathematics tasks with their students. The project will also publish peer-reviewed research articles to share findings with the field.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

These model systems can be extremely versatile, yet straightforward probes for comprehending the complicated mechanistic details that govern oxygen mediated reactivities in biology. Dr. Wijeratne and his team will utilize these powerful tools in shedding light on yet unknown knowledge that can lead to pathways for efficient syntheses of complex molecules, and the discovery of catalysts that can enhance the efficiency of catalysts of oxygen reduction benefiting alternative energy applications. This work will involve bio-inspired design and synthesis of fresh model systems that combine organic and inorganic synthetic toolkits, and analyses of reactivities that draw parallels to biological functionalities. As well, a broad variety of cryogenic spectroscopic tools will be employed, offering a uniquely specialized skillset to contributing high-school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. Outreach and educational aspects of this project will involve the orientation of Birmingham City high school students toward Regional Science Fair via a newly designed Science Club program. Proposed efforts will strive to bridge the gap of scientific literacy of youngsters in the City of Birmingham, which is one of the most income-segregated school districts in the country.   <br/><br/>Heme-containing dioxygenases play pivotal roles in human physiology, disease progression, and aging, consequently attracting substantial research interests within the past decade. However, exact mechanistic details concerning these are only faintly understood. Heme superoxide adducts are presumed to be active oxidants in heme dioxygenases, however, details pertaining to their definitive involvement in the actual enzymatic mechanism remain elusive. Synthetic model systems have long-served as powerful tools in addressing such mechanistic ambiguities, but synthetic heme superoxide adducts are often found to be sluggish oxidants. This anomaly calls for revaluation of explicit modeling of synthetic systems with direct relevance to their biological mode of action. Comprehension of mechanistic details of such model systems can also be of direct benefit for the design of superior synthetic methodologies targeting important complex organic molecules and homogeneous dioxygen reduction catalysts to be used in alternative energy applications. Proposed research will address this gap in knowledge by generating a library of synthetic heme superoxide model systems with divergent structural properties, and thorough investigation into how such structural modulations would influence their reactivity signatures. This work will vertically advance the fundamental understanding of reactivity-governing geometric, electronic, and non-covalent structural properties of mid-valent heme-oxygen intermediates, introducing a new era of heme-oxygen model chemistry.

The skeleton is a common site for breast cancer metastasis, which causes bone loss, fragility, and ultimately fractures. However, current therapies do not address bone health. Mechanical signals, which occur during daily physical activity, are well-known to improve to bone health, and they may also be protective against tumor-induced bone disease.  The working hypothesis of this award is that osteocytes are the key to a better scientific understanding of the causes and treatments of tumor-induced bone disease. Specifically, this work will evaluate if bone metastatic breast cancer causes a dysfunctional osteocyte response to mechanical signals, which causes bone loss. The results from this project will expand basic knowledge about the role of both mechanical cues and osteocytes in metastatic cancer. This award also exemplifies interdisciplinary research. The Educational Objective is to train a diverse Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics workforce.  Undergraduate researchers from under-represented groups will gain and leverage research skills critical to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics careers through formalized training.  This training will include targeted professional development and team-based interdisciplinary projects, which will expand career possibilities for engineers in under-represented groups.<br/><br/>To test the working hypothesis, this award will examine the impacts of: 1) breast cancer bone metastasis on bone remodeling mechanisms that are osteocyte-directed and mechanically-regulated, 2) mechanical loading applied to breast cancer cells on the mechanoresponse of osteocytes, and 3) breast cancer subtype on osteocyte mechanoresponse. This research capitalizes on the innovative in vitro/in vivo experimental approaches pioneered by the Principal Investigator. In vivo, controlled mechanical loading will be applied to mouse models of breast cancer bone metastasis. In vitro, osteocytes will be cultured in 3-dimensions and subjected to multiple mechanical cues (fluid flow and matrix deformation) ? an advancement over the most commonly used 2-dimension-flow only platforms. In aggregate, results from this research will transform current understanding of bone metastasis by establishing that bone metastatic tumor cells interfere with the mechanoresponse of osteocytes, which is a new mechanism contributing to tumor-induced bone disease and fragility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reliable simulations of how strongly correlated systems interact with light are crucial for understanding light-harvesting in photosynthesis, advancing technologies for solar energy conversion, and developing new photoactive materials with desired properties. However, available theoretical methods are unsatisfactory for simulating spectroscopic properties of strongly correlated systems due to limitations in their computational efficiency or accuracy.

All methods being developed by the Sokolov group will be implemented in a freely available and open-source computer program. The Sokolov group also develops hands-on, free, and publicly available computational lecture materials for use in undergraduate physical chemistry courses.

The emergence of vertebrate animals from water onto land was one of the major transitions of vertebrate evolution. For many living amphibians, this historical transition is mirrored by a current developmental transition, as they metamorphose from an aquatic larva to a terrestrial juvenile. Like other sensory systems, the olfactory system must be able to adjust and function in both environments across this developmental transition. This project breaks new ground by examining olfactory morphology and gene expression patterns across eight related salamander species with a wide range of life histories, ranging from typical larvae with metamorphosis, to direct development with no free-living larval stage, to secondarily re-evolved larvae. The study will answer the following questions: (1) Are patterns of olfactory organization consistent across species with the same developmental mode, regardless of evolutionary history? (2) Are water-sensing olfactory components lost in terrestrial, direct-developing species? (3) Do species that have re-evolved a larval period regain water-sensing olfactory components? This work will take place at Humboldt State University, an Hispanic Serving Institution located on the rural northern coast of California. It will directly support 15-20 undergraduate and two graduate students in hands-on research, enhancing their skills and thereby furthering their careers and job prospects. The research will be integrated into classes, benefitting approximately 300 students per year. A public outreach component will involve lectures to local community members, increasing scientific literacy on evolution and development and promoting appreciation for this understudied group of vertebrates.<br/><br/>This project will examine how the evolution of alternative developmental modes impacts olfactory system structure and function in the most speciose family of salamanders, the plethodontid or lungless salamanders. Olfactory morphology and gene expression patterns of eight plethodontid species and one outgroup species that span a wide range of developmental modes will be examined. Techniques used will include traditional histology to compare the basic structure of the olfactory organs, transmission and scanning electron microscopy to establish morphological classes of olfactory receptor neurons and supporting cells, microCT scanning and 3-D reconstruction to provide a visual image of overall olfactory organ anatomy, neuronal tracing to establish pathways of olfactory receptor neuron connection to the brain, and protein and mRNA localization of olfactory marker genes. This work will for the first time elucidate patterns of olfactory evolution with respect to olfaction in water and air, in larvae and adults, within an explicit phylogenetic framework.

The great potential of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has not yet been fully utilized in this domain due to the lack of holistic, resilient, flexible, and cost-effective monitoring protocols. This project will develop UAS-based fire management strategies to use autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an optimal, efficient, and safe way to assist the first responders during the fire detection, management, and evacuation stages. The project is a collaborative effort between Northern Arizona University (NAU), Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech), Desert Research Institute (DRI), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The team has established ongoing collaborations with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in Pacific Northwest Research Station, Kaibab National Forest (NF), and Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management to perform multiple field tests during the prescribed and managed fires. This proposal's objective is to develop an integrated framework satisfying unmet wildland fire management needs, with key advances in scientific and engineering methods by using a network of low-cost and small autonomous UAVs along with ground vehicles during different stages of fire management operations including: (i) early detection in remote and forest areas using autonomous UAVs; (ii) fast active geo-mapping of the fire heat map on flying drones; (iii) real-time video streaming of the fire spread; and (iv) finding optimal evacuation paths using autonomous UAVs to guide the ground vehicles and firefighters for fast and safe evacuation. <br/><br/>This project will advance the frontier of disaster management by developing: (i) an innovative drone-based forest fire detection and monitoring technology for rapid intervention in hard-to-access areas with minimal human intervention to protect firefighter lives; (ii) multi-level fire modeling to offer strategic, event-scale, and new on-board, low-computation tactics using fast fire mapping from UAVs; and (iii) a bounded reasoning-based planning mechanism where the UAVs identify the fastest and safest evacuation roads for firefighters and fire-trucks in highly dynamic and uncertain dangerous zones. The developed technologies will be translational to a broad range of applications such as disaster (flooding, fire, mud slides, terrorism) management, where quick search, surveillance, and responses are required with limited human interventions.

We emphasize the generation of high quality research and integration of psychological and neuroscientific theory with the design, execution, and interpretation of data. We select ten students annually for mentored research projects, especially undergraduates from ethnic-minority serving, public two-year and four-year institutions in the New York metropolitan area. Students also attend weekly didactics: a seminar that focuses on research methods, data analysis, statistical reasoning, and professional issues/career development and a journal club that familiarizes students with scientific literature. To enable students to address ethical issues that arise in research environments, we train students in key ethical guidelines and regulations based on the work of ethics experts. As a capstone experience, students present a first-authored poster at the BC Science Research Day, where they compete for awards based on the quality of their work and ability to communicate their findings. Many of our students work with their mentors to publish their results in peer-reviewed journals. We also host a data-driven mentor training presentation and student-mentor discussion panel in order to facilitate strong mentor-mentee relationships, increase mentor-mentee dialogue, and further motivate REU students to pursue STEM careers.

It will measure the returns to Medicare spending and Environmental Protection Agency regulation of fine particulate air pollution in terms of the number of premature deaths avoided, extension of life years, and private economic benefits. These measures are obtained by applying the latest economic theory and measurement methods to data on Americans 65 year and above over from 1999 through 2013 period. The research will also study how air quality regulation affects racial, income, and gender groups differently.  This study therefore provides information on how best to improve the health of older citizens in the US. The findings will inform policy makers about the  efficiency and fairness of different public expenditures used to improve the health of the elderly. The results also will yield insights on how public expenditures could be adjusted to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in pollution exposure and life expectancy.  The results of this research will help to develop better policies to improve the health of US citizens generally and thus contribute to US?s economic growth.<br/><br/>This project will generate novel estimates of marginal survival benefits of Medicare spending, marginal survival benefits of long-term reduction in fine particulate air pollution, and individuals? willingness to pay for increased survival probabilities. The project will show whether and how these estimates differ by age, sex, health, and socioeconomic status. The econometric analysis will use an instrumental variable approach to estimate survival functions that leverages spatial and temporal variation in medical treatment style and regulation of air pollution. The data used to implement this approach are constructed by linking federal administrative records to surveys of a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. The results will show the relative efficacy in reducing mortality through Medicare spending and regulating air pollution, and these efficacy measures will be converted into dollars using an economic model of individuals? expected utility-maximizing medical spending decisions.

Denmark at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will conduct research to develop new methods for selective difunctionalizations of alkenes. Addition to alkenes and other unsaturated compounds is among the oldest and most reliable transformations in organic chemistry. However, controlling reaction selectivity remains a challenge. The growing number of complex natural products, pharmaceutical, and agrochemical compounds containing vicinal nitrogen and oxygen atoms at stereogenic centers underscores this critical deficiency in synthetic methodology. This proposal addresses the challenges inherent in the design of enantioselective difunctionalization processes through a mechanismbased approach. The research activities planned are ideal for the intellectual and practical training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral coworkers. The interplay of reaction design, development and application represent the essence of the scientific method. Students are presented with hypotheses for the outcome of planned experiments and they must learn to collect and interpret data to substantiate or eliminate the hypothesis. The unifying theme of this activity is the invention of new chemical reactions that challenge current thinking. An undergraduate intern under the auspices of the St. Elmo Brady Summer Research Scholars Program at UIUC will be supported. This program is a 10-week summer research experience for underrepresented minority students (African American, Hispanic, Native Americans) from Historically Black Colleges at the University the Illinois Chemistry Department to encourage future enrollment in the PhD program.<br/> <br/><br/>Countless reactions have been introduced to effect regio, diastereo and enantioselective functionalization of double bonds with good generality. However, the vast majority of the existing methods employ transition metal catalysis such as dihydroxylation and aminohydroxylation (osmium), and diamination (palladium, copper). Despite the undeniable utility of these methods, they are rarely employed industrially in view of the challenges associated with metal contamination. This proposal aims to provide an alternative approach that is rooted in Main Group redox catalysis the advantages of which include ability to use innocent oxidants to drive the catalytic cycle and the high affinity of Se(II) reagents for carbon-carbon double bonds. The actionable roadmap to achieve this goal is to construct the mechanistic/physical organic foundation for the development of generally applicable and highly selective alkene difunctionalization. The overall objective is divided into three Specific Aims of this project: (1) catalytic, enantioselective syn-1,2-diamination, (2) catalytic, enantioselective syn-1,2-oxyamination and (3) catalytic, enantioselective syn-1,2-carboamination. For each Specific Aim, the team will: (1) carry out detailed mechanistic (kinetic, spectroscopic, crystallographic, computational) investigations of the catalytic reactions to learn the rules for achieving high catalytic activity (turnover frequency and turnover number) for the target reactions (2) design chiral catalysts that will impart high stereoselectivity and high chemical conversion for the introduction of new stereocenters, and (3) demonstrate generality in a variety of substrate classes that represent broadly useful structural motifs.

Despite a vast scientific and policy literature arguing that sustainable fisheries are achievable through scientific models and management frameworks, the health of global fisheries continues to decline. This suggests that there may be something fundamentally wrong with the way we have tried to analyze, understand, and manage fishing. This project examines an overlooked but critical factor in the overfishing crisis: the false belief that fisheries are inexhaustible, meaning they can be harvested at contemporary rates indefinitely, year after year, without risk of collapse. The resulting dissertation will: 1) document the history of inexhaustibility and show how resistance to the idea of dwindling fish stocks has taken different forms over the centuries; 2) examine what propels belief in inexhaustible seas; and 3) suggest how its influence might be mitigated to allow for the development of more effective and resilient fisheries management strategies. <br/><br/>This project finds surprising continuities over a hundred and fifty years of history. Preliminary results from archival research methods show that inexhaustibility appears in diverse forms over time but for similar reasons, including 1) overconfidence in quantitative science and free markets to simplify and solve complex environmental and social problems; 2) failure to account for observed fluctuations in fish populations that may make predictable and sustainable annual catches very difficult in the long term; and 3) an inertia generated by existing models, areas of focus, and management strategies that precludes new ways of thinking. Drawing on historian Thomas Hughes? notion of technological momentum, this project suggests that the idea of inexhaustibility has had sufficient intellectual momentum that it has proved nearly impossible to dislodge, even in the face of volumes of refuting empirical evidence. Through publications, op-eds, forums, round-table discussions, and oral histories deposited in the NOAA Voices archive, this project will engage scientists, policy-makers, environmentalists, and workers in the fishing industry in rethinking fisheries science to adapt to the reality of an exhaustible?and increasingly exhausted?sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, data is being produced at a huge rate today, and an algorithm's access to it is restricted either due to sheer volume or due to ownership concerns. This forces designers to revisit classical algorithms. In machine learning, one uses clustering algorithms to learn about unlabeled data. However, the presence of noise and anomalies can distort this, and one needs good outlier-detection algorithms. The goal of this project is to use and enhance techniques from mathematical optimization to tackle these new algorithmic challenges. In doing so, the project will create unified methodologies to attack problems arising in different areas. In turn, these news ideas will also lead to answers to classical optimization problems. Work on this project will go hand-in-hand with the creation of relevant courses in undergraduate and graduate curriculum which focus on these new algorithmic insights. The educational component of this project also includes a plan for injecting computer science and algorithmic thinking into the K-12 system.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the project focusses on three areas. The first area is about query access models where algorithms can access data only via asking certain kinds of questions.  A main thrust is to completely understand the query complexity of fundamental problems such as submodular function optimization and matroid intersection.  The second area is the development of new approximation-algorithm techniques to tackle outlier-detection problems in clustering. The project will also focus on richer objective classes for clustering, thereby paving the way for integer convex optimization. The third area is the development of the primal-dual optimization schema to design faster parallel algorithms, especially for perfect matchings in graphs, which is a fundamental problem in algorithms. By addressing these questions, this project will create new algorithmic paradigms that will be useful for tackling a range of modern-day relevant problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From satellite imagery, to genetic data, to web content, richer datasets offer  the promise of improved data-driven discovery and decision making across science, engineering, and industry. Realizing this promise, however, requires enormous computational effort. The goal of this project is to democratize the data revolution by developing new algorithms to efficiently process the world's largest datasets, without the need for the world's largest supercomputers. To do so, the investigator and his team will study a powerful algorithmic technique known as ""matrix sketching"". The key idea is to quickly compress a large dataset (represented as a matrix of numbers) down to its most essential information by eliminating redundancy and noise. The compressed data can then be efficiently digested by downstream algorithms for machine learning and statistical inference. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in matrix sketching by taking an interdisciplinary approach, combining tools from theoretical computer science with methods from computational and applied mathematics. The project also involves a major educational component, aimed at improving U.S. mathematics education through closer ties with applications in STEM fields. The project will support an international high-school applied-mathematics competition, the development of curricular material and workshops for high-school educators, and course development to better prepare university students for careers in algorithms, machine learning, and data science. <br/><br/>To advance research in matrix sketching, the project is centered around three main objectives, each involving problems of practical importance, as well as motivating theoretical questions that will more broadly impact algorithms research. The first objective is to develop sketching techniques that move beyond low-rank matrix compression, which only captures information about the largest-magnitude components of a matrix?s spectrum. Motivated by emerging applications in network science, deep learning, and computational physics, the research team is developing techniques that instead capture coarse information about the entire spectrum of a matrix. The second objective is to develop methods that allow for higher accuracy by combining existing sketching algorithms with powerful tools for interactive refinement. The goal is to design algorithms with runtimes that depend logarithmically, instead of polynomially, on problem accuracy. The final objective is to extend the impact of sketching beyond applications where data is over-abundant, by addressing important problems where sufficient, high-quality data remains a luxury. The theoretical tools of matrix sketching and data subsampling are being used to design smarter data-collection strategies for the ?small-data? regime, advancing the state-of-the-art in active learning and experimental design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Negative interactions, such as aggression, with closely-related species could prevent a species from expanding its range. If so, traits that enable a species to avoid negative interactions should be associated with range expansion. This prediction will be tested, for the first time, using a widespread species of dragonfly that shows extraordinary variation in wing coloration ? so much so that it was once thought to be multiple species. Dark-winged individuals experience much lower levels of interference from closely-related species than do light-winged individuals. This system provides an unparalleled opportunity to advance understanding of how negative interactions between species affect species distributions. As species? ranges shift in response to climate change, some species will interact with close relatives that they have not encountered previously. The results of this project could help predict the outcome of those interactions and, therefore, species distributions in the future. The project includes collaborations with researchers in the U.K. and Latin America and will provide field, lab and computational research training for students. A Spanish-language version of an existing citizen science initiative will be launched to expand engagement with the public.<br/><br/>Building on well over a decade of research on the evolutionary causes and consequences of reproductive and aggressive interference in rubyspot damselflies (Hetaerina spp.), this project tackles the question of how adaptations that reduce interspecific interference affect range expansion. The focal species, H. titia, varies in wing coloration both seasonally and geographically. To understand why this species? wing coloration changes seasonally, a series of field experiments will be carried out to distinguish among alternative evolutionary trade-off hypotheses. To distinguish among alternative scenarios for the origin and loss of the seasonal color change, phylogenetic relationships among populations throughout the species? range will be reconstructed using whole-genome data. To further clarify how the seasonal color change evolved, multivariate phylogenetic trait evolution models will be fit to a range-wide phenotypic dataset. Finally, to test the range expansion prediction, coalescence models will be used to compare rates of diversification and historical demography among H. titia populations and between H. titia and four congeners. This project will also produce the first range-wide intraspecific phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of a polyphenic trait, and new genomic resources for rubyspot damselflies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this spectral region, virtually all molecules exhibit absorption resonances, and these resonances constitute molecular fingerprints. Accordingly, for around the past hundred years, MIR light has been used for sensing, with recent applications ranging from environmental monitoring to protein characterization. In the past few decades, there have been revolutionary advances in ultrafast MIR laser sources, that is, laser systems producing brief pulses of MIR light. Such ultrafast MIR sources offer new, exciting opportunities for enhancing MIR sensing technologies. The first goal of this project is to develop novel detectors specifically tailored for ultrafast MIR laser sources. These detectors will enable the measurement of light fields of MIR laser pulses in the time-domain. Such field-resolving detectors will enable MIR sensing with improved resolution, as well as provide novel capabilities to study the dynamic behavior of MIR absorption resonances. The second goal of this project is to promote engineering education engineering student retention. Towards this end, online educational content will be developed for graduate students working with ultrafast laser technology; novel educational strategies emphasizing the ?we do? component of the gradual release of responsibility pedagogical model will be explored at the undergraduate level; and outreach events, promoting engineering and photonics, will be held for local students at the K-12 level. At all levels, the underlying themes of the research program will be integrated into the educational efforts. <br/><br/>Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is ubiquitous in sensing applications across virtually all scientific disciplines. MIR spectroscopic tools primarily rely on frequency-domain techniques: in a MIR spectroscopic system, infrared light illuminates a sample, and the frequency spectrum of the transmitted light is measured. Absorption resonances are then extracted from the measured spectrum, and information about the sample is thereby obtained. In contrast to conventional MIR spectroscopy, at longer wavelengths, ultrafast laser systems have enabled time-domain spectroscopic techniques. For instance, in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, terahertz waves irradiate a sample, and ultrafast laser pulses are used to measure the time-dependent electric field of the transmitted terahertz radiation. Such field-resolved measurements can provide unique, dynamical information as well as dramatically improved resolution compared to frequency-domain techniques. The goal of this project is to extend such time-domain, field-resolved detection to chip-scale platforms operating in the MIR. Specifically, in this project, chip-scale, optical detectors capable of resolving the instantaneous electric field of incident ultrafast MIR laser pulses will be developed. These chip-scale detectors will leverage sub-optical-cycle, strong-field photoemission currents from nanoscale metallic antennas to sample MIR laser pulses in the time-domain with exceptional resolution. These field-resolving detectors will provide revolutionary capabilities for future MIR spectroscopic systems and impact a broad range of scientific, medical, and industrial applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be achieved by combining low-radiation images of bone damage with mechanical testing of bones and machine learning.  This is important because fatigue (cyclic) fracture is a prevalent failure mechanism in nearly all engineered structures, but its relevance to the field of bone tissues has been neglected. These fatigue fractures are common in young athletes, especially in dancers. These fractures are also common in those who have bone fragility.  For example, aged and diabetic bones have poor collagen quality and become fragile.  Fractures are often thought to be the result of a single overload event, such as a fall. However, this may not explain the cause of all catastrophic fractures because it overlooks the role of fatigue from daily activities.  This research project will develop novel dynamic imaging and machine learning for capturing the origins of bone failure mechanisms and associated risk factors. The results will ultimately be used to prevent fragility fractures. This research will provide a transferrable methodological framework for medical imaging, and foster the development of new fracture-resistant materials inspired by biological design principles. The research will be integrated into a long-term educational plan to attract the next generation of female engineers through dance class and other creative learning supports.  It is of note that female engineering students in Utah, where this work will be done, are particularly underrepresented in comparison to the rest of the United States. <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to advance the development of new bone fracture mechanics theory by using a novel synthesis of synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography and specific machine learning algorithms to capture the 3D damage evolution during mechanical loading. Previous work has shown that this is typically not achievable by standard synchrotron micro-computed tomography imaging, which involves high radiation doses and causes deterioration of tissue?s mechanical properties. The research work will test the hypothesis that collagen cross-linking accumulation and other diabetic changes in bone quality play an important role in driving fragility fractures. The research tasks of this project include: (i) determine the (sole) effect of collagen cross-linking accumulation on fatigue and fracture resistance ; (ii) evaluate the contribution of collagen cross-linking accumulation in diabetic bone resistance compared with other bone quality factors; (iii) quantify the microscale failure mechanisms in deforming diabetic and crosslinking-rich bones during in situ fatigue and fracture tests; and (iv) evaluate whether cyclic loadings might drive a significant fraction of fractures in diabetic and crosslinking-rich bones. This project can reveal the origins of damage mechanisms in all types of collagenous tissues, and has the potential to lower the radiation level and improve image quality of medical scans. This new knowledge will establish the PI?s long-term career in bone fracture mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Work with AVs has been dominated by utilitarian models both in algorithms and framing public surveys regarding AVs. However, due to methodological issues and a pronounced resistance of the general public towards utilitarian thinking, there is a need to offer alternative approaches that adequately capture the flexibility of human moral judgment and decision making. This project utilizes the Agent-Deed-Consequence (ADC) model and research on human moral decision making to revolutionize the development of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the use of virtual reality (VR) and simulations. The project aims to improve high-school and college education, interdisciplinary scientific research, and transportation engineering by partnering with the NC State University Libraries? Virtual Reality Lab, NC State?s Institute for Transportation Research and Education (ITRE), Professional Engineers of North Carolina (PENC), and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). It contributes to (i) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; (ii) increased participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in research; (iii) improved Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and educator development; and (iv) improved well-being of individuals in society.<br/><br/>The ADC model draws on insights from ethics, experimental philosophy, social psychology and decision neuroscience to explain moral judgments and decisions by breaking them down into positive or negative intuitive evaluations concerning the Agent, the Deed, and the Consequence, and designating them as ?high-? or ?low-stakes? in any given situation. These intuitive evaluations combine to produce a positive or negative judgment of moral acceptability. For example, the overall moral judgment in a situation in which someone committed a deed that is judged as negative (e.g., changing lanes on a full line) would be mitigated if the agent had good intentions (e.g., circumventing a hazard) and the consequences were good (e.g., an accident was avoided). The ADC model provides formulas for representing such situations (e.g., [A+], [D-] & [C+] = [MJ+] or positive moral judgment). This project develops new moral situations about potentially harmful decisions involving traffic, including vehicles and pedestrians, and tests moral judgment on samples of high-school students, professional moral philosophers, and lay people with no formal training in ethics. The moral situations are programmed and recorded as animations in an immersive VR setting, and tested in populations of high school and college students as well as ethicists. The project culminates with a prototype ethical algorithm based on the ADC model which interacts with human decision makers in a simulated visual environment in the high-fidelity traffic simulator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, it plans to increase the number of STEM undergraduates who decide to pursue teaching careers.  These emerging teachers will develop skills in culturally responsive teaching and asset-based perspectives to increase their effectiveness as teachers in high-need school districts.  The project centers on supporting a pathway for community college STEM students to transfer to a four-year institution, complete their STEM baccalaureate degrees, and enter a STEM teacher preparation program. This pathway is intended to increase the number and diversity of highly qualified secondary STEM teachers, including individuals from low-income, first-generation, and/or military service backgrounds. The project will provide service-learning and STEM-based community activities to encourage STEM majors to explore teaching as a career. These activities will also form the foundation of a learning community in which preservice and new in-service STEM teachers can share and receive support. <br/><br/>This project at Sacred Heart University includes partnerships with Housatonic Community College and Ansonia, Bridgeport, and Stratford Public Schools. The project goal is to increase the number of highly qualified STEM teachers and their effectiveness in high need schools. Over the five-year project, 18 biology, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science majors will earn bachelor?s degrees followed by a fifth year in which they will earn teacher certification in Connecticut and the state-required Master of Arts in Teaching. Individual Noyce Scholars may receive up to three years of support and will be required to serve as a classroom teacher in a high-need school district for two years for each of the scholarship years received. The project aims to develop the Scholars? professional identities as highly effective STEM educators, enhance programming in culturally responsive pedagogy, and emphasize the importance of viewing high-need school populations through a strength-based lens. A longitudinal study will investigate the impact of increased familiarity with high-need communities on students? assumptions about teaching in low-income urban schools.  It will also examine the impacts of an undergraduate seminar and extensive field experiences on students? intercultural competence. The project team expects to disseminate evidence regarding the developed curriculum, the efficacy of preparing preservice teachers in cultural competency, the value of service-learning, and the success of mentorship for novice teachers. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Prejudice, discrimination especially aimed at minority manger, and racial and cultural barriers keep productive people out of, or decrease their effectiveness in, the labor market. Besides human costs, this mis-allocation of talent can slow economic growth, thus preventing countries from achieving their potential to improve the welfare of citizens as well as broaden opportunities for under-represented groups and prevent the development of entrepreneurial talent in low income areas where upward mobility may depend on entrepreneurship.  The focus of this study is on a specific type of discrimination: employees? discrimination against minority employers and supervisors.  This will be one of the few studies that uses an innovative approach to study discrimination from below.  The findings of this study will be helpful in understanding the extent to which discrimination from subordinate workers thwart the upward mobility of minority groups. It will inform on policies to reduce discrimination in the workplace and provide equal opportunity for all.<br/><br/>This project aims to answer three main questions: (i) Do minority employers and supervisors face discrimination from below in labor markets? (ii) What are the underlying motivations?; and (iii) What are the economic consequences of such discrimination from below? This research will use two field experiments to test for the presence of bottom-up discrimination, and study its economic consequences for minorities in the labor market. This research makes some contributions to the growing empirical literature on the economics of discrimination. This is the first study to provide experimental evidence on discrimination from below in real world field setting. Second, unlike most field experiments on discrimination in labor markets, the experimental design allows for an analysis of the underlying motivations for discrimination from below.  The results of this research has important policy implications to decrease labor market discrimination and improve the efficiency of labor markets and thus increase economic outcomes.  In addition to economic growth, the results of this research project has the potential to provide inputs into policies to decrease inequality as well as expand entrepreneurial and managerial opportunities for under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GFM calculates how much water each global melt basin is contributing to urban coastal sea-level rise. By tracking how physical processes link the Arctic with urban centers to the south, this research will test the validity of ?hydrological globalization,? an interdisciplinary social scientific concept that frames social adaptations to hydrological processes, asking whether sites physically connected through global water flow share responses in the form of discourse, policy measures, economic planning, and infrastructure development. <br/><br/>This site-based study involves ethnographic and document-based research, including interviews with government officials, scientists, industry experts tasked with scenario planning, and members of non-governmental organizations.

Culturally relevant education makes visible the value of students? diverse perspectives and experiences and may better support underserved students in STEM. While culturally relevant educational approaches are powerful, they rely on the teachers' competence in the culture of their students for implementation. The majority of those teaching in underserved communities are unlikely to share backgrounds and experiences with students from non-dominant groups. This means that teachers may be under-equipped to meaningfully implement culturally relevant practices or otherwise effectively teach students from non-dominant communities. This project aims to improve the field's understanding of how STEM teachers who come from cultural backgrounds that are different from their students, take up culturally responsive approaches. The strategy is to investigate in-service teachers? use of the Iupiaq Learning Framework?a framework developed by the Iupiat community in Arctic Alaska and centered on Iupiaq values and culture. The project is generalizing findings from this particular situation to provide a model for supporting teachers to provide culturally relevant pedagogy to students from non-dominant groups.  This is a Faculty Early Career Development Program project responsive to a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research program.<br/><br/>Project objectives will be accomplished through a series of teacher-focused professional development activities in the North Slope Borough School District in Utqia?vik, Alaska, where teachers are familiar with the Iupiaq Learning Framework. Because the majority of teachers in the district are not Native Alaskan and are from other parts of the U.S., the project is studying how they interpret, adapt, and use the framework in their classrooms. The project expands upon existing studies investigating teacher growth when Indigenous knowledge is the focus by capturing the experiences of 12 ""outsider"" teachers (defined as those who are not native Iupiat) who participate in a community-based design process. By collaborating with Iupiat community members to identify problems of interest to the community and resources to explore these problems, the project is developing place-based science inquiry activities that intersect Iupiaq culture with Western science practices. Finally, to support the implementation of the designed activities in the classroom, the same teachers are working together with students and community members in a learning community to implement and adapt the modules in their classrooms. This project is providing an account of how participation in community-based design can be used to support ""outsider"" STEM teachers in taking up classroom practices that honor community culture and values. Products of this work include a culturally relevant curriculum for Iupiat students that will be available in a curriculum repository that collects place-based materials.

Unfortunately, consumers struggle to learn what has been collected, by whom, and especially what this collection implies for their privacy. This project aims to improve data transparency and access rights by developing novel models, user interactions, and open-source privacy tools. These techniques and tools will empower consumers to protect their privacy in a data-driven world. Furthermore, the project will enhance education and outreach. The investigator will develop a pilot program for engaging early-career students in research, create a new privacy course for underprivileged high school students, and both develop and exhibit artworks designed to provoke reflection on individual privacy, by collaborating with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.<br/><br/>The project will center around the intellectual development of complementary tools that give consumers data-driven insight into (i) the huge archives companies give consumers who exercise data-access rights and (ii) the online third-party tracking ecosystem.

The project will address this challenge through formative user studies and the iterative development and evaluation of a data-access tool. In addition, the project will develop new techniques for identifying, integrating, and visualizing data archives. Second, because the raw data collected about a consumer provides only partial transparency, the project will develop new methods for communicating, in an individualized manner, inferences possible from data.

Traditionally, expensive and rare elements are employed to prepare the catalysts for small molecule conversion due to the high reactivity of the rare elements; however, these systems suffer from toxicity, low abundance, and high cost. In this project, the catalytic activity will be enhanced through the modification of molecular environment around the catalytic active site.

In addition, Professor Jiang's group will develop and maintain an interactive, open-source website for foot-of-the-wave analysis, a powerful technique for evaluating the performance of electrocatalysts. The construction of the website will start soon and be integrated into Professor Jiang's research website for easy access by the community.

Recent technological advances had a profound effect on our answers to that challenge.  They allow for rapid and cost-effective sequencing (i.e., reading) of pathogen genomes and can generate enormous amounts of data in almost real time. Genomic epidemiology is an interdisciplinary research area that uses the large-scale analysis of viral genomes to understand how viruses evolve and spread.  The methods of genomic epidemiology are currently becoming major instruments not only for research, but also for public-health decision making of broad societal importance. However, its computational toolkit is still developing, and this process faces many hard algorithmic challenges.  Some of the major problems are: (i) how to extract the whole spectrum of viral genetic diversity, including newly emerging mutations and variants, from noisy and fragmented sequencing data; (ii) how to use genomic data to investigate outbreaks and reconstruct virus-transmission networks; and (iii) how to identify highly pathogenic or transmissible viral variants. The algorithms for these problems should be accurate, reproducible, interpretable and scalable with respect to the levels of ""big data"" produced by modern sequencing platforms. Development of such algorithms and study of the corresponding algorithmic problems is exactly the goal of this project. Other major objectives are to help to bring computational genomics into high-school and undergraduate classrooms, to broaden participation in computational biology via advanced pedagogical techniques, and to facilitate training of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers, who will simultaneously possess an expertise in computer science, epidemiology, and molecular biology, and will be able to develop innovative algorithms and apply them to real-life problems.<br/><br/>This project will undertake the systematic study of fundamental computational problems of genomic epidemiology from the theoretical computer-science perspective. The overarching objective is the development of new methods based on cross-disciplinary convergence of techniques from algorithmic graph theory, network theory and mathematical (and, particularly, combinatorial) optimization. The first major specific scientific goal is the development of methods for assessment of viral genetic diversity using networks of statistically linked mutations and a graph-decomposition approach. The second goal is the development of a family of combinatorial algorithms for reconstruction of viral transmission networks using the fusion of phylogenetics and a network-theory approach to social networks relevant to infection dissemination.  The final goal is the design of scalable computational techniques for quantification of viral phenotypic diversity using combinatorial and convex optimization.  The investigator will closely collaborate with biologists and epidemiologists to ensure biomedical relevance and applicability of the developed algorithms. It is also expected that some of the new machinery will be applicable to non-biomedical problems arising in graph theory and in studies of complex networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Citation data from the earliest two academic journals will determine the link structure of the network and make the links indicative of cumulative innovation: If A cited B, then A used the existing knowledge of B to create something new. War-related turmoil in the English Channel did not obstruct bilateral exchange between all scholars. Considering each possible pair of scholars as a separate cross-sectional unit gives rise to a quasi-experimental setting. The control group contains initially unaffected pairs and the treatment group pairs those who benefited directly from the re-establishment of the cross-channel service. A new econometric approach exploits network-induced variation to estimate the effect of unobservable knowledge flows from pairs in the treatment to pairs in the control group. The average treatment effect on the treated pairs is identified by comparing the two groups' pre- to post-period changes in the linking probability. The empirical analysis requires an extensive set of geo-referenced network panel data. The data set permits the study of different research questions and testing of new methods. The results could provide inputs to design efficient intellectual property rights protection policies and thus maintain the US as the global leader in innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to investigate the chemistry of these single entities is significant because many complex systems consist of assemblies of individual parts that are not all alike. Understanding the function or behavior of the entire system often requires knowing how the individual components work. For example, it is important to know how a single leaf works in order to understand how a tree grows. Dr. Wang?s new techniques address key challenges faced by researchers studying the chemistry of nanoscopic particles using a specialized kind of microscopy. The new techniques overcome problems caused by contamination and other issues related to sample preparation, difficulty measuring especially small entities, and poor sensitivity in measuring some chemical reactions. In addition to cutting-edge research, the integrated educational activities of this work help to improve the quality and accessibility of STEM learning through the development of a new animation-based teaching module for undergraduate courses, as well as the integration of independent research projects into the undergraduate curriculum, and by engaging students from the local community through one-on-one research mentoring and virtual learning opportunities.<br/><br/>Single entity analysis is essential for understanding the fundamental dynamics of real-world systems that are often heterogeneous.

Natural polymers, such as cellulose (from wood, soybean hulls, cotton, etc.), chitosan (from the outer shell of shellfish) and alginates (from algae) are sustainable and renewable resources that are an essential component of a circular economy, aimed at minimizing waste. Combining properties of different natural polymers is a way to develop a new generation of products that may replace traditional, non-renewable fossil fuel-based materials.<br/>This project will focus on understanding, developing and using renewable, natural polymers to design efficient and sustainable adsorbents, which are highly porous structures for the removal of contaminants. Dr. Peresin proposes an extensive study of a variety of polymer systems to maximize their potential adsorption capacity for removing contaminants from water bodies in different environmental conditions. Adsorption capacity of the polymers? assemblies and their performance will be assessed using three model emerging aquatic contaminants, tetracycline (an antibiotic), ibuprofen (an analgesic) and sulfamethoxazole (an antibiotic). <br/>Dr. Peresin will use this research program as a platform for education with an impactful contribution to improving science literacy in the State of Alabama while contributing to local, national and global efforts to provide a sustainable method for cleaning drinking water. Younger generations have an increased environmental concern and awareness of the need to decrease our impact on the planet. Through her research and mentorship, Dr. Peresin hopes to advance career opportunities within the forest industry for environmentally conscience students with the development of novel processes and new products that contribute to the sustainable use of resources and economic benefit of society. This project is jointly funded by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>?<br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The overarching goals of this CAREER plan are 1) to uncover the principles that underlie the structure-property relationship between naturally occurring polysaccharides (PS) interactions, surface properties and their assembly for the design of macroscale adsorbents, 2) to use this platform to educate students on interfacial phenomena involved in cleaning water using natural resources, and 3) to contribute to global efforts to provide clean drinking water to society. Natural polymers are renewable resources, essential for the circular economy. Combining their properties is critical for developing the new generation of functional materials on lieu of traditional fossil-based materials. However, several challenges remain in order to deploy these materials, such as cost, performance and scale. The long-term research goal of this CAREER is to advance the knowledge that will enable the rational design of PS structures based on natural polymers for effective removal of emerging contaminants from drinking water. <br/>This CAREER proposal will provide a fundamental framework for elucidating the fine interplay between the composition, surface functionality, and the supramolecular structure of natural polymers, specifically PS such as cellulose and chitin, and their effect on interfacial interactions with emerging contaminants. Polymers self-assembly and their interfacial behavior have been extensively studied, however, more work is needed for understanding the correlation between the surface properties of natural PS assembly and their impact on the interfacial adsorption phenomena. During this five year CAREER award, the following hypotheses will be addressed: 1) PS interactions can be controlled by changing environmental conditions and macromolecules intrinsic properties, 2) entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding energy of PS assemblies will affect their swelling and adsorption capacity, 3) interfacial  interactions resulting from the macromolecule assembly will determine the surface energy and chemistry of the PS structures, with a direct impact on the total sorption capacity. The majority of the work will be performed on cellulose and chitin (and their derivatives) as they are ideal for this project due to their abundancy, robust chemical structural, surface area and versatile surface functionality. To test the hypothesis the PI will use a combinatory approach that involves PS assemblies and adsorption studies on 2D model surfaces. These findings then will be translated to a 3D hydrogel system, produced through a bottom-up self-assembly approach. Adsorption capacity and performance will be assessed using three model of emerging contaminants namely, tetracycline (an antibiotic), ibuprofen (an analgesic) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (an herbicide). These hypotheses will be tested with the following specific objectives 1) elucidate the nature of the PS interactions during their self-assembly; 2) understand the role of composition and surface functionality on PS assemblies swelling and supramolecular structure, 3) examine different routes for self-assembly of PS in 3D structures and 4) unveil the effects of supramolecular structure, composition and surface on the overall adsorption capacity of the PS assemblies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the heart of these breakthroughs is the design of complex, domain-specific deep neural network architectures. However, only a small set of highly-trained researchers are equipped with the resources and expertise to undertake this arduous, ad-hoc design process.  Moreover, design efforts have been largely limited to applications in a handful of domains, most notably computer vision and natural language processing. While the burgeoning field of neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate the design of neural network architectures, existing work on NAS has to date narrowly focused on these same well-studied domains. This project aims to develop, analyze, and implement novel methods that enable automated architecture design beyond these restricted domains. The project involves collaborations with practitioners in new domains to empower them to develop new architectures for their applications. The project will also include extensive educational efforts to create a new course that covers the complete lifecycle of machine learning workflows, including extensive treatment on the automated design and tuning of neural networks. The course material will be freely distributed to facilitate worldwide adoption and adapted to create a short course for high school students.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to develop principled, efficient, and automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) capabilities to enable practitioners to seamlessly create novel architectures for new problems. To achieve this goal, the project proposes a fundamentally new NAS paradigm driven by the co-design of the two core components of NAS, namely architecture search spaces and methods to search through these spaces. The researchers will demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed techniques across numerous domains, including those where expert-designed architectures do not exist. The technical problems being tackled blend ideas from optimization, learning theory, signal processing, and machine learning systems, and draw connections to the problems of compressed sensing, weak supervision, and meta-learning. The proposed NAS work will be transformational in unlocking the potential of novel deep learning applications in new domains, and will provide training opportunities for graduate students.  Moreover, the project's proposed activities emphasize accessibility and broad dissemination via:  foundational educational material disseminated to data scientists worldwide; growing and promoting diversity in the Machine Learning Systems research community; and widespread industry adoption via open-source activities, contributions to Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning blog, and a recurring podcast.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Besides synthetic particles, many organisms also generate naturally occurring iron oxide nanoparticles, known as ferritin, to store and regulate iron within their bodies. Whether man-made or natural, these iron oxide nanoparticles have a magnetization that can be used as a tool for manipulation or sensing in biological environments. However, nanoparticles often aggregate in complex bio-environments, and the effect of aggregation on their collective magnetic properties is not well understood. The overall objective of this work is to explore the relationship between nanoparticle clustering and resultant magnetic properties. Findings from this work can be potentially used to engineer magnetism-based sensing tools for more accurately tracking iron nanoparticles in biological systems. Data from this project can also advance other biomedical applications of iron oxide particles, such as their uses in magnetic hyperthermia for cancer therapy or as contrast agents for medical imaging. Besides advancing the field of bio-magnetism and nano-biotechnology, this research project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing research experience to students in state-of-the-art techniques for synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles, by enhancing infrastructure for research and education through the development of new techniques for magnetic characterization and by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering activities. <br/><br/>Iron-oxide nanoparticles have become crucial tools in biomedicine and bio-nanotechnology due to their magnetic behavior. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles (~5 to 10 nm in diameter), and naturally occurring ferrihydrite core (~ 5 to 8 nm) present in ferritin, the largest iron-storage protein in the human body. Determining the spatial localization and quantification of these iron-oxide nanoparticles in cells and tissues is critical for a number of applications in health. Thus far our ability to characterize the spatial distribution and quantity of iron oxide nanoparticles is limited to biochemical approaches like histochemical staining, which are largely qualitative. Magnetically sensitive detection offers an alternative, non-destructive, label free and quantitative means for characterization of iron-oxide nanoparticles. However, in biological systems, nanoparticles are often found in aggregates/clusters, which can impact their local and global magnetic properties and complicate interpretation of magnetic signals. The goal of this project is to understand how clustering of bio-inspired iron-oxide nanoparticles affect their magnetic properties across many length scales (nanometer to micrometer scale). Specifically, interactions between individual particles, as well as between larger clusters of particles, will be studied using a range of magnetically sensitive techniques. Biologically derived clusters of particles as well as artificially engineered aggregates will be used for the study. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles and naturally occurring ferrihydrite cores present in ferritin. In some cases, clusters will be nanofabricated using template guided assembly, so that geometric parameters of clusters such as size, shape, and interparticle distance can be varied systematically. Characterization of particle assemblies will be performed using techniques such as analytical electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, super-conducting quantum interference device magnetometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Results from this study will be used to develop advanced, magnetism-based metrology for localizing and quantifying aggregates of iron oxide nanoparticles in biological environments. An understanding of the effect of clustering on magnetic properties can enable quantitative histo-magnetic detection schemes for mapping iron deposits in tissue sections. The project activities will be accomplished by providing multidisciplinary and inter-institutional research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and by establishing new research collaborations. The project will also include outreach efforts to broaden participation, by developing and offering hands-on workshops on engineering concepts to under-privileged middle school students at a local school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, their sounds have received little scientific study despite their utility in monitoring streamflow and their environmental significance as dominant features of the riparian soundscape. In this project, the investigators will build on preliminary work and develop a tool for helping researchers collect important but currently impractical discharge data. This project will create a monitoring method that can enable hydrologists to collect streamflow data more efficiently than is currently possible, removing the constraint of stream-gaging logistics on data collection and permitting studies that are currently impractical. To encourage widespread adoption of the method, they will release a mature, user-friendly sensor/software combination with comprehensive manuals and instructional videos demonstrating fieldwork and data processing for new users. All instrumentation and software produced in this project will be open-source. They will promote hydrological and STEM education at multiple levels by including undergraduate and graduate students in research, instrumentation construction, software development, and K-12 outreach to underserved schools and community organizations. This interdisciplinary project will help train student assistants to work across disciplinary boundaries and teach transferable skills including electronic design and maintenance, field data collection, analysis, and scientific communication.<br/><br/>The investigators will address two research questions: 1) how can acoustic monitoring of whitewater features be used to measure streamflow? 2) how does the spatial distribution of whitewater sounds depend on characteristics of the stream and surroundings? The investigators will address their first question with case studies of many scales, ranging from waterfalls on rivers to riffles on mountain streams. In particular, they will examine the utility of acoustics for recording low-order and intermittent streams, which are under-monitored despite their hydrological, ecological, and policy significance. To answer the second question, they will characterize whitewater soundscapes by  collecting snapshot spatial surveys of noise around whitewater features and assessing how discharge, whitewater feature characteristics, vegetation, and topography affect stream noise extent and intensity.  This question is relevant to wide-ranging communities including hydrologists (site selection for acoustic gaging), geophysicists (understanding a important and variable source of background noise), ecologists (stream sounds aiding wildlife as navigational beacons, or impairing their ability to hear predators or prey), and urban and recreational planners (background sounds have measurable health effects on humans).

Current robot systems, however, remain passive in their perception of the world. Unlike biological systems, robots lack curiosity mechanisms for exploration and uncertainty mitigation, which are critical for intelligent decision making. Such capabilities are very important in disaster response, security and surveillance, and environmental monitoring, where it is necessary to quickly gain situational awareness of the terrain, buildings, and humans in the environment. The methods developed in this project will impact the design of mapping and active sensing algorithms for autonomous robot teams and their use in the aforementioned applications. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program research develops fundamental robot autonomy capabilities that will also impact other domains relying on autonomous robots. In addition, the project will develop a suite of open-source education materials, including theoretical problems, projects, lectures, and exemplary implementations of core robotics algorithms, unified in an easily accessible simulation environment. This platform will support curriculum development for graduate students, as well as outreach and research-initiation activities for undergraduate and K-12 students.<br/><br/>The research agenda will be achieved through two key technical innovations. First, the project will formally define an Active Bayesian Inference problem, seeking optimal control of sensing systems for minimum uncertainty estimation. Methods for distributed approximate dynamic programming that utilize the structure of the problem, induced by the functions modeling probability mass evolution and estimation performance, will be developed to efficiently represent and optimize multi-robot sensing control policies. Second, the project will demonstrate that a team of ground and aerial robots, using Active Bayesian Inference techniques, can achieve autonomous exploration and active high-fidelity mapping of an unknown environment. This objective will be supported by novel contributions to online dense implicit surface mapping in terms of distributed and probabilistic techniques that allow multiple robots to collaboratively estimate the environment geometry and semantics, while quantifying the uncertainty of these estimates to allow planning informative actions.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy storage is a vital technology to enable the widespread adoption of renewable energy and to accelerate the technological advancement towards negative CO2 emission. The Li ion battery technology represents one of the most important energy storage technologies. Further development of Li ion batteries calls for more fundamental studies that can reveal reaction mechanisms and inform the design of new materials. Despite many years of materials development, most commercial Li-ion batteries still rely on several cathode materials that are derived from intercalation materials discovered in the 1980s. In these conventional materials, there are defined pathways for Li ions to transport. Recently, there have been exciting discoveries in new battery materials with disordered Li ion transport pathways. Unfortunately, these materials exhibit inferior battery performance compared to conventional materials, although theoretically they should provide much higher capacity. This project uses advanced experimental methods to develop fundamental understanding of electrochemical processes in these new disordered materials. The successful outcome of this project will establish a knowledge base for further improving these materials. This project also seamlessly integrates research with educating the future workforce for the United States. It provides learning opportunities for elementary students with dyslexia in Southwest Virginia. Dyslexic students, an underrepresented group in STEM fields, can be enormous intellectual assets as history, for example in the field of battery research, has taught us. Separately from this effort, the CAREER project also establishes a sustainable educational program between Virginia Tech and national labs, allowing undergraduate students to perform research in national labs. Overall, through this CAREER project Prof. Lin educates several underrepresented minority students, helping them to excel at performing scientific research and to become future leaders in the energy storage field.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, investigates the structure-property relationship for an emerging family of advanced battery materials. The hypothesis underlying the various research objectives of this project is that Li-rich disordered rocksalt oxides, with a globally disordered Li percolating network and combined cationic/anionic redox activities, can potentially increase battery energy density far beyond what is delivered by conventional layered cathodes. However, so far their irreversible chemical and structural transformations during electrochemical cycling have impeded their practical applications. Prof. Lin and his research group carry out  holistic fundamental studies to understand how the chemical, structural, and redox properties transform at multiple length and time scales, during materials synthesis and under electrochemical operating conditions in order to resolve these daunting challenges. The project employs experimental methods, including synchrotron X-ray techniques and electrochemical diagnostics, to accomplish the following objectives: (1) probing and controlling the evolution of local coordination environment and global average phase during mechanosynthesis, (2) investigating the redox chemistry as a function of chemical composition, local coordination environment, global phase characteristics, and electrochemistry, and (3) quantifying the multiscale evolution of local coordination environment, global average phase, and redox chemistry upon prolonged electrochemical cycling. Taken together, results from these studies provide mechanistic insights into and advance the electrochemistry of disordered rocksalt oxide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past two decades, advances in computational power have led to a proliferation of program-synthesis techniques that draw upon various fields ranging from logic, programming-language theory, and machine learning. These techniques differ substantially in how they operate, and no single technique is universally superior in all cases. Furthermore, little is understood about users' actual needs and sentiment towards advanced development tools like synthesizers, which inevitably leads to the development of theoretically interesting but ultimately uncompelling or impractical tools. The novelties of this project are two-fold: (a) providing a unifying framework for these differing techniques so that their theoretical underpinnings can be better understood and next-generation program synthesis tools can be built on top of this framework, and (b) identifying the set of human factors that should be considered when making program-synthesis tools. This project's impact is, ultimately, unifying perspectives on program synthesis not just in terms of techniques but also disciplines: programming languages, human-computing interaction, and computer-science education.<br/><br/>The project focuses on two primary efforts. The first is developing a unified set of semantic foundations for synthesis based on a generalized notion of constraint that captures the common forms of specifications found with current techniques, e.g., types, examples, logical constraints, syntactic constraints, and partial programs. This constraint-based approach to synthesis naturally leads to a deductive, hole-guided programming style, different from traditional programming models. Therefore, the project's second effort is a systematic study of the needs and sentiment of developers towards this style of programming and the design of next-generation development tools based on these results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advancements of technology, such as the proliferation of GPS-enabled mobile phones, makes such data sources ubiquitous.  This gives rise to several challenges, such as storing the data, identifying and removing redundancies, clustering it, and preprocessing it to facilitate a variety of common and useful queries.<br/><br/>Consequently, the world is witnessing an outburst of research surrounding path and trajectory data.  Much of it is experimental, with little focus on the guaranteed performance, in terms of time, storage, and quality, of the various heuristics used for processing the sea of information.  In this project, the team of researchers is designing effective algorithms and data structures with provable performance guarantees for fundamental problems dealing with path and trajectory data.  They are concentrating their attention on proximity problems, including nearest-neighbor searching, clustering, and related questions.  However, in contrast with much of the previous related research, the team intends to put special emphasis on the usefulness of the obtained results, by taking into account properties that are often found in real-life inputs.  They are also considering these problems in the streaming model, which often suits the circumstances in practice.  (In this model one assumes that the overall volume of information is overwhelmingly large, that the data arrives in small frequent updates, and that limited amounts of time and memory are available to handle each update.)  The team is developing new methods and combine them with existing ones to attack challenging algorithmic questions in processing of massive amounts of curve and trajectory data in various settings.  The methodology is intended to be applicable to other problems in computational geometry and beyond.  The researchers are designing algorithms that are applicable to real-life problems of relevance to the academia, industry, and society.  Moreover, proximity problems for path and trajectory data are especially suitable for introducing high-school and university students to the world of algorithms, as the background needed for understanding the problems themselves is minimal and nice ideas at various levels of sophistication can be presented through easily accessible illustrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Future wireless communication networks will be required to provide significantly higher data rates compared to the current networks and to support highly-mobile low-latency applications such as virtual/augmented reality and autonomous vehicles. To respond to these requirements, this project will leverage machine learning to design next-generation wireless communication systems that can efficiently increase the number of antennas at the transmitters and receivers, which is essential for supporting high data rates. This project will also make use of the other sensory information such as GPS positions and camera images to improve the performance of the wireless communication networks. On the educational front, this project will lead to the development of undergraduate and graduate course materials and will provide opportunities for enhancing the basic engineering skills of undergraduate students through engaging them into building proof-of-concept prototypes. Further, the proposed work in this project is expected to have impact on a number of areas through the technology transfer to industry and the public release of all the machine learning datasets and algorithmic implementations developed during the project.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to enable highly-mobile large-scale MIMO systems in realistic dynamic environments. To achieve this goal, fundamentally new machine learning approaches that are capable of efficiently leveraging the prior system observations and the side multi-modal sensory information will be developed. The project has several inter-related thrusts: (i) Developing statistical channel prediction approaches for fast yet robust channel acquisition in dynamic massive MIMO systems; (ii) characterizing the fundamental conditions under which across-frequency and across-space channel prediction is feasible; (iii) Designing robust and adaptive multi-user precoding for highly-mobile massive MIMO systems leveraging learning-based conditional channel covariance prediction; (iv) Developing a novel multi-modal learning framework for fast mmWave beam prediction in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios, relying on the efficient fusion of various sensory data, such as positions, sub-6GHz channels, and visual data; (v) Investigating the design of efficient multi-modal learning approaches and algorithms for dynamic mmWave blockage prediction using advanced visual scene understanding and end-to-end learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of this project is to conduct a research synthesis of data collected over nearly two decades from several long-term global change experiments. The overarching goal is to understand the soil responses to three global changes of significance for ecosystems in the northeastern United States (climate warming, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and invasion by non-native plants). Soils are the largest repository of carbon (as organic matter) in the terrestrial biosphere, and the degree to which these global changes will accelerate or suppress soil organic matter decay will influence carbon and nutrient cycling processes and feedbacks to the climate system. The results and products of this research will provide a synthetic understanding of how soil warming, soil nitrogen enrichment, and plant invasion interact to influence biological and chemical processes in forest soils.<br/><br/>The aim of this OPUS project is to conduct a core research synthesis of data collected over 18 years from four long-term global change experiments at the Harvard Forest Long-term Ecological Research site with the goal to understand how multiple global change drivers act individually and in combination to influence soil microbial and biogeochemical parameters, with an emphasis on fungal community and soil organic matter dynamics. The ongoing experiments span 14-32 years in duration and represent some of the longest running experimental manipulations of their type globally. These sites have the same climate and similar soils, vegetation, and land-use histories and use identical soil warming and nitrogen fertilization techniques. A coordinated set of biogeochemical and microbial measurements have been made. This data synthesis approach offers a unique opportunity to understand how increasing soil temperatures, soil nitrogen enrichment, and biotic invasion individually or in combination affect soil biogeochemistry, plant-soil interactions, and microbial community dynamics over time. While several syntheses have been done for individual experiments, there has been no coordinated effort to integrate and synthesize data across experiments. The synthesis plan has two key components: (1) testing a mechanism for the soil carbon response to simultaneous warming and nitrogen enrichment, and (2) a cross-study synthesis of fungal community responses to global change and linkages to soil carbon storage. Data sets to be used in this synthesis include long-term records of 1) soil abiotic parameters (temperature, moisture, pH, bulk density, texture); 2) biogeochemical measurements (soil respiration, inorganic N, N mineralization, total soil C and N, root biomass, mycorrhizal colonization); and 3) microbial biomass, activity, diversity, community composition, and functional capacity.

Compounds containing carbon-nitrogen rings have a variety of applications in the development of new drugs and other medical applications. However, when select carbon atoms are replaced with boron in these cyclic compounds, special properties are induced that cause these ?boron-doped? molecules to emit light and/or change color, making them suitable for the advancement of electronics such as television, cell phone, and computer displays. A challenge that remains is the development of low-cost and long-lasting materials that absorb or emit light with specific colors and intensity. This can be achieved by coupling boron with non-metal elements such as phosphorus, or metals like gold. This project also contains outreach activities aimed at increasing educational success and graduation rates for underrepresented minorities and Virginia community college students who transfer to the University of Virginia to complete a bachelor?s degree. These students will have the opportunity to conduct science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and will receive degree-specific mentoring and professional development, enhancing their preparedness for graduate school and careers in science.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to develop new synthetic methods and establish reactivity trends for low-valent boracyclic materials with unusual bonding. Significant effort will be focused on the synthesis of stable open-shell boron radicals for energy storage and conversion. The primary synthetic strategy will involve chemical reduction of suitable haloboracyclic starting materials. The redox and electronic properties of these radicals will be studied with experiment and theory to access unusual spin states for the design of optoelectronic materials. An additional goal of the project is to investigate the synthesis and photophysical properties of boron-heteroatom-doped materials. This will involve two primary strategies: a) phosphinidene transfer from boraphosphaketene materials and subsequent ring expansion to form 6- and 8-membered boron-phosphorus-doped heterocycles and b) nucleophilic substitution using novel boracyclic anions to form boron-transition metal and boron-main-group element materials.

But this ignores two important areas deserving further study: the medieval roots of many twenty-first century medical practices, and continuing concerns about the safety and efficacy of drugs. The fears of alternative medicine groups promoting homeopathy, essential oils, and ?all-natural? remedies can be found as far back as the Middle Ages. The goal of this project is to study the practice of pharmacology in the Middle Ages in relation to the Franciscan Roger Bacon?s (d.1292) practice of medical alchemy, through which he attempted to produce medicines that would prolong human life. Bacon?s medical alchemy exemplifies thirteenth century attitudes towards medical practice, which simultaneously deferred to classical authorities and advocated for experiment and the creation of new knowledge. By examining extant manuscripts written by Bacon in light of contemporary 13th century medical authorities, this project examines the ways in which Bacon believes the theories of alchemy - which teaches how both organic and inorganic substances are generated - provides the means to create more effective pharmaceuticals. This history of pharmacology is important both for historians of medicine and current medical practice: it clarifies understanding of the early use of inorganic materials and their manipulation in medicine. <br/><br/>By examining Bacon?s alchemical and medical theories in light of thirteenth century medical education and practice, this project answers three central questions: (1) What types of medicines does Bacon think are useful in restoring health? (2) What physiological effects do these medicines have on the body, and why are they effective against disease when other medicines fail? And (3) How can we characterize the relationship between Bacon?s medical theories and those taught in universities? In situating Bacon within the 13th century medical traditions that focused on creating panaceas such as theriac, this research shows that Bacon, while certainly unique in many of his ideas, is still a part of the thirteenth century intellectual culture and that his ideas are molded by advances in medicine and contemporary theological discourses. It is imperative that the originality of Bacon?s ideas be established, as previous scholars have suggested that for the first 150 or so years after its introduction to the west in 1144, alchemy was focused more on the transmutation of metals than the making medicines. Thus Bacon is generally considered the first western author to unite alchemy and medicine. If it could be shown that Bacon?s alchemical ideas were influenced by others, then the early history of western alchemy, especially its ties with medical practice, would need to be re-examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Second, languages must provide expressive specification mechanisms to ensure that components are used correctly and that components do not have unintended interactions.  The project's novelties are new programming language features for modular specification and implementation of program data and behavior, at all level of the software stack from user-facing applications to operating system components and hardware support.

The second is modularity and reuse in low-level and systems programs.  The project develops extensible bit-level specifications of data structures and their layout, targeting applications including operating system kernels and hardware interfaces.  Each of these themes will only have impact if the resulting language features have comparable performance with existing approaches.

Besides synthetic particles, many organisms also generate naturally occurring iron oxide nanoparticles, known as ferritin, to store and regulate iron within their bodies. Whether man-made or natural, these iron oxide nanoparticles have a magnetization that can be used as a tool for manipulation or sensing in biological environments. However, nanoparticles often aggregate in complex bio-environments, and the effect of aggregation on their collective magnetic properties is not well understood. The overall objective of this work is to explore the relationship between nanoparticle clustering and resultant magnetic properties. Findings from this work can be potentially used to engineer magnetism-based sensing tools for more accurately tracking iron nanoparticles in biological systems. Data from this  project can also advance other biomedical applications of iron oxide particles, such as their uses in magnetic hyperthermia for cancer therapy or as contrast agents for medical imaging. Besides advancing the field of bio-magnetism and nano-biotechnology, this research project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing research experience to students in state-of-the-art techniques for synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles, by enhancing infrastructure for research and education through the development of new techniques for magnetic characterization and by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering activities. <br/> <br/>Iron-oxide nanoparticles have become crucial tools in biomedicine and bio-nanotechnology due to their magnetic behavior. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles (~5 to 10 nm in diameter), and naturally occurring ferrihydrite core (~ 5 to 8 nm) present in ferritin, the largest iron-storage protein in the human body. Determining the spatial localization and quantification of these iron-oxide nanoparticles in cells and tissues is critical for a number of applications in health. Thus far our ability to characterize the spatial distribution and quantity of iron oxide nanoparticles is limited to biochemical approaches like histochemical staining, which are largely qualitative. Magnetically sensitive detection offers an alternative, non-destructive, label free and quantitative means for characterization of iron-oxide nanoparticles. However, in biological systems, nanoparticles are often found in aggregates/clusters, which can impact their local and global magnetic properties and complicate interpretation of magnetic signals. The goal of this project is to understand how clustering of bio-inspired iron-oxide nanoparticles affect their magnetic properties across many length scales (nanometer to micrometer scale). Specifically, interactions between individual particles, as well as between larger clusters of particles, will be studied using a range of magnetically sensitive techniques. Biologically derived clusters of particles as well as artificially engineered aggregates will be used for the study. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles and naturally occurring ferrihydrite cores present in ferritin. In some cases, clusters will be nanofabricated using template guided assembly, so that geometric parameters of clusters such as size, shape, and interparticle distance can be varied systematically. Characterization of particle assemblies will be performed using techniques such as analytical electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, super-conducting quantum interference device magnetometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Results from this study will be used to develop advanced, magnetism-based metrology for localizing and quantifying aggregates of iron oxide nanoparticles in biological environments. An understanding of the effect of clustering on magnetic properties can enable quantitative histo-magnetic detection schemes for mapping iron deposits in tissue sections. The project activities will be accomplished by providing multidisciplinary and inter-institutional research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and by establishing new research collaborations. The project will also include outreach efforts to broaden participation, by developing and offering hands-on workshops on engineering concepts to under-privileged middle school students at a local school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, modern scientific instrumentation and sensing technologies are often bulky, expensive, slow, and/or cumbersome to operate; and may be unavailable in disadvantaged, remote, or under-developed communities where access to laboratory grade diagnostics is sparse. Colorimetric sensors on the other hand offer a promising solution to these problems, as they can be analyzed with high resolution by digital cameras or the naked eye. However, the performance of colorimetric sensors is so far typically inferior to the bulky/expensive alternatives as it can be difficult to convert small sensor variations into a large color response. This research introduces and investigates a means to address and overcome this problem through optimization of the sensor design, coordinated with the design of the light source.  This research opens the door to new types of high-performance colorimetric sensors, which may be competitive with and/or offer greater functionality than the bulky/expensive alternatives.<br/><br/>Structural coloration faces fundamental limits which presently prevent the realization of strong dynamic color responses arising from small variations in spectral properties.  As such, dynamic coloration and colorimetric sensing devices currently rely heavily on niche physical/chemical effects which must amplify spectral changes to yield their colorimetric response.  Colorimetric sensors built on such approaches are not generalizable and ultimately fail to rival the performance of laboratory grade benchtop equipment which is often bulky, slow, and costly/complex to operate. The proposed research presents a transformative and general technique for color transduction and sensing which can overcome these challenges. The ultimate goal of this research is to break the present performance limits of dynamic structural color devices and to investigate a new class of structural color based diagnostics, readable by the naked eye, which can rival or even exceed the performance of benchtop alternatives.  Objectives of this project include: (1) Establish the theoretical framework for our high-level approach, ?hyperchromatic structural color? (HSC), while mapping out and investigating the limits of dynamic color transduction and how to maximize perceived color variations in response to targeted stimuli; (2) Study the design of metasurfaces optimized for multi-chrome laser illuminants and tailored colorimetric trajectories; and fabricate, characterize, and analyze their performance while addressing integration and nanomanufacturing challenges; (3) Experimentally characterize the colorimetric sensing performance of the newly developed multi-chrome metasurfaces and advance the field of naked eye diagnostics; and (4) Implement an educational plan aimed at addressing an observed educational gap in high-school and undergraduate level optics and photonics in an effort to: (a) increase STEM exposure to local high-schoolers, (b) promote both STEM and graduate level education opportunities to a broad range of groups, and (c) bridge the gap between undergraduate education and industrial opportunities in optics and opto-electronic industries. The investigation of dynamic structural color using multi-chrome laser illuminants is compelling because it fundamentally offers access to the highest colorimetric sensitivities, and hence no alternative approach (i.e. broadband or monochromatic illumination) can principally produce stronger color variations in response to a given spectral perturbation.  Our focus on studying multi-chrome metasurfaces and the integration of responsive nanomaterials will advance our understanding of: multi-resonant and moir photonic systems, the design and optimization of moderate to low index metasurfaces and biosensors, how to nano-manufacture scalably chip-scale optics derived from unconventional media, and how to tailor spectral properties from arrays and pixelated structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To lessen the burden of cancer and improve clinical practice, researchers use algorithms to reconstruct the evolutionary history, or phylogeny, of a tumor from DNA sequencing data. Specifically, a tumor phylogeny describes the precise mutational composition of a patient?s tumor, thus enabling precision medicine with improved clinical outcomes. Moreover, comparative analysis of tumor phylogenies from patient cohorts enables the identification of key mechanisms underlying tumor evolution and metastasis, which in turn may lead to new treatment avenues. The next technological frontier in the field is single-cell sequencing (SCS), which holds the potential to precisely reconstruct a tumor's evolutionary history at single cell resolution. While SCS is becoming the de facto standard in cancer genomics, algorithms for this new type of data are still in their infancy and do not yet comprehensively model cancer evolution. This project will address this gap by developing new tools that will enable practitioners to cost-efficiently use SCS to comprehensively study a tumor's evolution, thereby advancing the state of knowledge regarding cancer progression, which in turn may lead to better targeted cancer therapies. Results from this project will be disseminated through open-source software. The integrated research and educational activities include interdisciplinary bioinformatics curriculum development, outreach to high school students and research opportunities for students in underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project seeks new models, algorithms and practical implementations to accurately and cost-efficiently infer comprehensive cancer phylogenies from SCS data and integrate the proposed research into education and outreach.

It is possible that differences in plan networks results in beneficiaries having access to differential quality physicians and hospitals. This research project will study why some private health insurance plans are better than others at keeping their beneficiaries healthy.  It will measure which physicians and hospitals promote health for different types of patients and link these to plan-level effects using new data on plan networks. The research will also develop new methods to separate plans that promote health from plans that enroll beneficiaries who will be healthier regardless of the plans they enroll in. The findings from this project will provide guidance on how to regulate private and government subsidized health insurance markets in ways that will promote beneficiary health.  By helping to improve efficiency in the health insurance market, the results of this research project will not only improve health outcomes in the USA but also promote economic growth and lower health care expenditure.  This research will therefore help to establish the USA as the global leader in health insurance reforms.<br/><br/>This project will develop a unified framework for studying quality differences and choice in healthcare markets by synthesizing the heterogeneous mortality effects and selection of different physicians, hospitals, and health insurance plans. This analysis proceeds in three steps.  It validates observational estimates of provider mortality effects, allowing for heterogeneity by patient observables, with quasi-experimental ?mover? variation. Second, it uses discrete choice methods to recover the effective networks of insurance plans from detailed provider network information. This is combined with validated provider mortality estimates to yield estimates of plan network quality. Third, it estimates a model of plan choice, as a function of provider networks and other attributes, and use this model to study (i) how health insurance markets impact health via the matching of consumers and providers and (ii) whether counterfactual market structures can yield better matches and health outcomes. The findings from this project will influence policy debates over the optimal structure of private and government subsidized healthcare markets, such as Medicare Advantage (MA).  This research will also yield new estimates of provider and plan network quality which will complement existing public performance rankings. The estimates will allow for a range of policy counterfactuals that evaluate the health consequences and broader welfare impact of policies.  The results will therefore improve the functioning of the insurance markets as well as improve its effectiveness on health outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, each of data acquisition, reconstruction and inference blocks in the data processing pipeline is independent of one another and optimized separately. This approach has led to exponential rates of data generation that creates an unbearable demand for power, storage, processing, and communication requirements in today?s sensing systems. The goal of this project is to advance the science of learning-based sensing and processing technologies by developing an adaptive, task-oriented and physics-aware data-to-decision pipeline, which jointly optimizes data acquisition, reconstruction, and inference stages in a data-driven learning framework. The proposed research will establish the foundations of future smart, adaptive, and resource-efficient sensing systems for a variety of applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, radar, and wireless communications.<br/><br/>This project has three interconnected objectives (i) Developing learning-based physics-aware multi-dimensional signal reconstruction techniques through foundational relations to regularized inverse problems and explainable architectures inspired from existing signal processing models, (ii) Developing mathematical and learning-based adaptive and task-oriented measurement design approaches with jointly optimized sensing, reconstruction and processing blocks, and demonstrate its impacts on real-world problems, (iii) Developing a learning-based data-to-decision framework, which infers actionable information (classification, parameter estimation) directly from low number of learned measurements. The central theme of planned synergistic educational and outreach activities is to increase the scientific literacy of both the K-12 and university students and the public regarding sensing systems, signal processing, and machine learning. Because sensing technologies are on the frontier of how information is perceived and extracted, and are essential to a wide range of applications, this project will have a high impact on sensing technologies being developed to improve the quality of our daily lives, ranging from applications of cameras to biomedical imaging, or from smart home technologies to autonomous vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will overcome this limitation by developing an instrument that will provide thick-sample imaging with high resolution. This project will integrate research and education to stimulate interest in Optical Engineering, providing students with a unique set of skills for succeeding in their professional careers. Optical Engineering is the field of study that focuses on the development and application of optics and photonics, including instrumentation. In this project, five educational activities are focused on transferring the knowledge of Optical Engineering. These educational activities include the following: (1) an online Optical Engineering Certificate; (2) a Summer Workshop in Advanced Optical Microscopic Techniques; (3) the creation of a STEM club in Lausanne Collegiate School so high-school students can develop science projects that are generally not possible in science classrooms; (4) a partnership with the Pink Palace Museum to expose the public to optics and microscopy; and (5) summer internships to undergraduate students, exposing them to research activities and new career paths. This project has several broader impacts. The most important broader impact is the enhancement of the imaging infrastructure for biological research and expanding our knowledge of cell behavior. Another significant broader impact is the increase in career opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. During this project, the PI will create research, education, and scientific outreach videos using the YouTube platform. These videos will provide hands-on demonstrations of building imaging systems and the use of optical tools to align them. Students involved in this project will participate in these videos, allowing them to develop a deeper understanding of the topic and improving their communication skills. The videos will be available in English and Spanish audio to support the educational growth of Hispanic students across the United States.<br/><br/>Available methods of light microscopy do not enable three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR) imaging of thick (>50 ?m) biological samples without staining.

This additional pathway to teaching licensure will address the needs of STEM majors who decide upon a teaching profession later in their college careers or even after graduation. Because of state licensure requirements, college students seeking teaching degrees are required to complete high credit-count coursework in both their primary STEM majors and in education. To do so in four years, most students begin on the traditional STEM education pathway, and their college coursework plans are prescriptive to ensure graduation within four years. The restrictions of this model can discourage transfer students as well as late deciders from pursuing teaching careers, as these students must often commit to at least two more years of study. The development and implementation of a Master of Arts in STEM teaching program aims to lower barriers for STEM majors to choose teaching as a profession.  <br/><br/>During this project, Maryville College will partner with Blount County Public Schools, a neighboring high-need local education agency and four regional partners.  Regional partners include the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, an environmental education center in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the STEM Innovation Network of Tennessee, and the Little River Watershed Association.  As the overarching goal of this project is to develop a one-year Master of Arts in STEM Teaching degree program, the project has three major objectives.  One is to create a viable, attractive pathway for STEM majors from Maryville College and for transfer students from community colleges to pursue teacher licensure midway through their college careers.  A second objective is to create educational materials to raise awareness of the new master?s program among Maryville College STEM students, regional STEM graduates, community college students, and potential professional partners with employees who may be interested in teaching.  The third objective is to forge partnerships with several regional organizations to develop a recruitment pipeline of STEM professionals who want to change careers.  The project also aims to provide professional development opportunities for undergraduate students and Master of Arts in STEM Teaching students through internships and teaching-related field experiences. Project evaluation will provide an opportunity to analyze the successes and challenges in developing and launching the proposed program, yielding valuable data for future program innovations at Maryville and for other institutions planning fifth-year STEM MAT program implementation. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent studies suggest that passive acoustic holograms can be used for projecting an arbitrary acoustic pattern when illuminated with only a single acoustic source.

These effects can be responsible for amplitude as well as phase distortions of the primary interfering waves that give rise to extra acoustic images and ambiguity functions of the reconstructed acoustic field. This award will explore an untested nonlinear volume holography approach based on experimental measurements and modeling. The method will help to answer fundamental scientific questions in wavefront engineering research including: (1) What are the dominant origins of nonlinearity in acoustic holograms?

It supports research, educational, and outreach activities to advance the fundamental understanding and design of nanomaterials. Spherical metal nanoparticles less than 10 nanometers in diameter are promising materials for biomedical applications because they can circulate in the bloodstream for long periods of time and interact with target cells. Some applications, such as the delivery of nucleic acids, require nanoparticles to enter the cell interior by crossing the cell membrane - the barrier that separates the cell interior from the environment - without damaging the cell. A small number of nanoparticles have exhibited this desirable cell entry behavior, but the mechanisms underlying this behavior are not understood. Consequently, general rules for designing nanoparticles that can efficiently cross the cell membrane do not exist.<br/><br/>The PI will utilize a combination of computational methods to address this knowledge gap and test hypotheses to understand how the properties of nanoparticles affect their interaction with cell membranes. Such methods permit the analysis of nanoparticle properties and interactions that are difficult to discern experimentally and to gain insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which nanoparticles enter cells. New machine learning methods will be further developed to predict how nanoparticle properties can be synthetically tuned to facilitate cell entry. This computational approach will permit the creation of new types of nanoparticles more rapidly than would be possible through experiments alone, enabling the rational design of next-generation nanomaterials with various biomedical applications.<br/><br/>This award also supports integrated education and outreach activities. The PI will create visually appealing, interactive, and easily accessible computer simulations that illustrate molecular-scale phenomena. These simulations will be used as a ?computational microscope? to demonstrate nanoscale phenomena to the public and grade 6-12 students during events hosted on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. They will also be integrated into a range of undergraduate chemical engineering courses and disseminated broadly through online resources. The project will further help train the next generation of scientists in computational science by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and local high school teachers. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports research, and integrated educational, and outreach activities to advance the fundamental understanding and design of functionalized nanomaterials. Designing materials to efficiently deliver cargo to intracellular targets without adverse side effects would have a transformative impact on biomedical applications including protein and drug delivery, gene editing, and bioimaging. Surface-functionalized gold nanoparticles have the potential to achieve this goal, but a longstanding challenge is designing nanoparticles that can enter cells without being trapped in endosomes and without disrupting the cell membrane. Surprisingly, some nanoparticles can non-disruptively penetrate into cells by translocating across the cell membrane, potentially enabling exciting new avenues for intracellular delivery. However, cell penetration mechanisms remain largely unknown, inhibiting the optimization and design of cell-penetrating nanoparticles.<br/><br/>To address this knowledge gap, this project will use molecular dynamics simulations at multiple length scales to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that influence the insertion of nanoparticles into lipid bilayers and test the hypothesis that bilayer insertion predicts cell penetration. The objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize mechanisms of bilayer insertion for different nanoparticle compositions using all-atom simulations with enhanced sampling techniques, (2) determine the impact of bilayer composition on nanoparticle insertion and penetration with coarse-grained simulations, and (3) train machine learning models to discover new classes of synthetically accessible cell-penetrating nanoparticles. Computational predictions of new cell-penetrating nanoparticles will be experimentally verified by collaborators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These studies will provide new insight into nano-bio interactions that will impact understanding of diverse classes of nanomaterials and demonstrate how the combination of machine learning and molecular simulation can inform nanomaterial design.<br/><br/>This award also supports integrated education and outreach activities. The PI will design simulation modules that utilize molecular dynamics simulations to illustrate nanoscale phenomena. Modules will be: (1) visually appealing, to engage students and illustrate concepts; (2) interactive, to increase student engagement and improve learning outcomes; (3) accessible, to ensure simulations can be performed without computational expertise; and (4) distributable, to maximize impact without requiring substantial computational resources. Modules will be designed in collaboration with educational experts then integrated into outreach events to impact grade 6-12 students, integrated into classes within the University of Wisconsin-Madison chemical engineering curriculum to engage undergraduate students, and will be disseminated online to the broader nanomaterials education community. Module development will also broaden participation by providing opportunities for undergraduates from underrepresented groups to contribute to the project?s research activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Salt marshes, hotspots of biological activity, have a remarkable ability to sustain themselves, largely due to their vegetation, and maintain coastlines as sea level changes. However, the annual loss of thousands of hectares of low-lying coastal wetlands to open water each year threatens fisheries, wildlife habitat, water quality, soil carbon stocks, and adjacent human infrastructure. The objective of this project is to learn how coastal wetlands, salt marshes in particular, will respond to intensifying environmental change.  This project plans to extend experiments examining the influence of rising atmospheric CO2, nutrient pollution, invasive species, and sea level rise on the structure and persistence of salt marsh vegetation. It aims to take advantage of an unparalleled thirty-four year record of plant, microbe and soil responses to global change to identify the most important factors for marsh survival. These results should be relatable to other coastal ecosystems, and are likely to improve predictions of future marsh loss as well as inform management strategies for maintaining wetlands.  Data from the project will be incorporated into undergraduate classes at two institutions, undergraduates will assist with data collection and use data from the project for senior theses, and the general public will be given tours of research site and given the opportunity to participate in citizen science initiatives.<br/><br/>This project includes three complementary, long-term field experiments that manipulate<br/>atmospheric CO2 and N enrichment in different plant communities, that leverage the inter-annual variability in other critical factors such as sea level, salinity and precipitation. The team plans to test the hypothesis that sea level rise, as the ultimate driver of change in coastal wetlands, will cause the two plant species with the highest flood tolerance (native sedge and invasive Phragmites australis) to replace those with lower flood tolerance (C4 grasses) over the next decade. Because the sedge and Phragmites also respond strongly to elevated CO2, the team predicts that plant community composition will initially shift and increase the ecosystem-scale CO2 response, but it will ultimately decline due to increasing flooding stress. The marsh is expected to cross a threshold in the next decade as rates of relative sea level rise accelerate to the point that the marsh becomes unstable due to declining productivity. However, the areas dominated by Phragmites, particularly plots with added N, yield the greatest productivity on the marsh, and have the best chance to keep up with accelerating sea level. Finally, the team hypothesizes that an increase in methane emissions expected with increased flooding will be offset initially by higher rates of rhizosphere methane oxidation from the flood-tolerant sedge. The results from this experiment can continue to inform models and global change syntheses. The site and extensive dataset are used as a hands-on case study in ecology courses at Villanova University and Bryn Mawr College. This project plans to train researchers at all levels, to engage the public in the long-term and forward-looking science that arises from this LTREB site, and to promote the application of this basic science to support coastal wetland protection, conservation, and restoration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, freshwater aquatic ecosystems are a major component of the global carbon cycle. Lakes emit a substantial amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, which is derived from a combination of internal organic matter breakdown and external inputs of inorganic carbon from surrounding watersheds. Dissolved oxygen, which is consumed as organisms break down organic matter, is declining in lakes around the world, threatening the ability of these ecosystems to support the current diversity and biomass of organisms they harbor. Past attempts to understand coupled carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen dynamics in lakes have not accounted for seasonal variation in light intensity and temperature or water column heterogeneity, both of which influence gross fluxes of both gasses. This project seeks to understand how heterogeneity in environmental conditions, in both time and space, impacts carbon and oxygen balance in aquatic ecosystems, and thus improve our understanding of the role lakes play in the global carbon cycle. Together, the integrated research and education plan of this project will provide educational and training opportunities to a wide range of students and early career scientists through improved course materials, a large workshop, and local outreach efforts. This project will also leverage datasets that exist at many organizations and institutions, and the insights gained via the process of compiling and harmonizing diverse data sets will be translatable to many other networks and research efforts.  Finally, outreach to citizen-scientists and lake associations around the world will leverage the power of comparative network science to understand individual lake conditions in a global context.<br/><br/>Lakes often exhibit substantial and dynamic structural heterogeneity, largely driven by thermal stratification. This project focuses on the production and consumption of carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen in lakes, and how heterogeneity in time and space regulate the dynamics of these critical biogeochemical fluxes. Lakes are globally important hot-spots of carbon cycling, venting about as much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere as is taken up by the world?s oceans. Theoretically, carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen are stoichiometrically coupled via metabolic processes, but departures from expectations based on stoichiometry and partial pressure in the atmosphere regularly occur in aquatic ecosystems.  Understanding what causes these departures may provide insights into underlying biogeochemical processing in lakes, and may enable more accurate predictions of continental-scale carbon dioxide emissions from lakes. This project aims to combine high-frequency sensor observations, manually collected data, long-term data sets and ecosystem modeling to understand the dynamics of lake carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen across large environmental gradients. Data will be obtained and harmonized from diverse sources such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and collaborating scientists and organizations in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most solids can be thought of as  being either insulators or conductors - often metals. A closer examination, however, reveals rich sub-categories including semiconductors such as silicon, that are insulators at the absolute zero of temperature but show substantial conduction at room temperature, and semimetals such as bismuth, that are formally metals at zero temperature but at higher temperatures have several orders-of-magnitude lower conductivities than metals like copper.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, the influx of ideas from mathematics in the area of topology into solid-state physics has spawned a new family of semimetals, namely, topological semimetals, of which graphene and Weyl semimetals are the most famous examples. These materials are ""true"" semimetals, in the sense that their properties at all temperatures are intermediate between those of metals and of insulators. Topological semimetals are fascinating materials: on one hand, they enable access to the physics related to the fundamental particles that make up matter through table-top experiments, while on the other hand, they tend to have conduction properties which make them attractive platforms for electronic device technologies.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI and his team will theoretically investigate various fundamental aspects of topological semimetals, such as the tendency of electrons confined to their surfaces to organize themselves in states in which the electrons are ordered in some way, like magnetism or the cooperative state of superconductivity in which electrons move without any resistance. The range of the investigation reaches to electronic properties related to how electrons move in single atomic layer and two-layer structures of graphene. These aspects of graphene are challenging to study using existing techniques because standard analytical theoretical descriptions begin to break down while computational approaches are too limited or become prohibitively costly. Thus, the team of researchers will develop a new numerical algorithm tailored for investigating physics in this regime.<br/><br/>The team will integrate the above research with concerted activities that harness technology for surmounting hurdles in education and outreach in the post-COVID era. Specifically, they will design mobile games that teach undergraduate physics content, build an ""analogy inventory"" to improve communication between physics and other STEM fields, organize a virtual conference on topological semimetals and develop innovative pedagogical strategies suitable for online and social distancing-compliant classrooms.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research, and education on topological semimetals. Topological semimetals (TSMs) are a cornerstone of topological condensed matter and, thanks to their gapless spectrum, present unique challenges and opportunities compared to their gapped counterparts such as topological insulators. The PI will explore, craft innovative tools for and tackle pressing theoretical issues in TSMs to unearth exotic phenomena in both weakly and strongly correlated regimes. This CAREER project is organized in 4 thrusts. Thrust 1 is focused on three-dimensional TSMs, adopting a clever surface-centric approach to reveal qualitatively new weak-correlation physics rooted in the interpolating-dimensional nature of the surface states and their inseparability from the bulk. This includes the quantum effects of weak disorder, spontaneous magnetization, and superconductivity, and also includes robust Majorana wires in mixed real-and-momentum space. Thrust 2 develops the primary tool for Thrust 3, namely, an innovative algorithm that is tailored for probing finite temperature properties of generic, non-integrable systems using the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Thrust 3 focuses on the strongly correlated regime of graphene-based systems. In particular, it inspects the microscopic processes that drive hydrodynamic transport in graphene and the finite temperature phases, including possible pseudogap and strange metal phases, in twisted bilayer graphene. Thrust 4 complements the research through concerted activities for surmounting hurdles in education and outreach in the post-COVID era using technology. Specifically, the PI and his team will design mobile games that teach undergraduate physics content, build an ?analogy inventory? to improve communication between physics and other STEM fields, organize a virtual conference on TSM-research and develop innovative teaching strategies suitable for online and social distancing-compliant classrooms.<br/><br/>This project is aimed to transform our collective understanding of TSMs by tackling fundamental issues in the field that arise from rapid experimental progress. For instance, Thrust 1 will clarify puzzles in magneto-transport experiments on TSMs, determine whether weak disorder can localize the surface states, provide theoretical support to surface superconductivity seen in TSMs and unveil scenarios where the surface spontaneously orders before the bulk does even though the latter has a higher dimensionality. It will also reveal a new class of non-local Majorana fermions and examine their potential for storing quantum information. The algorithm developed in Thrust 2 is a new approach to strongly correlated systems that could be useful for studying finite temperature equilibrium physics in unsolved regimes plagued by the Monte-Carlo sign-problem such as frustrated spin models and fermionic systems lacking quasiparticles. It transforms the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis from a useful qualitative conjecture to the basis for practical calculation. Thrust 3 will help dissect transport data in experimental graphene samples, which are increasingly approaching the quality needed for the electrons to exhibit hydrodynamic transport. It will also help map out the potentially rich and largely unexplored finite temperature phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacterial pathogens often share beneficial genetic material amongst themselves, enabling them to quickly adapt to their surroundings. The process of sharing genetic material, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), is the most common way that bacteria rapidly adapt to diverse environments. While much focus has been placed on characterizing pathogens that have already acquired beneficial traits via HGT, relatively little is known about the immediate adaptation that cells must undergo to successfully acquire such traits. This project investigates the adaptation process following HGT to provide insights into why certain pathogens are more successful (and therefore, prevalent) than others. The results and insights generated are applicable to a wide variety of biological areas and open questions and promotes ongoing and future collaborative efforts across the microbiology research community. In addition to its scientific objectives, this project facilitates significant educational opportunities for undergraduate students, particularly women and those from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM disciplines.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the plasmid fitness cost as a determinant of plasmid-strain success: strains bearing high-cost plasmids are either out-competed or evolve compensatory mutations that ameliorate the plasmid's metabolic burden. In addition to the fitness cost, acquiring a plasmid introduces an immediate, but transient, disruption to metabolism which also impacts population growth dynamics. The impacts of these short-term effects remain an understudied feature of conjugation dynamics.

For instance, for a self-driving vehicle, perception systems provide functionalities such as estimating the state of the vehicle, building a map of obstacles in its surroundings, and detecting and tracking external objects and pedestrians. As exemplified by recent self-driving car accidents, perception failures can cascade to catastrophic system failures and compromise human safety. Therefore, the development of trustworthy perception systems is paramount to ensure safety and enable adoption of high-integrity and safety-critical CPS applications. <br/><br/>This project lays the foundations of certifiable perception by developing a toolkit of theory, algorithms, and implementations to monitor and drastically reduce subsystem and system-level failures of perception. In particular, this project will (i) develop a new class of certifiable perception algorithms that operate reliably in challenging conditions, are equipped with input-output contracts describing their functionalities, and can formally assert contract satisfaction; (ii) show how to use certifiable algorithms to design contracts for and enable self-supervision of learning-based subsystems; (iii) design system monitors that assert the satisfaction of safety requirements or trigger fail-safe procedures in case of failure; (iv) develop a testbed and real demonstrations of certifiable perception on self-driving car data, focusing on key perception functionalities, such as vehicle localization, environment mapping, and object tracking. This research advances the state of the art in CPS and creates a new research field at the boundary between CPS, robotics and autonomous vehicles, computer vision, machine learning, system-level design and runtime verification.<br/><br/>Certifiable perception will have a transformative impact on a broad range of autonomous CPS where safety, reliability, security, and accountability are key requirements. These include intelligent transportation, supply chain logistics (e.g., last-mile delivery), new aerospace concepts (e.g., autonomous spacecraft, flying taxis, and drones for national security), service and domestic robotics, and collaborative manufacturing. This impact will be enhanced through the release and dissemination of open-source implementations and teaching material, and via demonstrations on real testbeds. The project also boosts K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education, by supporting and actively engaging students in research activities, and through outreach efforts targeting high school students from underrepresented and underserved communities. <br/><br/>This project is in response to the NSF CAREER 20-525 solicitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Florida Everglades, changes in freshwater supply and sea level rise are influencing the health of freshwater ecosystems. Since freshwater species are not well adapted to high salinity levels, a zone of low productivity often occurs at the intersection of salt- and fresh-water bodies. Even though these low productivity zones commonly occur in coastal areas, we do not understand how the size and location of these zones on the larger landscape will influence the capacity for coastal regions to maintain the productivity rates that allow them to keep up with sea level rise. To understand how Everglades wetlands are changing along the coast, it is necessary to determine how salt stress leads to a rapid loss of accumulated carbon (C) and the amount of time it takes for salt tolerant species to move into the affected zone, increasing productivity. This project incorporates measurements at the species level to determine how changes in salinity affect rates of photosynthesis, and how species-specific responses to increased salinity impact vegetation cover throughout entire marsh ecosystems. In addition to the traditional avenues for sharing research findings, this project includes a collaboration to develop an interactive website that features educational elements as well as resources designed to help coastal residents, educators, and elected officials become more familiar with and involved in coastal research. This project will also support a diversity and bias awareness workshop for biologists and produce a museum exhibit. <br/><br/>To understand how Everglades wetlands are changing, it is necessary to determine how complex stressors, driven by shifting hydrological regimes, either accelerate C storage or cause a rapid loss of accumulated C. This project involves characterizing species-level physiological responses to changing salinity and hydrologic conditions, remote sensing to detect the size and location of the low productivity zone, and eddy covariance to measure the productivity rates of entire ecosystems. This research aims to  establish links between wetland ecosystem structure and C dynamics, and the degree to which hydrology influences wetland feedbacks to already increasing atmospheric CO2. The data produced from this project will improve wetland data- model comparisons by measuring how CO2 and CH4 emissions fluctuate in response to the seasonal effects of inundation and changes in salinity. This project will also produce a documentary film to raise awareness of the important changes happening to coastal ecosystems and empower residents, students, and politicians to join in our effort to develop resilient ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet there exist very few detailed observations of the role of short ocean wave growth and directionality in mediating these exchanges. This project is to analyze a large set of ocean surface wave, near-surface hydrodynamics, and air-sea momentum flux data collected at the Air-Sea Interaction Tower (ASIT) between late 2019 and early 2020. The proposed work will help to resolve fundamental aspects of the relationship between air-sea momentum flux, ocean surface waves, and near-surface hydrodynamics. The results will be incorporated into classroom material for a new course on physical air-sea interaction at the University of New Hampshire and an existing course at Columbia University. Additionally, the results will be made available to K-12 teachers in the New York City area through the LDEO program ""Earth2Class (E2C) Workshops for Educators"". <br/><br/>The project will quantify the relationship between wind forcing and the directional growth and relaxation of short surface gravity and gravity-capillary waves. The air-sea momentum fluxes will be addressed by combining the observed thermal skin advection and short-wave propagation data with the atmospheric turbulent stress profile and subsurface velocity profile. One of the outcomes of this project will be to produce a new parameterization for the ocean surface current response to wind forcing that incorporates turbulent stress and the ocean surface wave state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A primary objective of this work is to expand the view of metabolism beyond current linear two-dimensional models to more holistic three-dimensional representations. A metabolon is a group of enzymes that organize in three dimensions by interacting together to generate a ?machine? that can direct flow and influence the path through the overall system. Determining metabolon formation provides fundamental information on how different compounds are produced in living organisms and gives insight into how to manipulate these systems to improve the production of compounds of interest. This work focuses on using orange (Citrus sinensis) to determine metabolon organization of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, which can be utilized for human benefit. The Broader Impact of this works includes the intrinsic nature of the research on flavonoids, which have important health and nutritional qualities.  Additional work with students will include opportunities to become involved in the research itself and outreach efforts will teach students how to grow their own food.  The activities will include a focused effort to include Pacific Islanders who are underrepresented in science. It is hoped these activities will capture the interest of young people due to the hands-on components and expose them to mentors who are currently successful in science and agriculture.<br/><br/>The overall research objective for this project is to determine the metabolic organization and enzymology of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in orange. The central hypothesis is that accumulation of flavonoid end products in orange depends upon formation of a metabolon. The rationale for the proposed research is that a determination of the enzymology and metabolic organization of the orange flavonoid biosynthetic pathway will identify targets for improving the content and quality of flavonoid metabolites for applications beneficial to humanity. These objectives will be achieved by identifying structure-function relationships of metabolon enzymes involved in biosynthesis of orange flavonoids, and determine the organization of enzymes comprising flavonoid metabolons of blonde and blood varieties of orange.  The work expands from prior use of the model system Arabidopsis thaliana by employing the fundamentally and agriculturally important species orange, which allows analysis of differences in metabolon formation between species that accumulate early and late flavonoids. Glycosyltransferase enzymes will also be studied as they contribute to the production of the majority of flavonoid compounds which accumulate in vivo but are currently understudied.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of the project lies in the fact that women?s perceptions of departmental and institutional appreciation and recognition are critical to their job satisfaction and intent to stay, which can impact inclusive hiring and retention. Research has yet to determine the causes of perceived mismatches among women and faculty of color and their workplace goals and values, and how this relates to differing experiences in the nature of work and broader forms of support. Yet, the inclusion and success of women is vital to meeting the national science and engineering workforce needs of the future. Therefore, this project aims to innovatively address these issues by drawing from the approaches of organizational justice and authenticity. While proven in other contexts, these theoretical frameworks have yet to be applied to an academic, intersectional equity study. <br/><br/>The primary goal for the UCF ADVANCE Catalyst project is to conduct research that will inform strategies for minimizing inequities by specifically identifying the root causes and associated programmatic solutions of intersectional inequities. More specifically, the project will adopt an intersectional perspective to examine STEM faculty members? perceptions of issues related to departmental climate and perceived faculty ?fit.? The project will draw from organizational justice and authenticity frameworks, aiming to obtain systematic quantitative survey data from all STEM faculty and qualitative data through focus groups with STEM faculty at UCF. Findings will measure faculty members? perceptions of organizational authenticity and justice, determine if and how these perceptions vary intersectionally (i.e., by sex/gender, race/ethnicity, age, parental status, and first-generation status). These results will then be applied to actionable items for institutionalizing transparent practices that are intended to improve departmental culture, faculty satisfaction, and equality as embodied in a five-year STEM Faculty Equity Strategic Plan. Pilot programming will consist of departmental climate workshops that focus on open, equitable department dialogue to foster an inclusive climate. Additionally, STEM mentoring faculty communities will be held as a space to discuss the practices and goals being developed across departments, along with a mentoring community created to address needs identified through this project?s research. A Strategic Planning Working Group and STEM Equity Executive Leadership team will contribute to developing the strategic plan and overseeing the planning process, respectively. Findings will be shared with the ADVANCE community and others through a website, presentations, and peer-reviewed publications. <br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.

These batteries must be non-flammable and inexpensive because safety and cost are paramount concerns for large-scale battery installations. This CAREER project will conduct fundamental research on advanced battery materials that have the potential for greater energy density and cycle life, while operating in non-flammable water-based electrolytes. Among the possible grid-scale battery options, rechargeable Zn-MnO2 batteries are attractive because the basis materials are inexpensive, safe, and widely available. However, the reversibility of the MnO2 reaction requires the addition of Bi, sometimes paired with other transition metals such as Cu. However, the action of these additional metals at the molecular level is not known, and this knowledge is important to rationally engineer the material for optimal use. This project addresses this problem by using advanced characterization techniques to observe electrochemical interactions between MnO2 and the added metals in real time during battery cycling. The observed structure-function relationships will then be exploited to engineer the materials for improved batteries. An integrated education plan will develop materials and tools to train research students in effective scientific communication through the internet and blogging. This is because it would be transformational if every researcher had skills to communicate the importance of their work to the general public. Online materials will be produced about the importance of electrochemistry and energy storage, as well as online scientific educational materials for Boston area K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project will examine electrochemical mechanisms in electrodes with MnO2 that has been doped with one or more metal cations. Previous work has demonstrated that during cycling Bi promotes formation of a layered birnessite form of MnO2 that is disordered or lacking in long-range structural periodicity. Determination of atomic positions in such a material requires techniques based on short-range order such as X-ray and Raman spectroscopy. In the case where MnO2 is dual doped with Bi and Cu, the three metal atoms (Mn, Bi, and Cu) are all electrochemically active during battery operation, meaning interactions such as electron mediator effects between the metals may be important, and this will be assessed. Work will begin with the synthesis of well-characterized, crystalline model compounds of doped MnO2, from which structural motifs can be established and atomic positions can be refined. Information from these model compounds will then be used to characterize dynamic atomic positions and interactions in electrodes during cycling, as observed by operando techniques in real-world disordered materials. To understand the electrode system as a whole, solubility of the dopants will be probed to account for transport of species via the electrolyte, and the impact of Zn cations on the MnO2 mechanism will be studied. The insights gained will aid development of rechargeable Zn-MnO2 batteries, and also contribute to understanding the electrochemistry of multiple redox-active sites in layered materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If a child is diagnosed with head deformations, early and effective therapy can be initiated. Thus, a major impact of this project is significant reduction of the number of children with cranial deformations who remain untreated and are exposed to potential health risks. Improved clinical management of these conditions will potentially lower the associated healthcare costs and improve patient outcome. Our technology will be packaged as a smartphone or tablet app, enabling access to lower-resourced communities and patients without access to specialized  clinics, as well as enabling care in periods of social distancing and reduced clinical services. This project will ultimately increase awareness of the risks of head deformations and improve pediatric health outcomes.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop quantitative imaging and machine learning algorithms that accurately measure the cranial shape and size using photos of the infant head taken with a smartphone.

In this  project, we will fully automate the measurements using neural networks and maximize accuracy with regression models accounting for endogenous variables, such as sex and age. To generate accurate head shape measurements even during operation by novice users, our new algorithms based on machine learning will automatically select better images to detect and classify the type of cranial deformation. By addressing errors related to novice use of the tool, such as correcting for variations in the use of the camera, the technology will ensure compliance and accessibility to operators with variable technological skills. Furthermore, we will advance reconstruction of the three-dimensional cranial shape utilizing modern smart device technologies.

Unusually high temperatures cause a breakdown of the symbiosis between the coral host and its algal symbionts, resulting in an event called ?bleaching,? named for the characteristic white appearance of corals. Bleaching events are becoming more frequent and intense, and often result in coral mortality, ultimately compromising the structure and function of reef ecosystems. The molecular mechanisms responsible for coral bleaching are unknown, and the goal of this proposal is to identify such processes. The experimental and molecular work in this project will be supported by internships of Hawaiian students, which is a Broader Impact. Also, a Marine Biology Mentoring Program for female high school students will be developed, which will helps participants understand tangible pathways toward a career in science. Coral reefs are vulnerable habitats identified by domestic and international organizations as conservation priorities. Reefs provide important ecosystem services and coastal protection to people around the world. This work will identify the molecular mechanisms of coral bleaching, information that can help identify new ways to stop coral bleaching. This project serves the NSF mission because it promotes the progress of science. Since coral reefs are important for tourism, this research also advances the nation?s prosperity.<br/><br/>This research aims to define the molecular mechanisms contributing to coral bleaching to identify the causes of, and resilience to, bleaching. The project uses a framework in which ?pre-conditioned? Pocillopora acuta are used to examine short-term changes in thermal stress at the molecular level that will help define signaling pathways (e.g., NF-KappaB, MAP kinases) involved in the breakdown of symbiosis. Concurrently, existing genomic and transcriptomic data from known Montipora capitata colonies with a range of ?fixed? thermal tolerance will be mined for genomic candidates which influence thermal tolerance. These two datasets will provide targets for a recently developed siRNA knock-down of genes of interest in corals, thereby fortifying correlative and descriptive studies with experimental phenotyping via reverse genetics. Preconditioned P. acuta, thermally tolerant M. capitata and any successfully manipulated corals will be evaluated for DNA integrity during each experiment to describe the cellular outcomes of bleaching and potential consequences of ?improved? bleaching tolerance via human intervention. These aims will be supported by summer internships for local students and by a Marine Biology Mentoring Program that increases diversity in stem by providing hands-on experience in field and laboratory settings for female high school students. This work will deepen our mechanistic understanding of the coral-algal symbiosis and develop tools to analyze, compare and diagnose thermal tolerance, which are critical for the long-term persistence of reefs and the ecosystem services they provide.

Anatomy is the cornerstone of medical education with cadaver dissection serving as the gold standard teaching method. However, many students have limited or no access to cadavers during their academic experience.  Learning resources in human anatomy (textbooks, models, apps) are generally color-coded, computer-generated images that lack the complexities and appearance of cadavers. These learning materials do not match dissected specimens, making knowledge transfer more difficult.  To overcome these challenges, the proposed software will marry digital cadaveric models with captivating educational gaming strategies. The software will bring high-quality anatomy education to low resource settings in the U.S. and abroad.<br/><br/>The proposed project will incorporate principles of educational psychology and learning science to develop a gaming platform for healthcare professional students (e.g. medical, physical therapy, dental, physician assistant) to learn human anatomy.

A high percentage of software costs are consumed by efforts to find and fix software defects. It is now common to apply defect-finding techniques continuously throughout development and operation of software systems, reviewing every code change (Modern Code Review, abbreviated MCR) and testing the software for defects continuously (Continuous Integration, abbreviated CI). Unfortunately, these continuous defect-finding efforts incur high cost for software developers, and they provide limited success. The goal of this project is to reduce the unfruitful, manual effort that software developers spend on code reviews and continuous integration, while keeping as many of their fruitful tasks as possible. To achieve this goal, this project will develop techniques to automatically prioritize review and integration actions, giving higher priority to those that are more likely to find defects. This project will advance the understanding of what software changes are risky, which ones are better accepted by developers, and what makes developers trust automatically-targeted defect-finding techniques. It will also produce many techniques and tools to enable software engineers to find more software defects in less time. This project will benefit society by improving software reliability, as well as reducing its cost.<br/><br/>The project will conduct interviews to survey software engineers to understand the human factors that would impact the adoption of automated targeted MCR and CI techniques. The project works toward the achievement of three objectives using machine learning and search-based algorithms: reduce the size of the code changes for which MCR and CI get executed, by determining which code sections are unlikely to improve;  automatically carry out actions resulting from MCR and CI. The project will also investigate how to generate automated explanations of the decisions made using these techniques. The long-term vision is to provide an integrated system that automatically reduces the number and size of MCR and CI tasks, automatically performs some of them, and explains its automated decisions to software engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Toward meeting this need, the project will launch a project designed to align K-12 curricula with industry needs and to foster proficiency in cybersecurity for students in the Pittsburgh area. Through this project, the College aims to: (1) increase the number of students, especially students from underrepresented groups, in its cybersecurity-focused associate degree program in information technology; (2) improve instruction to better prepare students for the local cybersecurity workforce; and (3) introduce educational activities into secondary schools to prepare students for further education in cybersecurity. <br/><br/>The investigators will develop an innovative model for partnerships with high schools by collaborating with the Beaver County Career and Technology Center, which works with more than 17 high schools in the Pittsburgh area to prepare students in technical areas, including cybersecurity. To broaden participation in cybersecurity, the project team will target middle school and Career Tech Center students from underserved communities for participation in summer camps, cybersecurity competitions, conferences, and mentoring. To expand and strengthen cybersecurity instruction, the project team will engage teachers in applied active-learning-and-teaching methods using virtual lab environments and will offer workshops on curriculum development and topics in cybersecurity. To align the college's cybersecurity curriculum with needs of business and industry, the project team will enhance the advisory board's role in shaping the curriculum, providing presentations about the field, mentoring students, and designing internships and other pathways to jobs. The project will add instruction that helps students research the requirements for specific cybersecurity jobs and connect those requirements with the knowledge and skills they are developing in their coursework. The project evaluation will examine the effectiveness of virtual environments in training job-ready cybersecurity students, the effectiveness of industry-led approaches for encouraging high school students to apply to two-year cybersecurity programs, and the effectiveness of practices to engage business/industry partners in designing and developing curricula and recruiting students from underrepresented groups.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significantly, hormone actions on developmental physiological processes are complex, involving multiple hormones acting on one or more organs to achieve organismal-level responses. The goal of this project is to reveal how, at the molecular level, specific hormones determine which proteins are made and which development outcomes are achieved in the process of tail growth and tail resorption during metamorphosis in frog tadpoles. Such basic knowledge is critical for evaluating how changes in environmental conditions, such as climate change and the presence of various chemicals, may affect organismal morphology and physiology and may threaten human health. By identifying novel genes and hormone interactions, this research will open new avenues to study how and why individuals may respond differently to changing environmental conditions. In the course of these studies, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in basic research with applications relating to amphibian declines and climate change. An undergraduate laboratory course to teach hands-on skills in gene disruption technology, and hands-on research experiences for high school students, will be developed. These educational activities will support the goal of creating a well-prepared, innovative scientific workforce.<br/><br/>Amphibian tadpoles respond to the environment with life-or-death changes in growth and development mediated by hormone signaling. A critical knowledge gap exists as to how hormones act at the molecular level to determine physiological and developmental outcomes that affect individual fitness. The objective of this proposal is to explain how glucocorticoid hormones act on Xenopus tadpole tails to promote either an increase or decrease in tail size. Towards this end, the proposed research will identify the tissues, hormone receptors, cell changes, gene regulation, and hormone interactions involved. The central hypothesis is that alternative tail responses to glucocorticoids stem from receptor-specific actions on tail tissues, as governed by thyroid hormone signaling. In the course of testing this hypothesis, the research will: 1) identify glucocorticoid target tissues in the tail by identifying which cells express glucocorticoid receptor(s) during tail growth and resorption, 2) determine the requirement for glucocorticoid receptor(s) in regulating growth and resorption, and 3) examine tissue-specific and receptor-specific glucocorticoid-response gene regulation as influenced by thyroid hormone signaling. These analyses will use glucocorticoid-receptor mutant tadpoles to show receptor-specific actions regulating altered tail size. Prior lack of basic molecular genetic tools (i.e., glucocorticoid-receptor mutants and associated response genes) has impaired progress to explain how stress during development affects phenotypes in frogs and other vertebrates. Knowledge of the tissues, receptors, genes, and thyroid hormone-dependence of glucocorticoid response gene regulation will advance the long-term goal of explaining how the environment, via altered hormone levels, modulates developmental processes and results in phenotypic outcomes that shape health and fitness. The educational broader impacts of this research include training of graduate and undergraduate research students, development of a new undergraduate course in gene-manipulation technology, and providing hands-on activities for local high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High agility, maneuverability, and payload capacity, combined with a small footprint, make legged robots well suited to precision agriculture applications.  This project develops and experimentally validates a theoretical and computational framework for structurally compliant legged robots to navigate over natural terrain. A systematic series of experiments will show how increasing the degree of compliance in the robot structure -- from passive elasticity in hip and waist joints, to fully deformable chassis and legs -- affects the efficiency and resilience of locomotion.  The project integrates foundational robotics research on design, modeling, motion control, and planning into two educational and outreach programs across K-12 and higher education. The first is a robotics makerspace for undergraduate students at the University of California-Riverside, and the second is a robotics summer academy camp for female middle-school students. Both efforts capitalize on student diversity at UC Riverside, a Hispanic Serving Institution, to broaden participation of under-represented minority groups.<br/><br/>The project investigates how compliance embedded into a legged robot can be harnessed to facilitate control and computation, with an eye to enabling efficient and resilient navigation in real agricultural fields. Research activities innovate along three key foundational robotics research directions. 1) Hardware design and dynamic modeling: The project offers fundamental insights and develops models regarding the effect of various forms of compliance on center of mass motion and gait stabilization for certain classes of legged robots and introduces new hardware designs that can harness compliance and enable principles of morphological computation. 2) Locomotion control: The project establishes compliance-aware legged locomotion controllers according to principles of whole-body and central pattern generator-based control to enable efficient closed-loop legged locomotion over a range of engineered and natural unstructured terrains.  3) Non-holonomic motion planning and autonomous navigation: The project develops non-holonomic motion planners that rely upon and utilize distinctive features of robot body morphology and embedded compliance for efficiency and resilience during autonomous legged locomotion over real agricultural fields.  This research can transform the science and technology of autonomous legged robots by making them more efficient and resilient in their operation, and thus unlock legged robots? full potential in precision agriculture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The persistent achievement discrepancies between students of Color and White undergraduate engineering students are commonly blamed on students or their previous education rather than acknowledging that the tests themselves or testing process could be biased against test takers. Factors such as differing cultures, educational access, and test taking strategies all contribute to the test taking experience and can result in tests that are inherently easier or harder for different groups of students. Very little is known about how biases contribute to the problem of discrepancies in achievement between students of Color and their White peers in engineering. The research on test fairness in engineering education has been limited by the low representation of students of Color in engineering. This CAREER project will apply an innovative research approach for small sample sizes that will advance understanding about the role of cultural familiarity within the context of concept inventories. By answering the research questions, this CAREER project will build a firm foundation for a life-long leadership position in research on fair assessment practices and educational activities to train instructors in increasing the fairness of their classroom tests. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will inform the field of engineering education by identifying how engineering education instructors and researchers can increase the fairness of assessments. Through its integrated research and education plans, the work will improve decision-making in engineering education and achievement for students of Color. Because there are so few students of Color in engineering, traditional approaches to studying assessment bias cannot be used. This project will use an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach which integrates studies of item difficulty and discrimination for each group of students separately and then will conduct interviews to explain the quantitative findings and build theory. The new approaches and methods developed will lead to significant strides in solving the problem of unfair assessment in engineering education. The research questions will investigate: To what extent do items in these three assessments demonstrate adequate functioning for students of Color? To what extent do score discrepancies remain once inadequate items are removed? What are patterns of cultural familiarity and content of problematic items and items that show acceptable functioning? How do students of Color experience testing in concept inventories? In the education plan, findings will be applied to develop and disseminate educational materials for three primary groups of learners: (1) future engineering faculty, (2) current engineering faculty, and (3) minority- and women-in-engineering program staff. The findings will benefit society directly from the research outcomes, activities related to conducting the research in this project, and educational activities. The first research question provides important information concerning the extent to which unfairness in assessments contributes to disparities in achievement. The second and third research questions lead to principles for fair assessments that will be widely shared with engineering instructors and future faculty (via a graduate course and partnerships with national engineering education organizations); these will improve fairness for thousands of students across the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Healthcare providers are recognizing the growing imperative to lower costs and maintain quality of care by harnessing the digital health records available. In radiation oncology, only a small fraction of the valuable data produced during routine patient care is leveraged for the care of new patients. High-dose curative treatments frequently lead to side effects, such as dry mouth in head and neck cancer treatment, and rectal bleeding in prostate treatments. An optimized treatment plan could minimize complications. The proposed project will advance an information system to optimize and personalize radiation treatments. <br/><br/>The proposed project leverages radiotherapy data to optimize treatment plans. Dose to organs at risk (OARs) must be kept low while ensuring the prescribed dosimetric coverage of the targeted disease. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatments require significant optimization, creating extensive planning processes.  This project will advance a treatment plan database for a data-driven clinical decision support solution that can predict achievable dose levels to each OAR. These levels can be used as intelligent optimization objectives by the treatment planning system (TPS) and as plan evaluation criteria. The system will be built for continuous refinement through ongoing augmentation with new patient plans, thus improving prediction performance with ongoing use, and allowing each clinical site to base predictions on its own data.

This investment has helped markedly improve courses and programs at many universities by testing and sharing research-based practices that promote active learning, increase student motivation and engagement, diversify the field, and better prepare students for work. At the same time, the investment has typically focused on researchers collecting new data, resulting in hundreds of data sets that remain underexplored. These existing data sets have significant potential to be analyzed and even combined in new ways to further support large-scale changes in how we recruit, teach, and prepare engineering students for the demands and challenges of the 21st century. Currently, however, engineering education researchers do not have productive and effective ways for sharing and analyzing data beyond the original project. Thus the full potential of these data sets remains untapped. This project will address that gap by developing and promoting a viable approach that will enable researchers to leverage the rich data currently available. In doing so, it will simultaneously improve engineering education nationally and increase the return on investment of public funds. The project will bring experienced researchers together with those just beginning their careers to identify the major roadblocks to sharing and re-using data, develop strategies and practices for overcoming those roadblocks, and conduct a series of test cases that demonstrate how to put those strategies and practices into action. The results will help create a paradigm shift that can move both the study and the practice of engineering education in the U.S. to a new level and spur the kind of sea changes needed to keep the nation?s engineering workforce at the forefront of the global marketplace.<br/><br/>Changing the paradigm of single-use data collection is a high-risk proposition that requires actionable, proven practices for effective, ethical data sharing, coupled with sufficient incentives to both share and use existing data. To that end, this proposal draws together a team of experts to overcome substantial obstacles in data sharing and build a framework to guide secondary analysis in engineering education research. In particular, we will bring together established and emerging scholars to deliver a tested framework that outlines methodological best practices for formally and informally sharing data, making data sets public, combining data from different studies, performing secondary analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data, publishing and sharing the results, securing the needed funding, and ensuring that the work is valued in the field. To create this framework, the research team will hold a series of six workshops over two years. In the first year, we will bring highly respected, experienced researchers from institutions across the country together with newer researchers to create the initial framework for data sharing and data re-use. In the second year, we will test and refine that framework on two existing data sets. We will solicit data sets from the wider community, and invite teams of scholars to conduct secondary analysis on those data sets, in conversation with the original researchers. Importantly, in selecting both the data sets and the approaches to secondary analysis, we will emphasize methodological diversity to ensure that the framework is widely applicable. The outcome will be a framework document that will comprise a set of tested guidelines for data sharing and secondary analysis in engineering education research, distributed through both journals and workshops to promote widespread adoption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symbiotic interactions involving subsets of species can have disproportionate impacts on communities, reaching well beyond each interacting species. Coral reefs host some of the most iconic symbiotic interactions in nature and are host to the highest diversity of life on the planet. Cleaning symbiosis, wherein small fish or shrimp remove external parasites and associated microorganisms from specific clients, is common on coral reefs. Sites on the reef occupied by cleaners, or ?cleaning stations?, attract a wide variety of fish species that engage in direct physical contact with the cleaner. These highly used territories are viewed both as ?clinics of the sea?, where parasitized and sickly fish seek the service of cleaners, but also as potential ?garbage dumps?, where unnecessary parasites and other microorganisms are removed. This project seeks to understand the role of cleaning symbiosis transferring microbes in coral reef environments. This research supports training for U.S. graduate students and for undergraduates from Arkansas State University, a primarily undergraduate institution that includes a large population of first-generation college students. These students participate in field site research and have opportunities to visit the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for broader exposure to ocean science and more specific laboratory training. The project strengthens international collaboration and further builds on the existing relationships between the team of scientists and resource managers, local divers, fishers, and boat operators, as well as K-12 schools and environmental education programs, and will therefore contribute to local economies. Outreach efforts include a film highlighting this research and publicly accessible narratives shared through press releases and an on-line magazine.<br/><br/>While the benefits of cleaning to reef ecosystem health have been extensively studied, the cleaning costs for cleaner species and the role of cleaning stations as potential sinks for microbial diversity and possibly even pathogens have never been assessed. Here, the researchers utilize the unique features of cleaning stations to understand transfer of bacterial and archaeal symbionts amongst fish and within coral reef environment. The study capitalizes on cleanerfish access to multiple variety of hosts or clients within stations to address new questions about how cleanerfish act as vectors to transfer microorganisms between hosts on a reef and if and how these microorganisms may play a broader functional role in reef resilience. Specifically, the project addresses the following hypotheses: 1) Cleanerfishes serve as keystone regulators of microbial communities, enhancing microbial community diversity and transferring key microbial species between clients, and 2) Cleanerfishes are a particularly important contributor to reef resilience, facilitating recovery of the microbiome following disturbance. The research team uses an integrative interdisciplinary approach involving field and laboratory observations and experiments, and molecular-based tools. The core research team includes experts in cleaning mutualisms, fish behavior, coral reef ecology, and microbial ecology.

How the 2-meter-long primate DNA with 3-billion base pairs (bp) fit into a 10-micrometer nucleus has intrigued biologists for decades. Microscopy imaging and DNA sequencing methods have revealed distinct structural units of DNA territories and domains, which change dynamically when cells change fate or are under environmental stress. How these DNA structural domains functionally impact gene expression and cellular activity remains unclear. To address this important question, the project aims to develop a new CRISPR-based technology platform to reveal the causal relationship between the 3D genome organization and gene expression. The project will develop an online education platform consisting of hands-on curricula modules designed to stimulate broad interest on CRISPR gene editing among undergraduates and high school students. Students from diverse cultural or socio-economic backgrounds will gain exposure to cutting-edge genome editing tools, knowledge and techniques via the remote learning platform. These educational activities are expected to engage STEM students and teachers, promote participation of underrepresented groups, and inform and educate the public about the importance and responsible use of novel gene editing biotechnologies. The project will train graduate students in the field of genome editing and genomics for science communication, education and research.<br/><br/>The research objective of the project is to develop a novel CRISPR-based technology platform to elucidate dynamics and timescales of 3D chromatin interactions and their causal relationship to gene transcription. Preliminary work in the PIs lab has developed several CRISPR-based methods such as LiveFISH for live cell imaging, CRISPRa/i for transcription perturbation, and CRISPR-GO for inducible and reversable repositioning of genomic loci. The project will develop an integrated platform enabling simultaneous perturbation and multi-color imaging of any DNA/RNA/protein on super-resolution level over longitudinal timescales in single living neuron cells. Using induced human neurons as a model system, the specific scientific goals are to: 1) measure the timescales of chromatin looping at signal-stimulated gene loci via live-cell imaging in single neurons; 2) study dynamics of loop formation, mRNA transcription and protein translation via multiple-color super-resolution imaging after neuronal activation; 3) determine the mutual relationship between looping and transcription by targeted perturbation of gene transcription with CRISPRa/i or targeted perturbation of looping with CRISPR-GO. Successful completion of the project will reveal new knowledge of the chromatin loop formation and complexity and uncover their causal functional relationship to transcription and cell activity. The insights gained by this research are expected to form the biotechnology basis that can be used to manipulate and engineer the 3D genome for future functional genomics research.

Estuaries produce highly productive recreational and commercial fisheries that feed billions and drive economies. Many large-scale ecosystem restoration efforts target changes in freshwater systems that impact the functioning, productivity, and biodiversity of downstream coastal waters.  Simultaneously, environmental variability is driving changes in sea-level, temperature, and precipitation that are influencing the same characteristics of these same estuarine systems. The ecosystem model developed by this research will help resource managers and restoration practitioners design and plan for beneficial outcomes for coastal ecosystems given the complex interactions of these co-occurring drivers of change.<br/><br/>Modeling, prediction, and analysis of ecosystems impacted by the coupled effects of environmental variability and large-scale restoration efforts will lead to new knowledge of spatial and temporal estuarine ecosystem responses to these large-scale drivers. The project addresses the following questions: 1) How will changes in salinity range and variability, water depth, temperature, and bottom sediments affect the distribution of fishes, invertebrates, and seagrass coverage in estuaries? 2) How will future spatial and temporal ecosystem changes, resulting from the interactions of hydrological restoration and environmental change, affect productivity, fisheries landings, and food web structure in estuaries?

Model reduction (complexity reduction) has become a ubiquitous tool that makes these repeated numerical simulations computationally tractable by exploiting intrinsic low-rank structures in the system dynamics. However, most of today's model reduction methods exploit linear structures that are present only in a limited class of problems, which excludes, for example, important problems with transport phenomena that describe waves and other moving coherent structures. This severely limits the use of today's model reduction methods in a wide range of applications from multi-phase problems in materials science to combustion in engineering to pattern formation in biology. The goal of this project is to develop new types of model reduction methods at the intersection of machine learning, numerical analysis, and scientific computing that exploit nonlinear structures to make tractable repeated simulations of transport phenomena to support scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The nonlinear model reduction techniques proposed in this project will derive reduced solutions on manifolds as compositions of low-rank approximations. This means that the traditional linear vector-space structure of today's model reduction methods is given up in favor of increased expressiveness (""breaking the Kolmogorov barrier""). The work packages are as follows: (i) New approximation theory concepts will be developed to show for prototypical transport-dominated partial differential equations that the proposed reduced models break the Kolmogorov barrier of today's linear model reduction methods, meaning the best-approximation error of the proposed nonlinear models decays exponentially faster than the best-approximation error of linear models. (ii) Numerical methods will be proposed that exploit the nonlinear low rankness of the composed approximations of the proposed nonlinear reduced models to achieve speedups compared to traditional models. The nonlinear solutions will be numerically computed by integrating in time the governing equations to ensure that the nonlinear reduced models generalize well to new inputs/parameters, in contrast to purely relying on data-fitted maps without going back to the governing equations. (iii) Two real-world applications in collaborations with domain scientists in storm-surge forecasting and additive manufacturing will demonstrate that the proposed techniques have the potential to impact a wide range of applications that currently are limited by prohibitively expensive simulations of transport phenomena. (iv) Integrated education components such as interactive online courses via flipped classrooms, tutorials for engineers, and outreach activities building on the two real-world applications in storm-surge forecasting and additive manufacturing will educate a broad audience and ensure relevance in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is generally thought that, in order to be species-rich, a lineage must also be ecologically diverse. Yet, this is not always the case. This proposal focuses on woodland salamanders (genus Plethodon), a highly diverse amphibian lineage in the Appalachian region of eastern North America. This lineage is renowned for high species richness despite little ecological diversity. Nonetheless, the story of the Plethodon radiation has largely been studied from a single niche axis ? that of structural habitat use and corresponding morphology. Just as important, but largely ignored, is thermal and hydric habitat use, and how interactions with climatic factors may generate biodiversity. As lungless salamanders, these organisms perform a delicate dance with their thermal and hydric environments to ensure cutaneous respiration. This award centers around discovering how physiological diversity is structured across the lineage, and how physiological evolution contributes to the high species diversity of Plethodon. This award is important because it will advance our understanding of how biodiversity originates. Specifically, the researchers will unpack how diversification (or lack thereof) along several ecological axes sculpts broad-scale patterns of species richness. The award is also important because it will provide detailed and updated information about salamander vulnerability to ongoing environmental change. This project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates and high school students.<br/><br/>Theory suggests that disparity in biodiversity reflects ecological differences among lineages. At one extreme, adaptive radiation is characterized by rapid and prolific diversification into numerous ecological niches and, at the other end, lineages with low ecological diversity also tend to have few species. So-called ?non-adaptive? radiations occupy an enigmatic middle ground characterized by high species richness despite low ecological diversity. Perhaps most famous among these radiations are the plethodontid (lungless) salamanders. This lineage is renowned for long-term morphological stasis, suggesting that diversification has been driven by neutral processes. Using a series of phylogenetic causal models, the researchers will explore evolutionary patterns of physiological diversity, and determine their causal mechanism(s). Then, using evolutionary rate matrices, the researchers will compare rates and patterns of morphological and physiological evolution. Then, the researchers will explore the physiological correlates of species? distributions to explore why the Appalachian region is so species rich in lungless amphibians. Lastly, using a series of new mechanistic models, the researchers will explore how salamander distributions will be altered over the next century.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A single component being slower than expected can drive the entire system into unpredictable and catastrophic behaviors that result into the entire system being unavailable for long periods of time, disrupting all services?human and automated?that depend on it. For the longest time, the research community has been trying to understand the performance of these complex systems in a best-effort way: deploying the system and observing its behavior in a number of test scenarios. The complexity of these systems, however, makes it impossible to thoroughly test everything that can go wrong. Inevitably some corner case emerges which drives our deployed system to its knees and we discover?too late?that our testing was not thorough enough. This proposal puts forward a rigorous way of reasoning about the performance of our systems: leveraging the recent advances in formal reasoning to allow programmers to systematically develop rigorous guarantees about the duration and speed of the system?s executions.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to solidify the foundation on which our future systems will be built. It uses formal reasoning to provide guarantees?not expectations?about how our systems will behave in practice. For the end users this means that the computer services they use every day will be more cost-effective and more reliable. Achieving these benefits, however, requires more than research. The proposal puts forth an educational plan for bringing verification closer to practicality by introducing it to current and future engineers by means of a new class on verification, an ongoing verification summer school, and a book on how to apply formal verification to real-world systems. Together, the research and educational objectives of this proposal aim to make formal reasoning an integral part of computing.

Hydrocephalus is a common condition, affecting 1 million Americans, and over 1 in 1,000 live births. It is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, and nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a tube, known as a shunt, to drain this excess CSF away from the brain and into a distal absorptive site within the body. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates, approaching 100% over 10 years, and diagnosing shunt malfunction is extremely challenging owing to a combination of varied causes, nonspecific symptoms, and the absence of a technology to directly quantify shunt patency. Consequently, shunt-related procedures and admissions significantly burden patients, their caregivers and hospitals, costing the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually. Additionally, the inability to monitor patients at home, coupled with the potential for shunt failure and the uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis disrupts patients? quality of life, and frequently results in unnecessary hospital admission and imaging. This project advances a wireless, wearable sensor that can noninvasively measure flow through shunts.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a new sensor for shunts. The sensor is based on advances in soft, flexible electronics and relies on measurements of thermal transport to detect flow through underlying skin layers. When placed on skin overlying a shunt, the sensor will measure both the presence and magnitude of flow of CSF, and transmit these data wirelessly to a receiver, such as a smartphone or tablet, where it can be viewed through a software application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will be specifically aimed at developing the technology for home use and will include features that support long-term measurements, including a rechargeable battery, charging station and cloud data support. The ability to routinely monitor patients with hydrocephalus at home is currently unavailable, and if successful, our sensor will allow for a deeper understanding of CSF hydrodynamics. These data will be used to develop an algorithm to detect long-term trends, with a view to understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing shunt failure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the sheer size and evolving nature of these graphs, processing them via traditional algorithms is often no longer a viable option. As a result, there is a rapidly growing interest in developing algorithms that explicitly account for the restrictions of processing massive graphs. Graph streaming algorithms have been particularly successful in this regard; these are algorithms that process input graphs by making one or few passes over their edges while using a limited memory, much smaller than the input size. This project focuses on further developing the theoretical foundations of graph streaming algorithms: what graph problems can be addressed efficiently via streaming algorithms, what are the inherent limitations of streaming algorithms, and how these limitations can be mitigated through better modeling assumptions? The research directions in this project go hand-in-hand with educational initiatives such as integrating related topics in advanced courses that provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and introducing high-school students to exciting ideas in theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>More specifically, the focus of this project is on understanding the powers and limitations of graph streaming algorithms for several foundational problems such as coloring, matching, reachability, shortest path, and minimum cut. These are among the most studied problems in theoretical computer science with an extremely broad range of applications. However, despite significant attention, many fundamental questions regarding these problems have remained unanswered in the streaming model. This research focuses on resolving some of these questions and moving toward determining the optimal bounds on the tradeoff between space, number of passes, and approximation ratio of graph streaming algorithms for these problems. This project plans to achieve this goal by designing and analyzing better streaming algorithms as well as using communication games as a powerful tool to prove lower bounds for these problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their high production speeds and ability to precisely place droplets of various organic and inorganic materials, these types of processes have been adopted in a variety of important applications. However, current inks used in droplet-based printing are largely limited to a single material. As such, scaling to multi-layer structures comprised of multiple materials requires an additional printhead for each material and additional time to sequentially deposit each material layer, making single printhead approaches prohibitively costly and time consuming.

Such complex films, incorporating a wide variety of organic and inorganic materials, are increasingly finding application in diverse areas such as electronics, energy devices, optical and mechanical coatings, biological materials, and pharmaceuticals.

Significant progress has been made towards the automation and optimization of circuits, especially digital logic circuits, via computer-aided design techniques. In fact, the advent of digital synthesis, or the automated design of digital circuits by computers, has brought hardware into reality which was previously thought impossible, such as microprocessors with billions of transistors occupying form-factors of a few square-cm and capable of performing billions of mathematical operations per second. Presently, the underlying circuit components of a system are designed separately from the electromagnetic (EM) blocks, often by different engineers or even different institutions altogether. Unfortunately, most EM devices such as antennas, microwave devices, and even nanophotonic devices in photonic integrated circuits must be painstakingly designed manually from the ground up by a human engineer. This process is not only tedious and time-consuming, but also suboptimal and often leaves significant performance gains on the table due to the enormous degrees of freedom available for designing such devices which are impossible for a human to explore. This project aims to tackle these issues by developing an automated synthesis platform for EM devices, analogous in spirit to digital logic synthesis, which will save human engineers significant time spent designing these devices manually and lead to novel, non-intuitive structures. This will be the first generalized synthesis platform which can handle a wide class of devices across the EM spectrum. This research will be complemented by an educational plan which includes the development of a new graduate class, training graduate and undergraduate students in multi-disciplinary fields, and motivating K-12 students to pursue careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Analytical solutions for Maxwell's equations, which describe all EM devices, do not exist except for simple toy problems. This significantly complicates the design of new EM devices and requires heuristic approaches and many time-consuming manual parameter sweeps. Despite the potential for unprecedented performance and time savings, there does not presently exist an automated synthesis framework for general EM devices which can operate with modest computing power. This project will lead to the design of such an automated EM synthesis platform by developing a scripting language to describe arbitrary EM devices in both the optical and radio-frequency regimes, advancing high-speed EM simulation methods based on boundary integral equations to decrease compute time and memory required by several orders of magnitude, and leveraging automated optimization algorithms capable of realizing new devices with little to no human intervention. The long-term goal of the project is to enable even the nonexpert with only modest computing capability, such as a desktop workstation, to design many types of different electromagnetic devices rapidly and efficiently in a matter of minutes to hours.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hyper-inflammation is a mis-regulation of the immune system often brought on by viral pneumonia. It can have severe life-threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and changes in blood clotting; hyper-inflammation has been seen in COVID-19 patients. Secondary conditions caused by hyper-inflammation can also have severe long-term consequences to patient health. This project will develop therapeutics that quiet the systemic mis-regulation of the immune system and reduce patient mortality. <br/><br/>The proposed project will advance a treatment for hyper-inflammation, such as that induced by COVID-19. It arises from multiple stimuli and results in life-threatening mis-regulation of the immune system. With a novel molecular target, a new class of anti-fibrotic compounds have the potential to reduce cytokine levels and pro-coagulation factors, acting broadly to address the heterogeneity of inflammation responses. As information becomes available regarding the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19, relevant biomarkers have been proposed.  To demonstrate robust actions on inflammation this project will evaluate the effects of the therapeutic on 1) pro-inflammatory cytokine release, 2) activation of the innate immune system, and 3) systemic concentrations of cytokines and pro-coagulation factors after initiation of inflammation. Biomarkers will be established to track the efficacy of the therapeutic at early and late stages of inflammation, providing a strong rationale for testing the efficacy of this class of compounds in animal models of inflammation. Importantly, with the successful completion of this project, this class of therapeutics will have demonstrated potential to treat hyper-inflammation, coupled with a demonstrated ability to prevent pulmonary fibrosis, a potentially fatal complication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wearable robots, such as powered exoskeletons, promise to improve our productivity, health, and independence by augmenting, preserving, and restoring our ability to move. However, existing powered exoskeletons are heavy and inefficient, which largely prevents them from being used in real life. Existing powered exoskeletons apply assistance to each wearer's joint separately, which requires many actuators and large batteries. In contrast, the powered exoskeletons created in this project will use bio-inspired actuation systems that concurrently assist multiple wearer?s joints, much like human muscles. Because one exoskeleton actuator assists multiple wearer?s joints, fewer actuators will be needed. Because energy is transferred between joints instead of being dissipated, smaller and lighter actuators and batteries will be needed. The multidisciplinary research team of roboticists, movement scientists, and clinicians will work closely with individuals with disabilities, broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>Ambulation requires considerable energy to accelerate and decelerate the limb segments and to dynamically support the body against gravity. Human ambulation is highly efficient and stable because of the passive dynamics of the leg and the elastic properties of the muscles, and also because many muscles span multiple joints, actively transferring energy between joints. In contrast, existing powered exoskeletons are designed and controlled considering each actuated joint as a separate unit, independent from the others, even when multiple joints are actuated. This approach disrupts the natural dynamics of ambulation, resulting in less efficient and less stable gait. The goal of this project is to address this fundamental gap by developing energy-conserving mechanisms and control algorithms inspired by human ambulation. We will optimize the energy exchange across multiple joints for the design and control of powered exoskeletons by studying how humans adapt to the assistance concurrently provided by a powered exoskeleton to multiple leg joints, on different anatomical planes, or during different ambulation activities. We will then design powered exoskeletons that can allow for energy transfer between different joints, conserving energy within the system, while improving metabolic cost, muscle effort, and stability of the wearer.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many chemical reactions require catalysts to proceed at and acceptable rate. A common characteristic of one important type of catalysts is their ability to gain and lose electrons; that is to participate in oxidative or reductive processes. Since many of these catalysts contain expensive metals such as platinum, there is great interest in discovering similar catalysts based on less expensive components. In this project, the preparation of bismuth compounds that are capable of the sort of gain/loss of electrons typical of platinum is being explored. The project focuses on bismuth because it is much cheaper and environmentally more benign than platinum. In addition to the scientific project, there is an educational component that involves close collaborations with local programs and science teachers. It will engage middle and high school students, especially Native Hawaiian, and other underrepresented students.<br/><br/>Bismuth is inexpensive, abundant, and non-toxic. This project aims at synthesizing bismuth compounds that mimic the reactivity of noble metal transition metal complexes.

These involve hypervalent bismuth compounds with an expanded coordination number that can cycle between oxidation states Bi(III)/Bi(V) and Bi(I)/Bi(III). These attributes are to be used to facilitate a selective organofluorine transfer, a pharmaceutically relevant transformation that is often challenging.

Today?s lithium (Li)-ion and emerging Li metal-based batteries have high energy densities, but they suffer from safety and performance issues along with increasing concerns about scarcity of Li resources. Calcium (Ca) presents a compelling alternative as the basis for next-generation batteries: it is the 5th most abundant element in the earth?s crust, and batteries utilizing Ca metal anodes are projected to have energy storage capabilities comparable to Li counterparts with potential for improved safety. However, development of Ca batteries has been hindered by numerous challenges, including formation of blocking interfaces on Ca metal anodes that impede reversibility, and the need to design electrolytes specifically optimized for divalent Ca ion electrochemistry. This research will build the fundamental understanding of Ca-based electrochemical reactions and the resulting interfaces on Ca metal. To achieve these aims, this research will create tools to conduct novel experimental, quantitative analysis of Ca electrolyte and interface thermochemistry that will guide design of improved Ca batteries. As an additional outcome of the work, middle-school students will engage in active virtual teaching modules that use outcomes of this research while fulfilling a Massachusetts state education standard, bringing exposure to scientists and engineers and motivating pursuit of STEM careers.<br/><br/>This research effort will conduct a targeted experimental study of the chemical, thermodynamic and interface parameters that govern Ca ion redox behavior and elucidate Ca solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) chemistry and properties. The central hypothesis guiding this work is that the heightened degrees of freedom in Ca2+ ion solvation present new opportunities to intervene in electrochemical pathways, which can allow reversibility and reaction selectivity to be unlocked if better understood. The tools to be developed to test this hypothesis include a new thermodynamic framework for measuring the solvated Ca state using reaction calorimetry; metal deposition methodologies to prepare high-quality Ca metal interfaces for fundamental study; an operando approach to probe the chemical dynamics of Ca SEI formation; and a cathode conversion reaction involving Ca and CO2 to test and strengthen understanding of how Ca2+ solvation affects reactivity. The results will be integrated to identify the fundamental origins that determine electrochemical parameters: redox potential, Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and rate capability, and therein identify strategies to improve them. Collectively, this work will yield progress in anode, cathode, and electrolyte aspects of Ca batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen-rich materials, mimicking the elusive solid metallic phase of hydrogen, can be metalized at much lower pressures, promoting high-Tc superconductivity at much lower pressures. The primary goal of this project is to synthesize novel hydrogen rich, room temperature or above room temperature superconducting materials at ambient pressure for practical applications, such as advanced power grids, new transportation, medical imaging, and scanning techniques such as MRI and magnetocardiography, and faster, more efficient electronics for digital logic and memory device technology. The project also provides an important research infrastructure for high pressure experiments with capabilities of addressing a diverse set of problems in materials science.

Groups receiving direct support include graduate students gaining access to large user facilities and learning necessary research skills; local high school teachers collaborating with the principal investigator on direct application of classroom concepts; research opportunities for first-generation college, low-income, and underrepresented minority students; and improving and building upon resources available to the Deaf community. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The properties of quantum materials are anomalously sensitive to external stimuli such as pressure, which give rise to exotic and often unprecedented properties. The long-standing quest for room-temperature or warm superconductivity has been reinvigorated by the discovery of high Tc superconductivity in a new class of dense, hydrogen-rich materials?superhydrides. The superhydrides rely on the role of the dissociation of the hydrogen molecules, which provide the extra electrons needed in energy states near the Fermi level. However, thus far, theoretical and experimental studies are mainly focused on binary superhydrides. The efforts envisioned in this project represent a natural and timely research direction to discover and understand structure, chemical bonding, and stability of novel ternary and quaternary superconductors with Tc comparable to or higher than room temperature and via compositional tuning, lowering the transition pressure while preserving the superconducting properties. Furthermore, in order to understand the quantum nature of these hot superconductors, there is a major need for absolute temperature measurements in high pressure experiments. To remedy this need, Nitrogen vacancy centers provide a new way to potentially determine the in-situ temperature measurement for compressed materials into the Mbar range, which would be revolutionary. Careful thermal measurements would likely increase the ability to measure the heat capacity on superconducting superhydrides, which is a superior test for superconductivity. The work will allow the research team to obtain insight into superconductivity more broadly including the stabilities, and as such, to the design of a new class of warm quantum materials for transformative technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organisms have widely-adapted a highly conserved process to anticipate our 24-hr planetary cycles, termed circadian rhythms, making them a fundamental ?rule of life? on planet Earth. Circadian rhythms are controlled by a molecular ?clock? that tunes organismal physiology to time a wide variety of cellular functions. Understanding how this clock times physiology is vital as the dysregulation of circadian rhythms can impact a wide array of critical biological functions in most organisms. Though the clock mechanism was presumed to be buffered against changes in an organism?s environment, contemporary research shows that environmental fluctuations can alter circadian regulation at the cellular level through as yet unknown mechanisms and the goals of this research are to identify how environmental signals are incorporated into the circadian timing of a cell. This project will also use the circadian clock to educate future scientists at the college and pre-school levels in the scientific method. As the creation of experimental and computational biological data has surpassed the education of biological researchers in data analytics, the principal investigator will implement a biological data analytics program at the undergraduate level to develop an understanding of how data analytics can solve biological problems. These undergraduate researchers will then work with the Rensselaer Science Ambassadors to reach out to local preschools to teach young children about the scientific method using the growth and tracking of sunflower movements as a model of the circadian clock in an effort to increase STEM interest in underserved communities. <br/><br/>The specific objectives of this project are to use computational and molecular approaches to identify and validate the mechanisms by which environmental signals are integrated into the circadian programing of cellular physiology. The molecular clock that drives circadian rhythms has been long believed to be buffered from environmental insult, theoretically acting as a fixed switch that turns a specific set of genes on during the day and off again at night. Contrary to this theory, recent data has shown there is flexibility in circadian regulation, demonstrating that environmental signals can be transduced into the clock?s control of transcript and protein levels. However, there is no mechanistic comprehension of how systemic integration of environmental signals into circadian molecular programing occurs. The data that the investigators have gathered on transcripts and proteins over circadian time from the model organism Neurospora crassa, along with the computational algorithms that they have built to analyze this data, suggest potential mechanisms for the integration of environmental signals into the circadian clock. Therefore, the scientific goals of this proposal are to utilize novel computational approaches to predict specific points at which environmental signals are integrated into circadian transcriptional and translational programming. The investigators will then use this exquisitely tractable circadian model organism to biochemically validate these predictions. This research will contribute to the understanding of how environmental signals are integrated into circadian regulation, which will serve as a model for signal integration in other cellular regulatory systems. This project will also develop novel computational tools with which to study many types of oscillations across research systems.

In anticipation of climate change and increasing demand for food, there is an urgent need to understand how ABA controls plant tolerance to stress as a first step in developing crops with greater resilience to stress. At the cellular level, plant stress responses can be controlled in various ways: DNA transcription into mRNA can be regulated, as can the translation of mRNA into proteins, which are ultimately responsible for executing the response. This project aims to discover all of the mRNAs translated into proteins that occur in the model Arabidopsis plant in response to ABA.  The ultimate goal of this project is to understand the global and gene-specific regulation of transcription and translation that gives rise to plant stress tolerance. This research will have important impacts on society by providing crucial information needed to breed crop plants that better adapt to environmental stress. In addition to offering interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in genomics, bioinformatics, and plant molecular biology, this project will be integrated with undergraduate research programs and will engage the research community by organizing a workshop to teach others how to do similar research with other plants.<br/><br/>This research will test the hypothesis that genes/transcript isoforms whose translation increases in response to ABA enhance plant tolerance to stress. Cutting-edge Ribo-seq and RNA-seq techniques, newly developed computational analyses, and advanced molecular biology tools will be applied. Specific aims include (1) the profiling of the translational dynamics of individual genes and the characterization of genes that are translationally regulated in response to ABA, (2) the investigation of the selective translation of transcript isoforms in response to ABA, and (3) the identification and characterization of novel ABA-regulated translated sORFs. Together, these results will provide comprehensive insights into posttranscriptional regulation in stress responses and enable the development of crops that more rapidly respond to and tolerate environmental stress.

As the vulnerability of the AI/ML lifecycle becomes increasingly apparent, organizations that rely on the consistency and integrity of their AI/ML are faced with the difficult task of assuring AI/ML security.  Along with challenges involved with tailoring the concept of zero trust into such environments, assuring security also needs to be accomplished quickly. The cost to develop and implement a single AI/ML model can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the malicious alteration of AI/ML models, model features, and training data that effectively poison AI/ML can negate the return on this substantial investment. Such poisoning attacks are a nascent threat that is expected to become widespread as malicious actors gain technical ability. This susceptibility of AI/ML to poisoning attacks poses a severe national security concern as AI/ML has become central to mission-critical defense and intelligence capacities.  <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a lifecycle management tool utilizing blockchain technology. The proposed innovation will enable users to store, train, and deploy data, AI/ML models, and model features, with each transaction or attempted transaction.  These transactions will be immutably logged to provide an audit trail, ensuring that nothing stored on the blockchain can be surreptitiously altered. These project goals are to determine how the use of blockchain technology may enhance the security of the AI/ML lifecycle.  The technology may be used to analyze the AI/ML lifecycle security concerns and foci of stakeholders including intelligence agencies, academia, commercial businesses, and machine learning engineers.  The project will also help determine if practical solutions exist for engineers to secure the machine learning lifecycle, examine economic models that inform the tradeoff of security, cost efficiency, awareness of virtual structure as it relates to the concept of ?Zero AI Trust?, and test usability in machine learning lifecycle management tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It intends to do so by developing a STEM Master Teaching Fellowship (MTF) model designed to produce master teachers who are technically, culturally, and pedagogically proficient. Chicago faces a crisis in teacher retention, particularly for STEM teachers in high-need school districts. The average school in Chicago Public Schools turns over 50% of its teachers every five years. Each year almost a third of the 520 Chicago Public schools have trouble filling one or more teaching positions. The high attrition rate combined with the general scarcity of STEM teachers is creating an acute shortage of teachers in high-need schools. This project intends to design an MTF model that serves diverse, high-need communities and addresses the causes of teacher attrition. The project will identify, recruit, and select exemplary teachers to the MTF program. This project will extend the current mentoring of new STEM teachers from one year to beyond the third year, the point at which teacher attrition increases sharply. <br/><br/>This Capacity Building project at Northeastern Illinois University includes partnerships with Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges of Chicago, and the New Teacher Center. Goals of the project are to (1) build the capacity of key stakeholders to share expertise and resources and to build a strong community of practice; (2) develop a mentorship and instructional coaching model rooted in culturally relevant, culturally sustaining, and community immersive STEM teaching; and (3) build capacity for in-person, hybrid, and virtual coaching and mentorship that addresses teachers? ability to design instruction and facilitate learning remotely. The theoretical basis for the project?s design resides in research literature on teacher leader development.  It stresses activities and experiences that promote development of highly effective STEM teaching skills, knowledge of community, culturally relevant and culturally sustaining pedagogy, and the ability to skillfully deliver STEM content virtually.  The project anticipates that teacher leaders with these skills and knowledge will have the potential to transform high-need schools and ameliorate high turnover and remediation needs. The project intends to conduct a needs-analysis to identify gaps in current CPS teachers? pedagogy and cultural competency and deficiencies in CPS STEM student learning outcomes. The MTF program will be designed to address the identified gaps. The analysis will also include remote and hybrid mentoring for new teachers. Potential contributions to the field are high as the project disseminates key findings locally, regionally, and nationally through STEM partnerships and conferences. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

This proposed project, based on evidence-based research in learning in informal environments, will deliver monthly personalized informal learning plans to enable parents to catalyze positive STEM experiences for girls early in their learning journeys so that they are more likely to embrace STEM careers and better positioned to secure them in the future.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform the way young girls perceive and engage in STEM career exploration by providing a progressive playlist of STEM informal learning experiences personalized to their unique interests. This is accomplished through a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven recommender system that learns from user preferences and attributes to recommend content and learning experiences, which are meant to increase STEM confidence and interest for young girls as well as inspire their curiosity. Parents can opt to provide immediate feedback on the recommended plan that further tunes the plan to their child?s needs or swap selections with secondary recommendations. The proposed project?s objectives are to develop and test algorithmic model for sequenced recommendations, design and build the prototype application, and conduct research to determine that personalized recommendation sequences deepen and/or expand STEM knowledge and interests. To guide the development, efficacy of the recommender will be assessed by comparing results from conducting studies using human recommendations with results using the AI recommender.

This reduction in human effort comes at a cost: in existing systems, human operators implicitly define high-level system objectives through their actions; autonomous systems lack this guidance.  Popular design techniques for autonomy such as those based on deep reinforcement learning obtain such guidance from user-specified, state-based reward functions or user-provided demonstrations. Unfortunately, such techniques generally do not provide guarantees on the safe behavior of the trained controllers. This project argues for a different approach where mathematically unambiguous, system-level behavioral specifications expressed in temporal logic are used to guide deep reinforcement learning algorithms to train neural network-based controllers.

This project seeks to understand if alternating assistance and resistance with a wearable ankle exoskeleton will elicit greater improvements in walking than either approach alone. The outcomes of this project have the potential to transform the treatment of walking disabilities across a wide range of conditions. Through a new curriculum in assistive robotics and engineering, this project aims to motivate engineering students to address the challenges experienced by individuals with disabilities and improve engineering education on human-centered design.<br/><br/>The purpose of this CAREER project is to develop a holistic treatment framework for gait rehabilitation based on the hybrid application of adaptive assistance and resistance and apply it to the treatment of ankle plantar-flexor dysfunction. The first objective is to establish foundational knowledge on the hybrid delivery of adaptive plantar-flexor assistance and resistance across different severities of walking impairment. The second objective is to develop a framework to optimize the long-term delivery of the hybrid exoskeleton therapy through the use of a holistic performance metric, accounting for both spatiotemporal and neuromuscular outcomes, and an artificial neural network to learn from participant responses over time. The third objective is to validate the hybrid optimization framework against training with assistance and resistance alone and compare hybrid exoskeleton training to standard gait training. This CAREER project is expected to pioneer the development of long-term human-in-the-loop optimization techniques to deliver lasting improvements in neuromuscular function and walking ability. This project will establish fundamental knowledge on the interplay between disease severity and wearable assistance and resistance. The strategies developed will be generalizable, enabling other investigators to apply this framework to different types of control algorithms, devices, joints, and patient populations.

Hydrogen peroxide is an environmentally friendly oxidant that is used in many applications including water treatment, textile and wood-pulp bleaching, the electronics industry, and personal protective equipment sterilization.  Currently, industrial production of hydrogen peroxide is dominated by the environmentally destructive anthraquinone process.   One approach of specific interest is based on using electrochemistry and two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials composed of carbon and boron, whereby physical hole defects and functional groups in these structures promote hydrogen peroxide synthesis. Under this award, the Groves research team will model the ability of acidic functional groups to produce hydrogen peroxide when the size of adjacent physical hole defects is varied.  Physical systems will be prepared to validate quantum chemical predictions derived from the computational studies.  This project will be integrated into Dr. Groves? senior chemistry laboratory course as one of several educational experiments performed over the semester, providing students a course-based research experience.  These new teaching practices, as well as a flipped classroom instruction approach, will be assessed in this senior lab setting to determine their impact toward improved student success.  Additionally, this course is a part of a scientific outreach program particularly directed at elementary/middle school students through CSUF?s Kids 2 College program, with hands-on demonstrations that borrow from Dr. Groves' research project.  <br/> <br/>Dr. Michael Groves of California State University-Fullerton is investigating processes for H2O2 synthesis. A particular focus is the computational quantification of the electrochemical properties of physical hole defects on functionalized boron, carbon, and boron-carbon 2D materials for the two-electron reduction of oxygen (O2) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).  This project has the potential for a much broader impact on 2D materials and electrochemistry by testing the hypothesis that the acidity of functional groups (alcohol, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid) can be modified by adjacent physical hole defects in graphene, borophene and hybrid materials, and that this will influence the electrochemical reduction of O2 to H2O2.  The newly developed Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics framework is being used for this project to ensure that the density functional theory calculations properly describe electrochemical conditions. First, an evolutionary algorithm, enhanced by agglomerative clustering, whereby each restart will search in a unique region of the potential energy surface, is being employed to determine the morphology of these carbon/boron 2D materials as a function of physical hole defect size.  As global minimum candidates are identified for each physical hole size and material, the acidity of all combinations of two functional groups from the set (alcohol, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid) will be determined.  The most acidic, least acidic, and two structures with intermediate acidities for each material will then used to calculate the barriers for the electrochemical reduction of O2 to H2O2.  Experimental collaborators at the University of Manchester are working alongside the Groves team to synthesize promising candidates to support the development of structure-activity relationships.  Finally, Dr. Groves will be incorporating this project into the senior physical chemistry laboratory as an extended course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE).

The interface of prosody with other parts of the AAL grammar is not well-understood. This project responds to an important need to extend linguistic analyses and tools to better understand the prosodic systems at work in AAL and its different varieties.<br/><br/>The project will pioneer inclusive tools and methods capable of reaching a wide range of AAL speakers and communities, combining community-based prosodic fieldwork and large-scale, web-based corpus analysis. Fieldwork sites include an isolated homogenous community in a small town in the Southern U.S., and a heterogenous community in the small city in the Northern U.S. The project adapts standardly-used prosodic fieldwork elicitation tasks to analyze prosodic interfaces with semantics, syntax, and discourse context in language production and comprehension. Psycholinguistic methods to enrich the tasks to explain variation within and across speakers will be incorporated. Experimental design for field- and large-scale web-based production and comprehension studies will also be informed by data-driven computational pattern discovery of how prosodic AAL structures are conveyed on Twitter in written form.

Development of this platform may benefit the healthcare system by improving the accessibility of diagnostic and prognostic testing that requires a panel of measurements. Specifically, there is potential for an early-stage Lyme disease (LD) diagnostic. Approximately 300,000 people contract LD each year, incurring a $1.3 billion cost to the medical system. Unfortunately, much of the societal and economic costs of LD stem from misdiagnosis due to the low sensitivity of the current Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-recommended testing protocol, which is typically <50% for the early-stage of disease, a time when many patients seek care. Therefore, the commercialization of an accurate and rapid test may provide a low-cost yet effective tool for identifying early-stage infection at the point-of-care, leading to faster and more effective treatment. The results from this potential I-Corps project also may benefit the diagnostics and medical community by demonstrating the value of a data-driven approach to multiplexed rapid testing.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a point-of-care diagnostic assay for early-stage Lyme disease (LD). Previously, the design and validation of a low-cost, paper-based vertical flow assay (VFA) was completed. Unlike standard rapid testing formats, the proposed VFA technology enables the point-of-care measurement (from patient blood) of a large panel of antibodies specific to the early-stage LD infection. A data-driven diagnostic algorithm is then used to infer a LD diagnosis from the panel of measurements, enabling sensitive and specific testing of suspected early-stage Lyme patients across a diverse population with varying immune responses.  An initial peer-reviewed clinical study of the prototype assay and diagnostic algorithm reported sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% and 96.7%, respectively, when compared to a rigorous clinical gold standard using all early-stage LD samples. These initial technical results show potential for effective early-stage LD diagnosis at the point-of-care, enabling faster and more effective treatment that could mitigate debilitating late-stage symptoms and associated costs to the healthcare system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although humans find different people?s faces easy to recognize, faces are in fact highly variable. One way in which faces vary is on the masculine-to-feminine dimension. Masculine faces are those with broader jaws, thicker brow ridges and longer chins than feminine faces. Studies have shown that people rate masculine faces as belonging to more physically dominant and aggressive individuals. These perceptions may affect decision making in everyday life, such as who we choose to lead organizations or perform certain tasks. While previous studies have aided our understanding of individuals? perceptions of dominance, it does not reveal why they do so. This project examines how faces differing in masculinity capture attention, affect memory, and impact perceptions of threat. A hypothesis is that faces with high levels of facial masculinity are perceived as more threatening and that this increases their attention and memory for them. Results of this research have the potential to inform our understanding of the cognitive processes which underlie our face perceptions and provide a methodological basis to conduct future studies to understand why highly masculine individuals are treated with deference.<br/><br/>Experiments can provide tests of the effects of facial masculinity on observers? dominance and threat perceptions. However, most experiments testing the effects of manipulating facial sexual dimorphism on observers? perceptions have relied on forced choice paradigms, which have significant drawbacks. The current research uses an enhanced methodology to examine the hypothesis that human attention automatically prioritizes processing of masculine faces, and that observers? selective attention to masculine faces is because they signal threat. Participants in the study are college students. The basic experimental paradigm has participants complete self-reported ratings of physical dominance, state and trait anxiety levels, and their body dimensions (height, weight, grip strength and chest strength). These measures, collected prior to the experiments, are used to quantify participants physical dominance and anxiety and serve as covariates in the analyses. Participants complete one of four experiments. Both the Dot Probe and Flanker Task test if participants selectively attend to masculinized men?s faces when they are not instructed to. For the Dot Probe task, participants are presented with two faces varying in masculinity, which is followed by the presentation of a target shape, either a square or diamond. Participants must classify the shape as quickly as they can. For the Flanker Task, participants judge the orientation of a centrally presented target letter (i.e., upright, or upside-down) while ignoring flanking faces varying in masculinity. The lexical decision task tests whether participants automatically associate these faces with the concept of threat. Participants judge whether a letter string is a word, while ignoring a simultaneously presented face varying on sexual dimorphism. A portion of the letter strings are words related to the concept of threat. Participants are assumed to be fastest to classify a letter string as a word when it is a threat word, and the presented face has been masculinized. In the rating recognition memory test participants are presented with a sequence of men?s faces varying on sexual dimorphism and asked to rate how dangerous each man appears. Participants then complete a recognition memory phase, in which they are presented with another sequence of faces, some of which were presented in the rating phase, and asked to judge whether they saw each face in the rating phase. Better memory for masculinized faces that are perceived as more threatening, assuming threat stimuli is more salient at initial encoding, is assessed with the recognition memory task.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will bring transformative change by enhancing grid robustness through activating a large number of control actuators that would otherwise offer very limited control capabilities. This will be achieved by designing innovative discrete control mechanisms in emerging technologies such as energy storage systems, solar power generation, and wind turbines. The intellectual merits of the project include advancing knowledge in the field of system dynamics, and a holistic approach that can handle the constraints and characteristics of very large-scale systems such as the electric power grid. As broader impacts, this project will provide insights into related problems from other fields where discrete control is applicable. In addition, this project will benefit society with a more reliable power grid with fewer blackouts, and facilitate environmentally friendly power production leading to fewer public health problems caused by local pollution from fossil fuel power plants.<br/><br/>The project will develop a framework that extends knowledge of continuous and discrete power grid controls. Actuation design on emerging power technologies to achieve a fast response, and tests on both hardware and simulation-based testbeds are considered. Discrete logics have been explored before for power grid control, but using several simplifying assumptions such as single inter-area oscillation mode, system aggregation on both of the oscillation ends, and a unique controllable component located right on the oscillation path. This project will reexamine this problem from a new perspective and will develop a new theory that connects power system oscillatory behavior with momentary shifting of equilibrium points when discrete power changes are enforced at controllable components. Topics of study will include large-scale dynamic systems, multiple oscillation modes, multiple controllable components, and adaptation to disturbances, all geared towards enhancing power system stability for increased penetration of renewable energy. An integrated educational plan will leverage the research through specific projects for undergraduate and pre-college students and through mentoring programs for Hispanic Americans to support their pursuit for professional or academic careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During protein synthesis, ribosomes decode a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequence into a corresponding protein sequence.  Cellular mRNA originates from the DNA in a cell?s chromosomes.  Ribosomes do not bind to mRNA at random; instead there is a highly-regulated process to ensure that ribosomes bind to the code in a particular place so that the mRNA code is translated correctly into protein.  Although there is a standard pathway by which this initiation occurs for most cellular mRNAs, there are alternative pathways that occur in cells under certain conditions such as stress.  It is also important to understand these alternative pathways because many viruses exploit them.  This project investigates one alternative protein biosynthesis pathway known as internal initiation.  Internal initiation requires the RACK1 protein to bind to the ribosome and this project will investigate the reasons this protein is required.  The mRNA that is translated by alternative pathways also has structural features that are required for internal initiation.   The proposed work will screen sequences representing thousands of cellular mRNAs to identify RNA structures that are able to bind ribosomes containing RACK1 and allow internal translation initiation. Together these approaches will greatly enhance our understanding of the components and mechanism of protein biosynthesis mediated by internal initiation. This research program is complemented by an educational living and learning program that encourages diverse groups of undergraduate students to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.  Biology students first years in this program live, eat, and study together and meet weekly to talk about their transition to college, finding opportunities to do research with science faculty early in their undergraduate careers, and strategies for succeeding in science majors and careers. This research program will help shape the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) are RNA structures that bypass the requirement for the m7G cap of the mRNA to facilitate translation. Although viral IRESs have been studied intensively, cellular IRES sequences are less well-understood.  To investigate the mechanism of cellular IRES-mediated translation, the interaction of the ribosomal protein RACK1 with the initiation factors eIF3D and DAP5 will be examined, and RNAs commonly regulated by these factors will be identified. In a complementary approach, RNA sequences initiating on a circular RNA construct following selection will be identified by high-throughput sequencing and validated in a luciferase reporter translation assay. These data will test the hypothesis that cellular IRES sequences may not be restricted to the 5? untranslated region, but may be more widely found within the human genome. Together, these experiments expand our knowledge on the process of protein biosynthesis and lay the foundation to perform future mechanistic studies on protein biosynthesis at the single molecule level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such programming errors, also known as ""bugs,"" can be exploited by adversaries to compromise critical systems. However, finding critical software bugs/vulnerabilities are like finding a needle in a haystack: test cases written by humans cannot trigger bugs caused by corner cases, and randomly generated test cases cannot reach deep execution states of a computer program. This project will address these limitations by advancing dynamic symbolic execution (a.k.a., concolic execution), a test case generation technology that can systematically explore all possible execution states.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance the scalability of concolic execution by narrowing the search space and improving the search speed. A smaller search space will lead to better code coverage or achieve the same coverage faster. The goal of narrowing the search space will be achieved by using reinforcement learning techniques to automatically infer and prune execution paths that will not lead to new program states, such as error paths. The goal of improving search speed will be achieved with more efficient symbolic constraint collection and constraint solving. More efficient constraint collection will be done by replacing traditional symbolic interpretation with highly optimized dynamic data-flow analysis. More efficient constraint solving will be done by replacing traditional theorem provers with high throughput local stochastic search.

To do so, it will conduct a study of nontraditional students in engineering with the goal of better understanding how to support their completion of engineering degrees. Students are considered to be nontraditional if they do not enter a four-year degree program directly from high school.  Nontraditional students are an increasing proportion of undergraduates in the United States and often form the majority of students in a college or university. Beyond not entering a four year degree program directly from high school, nontraditional students often have other characteristics, such as attending college part-time, having dependents, working full-time when enrolled, being financially independent, and/or having certifications other than a high school diploma. There is little research into engineering students with such nontraditional characteristics.  Filling this gap is important because engineering has a generally low persistence and retention rate and its curricula are often aligned with a traditional four-year residential degree (e.g., group projects, study halls).   Thus, there is a pressing need to understand how support structures can be designed to be effective for students with any nontraditional characteristics. This project will strengthen the engineering community?s understanding of nontraditional students, including development of guidelines to help institutions of all types better support the success of nontraditional students.     <br/><br/>This project will contribute to an understudied area of research: understanding the needs and experiences of nontraditional students in engineering. The project research plan uses a theory-driven mixed-methods case study of nontraditional students in engineering at Youngstown State University over a three-year period and will produce a body of knowledge on experiences and supports for nontraditional students in engineering.  It will also generate action-focused guidelines for improving persistence and success of nontraditional students in engineering. This project will examine three research questions: (1) What is the holistic experience of current nontraditional students in engineering?  (2) How do nontraditional students in engineering engage with co-curricular supports as they progress through their degree program? and (3) What impact do nontraditional student characteristics have on student integration and student success? Major data sources include a survey of over 1,000 nontraditional students in engineering, focus groups, and reflective diaries completed at multiple points throughout the semester. A significant project outcome will be to generate new knowledge and disseminate guidelines for supporting nontraditional students? academic, social, and professional integration, and their sense of engagement with their institutions. These outcomes can directly contribute to improved persistence and retention of engineering students.

They were discovered at Drexel University a decade ago. MXenes are comprised of layers of metal atoms connected by carbon or nitrogen atoms and having thickness of less than one nanometer. Their unique combination of electronic conductivity and tunable optical properties, such as a wide range of plasmonic colors, may be a game-changer in optics and electronics. More than 30 different MXene compositions have been synthesized; dozens more are predicted to exist. However, in spite of total number of publications on MXenes approaching 3000, just a few solid solutions (structures with a random mix of metal atoms) have been reported. Solid solution MXenes that are synthesized in this study greatly expand the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials and offer an opportunity for precise tuning of electronic and optical properties of MXenes. These materials can find applications in the manufacturing of transparent conductive electrodes for solar cells, smart windows, transparent heaters, optical filters, etc. Courses covering synthesis and characterization of MXenes are developed as a part of this project and offered online. Graduate and undergraduate students participating in this project are offered research co-operative education and internships at the National Nanofabrication Facility in South Korea to learn nanofabrication and perform fabrication and testing of MXene-based optical devices, such as transparent light emission diodes and electrically tunable optical filters.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The primary goal of this work is to establish direct experimental relationships between chemical compositions of solid solution MXene and their resulting properties. Solid solution MXene research is expanded into diverse structures and chemistries in order to study and generalize these relationships, and thus to enable specific optical and plasmonic properties to be rationally chosen based on the desired application. This project includes (i) synthesis of quaternary MAX phase precursors with the desired compositions; (ii) finding the appropriate conditions for topochemical conversion of the MAX precursors into MXenes, (iii) determining the conductivity and optical properties of MXenes, and (iv) using an array of advanced characterization techniques to determine the composition and structure of solid-solution MXenes and correlate them with the measured properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will collect a sample of gravitational-wave triggered neutron star merger events and a sample of black hole mergers for which potential host galaxies have been cataloged.  The rate of cosmic expansion is a key parameter in modern cosmology.  There is currently tension between local measurements and the results from cosmic microwave background studies, which motivates the pursuit of improved independent observables: gravitational waves have long been proposed as one such.  This work covers two such alternatives.  Broadening the impact of research on society at large requires effective communication to audiences from diverse backgrounds, including pre-college teens currently under-represented in STEM fields.  The researcher will engage with high schools and emphasize under-represented groups, using the infrastructure of the Brandeis Science Communication Laboratory.<br/><br/>This study uses the full range of available data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on NSF's Blanco 4-meter telescope in Chile, including images taken as part of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), as well as non-DES DECam images.  It will also use data from another NSF facility, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, LIGO.  Methods to be used include a Hubble diagram fit to a sample of neutron star mergers and a statistical dark sirens analysis for black hole events.  This is a new method independent of other cosmological probes, because standard sirens are distance indicators based solely on general relativity.  Detectors with enough sensitivity to enable this approach became operational in 2015.  This research will fully exploit the novel datasets as multi-messenger probes for cosmology using DES/DECam data, making a measurement of the expansion rate with 3-5% (statistical) uncertainty by 2022, and enabling percent-level precision with future data from facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are formed when matter collapses in on itself under the force of gravity, producing a singularity of infinite density.  This singularity cannot be directly observed because it is surrounded by an event horizon, the point where the black hole?s gravitational field is so strong that even light cannot escape, but matter outside the event horizon can in principle be observed.  On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) succeeded in producing the first image of a black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, 55 million light years from Earth.  The observed ring of light bent in the immense gravity was stunning confirmation that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of galaxies. The EHT results enabled scientists to verify key predictions of Einstein?s theory of gravity at the black hole boundary and to study how supermassive black holes dominate the energetics and dynamics at the centers of galaxies.  This project aims to build upon this success by improving the EHT so that astronomers can make black hole images that are much more detailed and take the first steps towards making black hole movies.  Observations under this award will address key questions about general relativity and astronomy, including whether black holes spin and how they launch powerful jets that travel at nearly the speed of light to distances larger than the host galaxy itself.  This project includes resources for training the next generation of radio astronomers involving postdoctoral scholars and graduate and undergraduate students at US universities, including minority-serving institutions, and will undertake cultural outreach to the Hawaiian community.<br/><br/>This award supports continued operations of an enhanced Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) over the next three years to test general relativity and study the astrophysics of supermassive black holes, including the Galactic Center source (Sagittarius A*) and the black hole in the center of the nearby galaxy M87.  Investments in instrumentation to transform submillimeter VLBI into a standard observing mode across the heterogeneous array will enable monitoring campaigns triggered during optimal observing conditions, allowing a study of the dynamics of the material at the base of the jet in M87.  The extension of observing to the 345 GHz frequency band will increase the angular resolution of the EHT, sharpen its view of Sagittarius A* due to reduced interstellar scattering, enhance its ability to study the structure of the magnetic field in these and other sources,  and test the prediction that photon rings are independent of observing frequency.

However, machine learning and data-driven approaches are now an indispensable part of autonomous-systems design, and their reliance on highly nonlinear continuous functions and probabilistic reasoning has largely been at odds with the logical and symbolic-analysis frameworks in formal methods. As a result, the lack of formal assurance has become the key bottleneck that impedes the wider deployment and adoption of autonomous systems. This project targets this open challenge by developing formal synthesis and verification techniques for learning-based and data-driven control and planning methods for autonomous systems. <br/><br/>The project develops the theoretical foundations as well as practical techniques and tools for improving the fundamental reliability of realistic autonomous systems such as autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles. The work builds on the investigator's prior work on formal methods over continuous and hybrid domains towards the unification of symbolic and numerical methods in practical engineering. The correct-by-learning methods can ensure formal properties of general learning-based decision-making algorithms towards safety and trustworthiness in all areas of AI applications. The education and outreach activities are a crucial part of the project, as the methods developed are only useful if they are adopted by the new generations of developers of autonomous systems in a broad range of engineering domains. The education efforts contribute directly to improving automation and usability of formal methods in practical engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores innovative methods of reducing skin-friction drag using computations and experiments. One of the promising methods for reducing skin-friction drag is to dampen wall turbulence passively using surface microstructures. While a substantial amount of effort has been made to advance wall techniques, the process is not yet completely understood. The primary aim of this project is to provide a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics of these novel surface microstructures and show that they can provide systematic control of wall turbulence to minimize skin-friction drag. The project outcomes will be disseminated to broader communities through many educational and outreach activities, such as undergraduate research programs, scientific publications, conference presentations, and summer science camps to K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>A micro airfoil structure, which is a newly proposed surface microstructure, is expected to achieve unique turbulence control capabilities due to its well-defined 3D geometry. The main objectives of the project are: (i) to demonstrate the turbulence control capability using the micro airfoil structure, (ii) to identify the connections between the control inputs created by the micro airfoil structure and the responses of skin-friction drag, (iii) to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the turbulence control and skin-friction drag reduction by the micro airfoil structure, and (iv) to recommend the optimum configurations of the single and arrays of micro airfoil structure for the maximum reduction of skin-friction drag. Direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation will be used to compute fundamental flows, and particle image velocimetry will be used to measure velocities in the turbulent boundary layer. The fundamental knowledge obtained through this project will provide insight to answer the long-lasting questions about the dynamics of wall-bounded turbulent flows. The unique turbulence control techniques achieved by the micro airfoil structure will provide guidance to other research areas in aerospace, mechanical, chemical, and ocean engineering where turbulence control may lead to drag reduction.

It is a fundamental process that controls the evolution of Earth and holds a key to understanding important processes, such as earthquakes, volcanism, and mantle convection. However, how subduction initiates and how the tectonic plate changes its shape during subduction initiation (SI) are still unclear. The key driving forces are the negative buoyancy of the subducting plate and external forces that push the tectonic plates laterally. The key resisting forces include bending resistance of the subducting plate, frictional resistance between the subducting and overriding plates, and viscous resistance that is exerted by the surrounding mantle on the subducting plate. The details of SI and how the subducting plate bends depend strongly on the balance between these forces and also on the strength of the subducting slab, which has been defined by some combination of viscosity, elasticity, and plasticity of Earth materials. Further, these material prosperities are often assumed to be uniform in numerical simulations of SI despite their dependence on pressure, temperature, stress, and composition. Which of the three mechanical properties (i.e., viscosity, elasticity, and plasticity) controls the bending of the subducting plate depends on their relative values. Using numerical models, this study aims to better understand how the bending behavior of the subducting plate changes with the three mechanical properties. The project provides support for an early-career female faculty member and a postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>A suite of generic 2-D and 3-D dynamic subduction models with a visco-plastic and a visco-elasto-plastic rheology will be developed to quantify the effect of elasticity on down-dip and lateral bending of the subducting slab. These models will incorporate a composite viscous rheology that accounts for both dislocation creep and diffusion creep, and models with the visco-elasto-plastic rheology incorporates pressure- and temperature-dependent shear modulus, using the thermodynamic code Perple_X. The models are used to address two key questions: (1) Can the negative buoyancy of the oceanic lithosphere be sufficient to overcome the elastic bending resistance and to initiate subduction, and (2) Is elasticity a rheological component that resists or facilitates down-dip and lateral bending/unbending? Systematic tests on the effect of subduction parameters on the slab evolution will also be performed to address these questions. Further, 2-D and 3-D models will be developed for selected real subduction systems, including Marianas, Tonga, and Puysegur, and the results will be compared with the tectonic history and the current slab geometry. The numerical models to be developed will provide not only the geometrical evolution of the slab but also the temperature and mantle flow fields of subduction systems over a range of parameters, and the information will be useful for the interpretations of geophysical and geochemical observations. The results will be summarized in scientific videos to be distributed through the PI?s research website and YouTube as well as in conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an outcome of interest in the analysis of economic growth and inequality, regional development, and a range of national and local policies. This information is also an input to key questions about the behavior and welfare of individuals, cohorts, and firms. Despite their paramount importance, systematic historical data on local economic conditions in the US are extremely limited. This limitation creates challenges in examining the evolution of the US economy during a period that includes geographic expansion, demographic and political realignment, and transformation from a rural, agrarian economy into an urban industrial one. Moreover, it poses challenges in understanding more recent developments in the US economy, since many of these have historical roots, or depend on cumulative or historical exposure to shocks. This project will generate a long-run panel on local economic conditions in the US?one that is comprehensive, high-frequency, spatially-disaggregate, and available consistently over the period 1865-present. The project will further illustrate the research potential of this new dataset and provide the first systematic, high-frequency evidence on local economic conditions in the US prior to the 1970s.<br/><br/>The panel dataset will comprise deposits of all households and firms in each county-year from 1865-present. For the period before 1960, the project will generate new data from the balance sheets of all nationally-chartered banks in the US, and supplement this with information on deposits held by state-chartered banks and other depository institutions. From 1961 to the present, the project will merge newly-collected data with existing information on deposits by county. The project will further explore deposits as a close and reliable proxy for traditional local economic indicators, such as employment or income, for which high-quality historical data are not readily available. An additional dataset will contain the detailed balance sheets of all US depository institutions underlying the county panel. These new datasets will have applications to all fields of economics, as well as across broader social science and policy evaluation spheres. The data will advance knowledge on the evolution of the US economy, fostering an understanding of critical local dynamics that previous data have obscured. By filling a substantial gap in the nation?s data infrastructure, this project will contribute to both economic knowledge and policy effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental issue regarding this process is the nature of the phoneme. In classical generative phonology, a phoneme is a combination of abstract and discretized features, devoid of acoustic details. On this view, speech perception is a process of sorting gradient information into non-gradient categories. However, evidence has emerged that speakers are sensitive to minute and gradient acoustic properties of speech sounds when making decisions about what they hear, which suggests that the phoneme itself may encapsulate acoustic details and their probability distributions that can be reshaped by speakers? experience. This view assumes a more direct relationship between the speech sound and the phoneme.  The current project will conduct experiments measuring brain activity designed to test the predictions of both models, facilitating an understanding of this core mechanism in speech perception.<br/><br/>The experimental methodology utilizes event-related brain potentials which measure automatic sound change detection in auditory cortex via oddball paradigms. One experiment will compare a category to a token from the same category: here, a change detection response will require that the category encodes physical stimulus properties. A second experiment will manipulate two different statistical distributions of the tokens that lead to a category representation. If the oddball response is modulated by the statistical information in the stimuli that gave rise to the ""temporary"" category, then the brain must be able to encode this information in category representations. If no sensitivity to acoustics or statistics is observed, then it must be the case that phoneme category representations do not contain gradient acoustic information. The findings can potentially increase the understanding of how categories are formed in human cognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing, more commonly known as three-dimensional printing, is a method of making virtually any shape from a digital computer model.  Although desktop three-dimensional printers have become quite popular, they are often limited to smaller objects without sufficient strength for structural applications.  This research focuses on a relatively new class of additive manufacturing that is capable of making large-scale structures such as full-size cars and houses.  This project conducts fundamental research to better understand big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) of extruded carbon-fiber reinforced polymer materials to produce higher strength components that can be used in the automotive, aerospace, energy, construction and defense sectors.  This is a collaborative research effort between two universities that exposes a wide and diverse group of students, including women and minorities, to new manufacturing technologies and provide opportunities to engage in hands-on activities that encourage them to pursue a career in STEM-related fields.<br/><br/>While the development of big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) of large-scale polymer structures has moved quickly, a basic understanding of the unique microstructure within an extruded fiber-reinforced polymer composite has not kept pace. The majority of recent efforts to improve the mechanical performance of 3D-printed materials has focused on interfacial properties and addressing meso-structural defects, such as voids between beads due to incomplete filling.  However, there are significant opportunities for improving the mechanical performance of 3D printed structures by controlling the internal microstructure of the extruded bead.  Specifically, the goal of this research is to maximize the mechanical performance of an extruded polymer composite by controlling the size, orientation, and distribution of reinforcing fibers and voids that define its internal microstructure.  This is accomplished by altering the flow path and resulting shear strain fields within the single-screw extruder and optimizing processing parameters such as flow rate, pressure, and temperature profile. Research tasks seek to establish new finite element models for deposition flow as polymer melt passes through the screw and nozzle, in addition to constitutive models defined by differential equations that provide unique insight into fiber orientation, void formation, fiber breakage and particle migration during processing.  The resulting knowledge and database of material properties enable the printing of tailored microstructures within BAAM parts and components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many students enroll in introductory laboratory courses for multiple disciplines at the same time.  As a result, there is a need for interdisciplinary investigation into how students experience scientific practices in such courses. This project focuses on the eight scientific practices described in the Framework for K-12 Education and embedded in the Next Generation Science Standards. Scientific practices are important because they are fundamental to scientific discovery, inherently interdisciplinary, and applicable across scientific contexts in higher education. This project will investigate similarities and differences in the scientific practices incorporated into introductory laboratory courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. It will focus on how students, staff, faculty, and teaching assistants value scientific practices that are perceived as more technical (such as analyzing data) or more social (such as communicating information). This project will determine whether and how students engage with specific scientific practices in biology, chemistry, and physics laboratory courses and how that engagement is encouraged and rewarded. The findings from this project will expand current understanding of scientific practices in introductory science courses.  In doing so, this work will lay a foundation for making these laboratory courses more equitable and supportive of a greater diversity of learners. <br/><br/>The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to explore the incorporation and gendering of scientific practices in introductory biology, chemistry, and physics lab courses at a primarily undergraduate institution using a comparative case study research design. This project will blend three theoretical lenses: the Framework for K-12 Science Education, accountable disciplinary knowledge (ADK), and technical-social dualism (TDS). These three lenses operationalize what counts as a scientific practice (the Framework), what it means for students to be accountable for engaging in a practice (ADK), and the gendering of scientific practices that are perceived to be more technical/masculine versus more social/feminine (TDS). The comparative case study approach will enable critical analyses of data from a variety of sources, including surveys, interviews, and classroom observations and artifacts. Case studies of biology, chemistry, and physics lab courses will provide insight into structural and interpersonal equity with regard to how scientific practices are valued, as well as examine how and by whom scientific practices are enacted across disciplines. Structural perspectives include those practices that are targeted by departmental and instructor learning goals, as well how those practices are assessed. Interpersonal perspectives include the ways that instructors and teaching assistants facilitate student engagement in scientific practices, and how students participate in them. This work will help to fill a significant gap in the discipline-based education research literature, namely the lack of interdisciplinary studies across biology, chemistry, and physics at the undergraduate level. Further, this project will provide insight into how structural and interpersonal mechanisms in laboratory courses may contribute to perceptions of some scientific disciplines as more social/feminine or technical/masculine than others. Finally, the findings from this work will provide guidance to support faculty, staff, and other instructors in their efforts to improve their interactions, instruction, and mentorship of students in the early stages of their science careers.

Wildfire frequency in many regions is intensified by the invasion of exotic grasses that are highly flammable, and which often replace native plants as burned landscapes regrow. To prevent invasive species from taking over burned landscapes, land managers are increasingly applying seeds of native plants to encourage ecosystem recovery and keep invasive plants at bay. However, there is still much to learn about the factors that determine the success of seed additions in terms of the ability of seeded species to establish, and to suppress flammable invaders. It is also unclear how previous human-caused landscape changes, such as nitrogen pollution or the removal of water-hogging shrubs (a practice common in western USA rangelands), will affect the success of native seed additions and plant recovery from fire. Moreover, it is unclear how different seed mixes repel exotic plants from invading disturbed areas. This research project addresses these issues by building on a long-term experiment investigating the effects of past nitrogen pollution and shrub removal (originally intended to improve rangeland forage) in a highly invaded sagebrush steppe ecosystem. The experimental site was entirely burned in a recent wildfire, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate how a history of nitrogen pollution and shrub removal will influence plant recovery from wildfire. The research team will develop criteria for creating seed mixes that suppress invasive plants, particularly flammable annual grasses, and will determine their effectiveness within the different long term experimental environments present across the study site. The results from this study will aid land managers in choosing native seed mixes that will help to prevent the spread of invasive plants and decrease the risks and costs of future wildfires.<br/><br/>This project investigates how ecological memories of nutrient enrichment and dominant plant removal impact plant re-assembly following wildfire and addresses a critical need to test the applicability of current models for creating post-fire communities that will be resistant to invasion by transformative invasive species. The research will evaluate a promising, but under-studied, trait-based model (the Community Assembly by Trait Selection model) for establishing native plant assemblages that are resistant to invasive grasses and forbs. This model will be applied in a novel experimental design to discern whether seed additions result in biotic resistance via limiting similarity, fitness hierarchies and/or trait complementarity. While much focus has been given to limiting similarity as a mechanism of resistance to invasion, experimental support has been mixed because this mechanism has been difficult to distinguish from fitness hierarchies and because ecosystems are frequently invaded by more than one exotic species simultaneously. This project will overcome these issues by using two separate seed mixes designed to convey resistance to invasive grasses and forbs, plus a high-diversity seed mix that combines these. With this experimental setup, evidence for biotic resistance within functional groups will support limiting similarity, resistance across different groups will support fitness hierarchies, and relatively greater resistance in the high diversity mix will support trait complementarity. The seed mix treatments will be nested within plots of long-term nitrogen enrichment and shrub removal, which at a microhabitat scale are characterized by environmental variation due to ecosystem engineering by shrubs and ants. This hierarchical design will enable the researchers to assess how ecological memories of landscape and microhabitat-level factors affect the success of seed additions for conveying biotic resistance to invasive plants. It also allows evaluation of how nutrient availability influences mechanism conferring resistance to invasion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collectively, this study will enable us to compare how literature, academics, and practitioners view ethics and DEI as related.

This study will benefit society by promoting the formation of engineers who can engage with different values and perspectives in ethical ways.<br/><br/>Despite various models, initiatives, and pockets of innovation by scholars and programs, we have not realized widespread changes in the diversification of the engineering workforce. We theorize that one barrier to change is the disjuncture between lines of scholarship from engineering education researchers in the intersecting spaces of DEI and engineering ethics. This study seeks to find ways for these communities to support one another by making explicit hidden structural issues that mask the intersections between ethics and DEI in the context of engineering. This study is comprised of three phases, addressing the following respective research questions: (1) How are engineering ethics and DEI related based on theoretical and empirical understandings of affective and cognitive development of students and practitioners within these communities?; (2) How are engineering ethics and DEI related based on mental models elicited from academics active in these two areas of research and scholarship?; and (3) How are engineering ethics and DEI related based on mental models elicited from a diverse cross-section of industrial practitioners? To address RQ1, we will use systematic literature review procedures to synthesize peer-reviewed scholarship on approaches to, and outcomes of, interventions centered around ethics and DEI. To address RQ2 and RQ3, academics (Phase 2) and industrial practitioners (Phase 3) will respond to an ethics/DEI challenge in multiple formats, including graphically, textually, and verbally. We will critically analyze the literature and mental models via a discourse analysis approach, guided by seven building tasks identified by Gee (significance, practices, identities, relationships, politics, connections, and sign systems). We will triangulate Phase 1, 2, and 3 findings to identify how discourses vary across the academic and industrial contexts. This triangulation will enable us to generate actionable modalities for supporting educational efforts aimed at the intersection of ethics and DEI both in curricular and workforce contexts. We will adopt an activist-oriented approach to disseminate findings to the research community and professional organizations through multiple mechanisms. This will directly benefit society by facilitating the professional formation of engineers who are more ethically adept and capable of engaging with difference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the loss of one species may trigger additional, and potentially unexpected, losses of species, because species depend on each other for food or habitat. For example, the loss of a prey species might result in predator declines and the loss of important functions and services that the predator provides (e.g., food production). In the Gulf of Maine, rapid warming and overexploitation are thought to have contributed to the near local extinction of the intertidal blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), an important prey species whose loss could have cascading consequences for this ecosystem. The project explores the consequence of blue mussel declines to the food web and to the ecosystem (e.g., through water filtration that improves water quality, and secondary production that supports food for people). The investigators are using theoretical models of species loss from food webs in combination with long-term ecological data and field experiments to investigate the effects of local species extinctions on ecosystem function. This combined approach is generating and testing theoretical predictions of species loss on ecosystem biodiversity and food web structure. Insights from this project are contributing to a better understanding of dynamics of coastal ecosystems worldwide that face similar losses of prey species. The project is fostering a new collaboration between a small liberal arts college (Colby College) and a research-intensive university (University of Colorado Boulder), creating unique training, mentoring, and educational exchange opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. This project is training a PhD student, a postdoctoral scholar, and undergraduate students, with a focus on engaging underrepresented groups and enhancing computational training for marine ecologists. This project is supporting the development of web-based teaching modules on complex ecological systems in combination with outreach and education efforts in Maine's coastal communities and in Colorado?s inland rural and urban communities. <br/><br/>Worldwide changes in local biodiversity are altering the functioning of ecosystems and the ecosystem services on which humans depend. Predicting the consequences of such changes in biodiversity to coastal ecosystem function and structure is complicated by the multiplicity of species interactions that characterize complex food webs. Food web theory predicts that the loss of species like the blue mussel has cascading impacts on the community through secondary losses of consumers that depend on resource species. However, such predictions of food web collapse (termed ""robustness"") have rarely been empirically tested. Furthermore, previous studies have rarely considered how secondary losses of species might alter coastal ecosystem function. For example, the loss of the abundant filter-feeding M. edulis is likely to affect water filtration, however, M. edulis? role as a key prey species could impact other ecosystem functions performed by species that consume M. edulis (e.g., secondary production). Thus, to estimate and predict the consequences of local extinctions on coastal ecosystem functioning, requires a research approach that moves beyond a focus on single species, and considers both direct and secondary species losses. This project is integrating food web modeling, field observations, data synthesis, and experimental species removals to quantify the impact of recent species losses on the structure and stability of the Gulf of Maine rocky intertidal food web. Historical and existing species interaction data and field observations are being synthesized to generate a detailed food web with ecosystem functions for the Gulf of Maine rocky intertidal. This food web model is used to predict the cascading impacts of species loss in this community, with particular attention to the impact on key ecosystem functions measured in situ. Finally, the predictions are tested in a multi-year factorial species removal experiment that quantifies how the diversity, structure, and function of the food web is affected by targeted species removal. This novel approach is providing much-needed empirical ground truthing to predictions of food web ecology. It is among the first of such experimental tests in marine systems. This research has the potential to transform the understanding of how marine ecosystem structure and function are altered by species losses, and the predictability of food web changes through empirical testing.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Biological Oceanography and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Doing so, however, presents a major challenge: this patterning must happen at a microscopic scale but over large distances, preventing the use of direct techniques like 3D printing.  There is an alternative: biological organisms are able to produce complex structure using the self-organization of basic chemical components with tuned interactions.  Doing something similar with manmade materials requires a better understanding of the self-organization process, as well as practical methods for engineering forces among microscopic particles.  This project explores an effect known as ""optical binding"", which induces complex forces between clusters of particles using light.  The research team is developing new experimental and numerical tools to explore the range of active and passive structures that can be generated using this force.  In addition, the researchers are conducting proof of principle research on ""acoustic binding"", a similar effect which uses sound instead of light.  The long term aim of both efforts is to exploit these novel tools to better understand self-organization in general, as well as to enable a new generation of manmade materials for industrial, defense, and consumer applications.  The project also includes efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields at the middle school through graduate level through integrated education and research opportunities.  In particular, the researchers are developing a new course on experimental physics for Middle and High school students in collaboration with the Bobcat Summer STEM Academy at UC Merced; rather than relying on ?canned? physics experiments, this course exposes students to the complete lifecycle of a scientific experiment, from design through execution and data analysis.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Understanding self-organization is of interest for many fields of science, including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  Colloidal systems have emerged as a useful experimental platform to study this phenomenon, as various techniques exist to modify the forces between colloidal particles.  Despite this, there are limits to the type of forces than can be produced: they are typically short range and can only be modified during the synthesis stage.  This project is studying an effect known as optical binding, which uses light to induce multi-particle interactions which are long range, directional, pairwise non-conservative, and can be altered in real time.  Additionally, the project includes proof-of-principle research on acoustic binding, which produces similar forces in an athermal and inertial regime.  The research team is using novel numerical and experimental methods to study both types of force in detail and exploring how these forces modify the self-organization of many-particle systems.  This provides insights into how feats of self-organization are performed in the natural world, and how they could be exploited to create new manmade materials with complex microstructure.  In addition to its research aims, this project also includes integrated outreach efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups in STEM at the middle school through graduate level through research opportunities and summer programs for students and their teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research develops and applies a novel synthesis approach based on controlled decomposition of a nitrogen-containing precursor thereby driving the crystallization of the remaining nitride materials. This decomposition-based approach is hitherto unexplored and offers a paradigm shift in single crystal nitride synthesis with a clear path towards inexpensive scaling of the method. Application of an extensive library of existing precursor materials allows for synthesis of a wide range of ternary and even more complex nitrides. Technologically important nitrides will be synthesized providing materials for super-hard materials, catalysis and (opto-)electronic devices. Students are being trained in equipment development, crystal synthesis, and machine learning techniques preparing them for employment in (single crystal) material synthesis and semiconductor industries. To promote recruitment and retention of female, underrepresented minority and at-risk students in science and engineering, the Boldly Utilizing Innovation to Lead in Developing Engineers for Research and Science (BUILDERS) initiative is engaging and connecting middle/high school and undergraduate students via synthesis workshops providing hierarchical mentorship and educational opportunities for the broader audience. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Many computationally predicted stable nitrides with intriguing properties have been proposed. Their single crystal synthesis from solution is challenged due to limited synthesis process parameter windows and insufficient solubility of nitrogen or cations at temperatures below their decomposition temperature. These limitations are overcome using a new synthesis pathway based on decomposition of lithiated nitride precursor from a melt.  Liquification and controlled decomposition of the precursor results in the deposition of a crystalline nitride and is achieved via controlling the lithium vapor pressure, nitrogen overpressure and temperature gradients, while alloy composition is achieved via control of the melt composition. The newly developed synthesis equipment is suitable to operate up to at least 100 atm and 1000 C. In situ data is fed through a machine learning algorithm to continuously and automatically control synthesis conditions to yield targeted material compositions. This approach does not rely on dissolution and diffusion of nitrogen through the flux from the gas phase leading to transformative opportunities in rapid, scalable synthesis of nitride single crystals. Students are obtaining in-depth, hands-on experience about the synergistic relationships between equipment development, in situ technologies, machine learning algorithms and resulting targeted material synthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses computational algebra to attack such problems. The main themes are: (1) Data Analysis, (2) Graphics, visualization, geometric modeling, (3) Computer science and computational complexity. A main problem in Data Analysis is to extract meaning from a massive dataset: imagine a dense, cloud of moving points. One approach is to freeze the cloud at a moment in time, and then increase the size of the individual points until nearby groups coalesce. Topological Data Analysis uses sophisticated mathematical tools to study the problem, and has led to insights into visual cortex activity, cancer pathology, and viral evolution. Companies from Boeing to Pixar use computer graphics and geometric modeling in applications ranging from analyzing turbulent fluid flow (air passage over a plane's wing) to accurate simulations and virtual reality. Key mathematical tools are splines, which provide a way of assembling a coherent big picture from local pieces. A third theme of this project is the modeling of dynamic processes, which often comes down to multiplying (massive) matrices many times (a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers).  Finding efficient ways to multiply matrices is the topic of a subfield of Computer Science known as complexity theory. The project builds on prior work of the PI using algebraic objects known as permanents to provide insight into the problem. While at his previous position at Iowa State, the PI partnered with the Iowa State Veterans Center to provide extra math tutoring and support for student veterans, including an intensive day long Math Boot Camp at the start of each semester. In this project, he will develop similar programs at Auburn, with the first boot camp planned for fall 2021.<br/><br/>The proposal revolves around a few main themes: permanents, polytopal parameterizations, and persistent homology, approximation theory and splines. The first group of topics is unified by homological methods and simplicial complexes, and the second by the interplay of algebra and discrete geometry; the objects of investigation are central players in computational mathematics. The problems share three traits: they are of importance in real world applications; subtle geometric or combinatorial data is reflected algebraically; and they are computationally tractable. The project will use the power of computational algebra to discover hidden connections between important applied invariants and geometry, combinatorics, and algebra. There are elegant characterizations of key invariants for applications (e.g. dimension of the spline space for a polytopal subdivision, equations for Wachspress parametric surfaces, the support locus of persistent homology) in terms of algebra. The concrete and computational aspect of the problems means they are ideal for involving graduate students and postdocs, and makes prospects for progress excellent. In addition to scientific advances, the project will result in development of specialized software, to be coauthored with students and integrated into the NSF-sponsored Macaulay2 software package.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Techniques for ensuring AI fairness have received a lot of attention in the AI literature.  However, these techniques are yet to see a substantial degree of deployment in real systems, which has thus-far limited their real-world impact. This is likely due in part to several practical challenges for deploying fair AI technologies. Firstly, the conventional wisdom is that fairness brings a cost in prediction performance which could affect an organization's bottom-line. Secondly, it is difficult to know which mathematical definition of AI fairness is appropriate to adopt since the definitions conflict with each other and encode different value systems. Finally, there is a chicken-and-egg problem, in that public pressure for an organization to adopt fairness considerations into an AI system only increases after this has been successfully demonstrated elsewhere. This research will develop technical solutions to resolve these human-facing barriers for the adoption of AI fairness techniques, thereby increasing deployment and the subsequent positive real-world impact.<br/><br/>To resolve the practical limitations of fair AI techniques, this research incorporates human-centered considerations into the design and execution of fair AI algorithms, connecting and advancing the state of the art in statistical machine learning, fair AI, and human-centered AI.  The first track of the project will develop methods for obtaining ?fairness for free,? in which the fairest possible solution is found when sacrificing little-to-no performance.  The researchers will design black-box, gray-box, and white-box approaches to this task.  Then, the second track of the research will focus on developing explainable AI and data visualization techniques to help humans assess and trade off the consequences of different competing notions of fairness.  A key step to accomplish this is to create a unifying fairness framework which systematically encodes the space of possible fairness metrics.  Finally, in the third track of the project, the researchers will develop practical solutions to several real-world applications of AI fairness, including the allocation of medical resources, and AI-based career counseling. The solutions will involve both applied and fundamental AI research, and will facilitate the evaluation of the methods developed in the first two tracks.  The project also includes initiatives for outreach, broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, training and educating graduate students, and curriculum development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This constraint places existing computational light transport techniques, and the remarkable capabilities they enable, outside of reach for several critical application areas that require imaging at microscopic scales, such as medical imaging, industrial fabrication, and material science. This project aims to change this state of affairs, by creating a bridge between computational light transport and optical interferometric imaging, a wave-optics technology well-suited for microscopic imaging. The project will produce a suite of computational interferometry systems that make available the full spectrum of computational light transport capabilities at microscopic scales. The project includes education and outreach programs tightly coupled to the research activities, namely: 1) the creation of interdisciplinary courses in visual computing, optics, and imaging; and 2) a series of workshops and summer courses for middle and high school students. These activities will bring long-term societal benefit, by encouraging students in secondary education and from traditionally under-represented backgrounds to take up STEM research and education as a career path.<br/><br/>The project will achieve its objective through three tightly coupled research thrusts: 1) The project will develop theoretical foundations that unify concepts across incoherent and coherent imaging. The discovered theories will enable the design of new interferometric imaging systems that can be programmed to selectively measure arbitrary light paths, while operating at microscopic scales. 2) The project will deploy these systems in a range of microscopic applications, including shape scanning, scattering tomography, and non-line-of-sight imaging. These task-specific implementations will demonstrate the flexibility and improved performance of computational interferometry. 3) The project will design hybrid optical-digital systems that use computational interferometry systems as optical computers, to perform common calculations with improved speed and signal-to-noise ratio. The produced computational interferometry systems will be evaluated under real conditions in medicine (deep tissue imaging), industrial manufacturing (closed-loop fabrication), and material analysis (scattering material characterization), thus creating strong potential for transformative impact in these critical application areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The location and size of these estuary plumes are highly dynamic because of seasonal changes in weather, winds, and ocean currents. The amount of nutrients carried by plumes ? and thus their impact on the coastal ocean ? also changes seasonally. This project is studying how the plume of the nation?s largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay, changes over the course of the year and what those changes mean for food webs and nutrient cycles in the coastal Atlantic Ocean. A model of water movements is being developed to predict how river flow, winds, and currents converge to cause seasonal changes in plume size, location, and composition. Research cruises spanning the area of the plume within the coastal ocean are collecting material within the plume as well as the animals living under and on top of the sediments. In parallel, experiments conducted on the ship are investigating how the animals and the chemical reactions in the sediment are affected by materials within the plume. By combining this modelling, measurements of bottom animal biomass and biodiversity, and nutrient experiments, this project is determining how estuarine plumes drive coastal food webs and productivity. Broader impacts include benefits to natural resource management through a better understanding of the linkages between plume dynamics, food webs and fisheries. Doctoral students, a postdoctoral scholar and undergraduate students are being trained in modeling, experimental and field research methods. Increasing diversity in STEM fields is occurring through a partnership with a community college (College of Southern Maryland) to recruit summer interns for research experiences. Outreach activities include the development of age-appropriate educational materials for the public and the use of these materials at ?in person? or virtual outreach events.<br/><br/>The overarching goal is to determine how the magnitude and reactivity of organic matter inputs and environmental conditions associated with spatially and temporally dynamic estuarine plumes affect inner continental shelf benthic communities. The project is analyzing the role of organic matter deposition, both labile and refractory, as a driver of benthic community structure and sediment-water biogeochemical flux rates. An integrative approach that combines hydrodynamic modelling, field observations and shipboard experiments is linking benthic responses to seasonal changes in plume characteristics. Specifically, a calibrated hydrodynamic model is being used to establish the history of plume-driven conditions and to quantify particle transport and deposition on the inner shelf. A survey of water-column conditions, organic matter pools, and benthic and epibenthic community composition at a fixed station grid are generating empirical measurements of benthic taxonomic and functional composition, biodiversity, and biomass. These measurements are being used to estimate secondary production and assess how it varies seasonally. Sediment-water nutrient fluxes and organic matter-specific nutrient assimilation rates (labile, refractory) by benthos are being quantified using experimental core incubations. Hydrodynamic plume reconstructions are coupled with observational and experimental data to test hypotheses regarding the stimulation of benthic biomass, biodiversity, and secondary production by plume particulate organic matter inputs both seasonally and spatially. Statistical models that account for feeding mode, past exposure to plume influence, lability of deposited organic matter, and physical forces (e.g., temperature, salinity, bed stress) are being developed to predict benthic responses to simulated plume conditions and, potentially, inform understanding of plume dynamics more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exacerbating the problem is that there is a growing shortage of general surgeons in the US, and hundreds of rural hospitals are projected to close in the coming years. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project produces much-needed research towards realizing autonomous surgery in the future to address these broad societal issues of healthcare access and equity challenges. Specifically, the project involves taking a big step of realizing autonomous surgical robots is imbuing them with knowledge of human anatomy and physiology in a transcribed form that can be leveraged by artificial intelligence for performing procedures autonomously. As part of the project, an educational plan that integrates closely with the research plan is planned. An interactive lesson-game for high school students is to be developed, and an experience in a classroom setting is planned in which they will explore programming and biology in a video game. <br/><br/>To achieve the overall goal of this project, dense and reduced-order models for representing multimodal, deformable tissue environments with semantic attributes will be investigated and neural networks to approximate the forward and inverse problem. An anatomical roadmap is defined that presents the human body as a semantic navigation problem, and local context can be leveraged to perform semantic localization and environment mapping. For semantic localization, theory and strategies for leveraging semantic labels in deformable scenes and methods will be defined, utilizing geometric priors and active manipulation to identify features and classify scene objects. Finally, given contextually informed observation models, anatomical context may be used to evaluate and optimize safe plans and robust trajectories as well as higher-level decision making such as behavior trees. The educational activity involving teaching students about programming and biology will focus on teaching anatomical context from a biological perspective and basic sequential logic from a block-programming perspective. As part of an interactive lesson, the activity includes a hands-on programming portion that involves building an autonomous agent to solve an educational surgical simulator videogame. Following the interactive lesson, survey data on their perceptions regarding STEM and the potential interdisciplinary nature of biology and computer science will be collected and parsed. Then, by making the activities open-sourced and incorporating our lessons learned, we aim for our videogame to reach underrepresented minorities and provide them an opportunity to experience the broader, multi-disciplinary opportunities that computer science, engineering, and biology have to offer. <br/><br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrodynamic cavitation is the formation, growth, and burst of gas bubbles in a rapidly flowing fluid. The resulting implosion of gas bubbles releases concentrated energy as pressure waves or high-speed micro jets. The impact of this project is on multiple fronts; the potential to reduce total energy spent in manufacturing processes, increase in the quality of the produced parts and fabrication of part features that are difficult to achieve with conventional manufacturing processes. The knowledge gained from this project could also be used to enhance the efficiency of existing cavitation-based systems in other areas beyond manufacturing such as cleaning devices, water purification, and homogenization of industrial and food products. The experimental and analytical work emanating from this project provides excellent educational opportunities to graduates and undergraduate students participating in the research. Particular emphasis is placed on engaging women and minority students in this project. The project also supports several classroom teaching initiatives within the manufacturing curriculum.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance the fundamental understanding of mechanisms for producing hydrodynamic cavitation from a high velocity fluid stream in a manufacturing process so that the pressure waves and micro-jets produced by this cavitation could be utilized to enhance the process. A combination of experimentation and analytical and numerical modeling is used to study different mechanisms for producing and controlling hydrodynamic cavitation. The study includes (1) characterization of hydrodynamic cavitation intensity via novel flow-induced vibration at various resonance frequencies, (2) characterization of vortex flows that can generate continuous and fully cavitating fluid streams thus increasing the yield on the energy to be harvested, and (3) development of mechanisms for creating self-resonating flows via superposition of pressure waves aimed at enhancing bubble collapse frequency. The analytical modeling provides an estimate of pressure induced during bubble collapse, whereas numerical modeling provides field variables depicting distribution behavior of cavitation in the fluid domain. To quantify the cavitation power density obtained from the above mechanisms, residual stresses and microhardness distributions measured from samples are mapped with field variables from numerical and analytical models. This project is aimed at creating a knowledge base to facilitate utilization of the cavitation energy to enhance manufacturing processes that involve high velocity fluid flow such as water jet cutting, water jet peening for surface treatment, nano-lubricant formulation, and polishing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peroxisomes are essential subcellular organelles involved in lipid metabolism and hydrogen peroxide detoxification. Despite the crucial role of peroxisomes in maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis, our knowledge on how cells cope with peroxisome dysfunction is largely missing. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, this project aims to uncover novel peroxisome surveillance pathways and a cascade of stress responses induced by defective peroxisomes. Through this project, the investigators will integrate peroxisome research into innovative educational activities allowing students to gain hands-on experiences in genetic and cell biology research. These educational activities include: 1) Developing an innovative undergraduate laboratory course to provide students with hands-on experience in genome editing and imaging techniques through course-based undergraduate research experiences; and 2) Engaging undeclared students in genetic and cell biology research through partnership with ?The Sky is the Limit? learning community. These integrated education programs will engage larger and more diverse groups of undergraduate students in biology research, and make basic research more inclusive.<br/><br/>Peroxisomes are important, yet least studied subcellular organelles in all eukaryotic cells. Dysregulated peroxisomal protein translocation can lead to impaired organelle function and disrupted cellular homeostasis. However, little is known about how cells surveil and respond to impaired peroxisomal protein import. This project will utilize state-of-the-art genome-wide CRISPR screening and TurboID proximity labelling techniques to map novel peroxisome stress response pathways and identify mechanisms underlying cellular homeostatic response to defective peroxisomal protein import. Several novel hypothesis will be examined, including: 1) How peroxisomal membrane proteins relay stress signal from the peroxisome to the nucleus; and 2) How serine/arginine-rich splicing factors activate cellular adaptive responses upon peroxisomal stress. Overall, the results of this research will likely have an important and positive impact on the protein translocation stress research field and may significantly advance our understanding of cellular adaptation to dysregulated peroxisomal protein import.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical models can inform scientific understanding of these complex and ever-changing systems, as well as public health policy. In particular, mechanistic models, mathematical models that describe the key processes that drive dynamic, real-world systems, along with empirical data, can be useful for assessing the efficacy of different control strategies, or testing different hypotheses about the underlying biology. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored both the importance of mechanistic models and the challenges of implementing these models to inform policy. One of these challenges, which spans disciplines, arises when there is a mismatch between the data available and the data required to inform these models and  reduce uncertainty in model outputs and predictions. A model-data mismatch could lead to erroneous conclusions about which control policies will be most effective at achieving a particular goal. This project aims to create a methodology that finds the most cost-effective approach to data collection for a given mathematical model, such that the model produces reliable outputs and measures of uncertainty. Applying these methods to recent case studies like COVID-19, Zika, and Ebola can inform appropriate responses to, and improve preparedness for, future pandemics. These methods will also be applicable to areas of ecology and physiology, where the overarching goal of integrating modeling and empirical studies is critical to progress. Integral to the research objectives is a new education program targeting undergraduate students, with unrecognized potential in STEM. A series of educational <br/>modules will engage students in the fundamentals of mathematical modeling, coding, and visualization, using a collaborative and inquiry-based approach. Participants will hone these skills by working with epidemiological models related to the proposed project, and will use their creativity and unique perspectives as novice modelers with diverse backgrounds to promote model literacy in the general public.<br/><br/>One way to address the problem of a model-data mismatch is first to evaluate the practical identifiability of a model, that is, the ability to estimate model parameters unambiguously from data, given a particular data set.  Conclusions derived from a practically unidentifiable model may not be robust.  Furthermore, commonly used methods to determine practical identifiability of epidemiological models rely on simple likelihood models (functions proportional to the probability of observed data given the model parameters) that make unrealistic assumptions about epidemiological data, which in reality are highly correlated and complex.  A poor approximation to the true likelihood model can lead to inaccurate estimates of uncertainty in model outputs.  Using appropriate identifiability metrics and improved (yet tractable) likelihood models, control theory can be leveraged to derive data sampling strategies, constrained by finite public health resources, that render a model practically identifiable.  The approach is to find sampling protocols that jointly minimize the identifiability metric and the cost of the sampling strategy.  These new methods will be tested using synthetic data, and applied to recent outbreaks to determine what data sampling strategies would have been sufficient to reduce the uncertainty in model parameter estimates, and therefore, reduce uncertainty in model outputs.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and the BIO Division of Environmental Biology through the Population and Community Ecology (PCE) Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by accounting for the spatial patterns present in parasite genomic data as well as the spatial properties of features of the landscape and built environment that are relevant for gene flow, for example, features that serve to either impede or enable parasite migration. The investigators consider how the spatial distribution of parasite genomic sampling locations impacts estimated migration patterns and determine whether the mapped migration paths are still meaningful even when there is an irregular distribution of sampling locations. The research provides insights on how to include locally known migration barriers as well as other relevant natural or built environmental features into mapped migration estimates. As public health officials work toward reducing and eventually eliminating malaria, local information about factors driving malaria risk is important for prioritizing resources and optimizing control and elimination strategies. <br/><br/>The research will be undertaken using computational methods that generate estimated effective migration surfaces. These methods use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to estimate migration and create migration contours that can be mapped to show relative high or low areas of gene flow. This research will integrate local spatial features to improve gene flow estimates and account for possible barriers thereby reducing spatial uncertainty that is commonplace in current maps of parasite migration. A set of analyses will be undertaken to determine the robustness of parasite migration surface estimates to varying spatial distributions of genomic data sample locations. This research is expected to not only have a profound impact for local public health officials tasked with eliminating P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria but will transform the ability of a broader group of researchers to produce parasite migration estimates for other kinds of species at local scales and provide new computational tools for studying parasite migration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This brain-to-skull interaction exemplifies the prevalence and compounding effects of interactions between tissue types. Nevertheless, analyses used in most anatomical studies treat each tissue as independent, isolated entities. Disregarding tissue-to-tissue interactions impedes true diagnoses of factors that contribute to anatomical changes along developmental and evolutionary timelines. To address this issue using modern techniques, the proposed research features two complementary projects on brain-skull interactions. The first study involves collection and analysis of high-density brain and skull shape data across >350 bird species to understand how the brain and skull have directed each other?s evolutionary trajectories. To pinpoint the mechanisms governing brain and skull interactions, the second study comprises embryological experiments on a novel avian model organism with a bizarrely shaped brain and skull. Collectively, these projects will demonstrate the contribution of tissue-to-tissue interactions on emergence of novel and diverse anatomical forms. Beyond its scientific merit, the research will also foster Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) talent through development and implementation of (i) a project-based Embryology module into a nascent graduate program; (ii) new virtual reality (VR) and 3-D puzzle games; and (iii) musical expressions of scientific data to engage more inclusive audiences, including racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and artistically inclined non-expert audiences.<br/><br/>The Darwinian paradigm champions the role of adaptive selection as a key process underlying trait evolution. However, recent large-scale evolutionary studies have shown that functional and ecological variables account for very modest amounts of the total morphological diversity of a structure. If ecology and function account for only a small proportion of the total phenotypic disparity, what are the major drivers of diversification through deep time? Instead of analyzing a single structure, this research focuses on the interactions between structures as a fundamental process that accounts for the unity and diversity of traits. Using the brain and craniofacial anatomy as an exemplar system, the project comprises (i) a collection-based interspecific analysis of brain-skull integration across the avian tree of life; and (ii) observational and manipulative developmental studies on a pair of chicken breeds, one with aberrant brain and skull morphologies. Through a synthesis of classic and modern techniques, including computed tomography (CT) imaging, high-density shape analysis, in vivo embryology, and fluorescence microscopy, these studies will visualize, model, and test evolutionary and developmental interactions between brains and skulls across multiple scales, from subcellular to gross anatomical levels. Importantly, these techniques and the resulting scientific data will converge on three proposed education initiatives: (i) a new project-focused Embryology module for a nascent graduate program; (ii) an immersive virtual reality (VR) game and an associated 3D-printed puzzle; and (iii) a STEAM project that translates biological data into music, offering a new modality to express and teach scientific concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This biomass includes the food, fiber and fuel required by humans and other life on this planet. During this conversion, the initial step of photosynthesis can react with atmospheric oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, which produces compounds that must be recycled. This recycling process, called photorespiration, requires large percentages of the plant?s energy reserves and releases carbon dioxide, thereby reducing plant growth and productivity. Photorespiration is affected by environmental conditions, increasing relative to photosynthesis as temperature rises. This research project explores the temperature response of photorespiration to determine how it will respond under future climates and seeking strategies to improve its efficiency. Findings from this proposal will be integrated into education activities and disseminated widely. Diverse students will be engaged via a research collaboration with a primary undergraduate institution serving under-represented students. Additionally, the potential for this work to improve crop productivity and the importance of models in plant biology will be disseminated by continuing Sounds of Science performances. The Sounds of Science is a unique collaboration where composers create music from research data provided by a plant scientist. Presentations where the investigators present an overview of the research and the compositions are performed will be recorded in partnership with local public media and have the potential to reach a public audience of ~500,000 Michigan residents.<br/><br/>Photorespiration is the second largest metabolic flux of carbon in an illuminated leaf and occurs when rubisco, the initial enzyme of carbon fixation, binds with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide and produces a molecule that must be recycled. Photorespiration recycles this molecule into Calvin-Benson cycle intermediates at the great cost of carbon. Understanding the mechanisms of carbon dioxide release during photorespiration is critical for predicting plant responses to climate change and potentially engineering plants with improved carbon assimilation and productivity. When temperature increases, photorespiration releases even more carbon dioxide per rubisco oxygenation, but the mechanism of this increase is unknown. The objective of this proposal is to resolve the mechanisms of this excess carbon dioxide release at high temperatures using an innovative combination of metabolic modeling, in vivo gas exchange, and isotopic labeling approaches. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that excess carbon dioxide release occurs from photorespiration at elevated temperatures when intermediates react non-enzymatically in the peroxisome with hydrogen peroxide produced from photorespiration. This hypothesis assumes that under ambient temperatures hydrogen peroxide is efficiently detoxified by the enzyme catalase, but under elevated temperatures catalase is unable to remove hydrogen peroxide quickly enough to minimize non-enzymatic decarboxylation reactions. The results of this project will reach across disciplinary boundaries with the strong potential to improve earth-system models of carbon cycling and to identify key traits for adapting photosynthesis to real-world growing conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmonic Analysis is a central area in today's Mathematics, with far-reaching connections to other fields of Science, from Number Theory to Physics. The meeting will focus on new developments in Harmonic Analysis that bring together the methods and perspectives of Noncommutative Geometry with those of Representation Theory. Both have seen spectacular advances over the past decades, leading them to become vast and vibrant areas of research, yet they remain mostly separated. The meeting will bring together experts in both fields to foster exchanges and incorporate new connections in the training of a new generation of researchers in Harmonic Analysis. In order to acquaint researchers in the two areas, especially early career researchers, with the perspectives from both sides, it will feature two mini-courses specifically aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and delivered by prominent mathematicians. Other activities will include research talks, discussion sessions and a poster session, giving participants many opportunities for meaningful interactions. Early career researchers will have the possibility to interact with established experts in a context particularly conducive to the formation of long-lasting mentoring relations. The organizers will strive to encourage participation of a diverse audience, including women and individuals from groups, organizations, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>At the foundation of Harmonic Analysis are the well-known principles that a geometric space may be studied through its space of functions, and that the analysis of these functions is simplified by taking into account the symmetries of the space. The decomposition of periodic functions into Fourier series is an elementary manifestation of this idea, which has been at the core of the pioneering work of Gelfand, Mackey, Dixmier and many others since the 1940s. In that regard, the Representation Theory and Noncommutative Geometry are both deeply rooted in Harmonic Analysis. Indeed, the study of tempered representations  generated an immense amount of activity in the second half of the twentieth century, culminating in Harish-Chandra's Plancherel theorem, the  realization of the discrete series and the classification of tempered irreducible representations by Knapp and Zuckerman. More recently, further efforts following Vogan's algebraic approach have led to a nearly complete computer-assisted description of all unitary representations of real algebraic groups. Now that classification questions have been given nearly complete answers, problems of different natures are receiving more attention. The analysis of functions on homogeneous spaces in terms of unitary representations leads to fundamental questions for which new conceptual tools are necessary. At the same time, recent results in Noncommutative Geometry clearly indicate that current investigations related to Index Theory and the topological approach to the tempered dual via the Connes-Kasparov isomorphism and the Mackey-Higson bijection provide original insight and new organizing principles in Representation Theory. The meeting will focus on extending the current methods beyond the group case to that of homogeneous spaces through joint effort of specialists from the two communities.

It is currently believed that increased temperature is more toxic for cancer compared to normal tissue. In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that the magnetic nanoparticles actively dissolve themself under the action of the magnetic field, thereby adding chemical toxicity, which also helps kill cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, new optical sensors will be developed to measure localized temperature and iron salt concentration around the magnetic particles. The collected knowledge will be used to increase the efficiency of hyperthermia treatment of cancer and eventually decrease the side effects.

A thin fluorescent coating of magnetic particles will be sensitive to the change of temperature and the concentrations of iron ions. Ultrahigh brightness of the photonic sensors will allow detecting the changes in temperature and ionic concentration optically, which is otherwise highly challenging. This technique will aid in the understanding of the action of the oscillating magnetic field on iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles. This understanding is important because magnetic fields are considered not only for hyperthermia treatment of cancer but for various other imaging and drug delivery techniques as well. This work will also shed light on the understanding of the photonic properties of encapsulated dyes inside of nanoporous silica matrix of the proposed nanosensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Progress in mathematics education can be facilitated by identification and removal of factors that impede math engagement and learning. One such factor is anxiety about mathematics. Math anxiety predicts avoidance of math and poor math achievement, and disproportionately affects individuals with math learning disabilities, women, minorities, and those from lower socio- economic backgrounds. Although substantial work has demonstrated the various correlates and deleterious effects of math anxiety, there is much less direct evidence about what causes it. The main goal of this research is to explore one potential cause of math anxiety that has received relatively little research attention: time-pressure. Time-pressure is a major aspect of math instruction and assessment, from elementary classrooms to university lecture halls. This research project, conducted by researchers from Georgetown University, will address three primary questions: (1) Does time-pressure in math settings cause math anxiety in-the-moment and, if so, are there physiological markers that identify on whom it has the greatest impact? (2) Does time-pressure have long-term implications for math learning, future resilience to time pressure, and math anxiety? (3) Does exposure to time-pressure in math settings have differential implications, whether positive or negative, depending on when in development that exposure occurred? The project is funded by a CAREER award from the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The project will use both an experimental approach (randomized controlled trial) and a longitudinal approach (cross-lagged longitudinal design). The investigators will also examine three different age groups for whom time-pressure in math settings is highly relevant, but may respond to this time-pressure in different ways: elementary (2nd grade), middle-school (8th grade), and college students. They will examine whether time- pressure impacts math anxiety and math performance in-the-moment, the impact time-pressure has on math learning and trait-level math anxiety, and whether exposure to time-pressure modulates the reciprocal interplay between changes in math anxiety and math ability across development. They will use behavioral as well as physiological measures of anxiety such as cardiac activity. Together, this work has the potential to inform decisions made by instructors about how to assess and encourage students to practice basic math skills. More broadly, these decisions have implications for consolidation of math skills in children and adults, changing attitudes about math, and equality of access to STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, the 21st century, which promises to thrive on big data, remote sensing, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and so on, demands novel devices, which can operate with power so frugal that ambient energy harvesting may accommodate all of their needs. The conventional silicon based complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology is inadequate for achieving such goals necessitating novel material discovery and device level innovations. This may be achieved in two-dimensional straintronic field effect transistors by utilizing a unique property of two-dimensional materials, namely, strain induced dynamic bandgap engineering and integrating it with piezoelectric nanotransducers, which will be explored in the proposed research. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The aim of the proposal is to experimentally demonstrate steep slope switching in two-dimensional straintronic field effect transistors (2D SFET) exploiting in-operando and uniaxial strain engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The 2D SFET can defy the thermodynamic limit imposed by Boltzmann statistics in conventional metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (FET) and achieve sub-60mV/decade subthreshold swing at room temperature along with high on-state performance. Realization of 2D SFET requires monolithic integration of 2D TMDC based FETs with piezoelectric (PE) ceramic based nanotransducers. The PE expands in response to an applied gate bias and transduces an out-of-plane stress on the 2D channel material reducing its bandgap. The result is an internal voltage amplification that leads to steep slope switching. While static, in-plane, and biaxial strain is used in conventional silicon technology, dynamic strain engineering is a relatively uncharted territory. Consequently, exploration of novel straintronic devices based on novel 2D TMDCs will add new fundamental knowledge towards advancing concepts for resolving critical computing needs and grand engineering challenges. Furthermore, the proposed straintronic platform will offer exciting opportunities to develop novel concepts including straintronic neuromorphic devices (SNDs) for brain-inspired computing, straintronic memory devices (SMDs) for in-memory computing, and straintronic security devices (SSDs) for secure computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pb-based organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) solar cells have shown tremendous promise with big leap in efficiency in less than a decade. However, due to presence of Pb and poor stability, these materials may pose issues for widespread use and commercialization of OIHP solar cells. The research community has not yet come up with a high performance alternative to Pb-based OIHP solar cells, primarily due to material defects. This project will develop air-stable and low defect density Pt-Ni and Sn-Ge based perovskite solar cells. Success in this project will result in development of a model system for Pb-free perovskite solar cells with stable buffer and contact materials. Lifetime prediction and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) models will be developed to determine the effect of Pb replacement on cell cost, energy yield, efficiency, degradation rates, encapsulation costs and recycling. In addition to these scientific advancements, PI will  train underrepresented minority graduate and undergraduate students on materials for energy applications. This CAREER project will also train the next generation workforce for solar energy jobs in Nevada at community colleges and UNLV. Dedicated workshop series to identify the fundamental roadblocks for development of high efficiency and Pb-free perovskite materials will be hosted in collaboration with academia and industry partners.<br/><br/>Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) have shown significant progress as low-cost, solution printable semiconductors with superior optoelectronic properties. For photovoltaic applications, these materials have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.2% single-junction and 29.1% perovskite-Si tandem devices. Despite the exceptional performance of OIHPs, toxicity of Pb, thermal stability, and stability due to ion migration are fundamental materials issues that need to be solved. The superior optoelectronic properties of Pb-based OIHPs have not yet been reproduced in Pb-free compositions due to high defect density and low absorption coefficient. The objectives of the proposed research are to develop all inorganic mixed halide-chalcogenide Pb-free perovskite photoabsorbers ABX3 and A2BX6 (A = Cs; B = Ge/Sn, Pt/Ni; X = I, Cl, Br, O, S) with tunable bandgap and high carrier lifetime. Dopant-free inorganic electron and hole transport layers with optimal band offsets will be developed for high efficiency and stable planar solar cells. Proposed work will address following: (1) solution processing of stable mixed halide-chalcogenide Pb-free perovskite thin films with low midgap defect density and high absorption coefficient; (2) stability and degradation mechanisms under junction bias, light illumination, heat, oxygen, UV and humidity; (3) surface and interface defect passivation with improved electron and hole transport layers; (4) high efficiency and stable Pb-free perovskite solar cells; (5) Accelerated stress testing protocols and numerical models for lifetime prediction and LCOE for Pb-free perovskite solar cells; and (6) cost-stability-performance trade-off analysis of Pb vs. Pb-free perovskite solar cells. Achieving a fundamental understanding of how to control the electronic, chemical, electrochemical, and dynamics behavior of Pb-free perovskite photoabsorbers will enable an entirely new generation of wide bandgap semiconductors for PV applications and beyond. Key international collaborations will be formed to address critical challenges for high efficiency Pb-free perovskite solar cells.

The main types of applications will be (4) the analysis of spectral methods on graphs and (5) localization phenomena in mathematical physics. The main tools will be basic facts from geometry analysis to reinterpret analytic estimates geometrically and vice versa, the interpretation of elliptic equations as fixed points in time of an associated parabolic equation (as well as associated techniques from parabolic equations) and various aspects of spectral theory.

The Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program addresses how and why coastal ecosystems and their services are changing. Like many coastal ecosystems, the Florida Everglades has been threatened by diversion of fresh water to support urban and agricultural expansion. At the same time, sea-level rise has caused saltwater intrusion of coastal ecosystems which stresses freshwater species, causes elevation loss, and contaminates municipal water resources. However, restoration of seasonal pulses of fresh water may counteract these threats. Researchers in the FCE LTER are continuing long-term studies and experiments to understand how changes in freshwater supply, sea-level rise, and disturbances like tropical storms interact to influence ecosystems and their services. The science team is guided by a diversity and inclusion plan to attract diverse scientists at all career stages. The team includes resource managers ? who use discoveries and knowledge from the FCE LTER to guide effective freshwater restoration ? and an active community of academic and agency scientists, teachers and other educators, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The project has a robust education and outreach program that engages the research team with the general public to advance science discoveries and protection of coastal ecosystems.<br/><br/>The FCE LTER research program addresses how increased pulses of fresh and marine water will influence coastal ecosystem dynamics through: (i) continued long-term assessment of changes in biogeochemistry, primary production, organic matter, and trophic dynamics in ecosystems along freshwater-to-marine gradients with a focus on how these affect accumulation of carbon and related elevation change, (ii) meteorological studies that evaluate how the climate drivers of hydrologic presses and pulses are changing, (iii) social-ecological studies of how governance of freshwater restoration reflects the changing values of ecosystem services, and (iv) use of high-resolution remote sensing, coupled with models to forecast landscape-scale changes. A new experimental manipulation will determine drivers and mechanisms of resilience to saltwater intrusion. Data syntheses integrate month-to-annual and inter-annual data into models of water, nutrients, carbon, and species patterns and interactions throughout the Everglades landscape to compare how ecosystems with different productivities and carbon stores respond (maintain, increase, or decline) to short- (pulses) and long-term changes (presses) in hydrologic connectivity. Synthesis efforts will use data from national and international research networks aimed at understanding how chronic presses and increasing pulses determine ecosystem trajectories, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nitrogen plays a critical role in boosting agriculture productivity but it has adverse impacts on the environment. Technologies and management practices have become increasingly available and affordable to improve the efficiency of N use in crop and livestock production, but limited improvement has been observed in environmental outcomes. For example, Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) in crop production has significantly increased and N fertilizer use has leveled off in the U.S., but the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico are still expanding, mostly driven by N and phosphorus (P) loaded from agriculture production. The improvement of N management in a crop or a livestock farm does not necessarily translate to N pollution reduction on a regional to global scale due to the complex responses of natural and human systems and lack of coordination among stakeholders and across spatial scales. This project will develop an N management framework that encompasses the complex N dynamics across systems and spatial scales, yet is simple enough to guide policies and actions of various stakeholders.<br/><br/>This project includes the following activities: (1) Design a hierarchical framework across systems including Cropping system nested within Animal- crop system, which is nested within the Food system, and finally nested within Ecosystem (CAFE); (2) Develop N budget databases according to the CAFE system framework on various spatial scales for the past three decades, including county-, watershed-, national, and global scales, and identify major gaps in N management at each scale; (3) Develop a case study for the Chesapeake Bay watershed to implement the CAFE system framework, and characterize spatial and temporal variations of N budgets and their drivers: (4) Facilitate the co-development of models, indicators, and communication products by students and stakeholders in order to effectively inform decision-making on N management. This project will advance the knowledge in N cycles by establishing a theoretical framework for integrated N management across spatial and system scales, and applying it to unpack N challenges on multiple spatial scales. This approach, leveraging the most recent advances in N cycle studies in both ecological and social science disciplines, will track changes in N management performance over time and space, identify management and engineering gaps that have been often neglected, help enable innovative technological and policy solutions, and assist and coordinate decision- making by stakeholders. A course will be developed to provide students unique opportunities to work with stakeholders on co-developing communication products targeted for wide distribution and use. Models and indicators developed from this project will are planned for implementation through collaborations with Chesapeake Bay Program, Environmental Defense Fund, and several international organizations, seeking direct impact on policies and informing consumers and producers. The data, indicators, models, and course materials produced by this project will be made publicly available online for use by other scientists, educators, farm advisors and students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symbiotic interactions involving subsets of species can have disproportionate impacts on communities, reaching well beyond each interacting species. Coral reefs host some of the most iconic symbiotic interactions in nature and are host to the highest diversity of life on the planet. Cleaning symbiosis, wherein small fish or shrimp remove external parasites and associated microorganisms from specific clients, is common on coral reefs. Sites on the reef occupied by cleaners, or ?cleaning stations?, attract a wide variety of fish species that engage in direct physical contact with the cleaner. These highly used territories are viewed both as ?clinics of the sea?, where parasitized and sickly fish seek the service of cleaners, but also as potential ?garbage dumps?, where unnecessary parasites and other microorganisms are removed. This project seeks to understand the role of cleaning symbiosis transferring microbes in coral reef environments. This research supports training for U.S. graduate students and for undergraduates from Arkansas State University, a primarily undergraduate institution that includes a large population of first-generation college students. These students participate in field site research and have opportunities to visit the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for broader exposure to ocean science and more specific laboratory training. The project strengthens international collaboration and further builds on the existing relationships between the team of scientists and resource managers, local divers, fishers, and boat operators, as well as K-12 schools and environmental education programs, and will therefore contribute to local economies. Outreach efforts include a film highlighting this research and publicly accessible narratives shared through press releases and an on-line magazine.<br/><br/>While the benefits of cleaning to reef ecosystem health have been extensively studied, the cleaning costs for cleaner species and the role of cleaning stations as potential sinks for microbial diversity and possibly even pathogens have never been assessed. Here, the researchers utilize the unique features of cleaning stations to understand transfer of bacterial and archaeal symbionts amongst fish and within coral reef environment. The study capitalizes on cleanerfish access to multiple variety of hosts or clients within stations to address new questions about how cleanerfish act as vectors to transfer microorganisms between hosts on a reef and if and how these microorganisms may play a broader functional role in reef resilience. Specifically, the project addresses the following hypotheses: 1) Cleanerfishes serve as keystone regulators of microbial communities, enhancing microbial community diversity and transferring key microbial species between clients, and 2) Cleanerfishes are a particularly important contributor to reef resilience, facilitating recovery of the microbiome following disturbance. The research team uses an integrative interdisciplinary approach involving field and laboratory observations and experiments, and molecular-based tools. The core research team includes experts in cleaning mutualisms, fish behavior, coral reef ecology, and microbial ecology. The proposed project aims to link behavior of individual organisms with ecosystem-level process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such a future cannot be realized with the traditional processors used in today's tablets and smartphone devices. While typical computers operate at power budgets of 10s-100s of watts, ultra-low-power devices would need to be able to operate at as low as 10s of milliwatts. And despite orders of magnitude less power, such devices would need to have the same compute capabilities and general programmability to support complex tasks such as data analytics, machine learning and wireless communication that are essential for these applications. In other words, even if it becomes possible to make the processor hardware ultra-low-power, these devices would be unusable if software developers are not able to write efficient programs that can run on these devices. This proposal makes the case for stochastic computing (SC), an unconventional approach for designing ultra-low-power systems. Instead of reading and writing data in binary, SC reads and writes in unary, where data is encoded as probabilities instead of standard digital numbers. This unconventional computing style allows SC to perform computations with circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller than their binary counterparts. For example, a multiplier circuit shrinks from 100s of logic gates down to a single logic gate in SC. Though promising, building processors using SC is no simple feat for a couple of reasons. First, there is a general lack of standard toolchains publicly available for designing, simulating and comparing SC circuits. Second, prior SC works are mostly case-by-case, proposing circuits that only work for specific applications and lack sufficient programmability for software developers to write useful programs.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is to lower the barrier-to-entry for non-expert developers to consider adopting SC in their systems. The PIs aim to develop and standardize an open-sourced framework, named UnarySim, for rapidly designing and evaluating SC systems. Leveraging the PIs' preliminary work on building efficient SC circuits, the project will culminate in the design of the first general-purpose, programmable SC processor that can support a variety of ultra-low-power applications. If the proposed research is successful, it can help proliferate the budding SC community and make SC a practical (and competitive) option in the tech industry. The broad goal of this proposal is to realize the potential of ultra-low-power computing, making it possible to perform unprecedented computing tasks at the cost (and size) of a dime. This can open the door for important new applications such as smart pacemakers, wearables, augmented reality and precision agriculture, to name a few. The insights gained from this research will be publicly disseminated in scientific venues and integrated into curricula to teach young students about power-saving principles and their impact on the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will substantially increase our understanding of monolayer cell membranes, which are variations in membrane structure that may help microbes survive in stressful environments. Uncovering the biological role of monolayer membranes, and the biochemistry required to produce them, will reveal some of the mechanisms microbes use to inhabit diverse and in some cases harsh environments. Improved understanding of monolayer membranes will also open new avenues in engineering microbes for biotechnology. Local high school students and undergraduates will participate in the research. Collaborations between researchers, participating students, and high school teachers will result in a high school teaching module focused on environmental microbiology. An additional outcome of this project will be the creation of an interactive regional soil database.<br/><br/>This project will define the environmental constraints and biochemical mechanisms that govern production of membrane-spanning lipids and monolayer cell membranes in the Acidobacteria. Functional roles for lipid monolayers and membrane-spanning lipids remain elusive. Membrane-spanning lipids are hypothesized to provide increased tolerance to elevated temperatures and low pH, as they are often associated with extremophilic lifestyles. However, their presence in numerous mesophilic prokaryotes, such as soil-dwelling bacterial species, has muddled this conclusion. This project will directly explore the connections between monolayer membranes, bacterial cell physiology, and biosynthesis of membrane-spanning lipids (branched dialkylglycerol tetraester and tetraether lipids) using tractable Acidobacteria model systems. One objective is to generate an environment to phenotype map for membrane-spanning lipid production. Another objective will be to identify and characterize biochemical processes involved in membrane-spanning lipid biosynthesis. Both objectives will utilize lipidomic, transcriptomic, and comparative genomic approaches to identify key regulatory and enzymatic pathways involved in producing branched dialkylglycerol tetraester and tetraether lipids. An additional component will be introducing membrane-spanning lipid biosynthetic capabilities to other bacterial species. Collectively, these objectives will deepen our understanding of the relationship between lipid structure, membrane function, and cell physiology in prokaryotes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These studies are expected to enable the development of new reactions useful for the assembly of complex molecules from inexpensive building blocks that are underutilized because they are inert to all but the harshest chemical reagents. In parallel with these research activities, Dr. Wickens will work to advance educational and outreach initiatives to increase the accessibility of organic chemistry through student-centered teaching innovations and collaborations with local artists to cultivate interest in science among the community. <br/><br/>Dr. Zachary Wickens and his research group are developing new strategies to promote thermodynamically challenging reductions under mild conditions. Strong reductants, such as alkali metals, possess a sufficient thermodynamic driving force to induce reactivity from even the most reductively recalcitrant molecules; however, these reagents are typically limited to polar reaction manifolds. In contrast, visible-light photoredox catalysis is a powerful strategy to selectively promote radical chemistry but the energy from visible light alone is insufficient to match the reduction potentials of alkali metals. The Wickens laboratory is working to bridge this gap and using electrochemistry to generate persistent radical anion photocatalysts with excited state reduction potentials far beyond conventional photoredox catalysis. These studies are expected to enable previously inaccessible transformations of abundant feedstocks under sustainable conditions. Synergistically, these research activities are providing training for a diverse cohort of graduate and undergraduate students and Dr. Wickens is also developing a new graduate-level course to facilitate the transition to graduate school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These massive sensors have promising and broad prospects to greatly advance big data-driven precision health, through comprehensively capturing behavioral, physiological or biological signals from the human body. Nevertheless, because of the big data volume brought by massive sensors, the system is very power-hungry and thus it is very pressing to innovate an ultra-low-power architecture. Targeting this crucial challenge, this project aims to develop new design methodologies, techniques and implementations to achieve a generalizable ultra-low-power architecture for wearable massive-sensor computers. Concretely, this project seeks to leverage novel deep learning approaches to minimize the power consumption of the system. Firstly, the data characteristics of sensor streams will be learned by deep learning to analyze, evaluate, and measure the redundancy in the data, which will then be used to activate just-enough sensors. The deep learning will learn the signal dynamics to intelligently determine the sensor activation schemes. Besides, the data on the activated sensors will be further analyzed and compressed to minimize the power consumption. The signal fluctuations and patterns will be learned by efficient deep learning models and then be encoded to sparsified representations. Real-world experiments will also be conducted to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed ultra-low-power architecture. <br/><br/>This project will develop a new ultra-low-power architecture to enable energy-efficient wearable massive-sensor computers, and thus greatly advance their real-world deployment.

This is essential for big data-driven precision health. The achieved human big data will effectively contribute to the study of time-varying, nonlinear, and unknown dynamics of the human body, and broadly benefit many areas like fitness and lifestyle management, medical decision support, disease model establishment, individualized treatment plan, and population-level big data mining. The research findings from this project will be broadly disseminated to the scientific communities, medical areas and other communities.

The central hypothesis is that the dispersion of coherent mesoscale eddies will provide an efficient estimate of the mesoscale diffusivity in the ocean.

Additive manufacturing, more commonly known as three-dimensional printing, is a method of making virtually any shape from a digital computer model.  Although desktop three-dimensional printers have become quite popular, they are often limited to smaller objects without sufficient strength for structural applications.  This research focuses on a relatively new class of additive manufacturing that is capable of making large-scale structures such as full-size cars and houses.  This project conducts fundamental research to better understand big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) of extruded carbon-fiber reinforced polymer materials to produce higher strength components that can be used in the automotive, aerospace, energy, construction and defense sectors.  This is a collaborative research effort between two universities that exposes a wide and diverse group of students, including women and minorities, to new manufacturing technologies and provide opportunities to engage in hands-on activities that encourage them to pursue a career in STEM-related fields.<br/><br/>While the development of big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) of large-scale polymer structures has moved quickly, a basic understanding of the unique microstructure within an extruded fiber-reinforced polymer composite has not kept pace. The majority of recent efforts to improve the mechanical performance of 3D-printed materials has focused on interfacial properties and addressing meso-structural defects, such as voids between beads due to incomplete filling.  However, there are significant opportunities for improving the mechanical performance of 3D printed structures by controlling the internal microstructure of the extruded bead.  Specifically, the goal of this research is to maximize the mechanical performance of an extruded polymer composite by controlling the size, orientation, and distribution of reinforcing fibers and voids that define its internal microstructure.  This is accomplished by altering the flow path and resulting shear strain fields within the single-screw extruder and optimizing processing parameters such as flow rate, pressure, and temperature profile. Research tasks seek to establish new finite element models for deposition flow as polymer melt passes through the screw and nozzle, in addition to constitutive models defined by differential equations that provide unique insight into fiber orientation, void formation, fiber breakage and particle migration during processing.  The resulting knowledge and database of material properties enable the printing of tailored microstructures within BAAM parts and components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Introducing an artificial protective layer on the Li metal electrode is an effective strategy to stabilize the Li electrode, yet how this protective layer interacts with the electrochemical process of Li metal anode is not well understood. This project will integrate experiments and simulations to understand how the physical and chemical properties of the protective layer affect the electrochemical performance of the Li metal electrode.

In this project, by an effective integration of experimental synthesis, characterization and phase-field simulations, a new understanding will be generated on electrochemistry and deformation/failure mechanism of suppressing dendrites, including mass transport, electric potential, stress, and deformation.

Because of the shortage, fewer students receive high quality instruction in STEM. Thus, many students graduate from high school without the skills needed for college and careers in today?s technology-driven world. This project aims to be part of the national solution by addressing the shortage in rural high-need school districts in West Tennessee. The project intends to recruit 25 individuals who hold undergraduate degrees in STEM fields, including STEM professionals. They will receive stipend support to become licensed educators as they complete a one-year master?s degree in education. This year of graduate school, followed by a mentored, one-year practicum while employed in rural high school classrooms, will prepare them as teachers. The need for more STEM teachers results both from too few teachers entering and too many leaving the teaching profession. This project intends to address both issues.  Financial support will lower the cost of entry to the teaching profession to address the problem of too few entering teaching. Proper preparation and mentorship are expected to address the problem of too many leaving teaching.<br/><br/>This project at the University of Tennessee at Martin includes partnerships with Gibson County Special School District, Lauderdale County School District, and Obion County School District. The project goals over five years include recruiting 25 individuals with bachelor?s degrees in mathematics, computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, geoscience, or engineering and preparing them to become highly effective teachers. Research shows that compensation and preparation influence the decision to become and to remain a teacher, regardless of content area. Through quantitative measures, interviews, and surveys, the project intends to examine how financial and other factors motivate individuals with STEM degrees to become teachers. The preparation includes Growth Mindset and the Classroom Organization and Management Program in addition to education coursework, early clinical experiences, implicit bias awareness training, and preparation for the edTPA assessment of preservice teachers. The project will examine the effects of graduate education coursework and of mentorship on these individuals? effectiveness in and persistence in the teaching profession. The project expects to have a broader impact of increasing access to effective STEM education for students in rural high-need schools. External evaluators from RMC Research Corporation will assess achievement of project goals. Project findings will be disseminated through conferences and journals of national educator associations by project investigators.

Secure compilation is a principled approach to building systems with end-to-end security guarantees from the start. When compiling code, secure compilers ensure that the security properties of high-level code are preserved down to the machine code level. Unfortunately, the gap between the theory of secure compilation and practice is huge. In particular, existing real-world industrial compilers are not secure compilers. The goal of this project is to bridge this gap by extending the industrial WebAssembly bytecode into a unifying principled and practical abstraction for secure compilation. To this end, this project will develop (1) novel techniques and principles which will serve as foundations for end-to-end secure systems and (2) new tools that will allow programmers to build new secure systems and verify the security of existing ones. The results of this project could make hundreds of millions of users safer: end-to-end security guarantees can prevent exploits in widely-used systems, from web browsers to next generation cloud platforms. The project will also contribute to the education of both college and high school students, and train the next generation engineers how to build end-to-end secure systems. <br/><br/>This project takes a principled and practical approach to building secure systems by turning WebAssembly into a secure compilations intermediate representation (IR): a target IR for secure compilers from high-level languages and as a source IR for secure compilers to machine code. Turning WebAssembly into a secure compilation IR requires addressing research challenges on two fronts. First, WebAssembly currently does not expose any abstractions for reasoning about high-level security properties, like memory-safety or constant-time. This makes it hard to build secure compilers to WebAssembly. Second, existing compilers of WebAssembly are not proven to preserve any security properties at the machine code level; bugs in compilers and microarchitectural details could both undermine WebAssembly's security guarantees (and thus the security of the systems that rely on these guarantees). This project tackles these challenges by (1) developing secure compilers of WebAssembly to native platforms, (2) extending WebAssembly with new abstractions (e.g., for memory-safety and constant-time) that make it possible to build secure compilers to WebAssembly, and (3) building secure compilers from high-level languages to WebAssembly that preserve properties like memory-safety and constant-time end-to-end. The project will yield both new innovations in formal reasoning and advances in practical secure systems building.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This biomass includes the food, fiber and fuel required by humans and other life on this planet. During this conversion, the initial step of photosynthesis can react with atmospheric oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, which produces compounds that must be recycled. This recycling process, called photorespiration, requires large percentages of the plant?s energy reserves and releases carbon dioxide, thereby reducing plant growth and productivity. Photorespiration is affected by environmental conditions, increasing relative to photosynthesis as temperature rises. This research project explores the temperature response of photorespiration to determine how it will respond under future climates and seeking strategies to improve its efficiency. Findings from this proposal will be integrated into education activities and disseminated widely. Diverse students will be engaged via a research collaboration with a primary undergraduate institution serving under-represented students. Additionally, the potential for this work to improve crop productivity and the importance of models in plant biology will be disseminated by continuing Sounds of Science performances. The Sounds of Science is a unique collaboration where composers create music from research data provided by a plant scientist. Presentations where the investigators present an overview of the research and the compositions are performed will be recorded in partnership with local public media and have the potential to reach a public audience of ~500,000 Michigan residents.<br/><br/>Photorespiration is the second largest metabolic flux of carbon in an illuminated leaf and occurs when rubisco, the initial enzyme of carbon fixation, binds with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide and produces a molecule that must be recycled. Photorespiration recycles this molecule into Calvin-Benson cycle intermediates at the great cost of carbon. Understanding the mechanisms of carbon dioxide release during photorespiration is critical for predicting plant responses to climate change and potentially engineering plants with improved carbon assimilation and productivity. When temperature increases, photorespiration releases even more carbon dioxide per rubisco oxygenation, but the mechanism of this increase is unknown. The objective of this proposal is to resolve the mechanisms of this excess carbon dioxide release at high temperatures using an innovative combination of metabolic modeling, in vivo gas exchange, and isotopic labeling approaches. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that excess carbon dioxide release occurs from photorespiration at elevated temperatures when intermediates react non-enzymatically in the peroxisome with hydrogen peroxide produced from photorespiration. This hypothesis assumes that under ambient temperatures hydrogen peroxide is efficiently detoxified by the enzyme catalase, but under elevated temperatures catalase is unable to remove hydrogen peroxide quickly enough to minimize non-enzymatic decarboxylation reactions. The results of this project will reach across disciplinary boundaries with the strong potential to improve earth-system models of carbon cycling and to identify key traits for adapting photosynthesis to real-world growing conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much like stable human communities, stable microbial communities are composed of many different members. Each member pursues their own strategies for survival, while at the same time interacting with each other and the physical environment in positive and negative ways to create a stable ?neighborhood.? Like human communities encountering natural disasters or gentrification, microbial communities often encounter natural or human-caused disruption. This project aims to determine and characterize the features that determine if a microbial community can be resilient or malleable to change when disrupted. This question will be addressed by creating simplified models of microbial communities, introducing disruptions like newcomer microbes or genetically altering existing community members, and then seeing how the community composition and behavior changes as a result of these disruptions. This research aims to uncover general rules that will allow more accurate predictions of microbial community responses to disruptions, which will allow for the design of interactions with natural microbial communities in ways that benefit humans and their environments. This project will train undergraduate students from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds.<br/><br/><br/>The human microbiota and the microbial communities of the environments that humans interact with shape human biology and lives. Previous observational studies have identified compositional features of some of these communities, and a mechanistic understanding how these microbial communities interact with humans is beginning to take shape. The question of how the members in these microbial communities influence each other, however, remains. Bioengineering has the potential to introduce genetically designed microorganisms to human and environmental communities to improve and modify their functions, but fundamental questions about microbe community behavior and device engineering remain unanswered. For example, can a genetically-modified organism enter an existing community and establish itself as a member? The rules that govern how organisms naturally enter or leave the community are unknown. Once there, how will the community affect the behavior of the genetic device and vice versa? These questions will be addressed mechanistically by first developing in vitro microbial community models ranging from pairs of representative organisms grown in batch culture to complex environmental inocula grown in continuous culture. These in vitro models will allow for inexpensive and rapid experimentation compared to currently existing in vivo models. Then, newcomer microbes will be introduced and changes in model community composition and gene expression will be identified through RNA-seq. Tn-seq screening will identify the mechanism by which successful newcomer microbes establish themselves in the model communities. Concurrently, commonly used promoters and reporter genes will be constructed, and their performance quantified at the RNA and protein levels and compared between pure culture and community culture. This data will be used to uncover rules for designing devices that are tuned for optimal function in microbial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Admired since the Victorian age, these organisms are often referred to as the ?glass houses of the sea? because of the intricate architecture of their cell walls made of silicon dioxide, or glass. When these organisms die, the cellular-associated carbon and other elements can be either recycled and reused by other phytoplankton or, because glass is heavier than seawater, lost by sinking out of the surface ocean. Thus, the contribution diatoms make to carbon cycling is dictated by the balance between the factors that facilitate recycling and those that stimulate export. As the most abundant entity in the ocean, viruses have, for decades, been characterized as efficient recyclers, acting as ?shunts? by preventing the transfer of energy up the food chain through host mortality and lysis. However, it has been suggested that viruses may also act as ?shuttles? to the deep ocean, stimulating cellular processes that facilitate sinking. This project is testing this emerging hypothesis and determining how different nutrient regimes influence the fate of diatoms through impacts on viral infection dynamics and death. This is particularly timely given major national and international initiatives currently seeking to quantify how ecosystem interactions regulate carbon export in the ocean. Results of this project have the potential to challenge the canonical role of diatom viruses in carbon cycling and transform the understanding of host-virus interactions in the ocean. This project provides critical funding support for a soft-money, underrepresented, female oceanographer, as well a graduate student and undergraduates. Proposed fieldwork leverages a Rutgers and European Union-funded project, fostering ongoing collaborations with researchers at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples, Italy. To facilitate ocean literacy, the PIs are working with the Rutgers? Education and Outreach team to conduct a series of Teen Cafes focused on carbon cycling, phytoplankton, and viruses utilizing the ?Tools of Science? (ToS), a series of educational videos and lesson plans designed to introduce middle, high school, and undergraduate students in underrepresented and underserved communities to core scientific practices. <br/><br/>Diatoms contribute almost 40% of marine primary productivity, dominating the biological pump and disproportionately contributing to carbon export due to the ballasted nature of a silica-based cell wall. The contribution of diatoms to carbon sequestration is dictated by the balance between upper ocean remineralization and sinking, yet we still cannot explain widespread spatio-temporal variability in diatom-mediated export. As the most abundant predatory entities in the ocean, viruses play a critical role in shaping microbial ecosystems and driving global biogeochemical cycles. The premise of this proposal is that nutrient regimes drive the biogeochemical consequences of diatom host-virus interactions. For decades, the role of viruses as ?shunts?, redirecting particulate matter away from higher trophic levels and into the dissolved fraction through host lysis, has dominated microbial ecology and marine virology. However, the idea that viruses may also act as ?shuttles?, facilitating carbon export by stimulating aggregation and/or ballast production, is now emerging as a potential mechanism for carbon flux. This project is conducting laboratory-based studies on diverse diatom host-virus systems and manipulative studies on natural diatom communities to compare the impact of viral infection on processes that facilitate sinking ? mineral ballast production and particle aggregation ? to those that stimulate remineralization ? bacterial-mediated hydrolysis and subsequent remineralization of diatom particulate organic matter and silica. Taken together, this work is characterizing the relative balance between these diametrically opposing outcomes within the ecophysiological context of nutrient regime (specifically, silicon and iron limitation), ultimately elucidating the impact of viral infection on the fate of diatom organic matter in the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This investment has helped markedly improve courses and programs at many universities by testing and sharing research-based practices that promote active learning, increase student motivation and engagement, diversify the field, and better prepare students for work. At the same time, the investment has typically focused on researchers collecting new data, resulting in hundreds of data sets that remain underexplored. These existing data sets have significant potential to be analyzed and even combined in new ways to further support large-scale changes in how we recruit, teach, and prepare engineering students for the demands and challenges of the 21st century. Currently, however, engineering education researchers do not have productive and effective ways for sharing and analyzing data beyond the original project. Thus the full potential of these data sets remains untapped. This project will address that gap by developing and promoting a viable approach that will enable researchers to leverage the rich data currently available. In doing so, it will simultaneously improve engineering education nationally and increase the return on investment of public funds. The project will bring experienced researchers together with those just beginning their careers to identify the major roadblocks to sharing and re-using data, develop strategies and practices for overcoming those roadblocks, and conduct a series of test cases that demonstrate how to put those strategies and practices into action. The results will help create a paradigm shift that can move both the study and the practice of engineering education in the U.S. to a new level and spur the kind of sea changes needed to keep the nation?s engineering workforce at the forefront of the global marketplace.<br/><br/>Changing the paradigm of single-use data collection is a high-risk proposition that requires actionable, proven practices for effective, ethical data sharing, coupled with sufficient incentives to both share and use existing data. To that end, this proposal draws together a team of experts to overcome substantial obstacles in data sharing and build a framework to guide secondary analysis in engineering education research. In particular, we will bring together established and emerging scholars to deliver a tested framework that outlines methodological best practices for formally and informally sharing data, making data sets public, combining data from different studies, performing secondary analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data, publishing and sharing the results, securing the needed funding, and ensuring that the work is valued in the field. To create this framework, the research team will hold a series of six workshops over two years. In the first year, we will bring highly respected, experienced researchers from institutions across the country together with newer researchers to create the initial framework for data sharing and data re-use. In the second year, we will test and refine that framework on two existing data sets. We will solicit data sets from the wider community, and invite teams of scholars to conduct secondary analysis on those data sets, in conversation with the original researchers. Importantly, in selecting both the data sets and the approaches to secondary analysis, we will emphasize methodological diversity to ensure that the framework is widely applicable. The outcome will be a framework document that will comprise a set of tested guidelines for data sharing and secondary analysis in engineering education research, distributed through both journals and workshops to promote widespread adoption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the past century, pathology has been performed on microscopically thin sections of tissues that are stained and mounted onto glass microscope slides for analysis by a pathologist. This process is labor-intensive, costly, and the turnaround time is typically one week. For the vast majority of biopsy procedures, the diagnostic result is not obtained for days or even weeks after the procedure. Current bedside pathology techniques for rapid diagnosis and quality assurance of biopsy samples are slow, inaccurate, destructive to the tissue, and require the presence of multiple trained personnel, which prevent them from being widely used. Recent technological advances allow digitizing of the physical microscope slides and enable a fully digital pathology workflow. However, to date no system can take a fresh tissue sample through the entire long, laborious processing lifecycle prior to imaging.  This project will develop a tissue processing and imaging platform to enable fast, automated processing from the fresh sample to the digital image within minutes of tissue removal. This will provide better care and patient outcomes and enables new opportunities to provide care in clinical settings with more limited pathology resources. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project continues development of an integrated technology platform that automates the entire process of tissue processing and digital imaging, obviating the need for trained personnel to be on-site.

However, experiments within the past ten years suggest that sensory precision is enhanced even further when cells interact. These experiments are fascinating and raise many fundamental questions about sensory cooperation, information sharing, and collective behavior. This project will address this problem by developing a comprehensive theory of collective cellular sensing. The project focuses on three examples from cell biology - morphogenesis in Drosophila, chemotaxis in E. coli, and metastasis of breast cancer and melanoma cells, where experiments suggest that cell-cell communication enhances sensing, but the mechanism of enhancement is poorly understood. In each case, a theoretical framework will be developed based on known features of the system and the framework will be validated using experimental data. The research, educational, and outreach activities are designed in a strongly interconnected manner to increase the broader impact of the work. Graduate and undergraduate students will directly perform the research and disseminate it through publications and conferences. The research will be integrated into education via an inquiry-based teaching module and cross- disciplinary units in the PI's graduate and undergraduate courses. Designed and piloted in collaboration with graduate students, the departmental outreach coordinator, and a local high school teacher, the activity will be delivered on campus, at an Indiana middle school serving underrepresented students, and at a state-wide and a national education conference, thereby reaching thousands of middle and high school students, particularly underrepresented students. Special focus is placed on developing and assessing knowledge of microbiology, microscopy, statistics, and number sense.<br/> <br/><br/>Sensory precision is crucial during development because cells determine their fates by sensing concentrations of molecules called morphogens. Recent experiments suggest that short-range cell-cell communication may help increase the precision of morphogen profile formation and the establishment of cell fate boundaries, but the mechanisms are still unclear. The PI will develop a theory of concentration sensing with short- range communication, validate it using previous experiments in Drosophila and zebrafish embryos, and make predictions for future morphogenesis experiments. In addition the PI will build a theory of long-range communication and apply it to bacterial chemotaxis. Bacteria move toward favorable environments by sensing gradients in attractant concentrations, a process called chemotaxis. Recent experiments suggest that chemotaxis is enhanced by long-range cell-cell communication, but the enhancement mechanism is unknown. To address this question the PI will develop a theory of gradient sensing and chemotaxis with long-range communication, validate it using previous experiments on E. coli bacteria, and make predictions for future chemotaxis experiments, including those of a collaborating lab. The PI will also build a theory of self-communication and apply it to cancer metastasis. Many cancer cells spread to other parts of the body, or metastasize, by sensing lymphatic flow. Recent experiments suggest that these cells sense flow by self-communication (releasing a molecule that they also detect), but the details of this mechanism are still poorly understood and the PI will develop a theory of flow sensing via self-communication, validate it using previous experiments on breast cancer and melanoma cells, and make predictions for future cancer biology experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process is directed at the formation of specialty metal sheet and foil that is needed in applications within the aerospace, energy systems, ground transportation and biomedical sectors. Currently, the majority of metal sheet is produced by rolling processes which, despite having attractive benefits, also have important limitations pertaining to control of properties, cost, infrastructure and energy. The shear-based deformation processing approach utilizes variants of machining-based processes to create metal sheet and foil in a single step from bulk ingot, while employing a compact manufacturing systems infrastructure. The metal sheet will have superior mechanical properties, because of unique process capability to control deformation parameters. Furthermore, the machining-based processing offers important economic benefits compared to current sheet-production technology in terms of cost and energy usage. The process will be particularly suited for production of sheet from specialty alloys like titanium, magnesium and aluminum, which are of interest for high-performance and/or lightweighting applications in critical industry and defense sectors. This interdisciplinary research requires participation of manufacturing, materials engineering and systems science. The multi-disciplinary approach will also contribute to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in research, and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/><br/>To establish the capability of the machining-based processing for commercial sheet production, the university-industry team is addressing three closely related technical objectives using titanium alloys as a model material system. Firstly, process deformation fields will be analyzed using in situ high-speed imaging, complemented by force/energy analysis. Secondly, sheet metal properties will be characterized through quantitative microstructure and crystallographic texture analyses; and strength and formability measurements. New shear-based textures, combined with fine-grained microstructures, are of particular interest. Correlations will be established between deformation fields, microstructure and properties in the form of a process map. Thirdly, building on the process mapping, process scaling and systems analysis (quality, cost, energy, equipment design) will be used to produce sheet with enhanced mechanical properties and commercial quality. The envisaged outcome is new process capability for producing commercial titanium alloy sheet at less than 1/10 the cost of current state-of-the-art processing, with future extension to other advanced material systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Allowing multi-agent systems to learn will let them operate in more complex and realistic scenarios by adapting their behavior to fit specific needs. Reinforcement learning is a promising form of trial-and-error learning that has the potential to drastically improve outcomes in many multi-agent domains (e.g., warehouses, delivery), but new methods are required for coordinating the agents in realistic domains with noisy and limited communication and sensing (i.e., partial observability). This project will develop these new reinforcement learning methods for coordinating teams of agents in various partially observable settings.  The results will impact the development of future artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic systems and will be conveyed through outreach and educational activities.<br/><br/>This project will develop a number of novel methods for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under partial observability. MARL, the extension of reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent domains, has gained popularity for generating high-quality solutions in some domains, but more work is needed to make the methods more scalable and widely applicable. Therefore, this project will first provide a better theoretical understanding of centralized training for decentralized execution methods. Centralized training for decentralized execution is the dominant paradigm in MARL where agents are trained offline and only executed online. The project will then develop new centralized training methods that are unbiased, scalable and perform well in a wide range of domains.  Second, the project will develop online decentralized learning methods that allow agents to learn online even in noisy multi-agent settings. Lastly, to allow agents to learn and execute in an asynchronous manner, the project will develop methods for asynchronous MARL as well as asynchronous hierarchical learning with learning over multiple layers of a hierarchy.

The visual appearance of human skin is remarkably diverse. Anatomical variations in not just shades of lightness, but also oiliness, texture, and thickness all influence how images will appear. Such anatomical variations are linked to demographics and may explain why artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines disadvantage certain skin types (e.g., darker skin, older skin, female vs male skin). Existing efforts in mitigating bias focus on biases at higher-layers of the AI stack. In contrast, this research award studies bias from the bottom-up by probing how light interacts with skin to form images. In doing so, it is possible to not only identify, but also correct for physics-based bias in imaging. Today, physics-based bias leads to performance gaps in everyday imaging systems, such as facial identification or medical imaging. If successful, the research award can make these systems fairer. The project integrates the research with education and outreaches to middle and high school students.<br/><br/>This research award rests on three pillars. The first pillar seeks to qualitatively and mathematically identify how images vary based on skin variations. The investigative team will focus on variations in skin tone, thickness, wrinkles, and oiliness. The demographic link to these variations will also be studied in collaboration with physicians enabling computer graphics renderings to be cross-checked with real, human subject data. The second pillar aims to assess how these variations in image appearance subsequently affect downstream image processing and AI pipelines. The investigative team intends to study, for instance, how photometric stereo- a widely used technique to obtain 3D shape - can trace its source of performance bias to variations in skin. The third pillar synthesizes these insights to create novel computational imaging systems that resist bias due to skin variations. It is quite possible that in seeking to design a fair imaging system, the overall performance may be affected. In the event there is such a Pareto tradeoff between fairness and performance, the investigative team will design a flexible system that can sample multiple points on the Pareto curve. The overall choice - of which tradeoff point is optimal - lies with societal and community goals. In summary, this award hopes to set a unique foundation for analyzing bias in computational imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does a given liquid decide whether to crystallize or to form a disordered solid like window glass when it is cooled? This question remains unanswered, and is a principal focus of current materials research.  Glass-formation is closely related to the jamming transition, the solidification of a granular material, like sand or coffee beans, that occurs when it is compressed.  Although great advances in theories of the glass-jamming transition have been made over the past decade, most of these theories assume particles are spherical.  This is a potentially serious limitation because very few real-world glassy and granular materials are composed of spherical molecules or grains.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance our knowledge of the glass-jamming transition by conducting a coherent research program that focuses upon its dependence on particle asphericity.  The research will systematically relate differences in the structure of glassy and jammed systems composed of model ellipsoidal particles to differences in particle shape and sample preparation protocol. The relatively low computational cost of the ellipsoidal-particle model will be exploited to explore relevant parameter spaces far more broadly than is feasible for chemically-detailed models. Key questions to be addressed are: (1) Does the importance of particle anisotropy decrease as spatial dimension increases? and (2) To what extent do the peculiar features of ellipsoids? jamming transitions influence their glass transitions?  The planned studies are designed with the aim to contribute maximally to the long-term goal of obtaining a level of physical understanding sufficient to develop predictive design principles for granular and glassy materials with tailorable structural, mechanical, and acoustic properties. <br/><br/>This award will fund the training of one PhD student and one undergraduate student in granular and glass physics, statistical mechanics, and computer simulations.  The PI will also develop and disseminate ?EllJam?, an iPhone/iPad app that illustrates the solidification physics of 2D ellipsoids. Playing with parameters such as the particle aspect ratio and compression rate will allow the user to discover and distinguish parameter values leading to crystalline solids from those which lead to disordered solids, and hence to develop some basic intuition for which factors control the outcome of solidification.  This app is intended to capture the interest of K-12 students and young researchers. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education in the fields of solidification processes, specifically, the glass-jamming transition, statistical mechanics, and computer simulations.  While the importance of particle anisotropy in controlling macroscopic properties of glassy and jammed systems has long been recognized, it is only within the past decade that the development of cheap high-output 3D printers has allowed production of grains with a wide variety of precisely specified shapes. Advances in synthesis techniques have allowed comparable shape control for colloids as well as preparation of orientationally-ordered small-molecule glasses. Over this time, computers have become powerful enough to simulate large systems of aspherical particles over long timescales. Although great advances in theories of the glass-jamming transition have been made over the past decade, most of these theories assume particles are spherical and hence cannot capture the effects of particle anisotropy.  This is a potentially serious limitation because very few real-world glassy and granular materials are composed of spherically symmetric molecules or grains.<br/><br/>The PI will carry out studies that will systematically relate differences in the structure of glassy and jammed systems composed of ellipsoidal particles to differences in particle shape via a coherent program of coarse-grained simulations and analytic modeling.  The PI will also ?stress-test? recently developed high-dimensional theories of the glass-jamming transition by determining whether they remain at least qualitatively accurate for systems composed of aspherical particles.  Specifically, the research team will first develop a parallel molecular dynamics code for simulating hyperellipsoids.  Then it will conduct simulations and analytic work aimed at determining how coupled dimension and particle-aspect-ratio-dependent effects influence both jamming and the thermal glass transition.  Key amongst the questions to be answered by these studies are: (1) Does particle anisotropy become less important as spatial dimension increases and the tendency of particles to locally order decreases ? and if it does, how rapidly? and (2) To what extent do the peculiar features of jamming transitions in ellipsoids, more precisely jamming densities that become singular as the aspect ratio of a particle approaches unity, influence their thermal glass transitions?  Answering these questions will contribute to the soft matter theory community?s long-term goal of obtaining a level of physical understanding sufficient to develop predictive design principles for granular and glassy materials with tailorable structural, mechanical, and acoustic properties. <br/><br/>This award will fund the training of one PhD student and one undergraduate student in granular and glass physics, statistical mechanics, and computer simulations.  The PI will also develop and publicize ?EllJam?, an iPhone/iPad app that illustrates? 2D ellipsoids? jamming physics. The user will be able to choose the system size, the particle aspect ratio, and the compression rate, and then watch how ellipsoid jamming varies with these parameters. The user will also be able to choose between monodisperse systems which tend to crystallize in 2D and the 50:50 bidisperse systems typically employed in jamming studies. This app should be of interest to both K-12 students and young researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most larvae are too small to find or track in the ocean, so we know little about how long larvae can survive and how fast they grow under natural conditions. This limits our ability to understand how marine species colonize remote habitats, or how much potential there is for long-distance gene exchange that can help populations adapt to changing conditions in the sea. Because larvae are so hard to follow, their movement is often estimated indirectly from transport models of ocean currents and analyses of shared genetic variation among populations.  These approaches are rarely combined, however, and the larval component of transport models is often based on unrealistic estimates of how long larvae can stay viable. This project is simultaneously generating estimates of larval dispersal from population genomic modeling and transport models of larval movement.  The larval movement models are grounded in data from larval rearing experiments that mimic the natural food and temperature conditions that larvae experience in the North Central Pacific. The combined approach is helping explain how marine species colonize and persist in very isolated island areas and how likely they are to exchange genes across vast oceanic distances. The project is providing interdisciplinary training for three graduate students and several undergraduate research assistants. In addition, the investigators are partnering with a science outreach coordinator to engage Hawaiian high school students in field and lab work. This activity is aligning educational goals and assessments with a culture-and place-based framework for science education, N? Hopena A?o (H?), developed by the Hawaii Department of Education.<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to understand rates and patterns of long-distance connectivity between the Hawaiian archipelago and other remote island chains of the tropical north central Pacific. Specifically, the investigators are integrating empirically-derived data on larval life histories, biophysical transport models, and population genetic inferences about gene flow to understand how patterns of dispersal and connectivity in marine systems are affected by the capacity of larvae of many species to prolong development and delay metamorphosis. They are measuring planktonic larval duration under environmentally relevant conditions to test the capacity of larvae to extend development in the dispersal pathways leading to and from the Hawaiian Islands. Results from these laboratory experiments, as well as water-column data gathered over the past two decades, will be used in larval transport models that incorporate estimates of temperature, food availability, and varying life-history traits. Population genomic data gathered from the same species in the field will assess the role of gene flow in shaping genomic structure between Hawai'i and other isolated archipelagos and islands in the region, identify larval dispersal pathways to and from Hawai'i, test contrasting historical models of gene flow, and estimate rates of larval dispersal in and out of Hawai'i.  <br/> <br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biological Oceanography Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Normally, the arrangement of atoms is frozen in a crystal pattern that cannot be easily changed.

The specific materials studied are only a few atoms thick, so-called two-dimensional or ?2D? materials. 2D materials can be stacked like sheets of paper and the individual sheets can easily slide and rotate, which changes the internal crystal pattern.

These are among the most expensive of all drugs to manufacture. Identifying strategies for improving monoclonal antibody (mAb) production is the primary objective of this project. The metabolic pathways of CHO cells will be engineered to make this happen. Making these therapies more affordable and available to the public will improve the health and quality of life of millions of patients. This project will also provide the opportunity for students to engage in collaborative research with industry scientists, including internships at a Janssen R&D facility. Such an experience will prepare them for a career in the biotechnology industry or in a government or academic lab. Undergraduate and high-school students will also be recruited to work collaboratively on CHO cell engineering. <br/><br/>Dynamically balancing the metabolic requirements for efficient growth and product biosynthesis in mammalian cell cultures is a key biomanufacturing challenge. The overall objective is to engineer CHO cells that dynamically regulate their central metabolism to promote maximum yield and quality of recombinant mAbs. An industrial CHO line will be engineered to promote mitochondrial respiration during production phase by controlling expression of metabolic genes with inducible gene switches. Then, the amino acid metabolism of CHO host cells will be optimized to reduce glutamine overflow and increase energetic efficiency. Finally, IgG glycan profiles will be assessed to determine how manipulating CHO sugar and amino acid metabolism impacts product glycosylation. Metabolic flux analysis will be applied to rigorously evaluate the influence of genetic alterations on host metabolism, particularly within mitochondria and pathways that supply nucleotide-sugar precursors for mAb glycosylation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nearly one in five children experience an internalizing disorder like anxiety or depression. These disorders can hinder development well into adulthood. Yet objective and widely available assessment for these conditions remains a key unmet need. Such an assessment could enable effective diagnosis at scale while advancing the understanding of internalizing disorders, potentially informing future personalized interventions. The results of this project pave the way for improved assessment of a variety of disorders such as fall risk assessment in older adults and in individuals with neurological disorders. This project will also establish a digital mental health interest group at the University of Vermont that will bring together high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students with faculty and industry professionals. This group will engage in an annual digital mental health hackathon, hosted by UVM?s Center for Biomedical Innovation, that focuses on rural mental healthcare.<br/><br/>This NSF CAREER project advances the fields of childhood mental health, digital medicine, and the engineering of signal processing and machine learning algorithms for extracting meaning from wearable sensor signals. These advances fill key knowledge gaps, and will be made in the context of three research objectives: 1) developing and validating context-aware multi-modal digital biomarkers and using them to identify transdiagnostic latent classes, 2) developing, validating, and optimizing multi-modal, multi-domain digital phenotypes of childhood internalizing disorders, and 3) developing an open-source platform that integrates algorithms for extracting biomarkers, latent classes, and phenotypes from wearable and mobile technologies. Data to inform this project will be collected from children at elevated risk for internalizing disorders. Each child will complete a series of brief mood induction tasks during which movement, speech, electromyography, electrodermal activity, and electrocardiography data will be collected by wearables and mobile phones. These research objectives advance scientific knowledge of the biomarkers and phenotypes of childhood internalizing disorders, trans-diagnostic latent profiles in young children, and the relationship between physiological markers of these conditions and their behavioral symptoms. The first-of-its-kind platform will advance development and validation efforts in digital medicine and allow future extension to a wide array of clinical endpoints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improvements to individual components are made at varying paces, often creating bottlenecks in the flow of information - the scientific workflow - and slowing down scientific discovery. FABRIC Across Borders (FAB) enables domain scientists and CI experts to jointly develop a more tightly integrated, flexible, intelligent, easily programmable workflow that takes advantage of rapid changes in technology to improve global science collaboration. FAB enables domain scientists to perform global, end-to-end experimentation of new CI workflow ideas on a platform with one of a kind capabilities. The project expands the NSF-funded FABRIC testbed to encompass four additional, International locations, creating an interconnected resource on which an initial set of scientists from High Energy Physics (HEP), Astronomy, Cosmology, Weather, Urban Science and Computer Science work with cyberinfrastructure experts to conduct cyberinfrastructure experiments. In addition to domain scientists, FAB collaborates in the area of Internet freedom and maintains strong partnerships with human rights groups, which serve to expand the results beyond domain sciences.<br/><br/>FABRIC nodes contain programmable networking hardware, storage, CPUs and GPUs, measurement devices and software in a single, integrated rack. FAB enables placement of four additional nodes in partner data centers in Tokyo, Amsterdam, Bristol and the particle physics lab CERN in Geneva and connects them via NSF-funded International networks, on which it?s possible to conduct experiments without impacting production science. FAB offers programmable peering with production networks and specialized testbeds, allowing experimenter topologies to be joined with production networks, vastly expanding the possibilities for the types of resources and users that can utilize the infrastructure. FAB creates new software services and tools for researchers at the facilities, and interfaces with existing and evolving data delivery services to efficiently move and process scientific data globally and test novel data analysis approaches that scale to massive volumes. Metrics of success are driven by the science experiments themselves: more efficient handling of both high energy physics data from CERN experiments to worldwide collaborators and Cosmic Microwave Background data collected in South America and the South Pole; successful proofs of concept for the sharing of Smart City sensor data for urban planning as well as the establishment of global, private 5G networks.

Research has shown that negative emotional reactions can impair employees? task performance and result in counterproductive work behavior and, in severe cases, insider threat behavior. Much of this research has been guided by theories predicting causal event-emotion-behavior sequences. However, the many empirical studies in this area are either correlational rather than causal (e.g., ecological momentary assessment studies) or conducted in the laboratory rather than in situ. This research will help employees gain strategies to regulate their emotions, thereby potentially improving task performance and deterring counterproductive and insider threat behavior. Thus, the research has the potential to improve employee well-being. The research also has the potential to aid organizations in weakening the links between stressful events and insider threat behavior on the part of their employees. Finally, this research will illustrate the JITAI as a new and very different type of intervention that can fruitfully augment traditional interventions in a variety of topic areas within the organizational sciences (e.g., occupational safety interventions, sexual harassment prevention interventions, leader development interventions, and technical skills training interventions).<br/><br/><br/>The current pair of studies will manipulate emotional experience via randomly assigned Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), also known as ecological momentary interventions. Tailored interventions are needed to help individuals regulate negative emotions in the moment?when most needed and before the resulting deleterious performance outcomes manifest. As such, the JITAIs in the current research are focused on emotion regulation, thereby providing causal tests of the role of emotion on behavior as well as testing additional research questions involving situational and dispositional moderators of emotion-behavior relationships. Unlike standard interventions, these JITAIs are within-person interventions that capitalize on temporal states of vulnerability (e.g., high levels of negative emotion) and aspects of the current context (e.g., the nature of the emotion-causing episode, the feasibility of completing the intervention at that particular moment) to optimize treatment effectiveness. Specifically, in the proposed studies, participants will repeatedly be randomly (re-)assigned to different cognitively-focused emotion reappraisal interventions or to no intervention (control condition) over the course of several work weeks. The reappraisal strategies to be contrasted against each other (and against a control condition) include imagining that a negative emotional stimulus or situation had a positive outcome, altering the impact of the emotional stimulus by adopting a more-or-less objective perspective, and interpreting the focal emotion in a manner that facilitates an accepting, observing, non-judgmental relationship to emotions. The first study is a micro-randomized trial that will provide for causal inferences regarding emotion and the effects of three cognitive reappraisal JITAIs in achieving proximal (i.e., decision-point and day level) emotion and performance outcomes. The results from the first study will permit the optimization of decision rules (e.g., dropping a less effective intervention, including decision rules for which intervention should be used when based on context) to inform the second study. The second study is a randomized control trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of the JITAIs in achieving distal (i.e., end-of-study and post-study) outcomes against control conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Little is known about what types of professional development (PD) support teachers' improved practice and student learning. However, federal, state, and local governments spend resources on helping teachers improve their teaching practice and students' learning. PD programs vary in their intent and can fall on a continuum from highly adaptive, with great latitude in the implementation, to highly specified, with little ability to adapt the program during implementation. The project will study the design and development of PD that supports teacher development and student learning, and provide accumulation of evidence to inform teacher educators, administrators, teachers, and policymakers of factors associated with successful PD experiences and variation across teachers and types of PDs. The impact study will expand on the evidence of promise from four 2015 National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded projects - two adaptive, two specified - to provide evidence of the impact of the projects on teachers' instructional practice over time. Although the four projects are different in terms of structure and design elements, they all share the goal to support challenging mathematics content, practice standards, and differentiation techniques to support culturally and linguistically diverse, underrepresented populations. Understanding the nature of the professional development including structure and design elements, and unpacking what teachers take up and use in their instructional practice potentially has widespread use to support student learning in diverse contexts, especially those serving disadvantaged and underrepresented student populations. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 Program, which funds research and development on STEM innovations and approaches. <br/><br/>This study will examine teachers' uptake of mathematics content, pedagogy and materials from different types of professional development in order to understand and unpack the factors that are associated with what teachers take up and use two-three years beyond their original PD experience: Two specified 1) An Efficacy Study of the Learning and Teaching Geometry PD Materials: Examining Impact and Context-Based Adaptations (Jennifer Jacobs, Karen Koellner & Nanette Seago), 2) Visual Access to Mathematics: Professional Development for Teachers of English Learners (Mark Driscoll, Johanna Nikula, & Pamela Buffington), two adaptive: 3) Refining a Model with Tools to Develop Math PD Leaders: An Implementation Study (Hilda Borko & Janet Carlson), 4), TRUmath and Lesson Study: Supporting Fundamental and Sustainable Improvement in High School Mathematics Teaching (Suzanne Donovan, Phil Tucher, & Catherine Lewis). The project will utilize a multi-case method which centers on a common focus of what content, pedagogy and materials teachers take up from PD experiences. Using a specified sampling procedure, the project will select 8 teachers from each of the four PD projects to serve as case study teachers. Subsequently, the project will conduct a cross case analysis focusing on variation among and between teachers and different types of PD. The research questions that guide the project's impact study are: RQ1: What is the nature of what teachers take up and use after participating in professional development workshops? RQ2: What factors influence what teachers take up and use and in what ways? RQ3: How does a professional development's position on the specified-adaptive continuum affect what teachers take up and use?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lottery revenues are valuable to state and local governments.  However, critics have claimed that state-run lotteries do not serve the public good, because lottery purchasers are overly optimistic about the chance they will win. This project seeks to answer the following question: should states run lotteries such as Mega Millions and Powerball, and if so, how should such lotteries be structured?  The answer depends on a series of larger questions in behavioral economics. How much of lottery consumption is driven by entertainment and other normatively acceptable preferences versus ignorance, innumeracy, and other behavioral factors that a social planner might want to mitigate? Do lower-income people spend more on lottery tickets, and if so is does this enhance the welfare consequences of offering lotteries (because it reflects consumer surplus for people with higher marginal utility) or does this decrease the welfare consequences of offering lotteries (because it reflects exploitation of behavioral bias)? The goal of this project is to study state-run lotteries by building on recent advances in behavioral public economics. The first step is to collect new empirical data and analyses that identify a set of statistics that determine optimal lottery policy. The second step is to use the empirical parameters to simulate the welfare effects of lotteries and different design choices. This will provide the first benefit-cost analysis of state-run lotteries that theoretically and quantitatively considers the alleged behavioral biases at the heart of the policy discussion.<br/><br/>This project studies optimal lottery policy through the lens of optimal taxation, where lotteries are a taxed good whose consumers may be subject to behavioral biases. The project starts with a derivation of new sufficient statistics formulas for optimal pricing and attributes of a government-provided good. The key parameters of the welfare formulas will be estimated using lottery prizes and sales data and a large new nationally representative survey. The prize and sales data allow estimation of how lottery demand varies with ticket prices, jackpot amounts and smaller prizes. The new survey will generate a nationally representative dataset of how lottery expenditures vary with income, and how they vary with measures of innumeracy and poor statistical reasoning. These empirical moments permit estimation of a structural model of lottery demand, which will be used to examine the welfare consequences of eliminating or restructuring state-run lotteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This presents a unique opportunity in the parallel computing community to remove the human and associated guesswork in the performance engineering loop, and instead, use data-driven ML models for performance modeling, forecasting and tuning. Analytics of data about software performance and operational efficiency of the parallel systems can be used to identify performance anomalies and their root causes. This can transform the process of optimizing the performance of parallel software and operational efficiency of parallel systems. By using data-driven statistical modeling based on machine learning, the impact of human errors in the process can be minimized, and parallel software and systems can become truly self-tuning. This work is leveraging and contributing to the growing body of work on ML for Systems, and brings its benefits to extreme-scale parallel software and systems. The project is also engaging high school students, training undergraduate and graduate students in parallel computing and preparing them for a career in HPC to address a significant shortage of computer and computational scientists in HPC, both in the industry and national laboratories. <br/><br/>The project is applying statistical and ML algorithms to analyze performance data, and using the trained models and insights to enable the self-tuning of performance of parallel software and systems. This work is developing a holistic methodology for accomplishing the following tasks: (1) analyze large volumes of software and system data collected over time, (2) apply machine learning to model application and system behavior, and (3) use these models to guide application, runtime and system optimization decisions that impact future executions. This holistic approach of data-driven self-tuning can significantly improve the performance and portability of parallel software, and operational efficiency of HPC and data center systems even as codes and systems evolve. Better performance of individual jobs leads to faster science results and increased job throughput. This work is making advances in three key areas. First, development of ML-based mechanisms to model the performance of parallel software and use of such models to automatically optimize their performance by selecting high-performance configurations. Second, the development of automated methods to analyze large-scale longitudinal monitoring data for analysis of parallel systems, and develop mechanisms to use trained ML models to automatically tune the operation of parallel systems. And finally, the first two thrusts can be used to automatically tune the performance of parallel codes as they are ported to new or future architectures by using techniques such as transfer learning. This project is leading to the development of a suite of techniques and frameworks to analyze performance-related data being gathered at different levels (job, system and facility) and to make decisions for optimizing various operational efficiency related metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the loss of one species may trigger additional, and potentially unexpected, losses of species, because species depend on each other for food or habitat. For example, the loss of a prey species might result in predator declines and the loss of important functions and services that the predator provides (e.g., food production). In the Gulf of Maine, rapid warming and overexploitation are thought to have contributed to the near local extinction of the intertidal blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), an important prey species whose loss could have cascading consequences for this ecosystem. The project explores the consequence of blue mussel declines to the food web and to the ecosystem (e.g., through water filtration that improves water quality, and secondary production that supports food for people). The investigators are using theoretical models of species loss from food webs in combination with long-term ecological data and field experiments to investigate the effects of local species extinctions on ecosystem function. This combined approach is generating and testing theoretical predictions of species loss on ecosystem biodiversity and food web structure. Insights from this project are contributing to a better understanding of dynamics of coastal ecosystems worldwide that face similar losses of prey species. The project is fostering a new collaboration between a small liberal arts college (Colby College) and a research-intensive university (University of Colorado Boulder), creating unique training, mentoring, and educational exchange opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. This project is training a PhD student, a postdoctoral scholar, and undergraduate students, with a focus on engaging underrepresented groups and enhancing computational training for marine ecologists. This project is supporting the development of web-based teaching modules on complex ecological systems in combination with outreach and education efforts in Maine's coastal communities and in Colorado?s inland rural and urban communities. <br/><br/>Worldwide changes in local biodiversity are altering the functioning of ecosystems and the ecosystem services on which humans depend. Predicting the consequences of such changes in biodiversity to coastal ecosystem function and structure is complicated by the multiplicity of species interactions that characterize complex food webs. Food web theory predicts that the loss of species like the blue mussel has cascading impacts on the community through secondary losses of consumers that depend on resource species. However, such predictions of food web collapse (termed ""robustness"") have rarely been empirically tested. Furthermore, previous studies have rarely considered how secondary losses of species might alter coastal ecosystem function. For example, the loss of the abundant filter-feeding M. edulis is likely to affect water filtration, however, M. edulis? role as a key prey species could impact other ecosystem functions performed by species that consume M. edulis (e.g., secondary production). Thus, to estimate and predict the consequences of local extinctions on coastal ecosystem functioning, requires a research approach that moves beyond a focus on single species, and considers both direct and secondary species losses. This project is integrating food web modeling, field observations, data synthesis, and experimental species removals to quantify the impact of recent species losses on the structure and stability of the Gulf of Maine rocky intertidal food web. Historical and existing species interaction data and field observations are being synthesized to generate a detailed food web with ecosystem functions for the Gulf of Maine rocky intertidal. This food web model is used to predict the cascading impacts of species loss in this community, with particular attention to the impact on key ecosystem functions measured in situ. Finally, the predictions are tested in a multi-year factorial species removal experiment that quantifies how the diversity, structure, and function of the food web is affected by targeted species removal. This novel approach is providing much-needed empirical ground truthing to predictions of food web ecology. It is among the first of such experimental tests in marine systems. This research has the potential to transform the understanding of how marine ecosystem structure and function are altered by species losses, and the predictability of food web changes through empirical testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While single-cell sequencing technologies have provided a new frontier for researchers, they also come with a complex set of problems. One of these problems is related to the quality of gene expression estimates, which are used in numerous downstream analyses from the prediction of the cell types/trajectories to determining differentially expressed genes between cell types or tissues. The low coverage and sequencing inefficiencies can affect up to 90% of gene expression estimates for scRNA-Seq studies, and hence, are challenging to overcome. However, there are two critical problems in the way that current methods attempt to address this problem: (1) inadequate use of bulk data to compensate for low expression genes and (2) under-utilization of iterative procedures to optimize highly-connected steps for imputation of gene expression estimates.<br/><br/>This project will develop a novel computational framework to integrate bulk RNA-seq data into scRNA-seq data modeling and analyses, aiming at accurate gene expression estimates from the sparse scRNA-Seq data, and high quality, reliability, and precision of downstream analyses. The aim is to model particular features of the heterogeneous gene expression patterns among various cell types. Integration of bulk RNA-Seq data through de-convolution will be used to develop heterogeneous compensation distributions and probabilities. Utilization of the gamma distribution to determine empirical distribution for single-cell gene expression estimates will improve the baseline expression in a specific cell type and identify estimates of interest through the high level of noise in sequencing data, which will then be combined with compensation information from bulk RNA-Seq data to correct biases from the high noise scRNA-Seq data. Finally, the updated expression estimate will be used to iterate back through the process to provide improved results for each stage of the process.  The outcome will be a novel imputation framework that should enable scRNA-Seq expression estimates through the integration of the above three new characteristics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These limits dictate what can be expected from the algorithms that are coded, and justify beliefs in the security of cryptography.  The use of algebraic techniques (multiplication, derivatives, and beyond) is pervasive in the design of efficient computation.  These techniques apply to problems inherently of an algebraic nature, as well for tasks that seemingly lack algebraic structure.  This project seeks to understand the power of these techniques through two different lenses.  The first aims to show how to efficiently eliminate the use of randomness in algebraic algorithms.  The second aims to leverage the deep mathematical structure of algebraic algorithms to define limits on their computational power.  These two aims are connected through attention to common techniques and models of algebraic computation.  The project will promote study of algebraic computation in general through course design, organization of workshops, and training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In particular, this project seeks to design deterministic algorithms for deciding whether a given algebraic expression simplifies to a trivial expression, a problem known as polynomial identity testing (PIT).  While efficient randomized algorithms for PIT have been known for decades, developing deterministic algorithms has proven challenging.  The project identifies classes of PIT problems which are both of fundamental importance and that are ripe for further progress.  Deterministically solving these PIT problems would settle key challenges in the area, and also lead to new algorithms in areas outside algebraic computation.  Developing such deterministic PIT algorithms is known in general to be equivalent to establishing limits on efficient algebraic computation, and as such this project seeks to establish such limits through the geometric complexity theory (GCT) program.  This program has seen significant overall interest from the research community, but has seen fewer than desired results due to the high barriers to entry arising from steep mathematical prerequisites.  The project offers a set of problems within this program that both are of fundamental importance, but also are concretely solvable.  The selection of these problems is informed by corresponding progress made in developing deterministic PIT algorithms, and as such the two parts of the project will develop in tandem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When viewed under coherent imaging conditions such as laser illumination, these materials create ""noisy"" images containing small spurious spots of color known as speckle, which severely degrade image quality. Despite their seemingly random nature, speckle images have strong statistical properties that are highly informative of the material producing them, and can be used to enable remarkable imaging capabilities (for example, being able to see through or focus inside a material). However, realizing these capabilities in practical application settings where scattering is important (tissue imaging, fluorescence microscopy, remote sensing, material fabrication) remains a challenge due to our incomplete understanding of speckle statistical properties. This project will use techniques from computer vision and computer graphics to greatly enhance our understanding of these properties, and significantly expand the scope of possible applications, thereby having transformative impact in areas such as medicine and material science. The project will additionally create a new point of convergence between vision, graphics, optics, and imaging, establishing new research directions and methodological approaches within and across these areas.<br/><br/>Achieving the project's goals will require developing a better understanding of the limitations inherent in speckle statistics, and using this knowledge to invent better imaging algorithms. To date, efforts towards this direction have been hindered by difficulties in simulating speckle effects stemming from the complexity of the wave-optics and multiple-scattering phenomena underlying them.  This project will change this state of affairs through three tightly coupled research thrusts: 1) Simulation The project will first develop Monte Carlo rendering algorithms that efficiently simulate physically accurate speckle images and different types of statistics (spatial, temporal, spectral). These tools will be used to perform a thorough qualitative and quantitative investigation of the statistical properties of speckle images, with emphasis on application-relevant settings. Phenomenological discoveries will be backed by theoretical analysis of the underlying physics. 2) The project will develop new algorithms for speckle-based imaging through scattering, using the insights from the exploration of speckle statistics. These algorithms will be designed to specifically exploit additional statistical structure in speckle images that currently remains untapped. The improved performance of the developed algorithms will be demonstrated through experiments on tissue phantoms and under conditions emphasizing fluorescence imaging applications. 3)The project will develop computational imaging systems that use the rich information available in speckle images to characterize the optical scattering properties of material samples (for instance, for material quality control). The use of speckle measurements will endow these systems with a combination of accuracy, efficiency, and generality that is not available in existing scattering acquisition technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The costs of wildfires are magnified when they spread into communities; commonly referred to as wildland-urban interfaces (WUI). In wildfires, fragments of burning materials, known as firebrands (or flying embers) can be generated, lofted, and carried by the wind several meters to kilometers ahead of the main fire-front and create several new spot fires. Post-fire studies indicated that firebrands are responsible for the fastest spread and the major cause of the ignitions in WUIs. From the moment an ember becomes airborne, a firebrand?s trajectory, and thus its landing spot, depends on characteristics of the turbulent wind flow. While the structure of the turbulent winds is determined by mechanical and buoyant forces, there is currently no clear fundamental understanding of how these factors affect the spotting risks. In addition, it is not clear what role the small eddies of the turbulent flow play in determining firebrand behavior because their effects are neglected in the majority of physics-based studies. The principle aim of this project is to advance fluid-dynamic understanding of the firebrand transport phenomenon in turbulent winds, increase the general public?s scientific literacy about fire safety, and motivate a wide spectrum of students to engage in this emerging field. This research will advance the prediction and mitigation of fire spread into wildfire-prone areas and elevate the importance of fire science in the national landscape.<br/><br/>The research will use Large-Eddy Simulations, Lagrangian particle tracking of the embers, and surface energy balance analyses to systematically investigate the effect of the turbulent scale interactions on firebrand transport and spotting risk for the advancement of fire science. The project will, for the first time, a) develop and validate a versatile multiscale computational model of firebrand transport that incorporates the important effects of small scale turbulence (i.e., the order of the size of the embers) on evolving firebrands; b) investigate the effect of thermally-driven turbulent winds due to heterogeneous spatiotemporally variable buoyant forces on firebrand transport, and c) explore the effect of mechanically-driven turbulence structures due to surface topography on firebrand transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Patients with PKU are unable to catabolize phenylalanine and therefore have elevated, toxic levels. These patients are treated with a severely protein-restricted diet and other potential medications. Since excess phenylalanine results in neurologic injury, and inadequate phenylalanine results in protein malnutrition, the diet of patients must be carefully balanced. This balance can only be accomplished by tracking blood phenylalanine levels, which fluctuate throughout the day. Currently the turnaround time of laboratory tests is 5 to 7 days, and sometimes longer, during which patients may experience prolonged episodes of behavioral and neurocognitive morbidities. PKU is a lifelong genetic disorder and requires constant tuning of diet therapy. The annual societal cost for taking care of patients with PKU can range from $15,000 to $200,000; this disease causes irreversible damage and high costs of care when improperly managed.

To reduce the environmental burden of buildings in design and construction decisions, this project seeks to understand the interdependencies of EE and OE components, their relationship to water use and carbon emission, and the current and future impacts of the energy-carbon-water (ECW) nexus. Three research objectives will be pursued: (1) quantify EE-OE interdependencies by measuring an EE factor that represents the EE expense of saving one unit of OE; (2) examine energy-focused design decisions from an ECW perspective; and (3) investigate how fast-changing energy mix and use may influence future EE-OE interdependencies. The key educational goal is to enhance science education of environmentally sustainable buildings by embedding energy modeling and innovative Virtual Reality (VR)-based learning activities into existing curricula and research training. The educational objectives are: (1) stimulate a diagnostic-prognostic-based sustainable built environment education at the university level; (2) enhance the science education of environmental sustainability at the high school level; and (3) extend tools and resources to architects, engineers, and home builders for broader societal benefits. The research plan offers knowledge and resources to be used by students, who, in turn, create data models to help accomplish the research goal.<br/><br/>This study combines building information and energy models from engineering with earth science and economic models to close three knowledge gaps. First, the interdependencies of EE and OE components are not fully understood. This research aim to answer: (1) how do different EE and OE components function and influence each other? and (2) which design measures or EE/OE components may be the main driver of environmental change? Second, it is unclear how design decisions based on EE and OE would differ if energy-related carbon emission and water use are considered. This project will explore how the interplay of a complex ECW system may influence design decisions and which system may be the most impactful. Third, the forces of climate change and automation are shifting building energy use towards electricity. How such a shift may influence future ECW interactions is unclear. This study will explore how the forces of climate variability and automation may alter future states of energy use and environmental change and how such changes may affect the complex ECW system in the future. Through a more diagnostic- prognostic modeling of a building?s environmental impacts, this study seeks to close these gaps and create resources to help architects, engineers, and policy makers make scientifically-informed decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this research will advance understanding of the ways that financial stress affects decision-making and resilience of drinking water systems (DWS), produce actionable knowledge that will improve equity and resilience of DWS, generate a new, publicly accessible database, and educate and train students and water professionals about the intersection of fiscal stress, risk and resilience, and equity in municipal decision making. <br/><br/>This research advances empirical and theoretical understanding of the relationship between financial stress, fiscal behavior, and resilience using a novel mixed methods approach. This research also advances practical understanding of how financial stress affects decision making and resilience in municipal DWS and generates a novel, integrative, publicly accessible database of municipal government spending and revenue, political and institutional context, drinking water system conditions, and demographics. Results from this research will provide scholars with new theoretical insights for understanding the relationship between fiscal stress, behavior, and resilience and its implications for equity in public services, and provide actionable insights to support effective interventions to improve equitable resilience now and in the future.

Hurricanes change forest structure and can increase carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Severe hurricanes favor light-loving tree species that are particularly vulnerable to wind damage, making forests more vulnerable to subsequent hurricanes. More severe hurricanes may also lead to the development of shorter forests dominated by wind-resistant species. In the short term, tree damage from severe hurricanes will reduce forest carbon storage and through accelerated decomposition, much of the carbon in dead biomass will return to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. However, the long-term effects of more severe hurricanes on carbon dynamics are not well understood and depend on the severity of the hurricane and post-disturbance tree establishment, growth, and death. The research will use data collected after Hurricane Mara in Puerto Rico to improve understanding of these long-term effects. Society will benefit from the development of modeling schemes that can be used to predict forest resilience to climate change. Results will be shared with scientists and managers working in the U.S Forest Service and 28 young scientists will gain valuable experience in ecological research.<br/><br/>The proposed research studies the unique situation caused by the passage of Hurricane Mara over Puerto Rico in 2017 to gain important, new knowledge about the effects of extreme wind on forests and to develop a realistic approach to representing forest responses to wind damage in earth system models. Mara was the strongest hurricane to make direct landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928 and may reflect changes in North Atlantic hurricanes. This project completes the seventh 5-year census of the 16 hectare Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot to characterize post-disturbance tree recruitment, growth, and delayed mortality. The project combines data on tree damage and forest recovery after Hurricane Mara and two weaker storms, hurricanes Hugo (1989) and Georges (1998), with aerial laser-derived representation of tree biomechanical properties. This information will be used to characterize the relationship between canopy structure of tree species and their response to a range of hurricane severities. The data will then be used in the Ecosystem Demography model, allowing assessment of the impacts of various climate change scenarios on forest and carbon dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to develop a context- and user-aware security framework that enables (G1) contextual integrity by notifying users only when sensitive data is used in the ways that cannot be justified by  the  contexts  and  the  apps?  intentions,  and (G2) user  awareness  by  generating  natural-language  (NL) descriptions that explain the sensitive data uses.  <br/><br/>The research will have four major tasks. First, the research team  will develop a context- and intention-aware model that represents the  correlation  between  the  contexts/intentions and the sensitive behaviors in  the code, where the contexts and intentions are expressed mainly by unstructured  information (i.e., images and text) in the Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Second, the team will develop novel program-analysis techniques that associate the contexts and the intentions in GUIs to the sensitive behaviors in the code, which enables the construction of a large-scale high-quality training data. Third, the team will develop a neural machine-translation model that takes as input the contextual information provided by GUI contexts and the vocabulary provided by privacy policies, and synthesizes descriptions for sensitive behaviors in the code. Finally, the team will develop a lightweight instrumentation system that integrates the results of the detected undesired behaviors and the synthesized descriptions. The success of this project will enhance the security of society at large by leading to more secure mobile apps, and the proposed techniques will provide new insights for the cooperation of program analysis and machine learning.

Prominent examples include computational redistricting and the increased use of statistical analysis in polling and forecasts. This project will historicize the role of computers, as well as algorithmic thinking and mathematical rationales, in the constitution of American representative democracy in the twentieth century. Even before digital computers and automated decision making became prevalent, controversies about mathematical definitions of ?fairness,? ?bias,? and ?discrimination? abounded in American life, and nowhere were these ideas debated more forcefully than in the realm of democratic decision making. Focusing on congressional apportionment, the census, proportional voting, congressional redistricting, polling, and forecasts, this project investigates how changing computational practices, from statistical modeling to computational geometry, have insinuated themselves into the most basic definitions of ?fairness? in the American electorate in the twentieth century. <br/><br/>Applying theoretical insights from Science and Technology Studies, this project will integrate archival research and oral histories in order to investigate the extent to which ideas about what constitutes ?bias,? ?fairness,? and ?discrimination? are determined by mathematical and computational metrics as well as by legal, legislative, and social ones. This research will therefore elucidate how technical and social definitions of fairness are entangled in computational and mathematical ways of thinking. Furthermore, it will reckon with the public understanding of science and, in particular, the public understanding of mathematics and statistics. Finally, it will extend the study of how scientific expertise is received and adjudicated when the expert?s skill is a method (e.g., statistics), rather than a subject matter (e.g., climate change, DNA fingerprinting). The project will increase public engagement with science and technology by unpacking and clearly outlining the ways in which mathematical and computational claims to knowledge have at times obscured political and social agendas. One of the primary goals of the project is to understand how mathematical claims to truth are adjudicated not only in the courts, but also by the general public. Some of the debates that will be examined, like the one regarding census adjustment, are highly technical in nature. Examining the successful (as well as unsuccessful) strategies that U.S. journalists and the public have developed to communicate and disseminate these complex issues is crucial to contemporary society, when so many aspects of daily life are governed by technically intricate, if not entirely opaque, computational systems. As data analytics become increasingly foundational to how Americans engage with the most basic constitution of democracy, it is of the utmost importance to publicly disseminate information and toolkits to help citizens evaluate such claims and their assumptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by supporting the persistence and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with financial need at Georgia College and State University. Over its five-year duration, the project will provide scholarships to eighteen full-time students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in chemistry and/or physics. The Scholars will enter in two annual cohorts and receive up to four years of scholarship support. The project seeks to increase student persistence by linking scholarships with effective supporting activities, including tutoring, team advising, mentoring, undergraduate research experiences, service learning, graduate school preparation, internships, and community building. The project will also support curriculum improvements designed to increase second-year student retention.  Through project evaluation and research, new knowledge will be generated about factors that influence educational access, persistence, and academic and post-graduation success of STEM undergraduates, including those from populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Academic and social support activities, such as summer bridge, undergraduate research, first-year seminar, and mentoring, can increase student persistence and success in STEM. However, limited data exist about the impact of such activities on low-income STEM majors who gain increased access to them by receiving additional financial support.  Specifically, little is known how these support activities affect STEM undergraduates' engagement, self-efficacy, persistence, and post-graduation placement. To help fill this gap, the project will investigate the effects of early community-building activities in a low-stakes social environment on Scholars? persistence, engagement, and sense of belonging. It will also study the impact of a second-year research methods and scientific communication seminar on Scholars? self-efficacy and interest in undergraduate research. To better understand the career pathways and goals of academically talented, low-income students in STEM, the project aims to determine the impact that participation in summer internships and undergraduate research has on post-graduation job and graduate school placement. The project evaluator will use a mixed-methods approach to examine project implementation (outputs), the project's impact on participants (outcomes), and strategic impacts and sustainability of the project.

However, as the size of the graph continues to grow, learning, mining and computing such gigantic graphs become ineffective, impractical, and potentially dire. Fortunately, Graph Sampling and Random Walk can dramatically reduce the size of the original graphs, while still capturing the desired properties for downstream graph analytics tasks. But a comprehensive system that can perform graph sampling and random walk on real-world trillion-edge graphs at an acceptable speed is absent. This research pioneers the effort of uniting various graph sampling and random walk algorithms behind a user-friendly framework that can take advantage of world-class Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing facilities, including the future exascale ones, to rapidly handle trillion-edge graphs. This project contributes to the U.S. national goal of increasing participation in science and engineering, which is crucial to America?s success in addressing global challenges, building a stronger and more diversified workforce, and meeting the needs of the global innovation economy. This project produces a high-performance software library that serves as a foundational tool for fellow science and engineering practitioners from academia, national laboratories and industry.

However, high failure rates, large volume and weight, and the high cost of power converters can often restrict the grid penetration of these energy sources. Wide-bandgap semiconductor devices, including those made of silicon carbide, are a promising solution for improving power converters, but their merits cannot be fully realized with current converter topologies. The goal of this CAREER plan is to create high power density and ultra-reliable converters by combining wide-bandgap devices with new universal converter topologies that have an ability to eliminate less reliable components commonly used in power converters, such as electrolytic capacitors, as well as bulky components like low frequency  transformers. These improvements will contribute to the long-term research goal of the PI, which is to realize ultra-high-performance sustainable energy systems. The PI?s long-term educational goals are to train the next generation of engineers who are aware of the major challenges in the power electronics field and well-prepared for addressing the future energy needs of the United States. There is an obvious need for a more varied workforce in the energy fields. This project will create an opportunity for several graduate and undergraduate students to learn about wide-bandgap-based power converters and their applications in sustainable energy systems. The proposed research is relevant to a wide range of applications, but, for the scope of this work, the PI and her team will focus on microgrid applications. <br/><br/>Silicon carbide devices offer significant advantages at the device level, including dramatically higher switching frequency. Despite significant device-level advantages, simply substituting silicon carbide semiconductors for their silicon counterparts will not result in significant improvements to a converter. For instance, in power converters that involve transferring the power from a source to a load with unequal instantaneous values of power,  such as single-phase inverters, the size of passive components is not reduced by increasing the switching frequency and use of silicon carbide devices. These converters typically employ large electrolytic capacitors, which have high failure rates. A primary component of this proposal is that it includes a total elimination of low reliability electrolytic capacitors as well as low frequency transformers in all power converters. This will be achieved by creating novel, single-stage multi-port silicon carbide-based converter topologies that accomplish power conversion between any type of source and load, including dc, single-phase ac or multi-phase ac, in one stage, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded converters and decoupling capacitors. These topologies are inspired by isolated dc-dc converters, which can use high frequency transformers instead of low frequency transformers and will be complemented with the use of soft-switching techniques. The input side and output side switches cannot be controlled independently in these converters. The main challenge is the complex control of these converters, especially when the link current/voltage ripple values are large. Therefore, conventional modulation techniques cannot be used. In this project modified modulation techniques will be developed for these converters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individuals from marginalized groups often feel unwelcome and unrepresented in STEM.  Students who encounter such feelings are less likely to persist in STEM majors than their peers.  Instructors with a marginalized identity can positively impact students who share the same identity.  However, it is unclear to what extent marginalized students know or know of instructors who share their identity, and whether this knowledge affects students? college experiences.  This project intends to assess impacts on students when biology instructors? share their LGBTQ+ identities, including impacts on LGBTQ+ students? sense of belonging in biology classrooms and college STEM communities.  This knowledge may help to identify strategies that improve undergraduate students? sense of belonging and capability in STEM, thus supporting greater success of students from diverse marginalized groups. <br/><br/>Marginalized stigmatized identities that carry negative stereotypes can be invisible because a person who carries these identifies must choose to reveal them.  Currently, it is unclear how an instructor?s sharing of an invisible stigmatized identity may impact students both who do and do not share that identity.  The project team has a strong record of leading successful projects that address issues of diversity and identity in STEM education.  In this project, the researchers will use in-depth interviews and a national survey to examine the extent to which instructors share their LGBTQ+ identities with their students.  The project has already recruited a substantial number of volunteers to participate in the interviews.  Using the framework of invisible stigmatized identities, the project team hopes to identify factors that influence an instructor?s decision to share a marginalized identity with their students.  Additionally, through a quasi-experimental study, the project intends to explore the impacts when instructors briefly mention their LGBTQ+ identity.

Decisions made under conditions of fiscal stress may erode and undermine the resilience of these critical city services by impeding the ability of water managers to respond to today?s challenges and plan for an uncertain future, while maintaining affordable and equitable service delivery. Financial stress therefore presents a significant risk to the resilience of the services upon which millions of people depend. Despite these risks, the effects of financial stress on decision making by city governments and the influence of local political, institutional, and physical contexts on decision making is poorly understood. This award supports fundamental research that addresses this fundamental gap in knowledge. Specifically, this research advances understanding of the ways that financial stress affects decision making and resilience of drinking water systems, produces actionable knowledge that improves equity and resilience of drinking water systems, generates a new, publicly accessible database, and educates and trains students and water professionals about the intersection of fiscal stress, risk and resilience, and equity in municipal decision making. <br/><br/>This research advances empirical and theoretical understanding of the relationship between financial stress, fiscal behavior, and resilience using a novel mixed methods approach.

Single cells have a biological clock, but their synchronized timekeeping is usually only observed at the level of tens of millions of cells. A grand challenge is understanding how cellular clocks in organisms, tissues, and cells become synchronized to keep time.   Using a model fungal system, Neurospora crassa, investigators consider two principal theories on the emergence of clock synchronization:  (1) through a shared biochemical signal between cellular clocks; (2) through the random switching of clock genes within a cell.  In examining these two scientific theories, investigators explore the origin of the biological clock from a single cell perspective, which remains an open challenge since the Nobel Prize winning discoveries of Hall, Young, and Rosbash linking genes to circadian rhythms.  As part of the Broader Impact activities investigators develop new projects in the area of biological clock research for two REU site programs in Genomics and Computational Biology and Nanotechnology and Biomedicine, which actively recruits students from Clark Atlanta University.  The team will also organize and contribute to the Gordon Conference on Collective Behavior (GRC).<br/><br/><br/>In order to understand the synchronization of clocks between cells, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including:  (1) lack of working stochastic network models to describe populations of cellular clocks; (2) lack of a direct test for interrogating the biochemical signals as quorum sensing based synchronization mechanisms; (3) lack of knowledge on what signal(s) synchronize(s) cellular clocks; (4) lack of evidence to determine whether or not stochastic switching in clock genes plays a role in synchronization ? the stochastic resonance (coherence) hypotheses; (5) lack of understanding how the clock functions at the predominant life stage of fungi, the filament. The goal of this work is to understand the synchronization of biological clocks between cells and filaments in N. crassa by two mechanisms, quorum sensing vs. Stochastic Resonance (Coherence). The interdisciplinary team will investigate mechanisms of collective behavior using:  novel microfluidics platforms to measure phase synchronization of biological clocks on a controlled number of living N. crassa cells, methods from Statistical Physics to test quorum sensing versus Stochastic Resonance theoretical frameworks, and a newly developed Continuous in vivo metabolism-NMR (CIVM-NMR) method to identify and characterize signaling molecules that may be responsible for clock synchronization. The research-driven Broader Impact activities include:  (1) Development of interdisciplinary research-centered course, Clock Collaboratorium; (2) Development of undergraduate research projects focused on the central theme of the biological clock, which will be deployed in two NSF REU site programs; and (3) Organization of a collective behavior community that will engage through a new Gordon Research Conference in Newport, RI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether between microbes or mammals, ecological relationships depend on features that enable organisms to interact across species boundaries. A major goal of modern biology is to identify these traits, understand how they function, and infer how they evolved at the genetic level. An outstanding challenge in the study of biological interactions is explaining how animals evolve relationships with other species via changes in the brain, behavior and communication. This proposal addresses this challenge by examining a symbiosis between two animals?an ant species, and a rove beetle that lives as a social impostor inside the ant?s colony. By studying the beetle?s nervous system and chemical glands, mechanisms will be uncovered that enable the beetle to accurately detect and chemically manipulate its ant partner, consequently integrating into colony life. Comparisons with related beetle species that live independently of ants will reveal how the symbiotic beetle?s behavior and chemical communication systems evolved. This work will illuminate how different animal species recognize and interact with each other, informing our understanding of how brains process sensory information about other organisms and generate social behavior. This research could advance agricultural control strategies by discovering novel compounds that disrupt pest species biology. It may also aid in countering invasive species. This program also provides undergraduate research experience that is trans-disciplinary, preparing the next generation of scientists to participate in the bioeconomy. <br/><br/>Complex interspecies relationships pervade the Metazoa, but knowledge of the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these lifestyles is scarce. Animal symbioses are often hard to reconstitute in the laboratory, whereas classical models such as Drosophila and mice exhibit negligible interactions with other species. Rove beetles (Staphylinidae) comprise a remarkable clade in which numerous lineages have convergently evolved into 'myrmecophiles': behavioral symbionts of ant colonies. Evolution of this way of life involves radical changes in behavior and chemical communication, allowing rove beetles to hijack ant chemical cues and assimilate into the social fabric of the nest. This proposal will break open the molecular architecture of animal symbiosis by pioneering the myrmecophile rove beetle Sceptobius as a model. This goal will be achieved by: 1) Uncovering adaptive chemosensory and neuroanatomical changes enabling Sceptobius to recognize and socially interact with its host ant; 2) Revealing cellular and molecular mechanisms permitting Sceptobius to chemically mimic and behaviorally manipulate ants; and 3) Leveraging population genomic variation in this ant-myrmecophile system to illuminate coevolutionary dynamics of symbiotic animals and their hosts. Development of a behaviorally symbiotic model insect will impact understanding of species interactions across the spectrum of biological complexity. This proposal has ramifications for the fields of neuroscience, behavior and chemical ecology, and will enhance our knowledge of genomic, cellular and developmental evolutionary processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although a great deal has been learned about how these individual systems work, how these critical functions interact remains poorly understood. This interaction is especially important in speech communication, which is of remarkable significance in humans. In order to use speech successfully, both to communicate with others and to monitor oneself speaking, the auditory speech perception circuit and the motor speech production system must precisely align in time. This temporal coordination is important for planning to speak, monitoring one?s errors, learning language sounds, and learning new words from a conversation. In this research program, the investigators study this alignment through auditory-motor synchronization. They use behavioral, neuroscience, and computational approaches to characterize auditory-motor synchronization and test the consequences of this synchronization for real-life behaviors such as word learning.     <br/><br/>An important feature of recent work that motivates this research is the discovery of a simple behavioral paradigm, the ?spontaneous speech synchronization test? (SSS test). The test measures how precisely listeners synchronize their own spoken output to speech that they hear. The procedure is remarkably sensitive to individual differences, revealing that not all listeners synchronize equally well. Notably, the synchronization scores from the SSS test not only correlate highly with brain anatomy and physiology but are also predictive of listeners? performance in important real-life challenges, such as word-learning. The new research builds on the novelty, sensitivity, and broad utility of the SSS test. The research plan is organized into four aims. First, the investigators will optimize the test for broad use by other scientists. Second, they will perform new experiments that test how auditory-motor synchronization, i.e., the rhythmic alignment between speech perception and speech production systems, guides speech perception. Third, they will develop a computational model constructed to provide a mechanistic description as well as to generate further testable predictions of auditory-motor synchronization. Fourth, the team will explore the consequences of synchronization for the essential capacity of word learning. An overarching practical, final goal is to release the SSS test in an open access format. Because the test outcome correlates with word learning, specific patterns of neural connectivity, and other cognitive features, it can be a useful, quick, easy-to-implement assay for researchers, educators, and clinicians.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental scientific contribution of this research is to understand how plants rapidly and efficiently coordinate and control this defense response at the molecular level. This project develops and implements novel experimental tools to characterize and investigate the processes that regulate the production of terpenoid indole alkaloids in the plant Catharanthus roseus.

The Achilles heel of QIP has been dissipation, the friction that both generates heat and destroys the long-lived quantum correlations among quantum bits (""qubits"") necessary for QIP, so far limiting quantum information systems in both size and complexity.  Such correlations among qubits are called ""entanglement,"" and a goal of this research is to produce any desired entangled state of qubits, which becomes the starting point for a quantum computation.<br/><br/>A powerful approach to address this general problem is quantum reservoir engineering: the idea is to turn the tables on dissipation and use it as a resource for steering a quantum system, such that the dissipation-driven dynamics naturally relax the system to the state of interest.  This CAREER project supports basic research into developing a novel reservoir engineering framework and leverages it for entanglement generation in noisy quantum systems.  From a practical standpoint, this will help identify critical milestones for establishing reservoir engineering as a standard paradigm for scalable and robust entanglement generation, which has applications in all areas of quantum information science, including quantum computing, sensing and communication.  In addition, the proposed research will enable fundamental advances in the physics of quantum systems coupled to a noisy environment by developing theoretical tools to rigorously explore the validity of standard dissipative models in the presence of noise that varies, and is correlated, in time.<br/><br/>The education and training aspect in this project will assume a multi-pronged approach that will expose graduate and undergraduate students to a wide variety of analytical and computational techniques in quantum information and quantum optics.  Aided and informed by close connections with experimental realizations of solid-state qubits, the aim will be to provide the trainees a holistic view of the polyglot field of QIP and address the strategic national need to create a ""quantum-smart"" workforce.  The training aspect will be integrated with broad educational and outreach goals via new and continuing curriculum and course development initiatives, public talks, and promoting open access venues for communicating research results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Quantum reservoir engineering is an attractive approach for correcting errors and realizing stable quantum coherences autonomously.  The basic idea is to tailor the dissipative environment of the target systems so that this engineered dissipation relaxes the system to and sustains it in a desired target state.  While versatile, existing schemes for dissipative state preparation rely exclusively on time-independent dissipative dynamics, which can leave the protocols susceptible to unwanted spurious dissipation.  The PI's broad vision is that this project will enable a transformative new class of dissipative state preparation protocols with dramatically improved speed, fidelity and robustness to errors.  To this end, the research will broadly focus on two directions: (i) study of dynamics driven by time-dependent dissipation, and (ii) study of dynamics driven by correlated dissipation.  These theoretical studies will involve developing a comprehensive analytical and numerical framework with some of the first explorations of the validity of open quantum systems descriptions, especially in a context where non-trivial dissipation is a useful resource.  For instance, the outcomes of this project will address fundamental questions pertaining to implications of adiabaticity and non-Markovianity for reservoir engineering and provide useful pointers for quantum error correction and error mitigation in the presence of correlated noise.  This has transformative potential not only for the entanglement stabilization protocols envisioned here but also for any platform involving dynamic control of quantum systems.  The PI maintains an active collaboration with experimental groups who will test the ideas on Josephson-junction-based superconducting platforms.  Thus this research will complement and advance the rapidly growing experimental capabilities in quantum control of low-dimensional open systems in the near-term.  Further, it will help strengthen interdisciplinary connections between disparate fields of quantum information/quantum optics, optimal control and strongly-interacting field theories, all of which focus on far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At current, there is little awareness of engineering education among engineering undergraduate students across the country to identify related interests. Further, there are limited professional venues targeted for students with interests in engineering education research related topics. With a growing need for scholars in the field of engineering education, this program will create a low risk?high pay off opportunity to promote exposure to the field at an early enough point to inform career trajectories. Additionally, as the number of Black and Latinx students attending graduate school across all engineering disciplines make up less than 4 percent combined, this experience could potentially serve to introduce an area of research that might differentially attract students compared to traditional engineering disciplines by the range of research promoting topics such as equity and social justice to makerspaces and asynchronous learning. As there is a direct link between research and practice, the goal is that diversifying the individuals conducting engineering education research could help establish more inclusive and just practices throughout engineering. The REU Site Establishing New Generations of scholars to Amplify and Grow Engineering Education (ENGagED) will address the aforementioned limitations by affording an introductory experience to research in engineering education for undergraduate students while also aiming to broaden participation in engineering. ENGagED will be led by Arizona State University (ASU) and University of Florida (UF) to provide a shared experience for engineering undergraduate students to engage in engineering education research and establish a visible pathway to careers in the field.<br/><br/>The goal of this ENGagED REU is to provide a rich exposure to and research experience in engineering education with a focus on underrepresented students. Having a broad range of projects anchored in engineering education research with threads of broadening participation woven into their framework will serve to expose students to the vast topics covered through the engineering education taxonomy. The goal is that ENGagED may serve as a model for identifying and attracting future talent to meet the growing discipline, promote visibility of the field, and potentially, provide a critical, formative experience in engineering education that results in increased student awareness, knowledge of pathways to the field, an expanded pool of talent and community of inclusive scholars. The explicit objectives of the ENGagED REU will be: 1) To provide engaging research experiences to undergraduates (i.e., depth), and specifically, students from underrepresented groups?which for this project will focus on Black and Latinx students and as a result of intersectionality may also include women, people from low SES backgrounds and first-generation individuals among other minoritized identities?that create awareness of and exposure to the field of engineering education; 2) To equip students with the foundation necessary to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate quality engineering education research; 3) To provide an opportunity for engineering undergraduates from underrepresented groups to be mentored by graduate students and faculty from underrepresented groups while all students learn to work collaboratively in a dynamic, interdisciplinary research environment; and 4) To use the introduction to engineering education research (i.e., breadth) facilitated by contributions of the faculty mentors and scholars network as a means of increasing exposure to research catalyzing interest in the field to grow the talent pool of future engineering education researchers, with an immediate focus on graduate studies. Through this REU site, cultivation of a diverse talent pool will serve to identify and develop future talent to populate the engineering education research community. The comprehensive set of expertise and breadth represented by the PIs, Faculty Scholars Network, faculty research mentors and Faculty Scholar of Outreach create an introductory exposure to engineering education for the REU students that will serve them well in any future engineering education pursuits.

Instead, the product they will receive is a function of both their preferences and the preferences of the other agents, including those of the sellers. Consider for instance the problem of assigning students to public high schools. As in the USA every child is entitled to free education, decisions on how eighth-graders are assigned to public high schools must be made based on their grades, features, and wishes, rather than resorting to prices. Since their introduction by Gale and Shapley in 1962, matching markets have been a fundamental research topic in computer science, economics, and operations research. Today, they arise in contexts ranging from enhancing diversity in school cohorts, to house allocation, to the assignment of users to servers and of refugees to their new homes. Typically, the large size of those markets implies that, even when good assignments exist, one may not be able to find them. The goal of this award is to propose fast algorithms to obtain fair allocations of goods in various matching markets, as well as proposing new, impactful matching markets that model complex scenarios. These algorithms will allow finding provably good solutions to all the matching markets mentioned above, and more. The educational and outreach initiatives of this project will instruct middle school students from underrepresented minorities on the features of the current mechanisms guiding the admission to public high schools, as to enhance their opportunities of obtaining a good placement.  <br/><br/>In more detail, this project will undertake a systematic study of matching markets from an algorithmic perspective, with the goal of understanding the computational limits of the present theory, and of devising alternative models and solutions for markets that currently elude computational tractability. This award will investigate provably fast algorithms to find matchings that satisfy or approximate important properties and/or that maximize certain objective functions modelling fairness or profit. For many of those problems, no algorithm is currently known. More generally, this project aims at a systematic algorithmization of certain existence results in the area, as well as the development of new, insightful, and impactful models. The three research thrusts of this award will focus on models with choice functions, algorithms for dominating points in polytopes ( la Scarf), and von Neumann-Morgenstern stability, respectively. By investigating the mathematical structures underlying matching markets, the research carried out in this project also aims at deducing principles and algorithms whose interest go beyond matching markets, and have impact on the investigation of mathematical objects such as lattices, posets, and polytopes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One reason for this is because the scholarship on how change happens in engineering education tends to focus on course content and classroom instruction. Unfortunately, such findings do not easily lend themselves to value-laden, systemic issues like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Fortunately, some Colleges of Engineering (COEs) throughout the U.S. have adopted change strategies that have resulted in consistently being named among the top-ten producers of Black and brown engineers. This project is motivated by a desire to learn from and follow their example. This CAREER project will disrupt the status quo regarding who gets to be an engineer by investigating five COEs that have significantly changed the face of engineering over the last 20 years. This project will: (1) Advance our understanding of the change strategies that exemplary COEs have used to improve Black and brown students? access to engineering education and careers; (2) Identify evidence-based models for broadening participation of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in engineering; and (3) Set COEs on a path to parity, such that the student body demographics in COEs across the country reflect the racial/ethnic makeup of the nation.<br/><br/>Using Kotter?s Leading Change Model and Acker?s Inequality Regimes as a framework, this multi-case study will investigate how exemplary COEs envisioned, implemented, and institutionalized changes that influenced Black and brown students? access to engineering. The five COEs that will be investigated are: Florida International University, Morgan State University, University of Central Florida, University of Maryland-Baltimore County, and University of Maryland-College Park. Given variations in the types of universities included in the research design, comparing and contrasting insights that emerge from each case will enable the PI to understand the conditions for change. The use of a research study design that relies on both qualitative and quantitative data will produce complementary forms of evidence on what promotes and impedes progress in this context. The research outcomes will include: (1) impact narratives that document concrete examples of how to expand who gets to be an engineer; and (2) a model for broadening participation informed by a cross-case analysis of these exemplars. Furthermore, this timely work focuses on the need to leverage talent from every demographic to diversify the engineering workforce and improve the lived experiences of minoritized groups. The educational outcomes will include: an Impact Playbook that translates the research into actionable strategies; a graduate course for future engineering faculty designed around each of the cases; a townhall discussion among associate professors; sharing insights with ASEE?s Engineering Deans Council; and a partnership with Virginia Tech?s (VT) College of Engineering and College of Science to build capacity among its leaders to envision and enact sustainable changes that promote DEI on VT?s campus.

The proposed design uses highly efficient and low-cost modern technologies with few moving functional elements. Only four modules are employed, designed to connect together in a quick-release, tool-less fashion requiring no service technicians to maintain.

Transforming the early experiences of future teachers can help to ensure the Nation has qualified STEM educators capable of inspiring and preparing the future STEM workforce. The project intends to do so by recruiting, preparing, and supporting a diverse group of undergraduate STEM majors to become highly skilled STEM secondary teachers.  These future teachers will include community college students and lower division students who represent the  region's demographic diversity. The project intends to prepare these students to serve as highly qualified middle and high school STEM teachers in rural, high-need schools and school districts. To recruit, prepare, and support these STEM students, project partners will coordinate two teacher preparation pathways that emphasize early STEM research and inquiry experiences.<br/><br/>This project at California State University Monterey Bay, a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) will leverage a regional alliance between three other post-secondary HSIs (Cabrillo College, Hartnell College, and Monterey Peninsula College) and the County Office of Education, representing 24 school districts in California's Central Coast region. Responding to consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the project will provide future teachers with online instruction and prepare them to be skilled online and in-person teachers.   For example, it will help future STEM teachers develop their capacity to facilitate STEM inquiry in ways that integrate digital citizenship and technology.  It aims to recruit, support, and prepare 30 new STEM teachers who will be recruited from undergraduate STEM majors (including biology, computer science, environmental science, marine science, mathematics, or statistics) at California State University Monterey Bay and partnering community colleges.  The students will receive scholarship support for their senior year and post-baccalaureate STEM teacher credentialing year.  In addition, mid-career STEM professionals will be recruited and receive stipend support to complete the one-year post-baccalaureate STEM teacher credentialing program. The Next Generation Science Standards Regional Collaborative Teacher Network coordinated by the County Office of Education will provide the prospective teachers with access to an early, inclusive STEM community of practice of current in-service teachers who are implementing best practices for STEM instruction and student learning. Early STEM inquiry, teaching, and mentored research opportunities will integrate active learning and culturally responsive pedagogy to build early social capital and create a diverse STEM teacher community. Project outcomes have potential to provide a model for the California Community College system (115 colleges) and California State University system (23 universities) to broaden the applicant pool of highly qualified STEM teachers. Dissemination of the model and strategies will help to address short- and long-term teacher shortages through an expanded STEM teacher preparation pipeline. Qualified and innovative STEM teachers in rural districts will have critical roles in developing the STEM workforce to meet emerging critical needs. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As more renewable energy is introduced into the grid and as grid operations grow increasingly complex, grid components such as power plants and energy storage must be operated on faster time-scales to balance fluctuations in power and keep the grid operating reliably. This project transforms the traditional optimization problems that grid operators solve by expediting their solution time using historical data and machine learning. The intellectual merits of this project focus on embedding the learning-based solutions into existing grid operations using a hybrid approach, by combining conventional optimization with machine learning. Rather than relying on purely data-driven solutions, grid operators can have increased confidence that the grid can continue to operate reliably under highly renewable energy futures. The broader impacts of the project include a ""learning-for-energy"" program with scholarship prizes, and publicly released datasets and benchmarks for algorithms emerging in this area of research.<br/><br/>In contrast to traditional approximations of these difficult problems that are typically used to address convergence speed and success, this project  proposes to leverage data to preserve more complex relationships while maintaining extremely fast computational speeds. Multiple ""learning-assisted"" algorithms will be developed to enhance various facets of power system operations including stochastic, distributed, and AC optimal power flow. Neural networks in particular can approximate complex functions well and perform inference in milliseconds, but alone, are black-box solutions that may not give grid operators the confidence to use them in real system operation. Here, hybrid approaches that combine optimization and machine learning are taken to determine better warm-starting points for nonconvex solvers, assist the convergence time of distributed optimization techniques, improve convergence success in difficult-to-solve optimal power flow scenarios, and reduce problem complexity in stochastic grid optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The insights to be gained from such analyses have the potential to transform medicine, social science, and technology. However, this potential often goes unrealized when the custodians of data do not have the tools to analyze it while safeguarding individual privacy. Differential privacy provides a framework for guaranteeing strong individual privacy while enabling the systematic design of privacy-respecting algorithms. For these reasons, it is enjoying increasingly widespread adoption in both industry and government.<br/><br/>This research confronts three broad classes of challenges which will enable the wider and safer adoption of differentially private technologies. The first is to understand which statistical inference and learning tasks admit differentially private solutions, and at what cost in computational resources. This research uses connections between privacy, communication complexity, and online learning to give a unified characterization of when privacy is achievable. The second is to develop new algorithmic paradigms, based on computational heuristics and regression algorithms, that will lead to practical solutions to high-dimensional statistical problems. The final objective is to develop new mathematical tools for more precisely understanding the guarantees of differential privacy and assessing its downstream impacts. Such tools will form a critical part of the guidance that the scientific community must provide to policymakers.

Hurricanes change forest structure and can increase carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Severe hurricanes favor light-loving tree species that are particularly vulnerable to wind damage, making forests more vulnerable to subsequent hurricanes. More severe hurricanes may also lead to the development of shorter forests dominated by wind-resistant species. In the short term, tree damage from severe hurricanes will reduce forest carbon storage and through accelerated decomposition, much of the carbon in dead biomass will return to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. However, the long-term effects of more severe hurricanes on carbon dynamics are not well understood and depend on the severity of the hurricane and post-disturbance tree establishment, growth, and death. The research will use data collected after Hurricane Mara in Puerto Rico to improve understanding of these long-term effects. Society will benefit from the development of modeling schemes that can be used to predict forest resilience to climate change. Results will be shared with scientists and managers working in the U.S Forest Service and 28 young scientists will gain valuable experience in ecological research.<br/><br/>The proposed research studies the unique situation caused by the passage of Hurricane Mara over Puerto Rico in 2017 to gain important, new knowledge about the effects of extreme wind on forests and to develop a realistic approach to representing forest responses to wind damage in earth system models. Mara was the strongest hurricane to make direct landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928 and may reflect changes in North Atlantic hurricanes. This project completes the seventh 5-year census of the 16 hectare Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot to characterize post-disturbance tree recruitment, growth, and delayed mortality. The project combines data on tree damage and forest recovery after Hurricane Mara and two weaker storms, hurricanes Hugo (1989) and Georges (1998), with aerial laser-derived representation of tree biomechanical properties. This information will be used to characterize the relationship between canopy structure of tree species and their response to a range of hurricane severities. The data will then be used in the Ecosystem Demography model, allowing assessment of the impacts of various climate change scenarios on forest and carbon dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Public schools face a shortage of STEM teachers, especially those with a STEM degree and who represent the diversity of the community they are serving. This shortage likely limits K-12 student STEM learning and may decrease their interest in pursuing further education in STEM.  As a result, the lack of highly qualified STEM teachers can affect representation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce. Houston Baptist University is a four-year undergraduate Hispanic-Serving Institution in Houston, Texas, one of the most diverse cities in the nation. The demographics of students at the University mirror those of the K-12 students in the Houston area. The project includes collaboration with the Lone Star College System, a public community college system and the largest institution of higher learning in the Houston area.  Through this collaboration, the project aims to develop a program to prepare students to become K-12 teachers and leaders by obtaining both a Bachelor of Science degree in a STEM major and a Master of Education degree.  This capacity building project also aims to identify ways to retain these prepared and diverse educators in the Houston area. The development of this program will provide an alternate career route for STEM majors that is designed to address a shortage of prepared and diverse educators in the community. <br/><br/>This project at Houston Baptist University includes partnerships with the Lone Star College System and Houston Independent School District. The primary goal of this project is to develop and implement plans for a five-year BS/MEd pathway for STEM majors to earn their teaching licensure in a fifth-year program and eventually enter the Houston workforce as STEM teachers and education leaders.  Project aims include: 1) increasing capacity for student success in STEM; 2) expanding capacity of the Houston Baptist University curriculum for STEM teaching licensure; and 3) strengthening capacity for professional development for STEM educators. This project seeks to identify challenges that lead to the persistent shortage of qualified and diverse STEM educators in Houston Independent School District. The needs of college students pursuing a STEM degree, STEM teachers, and local K-12 school administrators will be assessed to determine capacity for continuous growth of the program. If successful, development of the program has the potential to serve as a model for understanding STEM teacher shortages in urban school districts serving predominantly underrepresented students. Findings also have potential to be applied to other institutions with student groups experiencing similar challenges preventing them from remaining in the community and serving through teaching. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While generally pursued as separate lines of investigation, we hypothesize that the aims, objectives, and goals pertaining to ethics and DEI often overlap. By investigating this potential overlap, we hypothesize that we can help improve overall efforts at promoting DEI and ethics in engineering. Our primary research objective is to synthesize intersections between ethics and DEI among engineering academic and workforce communities. In this study, we begin with a systematic literature review that explores potential overlap in literature in ethics and DEI. Second, we will study how engineering academics view (consciously and subconsciously) ethics and DEI as related. Finally, we will study how industrial practitioners view (consciously and subconsciously) the potential overlap between ethics and DEI. Collectively, this study will enable us to compare how literature, academics, and practitioners view ethics and DEI as related. We will use findings to generate curricular and workforce training efforts to better integrate ethics and DEI in engineering. This study will benefit society by promoting the formation of engineers who can engage with different values and perspectives in ethical ways.<br/><br/>Despite various models, initiatives, and pockets of innovation by scholars and programs, we have not realized widespread changes in the diversification of the engineering workforce. We theorize that one barrier to change is the disjuncture between lines of scholarship from engineering education researchers in the intersecting spaces of DEI and engineering ethics. This study seeks to find ways for these communities to support one another by making explicit hidden structural issues that mask the intersections between ethics and DEI in the context of engineering. This study is comprised of three phases, addressing the following respective research questions: (1) How are engineering ethics and DEI related based on theoretical and empirical understandings of affective and cognitive development of students and practitioners within these communities?; (2) How are engineering ethics and DEI related based on mental models elicited from academics active in these two areas of research and scholarship?; and (3) How are engineering ethics and DEI related based on mental models elicited from a diverse cross-section of industrial practitioners? To address RQ1, we will use systematic literature review procedures to synthesize peer-reviewed scholarship on approaches to, and outcomes of, interventions centered around ethics and DEI. To address RQ2 and RQ3, academics (Phase 2) and industrial practitioners (Phase 3) will respond to an ethics/DEI challenge in multiple formats, including graphically, textually, and verbally. We will critically analyze the literature and mental models via a discourse analysis approach, guided by seven building tasks identified by Gee (significance, practices, identities, relationships, politics, connections, and sign systems). We will triangulate Phase 1, 2, and 3 findings to identify how discourses vary across the academic and industrial contexts. This triangulation will enable us to generate actionable modalities for supporting educational efforts aimed at the intersection of ethics and DEI both in curricular and workforce contexts. We will adopt an activist-oriented approach to disseminate findings to the research community and professional organizations through multiple mechanisms. This will directly benefit society by facilitating the professional formation of engineers who are more ethically adept and capable of engaging with difference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How cells communicate and govern these fundamental biological processes are highly complex and dynamic, and their behavior is very difficult to predict from knowledge of the individual parts. Therefore, the question arises how we should analyze and understand such complexity and which measurement technologies will prove most useful. Recently, several high-throughput approaches for collecting large-scale datasets, particularly those involving gene expression, have unlocked the door to data-driven systems biology-based projects.  However, studying many interactions, even in a closely interconnected network, is powerful, but it is often hard to see the forest for the trees. Most often, system biologists rely on mathematical and computational models to analyze large-scale datasets and use these models to make scientific breakthroughs. To inspire and train the next generation of scientists in both experimental and computational approaches, this project will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to learn both cutting-edge cell biology-based experimentation and computational methods for formulating, simplifying, and extracting critical information from large-scale quantitative experimental data. A combination of hands-on training and lesson plans on the concept of 'cellular decision-making' for high school teachers will further promote data-driven biology among high school students. The graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working on this project will integrate experimental and mathematical modeling techniques that can be applied to broad areas of biology. This quantitative research theme will be carried forward by mentorship to high school students and through public engagement activities with the local community. <br/><br/>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a central mechanism for diversifying the cells found in complex tissues. During EMT, epithelial cells adopt mesenchymal properties by altering their morphology, cellular architecture, adhesion, and migratory capacity. Several growth factors, including TGF-beta and Wnt, have been shown to trigger the EMT in both embryonic development as well as normal and transformed cells. However, a mechanistic and integrated understanding of how these various factors cooperate to induce the EMT in epithelial cells or transdifferentiation in fibroblast is still lacking. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated understanding of how Wnt and TGF-beta pathways control fundamental cell biological and developmental processes of EMT and cell migration. The research project will reveal mechanistic insights into how Wnt signaling drives EMT and promotes cell migration, and determine whether cooperation between Wnt and TGF-beta signaling is necessary for EMT. The project will also provide a biochemical portrait to determine how proteins in the Wnt pathway interact and interconnect with TGF-beta signaling and determine how these connections change as epithelial cells undergo transdifferentiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is national momentum to expand K-12 student access to computer science education, including for historically underrepresented and otherwise marginalized youth. As of 2019, 34 states had moved toward this goal by developing K?12 computer science standards.  However, two-thirds of currently certified K?12 computer science teachers in the United States do not have a degree in computer science.  The limited formal preparation of these teachers raises concerns about the quality of K-12 computer science education across the Nation.  This project will lay the foundation for enhancing Kennesaw State University?s capacity to prepare secondary computer science teachers who have strong computer science knowledge and skills. Specifically, the project will: (1) examine needs in local school districts and the interests of computer science and mathematics majors in teaching as a career; (2) develop new undergraduate and graduate degree programs leading to computer science teacher licensure; (3) produce curricula, teacher professional development opportunities, and outreach programs to strengthen computer science education in Georgia, specifically in high-need districts; and (4) create a metro-Atlanta hub for computer science teacher education at the University. As a result, Kennesaw State University will develop capacity in four areas: student interest and expertise; curricular relevance; certification programs; and recruitment, retention, and advising.  <br/><br/>This project at Kennesaw State University includes partnerships with the Cobb County School District and the Georgia Department of Education to create multiple programs for computer science teacher education. Moreover, the project will design and implement activities targeting students, pre-service teachers, and in-service teachers with a goal to promote, recruit, and retain computer science teachers.  Programs to be developed include a Master of Arts in Teaching in Computer Science and a Secondary Computer Science teacher concentration in an existing Master?s of Education degree program.

Both are important for managing complex systems such as self-driving vehicles, humanoid robotics, smart buildings, and automated healthcare. This CAREER proposal aims at building fundamental connections between control theory and machine learning. On one hand, control theory provides mathematically rigorous tools for addressing the robustness requirement of modern safety-critical systems such as commercial aircraft and nuclear plants. On the other hand, machine learning techniques have been used to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for many artificial intelligence tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and Go. A rapprochement of control theory and machine learning will significantly broaden the class of engineering problems that can be solved efficiently. This proposal aims at reconciling these two areas with a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach that spans and connects the forefronts of robust control theory, nonlinear system theory, jump system theory, supervised learning, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, semidefinite programming, and non-convex optimization. The proposed research will lay the theoretical foundation for reliable integration of control and machine learning in modern safety-critical intelligent systems. The research progress will promote multidisciplinary collaborations and benefit the researchers from learning, control, optimization, artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics. In addition, the research will be strongly coupled with educational developments which will promote students from different departments to develop solid multidisciplinary proficiency. New course materials resulting from the research will provide new concepts and ideas to inspire the next generation of academic and industrial leaders.<br/><br/>This proposal takes an interdisciplinary perspective on machine learning and control. The proposed research is centered around two thrusts. The first thrust focuses on tailoring control theory to unify, streamline, and automate the analysis and design of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, algorithms in supervised/reinforcement/unsupervised learning will be modeled as Markovian jump systems and nonlinear systems which have been extensively studied in controls literature. The combination of this idea with modern control-theoretical tools such as stochastic dissipation inequalities will pave the way for a unified principled approach to the design of high-performance algorithmic pipelines in machine learning. The second thrust focuses on borrowing recent results in non-convex learning to push control theory beyond the convex optimization regime. The recently developed non-convex learning theory will be leveraged to derive various theoretical guarantees for non-convex optimization problems in control. The proposed research is expected to advance the state-of-the-art algorithms in large-scale control and broaden the class of nonlinear/robust control problems that can be solved with guarantees. The proposed research covers both ?control for learning? and ?learning for control,? deepening the connections of control and learning by showing that the techniques used by each side can be explored to impact the other side.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will far surpass the capabilities of lasers and laser-like electromagnetic radiation sources currently available in this frequency range, which either have low power output, or are too large, heavy, and power-consuming to be used in field-portable applications. This project establishes a new type of laser technology uniquely based on high-temperature superconductors that will be ideal for the above applications in this ?terahertz gap? frequency range. To date, milliwatt-level power from this type of laser has only been theoretically predicted, at the level of fundamental physics. This project tests the ideas empirically and engineers the technology to make it available for deployment. The cryocooling requirements of this technology take advantage of micro-cryocoolers that are already used for infrared cameras and night vision goggles. To complement the superconductivity research project, a program of scientific outreach activities is performed. These are based on superconductive levitation experiments to inspire high schoolers and community college students, particularly from underrepresented demographics, into STEM fields. A graduate-level course module focuses on lithographic fabrication techniques for microelectronics and prepares students for careers in device microfabrication research.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>At present, the sources of coherent radiation available between approximately 0.3 trillion Hertz and 1.5 trillion Hertz all have serious engineering drawbacks that limit their usefulness. Existing technologies that work at these frequencies either generate very low levels of output power, or are very heavy, bulky, and power-consuming. User-friendly lasers operating in this ?terahertz gap? range would revolutionize a number of fields, including high-bandwidth data transmission, scientific and medical imaging, and security and defense technologies. Stacked ?intrinsic? superconductor-insulator-superconductor (Josephson) junctions in the extremely anisotropic high-temperature superconducting compound Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 are one of the most promising candidates for filling the ?terahertz gap?. These intrinsic Josephson junctions can be used to engineer the only compact terahertz laser source that currently offers tunability, high power, and continuous-wave operation. This project engineers terahertz laser sources based on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 Josephson junctions to achieve at least an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the terahertz power output of these devices to 1 milliwatt or more, while also at least doubling their operating frequency range to at least 1.0 terahertz. These enhancements in terahertz power and emission frequency are targeted even at operation temperatures of 77 Kelvin or more, in order to minimize cryocooling requirements. Terahertz sources are microfabricated by patterning stacks on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 crystals using optical lithography and argon-ion milling. The feasibility of doing this at volume for commercial-scale terahertz laser applications will be tested.

Most crops emerged from limited geographical ranges but were rapidly disseminated into highly variable conditions across the globe. Though selection of crop varieties best adapted to specific locales is critical for maximizing agricultural yields, our understanding of the genetic basis of crop adaptation remains in its infancy. This is partly because the process of plant adaptation occurs over the course of decades making it difficult for plant geneticists to study. To directly observe the process of adaptation, this project will use the barley composite crosses (CCs) common garden experiments, a novel series of agricultural genetics experiments begun nearly a century ago in barley.  In these experiments, genetically diverse sets of barley varieties were competed in multiple locations over the course of decades. Using modern genomics techniques, this project will uncover and link the genes that underlie competitive ability revealed in these experiments to changes in important agricultural traits such as flowering time, plant size, and yield. Through this project, hundreds of undergraduate students will participate in the discovery of genetic shifts in the population as part of a reenvisioned introductory biology curriculum that involves hands-on experiments using molecular biology techniques. Plant materials, phenotypic observations, and billions of DNA sequences produced by this project will be made rapidly available for use by researchers and small grains breeders world-wide.<br/><br/>The longevity of the composite crosses makes them an unparalleled genetic resource to study the molecular basis of crop adaptation. The primary goals of this project are to identify genes that underlie crop fitness in variable environments, to explore the genetic process of adaptation over time, and to understand how molecular changes translate into phenotypic differences. To achieve these goals, structural and single nucleotide variants that segregated at the beginning of the experiments will be identified by resequencing the genomes of the forty parental barley cultivars using long read sequencing technologies. The evolution of these variants will be monitored as the composite cross populations adapt to two distinct environments, one located in Bozeman (MT), the other in Davis (CA). Using this comparative approach will allow for the characterization of the rate and mode of genetic change throughout the genome and will result in the identification of suites of genes that drive increases in barley fitness. Finally, genotypes will be linked to phenotypes by creating and using a powerful new barley multiparent mapping population from the composite cross material to identify the genomic basis of numerous adaptive traits, to link changes in gene expression to changes in phenotype, and to reveal how the genetic architecture of trait variation shapes adaptive evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stem cells differentiate into mature cells through the process of stem cell fate decision-making: in most cases, we cannot yet explain or predict this process. This project will develop mathematical models to understand how stem cells make fate decisions. The models will describe the dynamics of stem cells as well as the gene dynamics occurring inside cells and the higher-level coordination that occurs between the many cells of a tissue. The PI will take the novel approach of using publicly available genomics data to inform models of two organs: the blood (hematopoietic) and kidney epithelial systems. The research outcome will be an ability to predict and explain stem cell fate decisions: knowledge that will bring us one step closer to being able to build new organs. The educational objective of this project is to train a new generation of scientists to be equally skilled in biological and quantitative thinking. This will be achieved by developing new curricula for undergraduate, middle/high, and elementary level students, closely coupled to the research goals of the project.<br/><br/>This project will develop models to explain how stem cell differentiation is coordinated and maintained in complex signaling environments. Stem cell differentiation is controlled by cell-internal gene regulatory networks as well as signals from the microenvironment and cell- and tissue-scale effects. Predictive models of stem cell differentiation must take into account the dynamics occurring on all of these biological scales. Stem cell states (both homeostatic and perturbed) in two systems will be studied: hematopoiesis and kidney epithelia. For each system, publicly available single-cell genomics data will be leveraged to infer regulatory networks across transcriptional-to-cellular scales. This will be achieved via three scientific objectives: 1) Develop Bayesian inference methods to learn single-cell regulatory networks; 2) Investigate stem cell lineage dynamics via dynamical systems modeling and parameter inference; 3) Predict tissue-scale responses to stimuli through multiscale modeling. The resulting models will give fundamental new insight into how stem cells function, and may reveal shared regulatory logic of signaling pathway motifs across different organs. The educational goal of this project is to train a new generation of scientists to be simultaneously literate in mathematical and life sciences.

To fight bacterial infections, plants use small, mobile metabolites that travel throughout their vascular system to turn on defenses at sites of attack and throughout the plant body. By activating defenses in uninfected tissues, plants exist in a heightened immune state that limits new pathogen infections. This immune response is known as defense priming or systemic acquired resistance. Recent research identified an amino acid derivative called N-hydroxy-pipecolic acid (NHP) that is the bioactive metabolite required to turn on defense priming. There is sparse information for how NHP affects plant defense and development. Notably, watering or injecting plants with NHP is sufficient to induce defense priming and protect against bacterial and fungal infections. These findings suggest that altering NHP levels in plants or providing NHP to plants to enhance their defense responses may be effective strategies to enhance disease resistance in plants used in agriculture and horticulture. This project will study important aspects of NHP biology. Key questions include: (1) How long does the NHP defense signal last? (2) How is the defense signal turned off? (3) How does NHP signaling impact normal growth and development? (5) Do pathogens manipulate NHP biology to turn off this plant defense system? These questions will be answered by using chemical biology and functional genomic approaches with tomato, an important crop plant. The long-term goal is to investigate possible chemical applications and/or engineering efforts to enhance defense priming in plants to improve plant health. This study will provide intensive research training at the graduate, undergraduate and high school level with special consideration of women, underrepresented minorities, and those from under-resourced backgrounds. The research and outreach activities will also provide hands-on teaching and mentorship training for Stanford graduate and postgraduate students. <br/><br/><br/>Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a global plant immune response induced at the site of pathogen infection that triggers long-lasting and broad-spectrum disease resistance throughout the plant. A single small metabolite, N-hydroxy-pipecolic acid (NHP), is necessary and sufficient for initiation of this heightened immune state, even in the absence of an initial infection. Interestingly, NHP and its derivatives appear to be mobile metabolites, illuminating the chemical nature of the signals that are required to initiate and amplify defense responses over long distances within the plant body. Moreover, overexpression of the NHP biosynthetic pathway in local tissues alone can protect distal tissues from pathogen infection. These data thus highlight the intriguing possibility for translating a chemical or metabolic engineering approach to prime and/or enhance disease resistance under pathogen pressure. Currently, there is sparse information available regarding the regulation of NHP biosynthesis, dynamics of NHP signaling, and universal impact of this defense priming mechanism on plant growth and health. The goal of this research is to elucidate the temporal dynamics of NHP chemical defense and its effectiveness in protecting important crop plants under native and engineered conditions. This study will test the hypothesis that the regulation of NHP biosynthesis and the duration of the NHP bioactive signal can be titrated to increase disease resistance without compromising plant fitness. The model vegetable tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, will be used to elucidate fundamental aspects of NHP. This research will provide insight to the dynamics of NHP signaling and growth-defense associated with altered NHP production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the power that can be generated from these renewable sources is intermittent and typically asynchronous with electrical energy demand. Thus, large-scale energy storage is indispensable for a sustainable economy with reduced reliance on fossil fuels. Representing a promising solution to this energy storage need, aqueous zinc (Zn) metal batteries can store energy at a low cost, with low environmental footprint and high intrinsic safety. However, Zn metal batteries suffer from short cycle life, primarily due to corrosion of the Zn metal anode by water. This corrosion drastically curtails the cycle life of Zn metal batteries and causes a safety concern due to the generation of explosive hydrogen gas?two challenges that require outside-the-box solutions. The recent emergence of highly concentrated ?water-in-salt? electrolytes offers a unique opportunity to re-define the stability between the Zn metal anode and the aqueous electrolyte. This project seeks to transform the cyclic stability and increase safe operation of aqueous Zn metal batteries. If successful, this will mark a significant breakthrough for energy storage technologies in the United States. For educational impacts, the investigators will leverage institutional programs their universities to increase the participation of community college students and high school students in summer research experiences. The training of graduate and undergraduate students will feed the workforce need of the next-generation energy sector. <br/><br/>The project will elucidate the water stability properties in extremely concentrated solutions by integrating research activities in materials electrochemistry, femtosecond Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio computation. These complementary methods are highly synergistic, providing insights from different vantage points that when integrated can enable deep understanding. In the concentrated electrolytes of study there are few water molecules per solvated ion; therefore, the solvation sheaths are often thinner or incomplete compared to standard dilute solutions. Such solvation structures significantly alter the properties of the solvated ions and the dynamic water molecules as a solvent. Preliminary results have revealed that water molecules exhibit unusually high electrochemical stability against hydrogen evolution and display an intriguing blueshift of vibrational frequencies in stimulated Raman studies. First-principles calculations indicate that there exist peculiar properties of water molecules to be explored in these concentrated solutions. This project will generate an in-depth understanding of the correlation between solvation structures of the concentrated electrolytes and the corresponding stability in contact with the Zn metal anode. The values of such knowledge will transcend different disciplines of physical sciences and engineering and impact a broad range of STEM learners and practitioners in academic and industrial settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, dendrite growth on the electrode and unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation have created safety concerns in Li batteries and hindered practical applications. Introducing an artificial protective layer on the Li metal electrode is an effective strategy to stabilize the Li electrode, yet how this protective layer interacts with the electrochemical process of Li metal anode is not well understood. This project will integrate experiments and simulations to understand how the physical and chemical properties of the protective layer affect the electrochemical performance of the Li metal electrode. The fundamental knowledge gained will guide development of novel Li metal electrodes with high performance and improved safety for electric vehicles and other high-energy-density electrical storage devices. The project will also involve the education of graduate, undergraduate students, and K-12 students by course development, summer camp, and outreach activities in local museums.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop a new understanding of the key physical and chemical properties of the protective layer that leads to stable charge/discharge processes of the Li metal electrode. The state-of-the-art guideline is insufficient, and the model only considers the influences of the limited mechanical properties of the protective layer on the stabilization of the Li metal electrode. In this project, by an effective integration of experimental synthesis, characterization and phase-field simulations, a new understanding will be generated on electrochemistry and deformation/failure mechanism of suppressing dendrites, including mass transport, electric potential, stress, and deformation. The research goal will be reached by working on several objectives: (1) Effect of mechanical properties of the protective layer on the suppression of Li dendrite growth; (2) Effect of ionic mass transfer behaviors of the protective layer on the stabilization of the Li metal electrode; (3) Novel protective layer on Li metal for the high-performance assembled cells. The elucidated correlation between physical and chemical properties of the protective layer, and the electrochemical processes of the electrode is expected to open pathways for the novel design and fabrication of Li metal electrodes, leading to stable and high-performance next-generation energy storage devices.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET Electrochemical Systems program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an outcome of interest in the analysis of economic growth and inequality, regional development, and a range of national and local policies. This information is also an input to key questions about the behavior and welfare of individuals, cohorts, and firms. Despite their paramount importance, systematic historical data on local economic conditions in the US are extremely limited. This limitation creates challenges in examining the evolution of the US economy during a period that includes geographic expansion, demographic and political realignment, and transformation from a rural, agrarian economy into an urban industrial one. Moreover, it poses challenges in understanding more recent developments in the US economy, since many of these have historical roots, or depend on cumulative or historical exposure to shocks. This project will generate a long-run panel on local economic conditions in the US?one that is comprehensive, high-frequency, spatially-disaggregate, and available consistently over the period 1865-present. The project will further illustrate the research potential of this new dataset and provide the first systematic, high-frequency evidence on local economic conditions in the US prior to the 1970s.<br/><br/>The panel dataset will comprise deposits of all households and firms in each county-year from 1865-present. For the period before 1960, the project will generate new data from the balance sheets of all nationally-chartered banks in the US, and supplement this with information on deposits held by state-chartered banks and other depository institutions. From 1961 to the present, the project will merge newly-collected data with existing information on deposits by county. The project will further explore deposits as a close and reliable proxy for traditional local economic indicators, such as employment or income, for which high-quality historical data are not readily available. An additional dataset will contain the detailed balance sheets of all US depository institutions underlying the county panel. These new datasets will have applications to all fields of economics, as well as across broader social science and policy evaluation spheres. The data will advance knowledge on the evolution of the US economy, fostering an understanding of critical local dynamics that previous data have obscured. By filling a substantial gap in the nation?s data infrastructure, this project will contribute to both economic knowledge and policy effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

So far device fabrication has been restrictive due to limitations in sample preparation. This project aims to understand the spintronic properties of Janus layers and to integrate them into spin-based field-effect transistors and gating devices for next-generation electronic applications. The societal impacts will manifest through the introduction of a new generation of spintronic devices and lowering energy consumption in high-speed electronic devices.

It is generally thought that, in order to be species-rich, a lineage must also be ecologically diverse. Yet, this is not always the case. This proposal focuses on woodland salamanders (genus Plethodon), a highly diverse amphibian lineage in the Appalachian region of eastern North America. This lineage is renowned for high species richness despite little ecological diversity. Nonetheless, the story of the Plethodon radiation has largely been studied from a single niche axis ? that of structural habitat use and corresponding morphology. Just as important, but largely ignored, is thermal and hydric habitat use, and how interactions with climatic factors may generate biodiversity. As lungless salamanders, these organisms perform a delicate dance with their thermal and hydric environments to ensure cutaneous respiration. This award centers around discovering how physiological diversity is structured across the lineage, and how physiological evolution contributes to the high species diversity of Plethodon. This award is important because it will advance our understanding of how biodiversity originates. Specifically, the researchers will unpack how diversification (or lack thereof) along several ecological axes sculpts broad-scale patterns of species richness. The award is also important because it will provide detailed and updated information about salamander vulnerability to ongoing environmental change. This project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates and high school students.<br/><br/>Theory suggests that disparity in biodiversity reflects ecological differences among lineages. At one extreme, adaptive radiation is characterized by rapid and prolific diversification into numerous ecological niches and, at the other end, lineages with low ecological diversity also tend to have few species. So-called ?non-adaptive? radiations occupy an enigmatic middle ground characterized by high species richness despite low ecological diversity. Perhaps most famous among these radiations are the plethodontid (lungless) salamanders. This lineage is renowned for long-term morphological stasis, suggesting that diversification has been driven by neutral processes. Using a series of phylogenetic causal models, the researchers will explore evolutionary patterns of physiological diversity, and determine their causal mechanism(s). Then, using evolutionary rate matrices, the researchers will compare rates and patterns of morphological and physiological evolution. Then, the researchers will explore the physiological correlates of species? distributions to explore why the Appalachian region is so species rich in lungless amphibians. Lastly, using a series of new mechanistic models, the researchers will explore how salamander distributions will be altered over the next century.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graduate students face many stresses: from classwork, from their paid teaching and research commitments, and from other stressors outside of their graduate work. In this research on the formation of engineers, we will identify major stressors that PhD-level engineering students commonly face, create and validate a questionnaire to measure these stressors, and test how stress can predict students? intentions to leave their doctoral programs. The project uses a workplace stress model in which having low control over job hindrances (e.g. course availability, graduation requirements, COVID-19) leads to harmful stress. The results of this study can inform a wide range of programs and personnel who support doctoral engineering students, including faculty advisors and engineering departments, counselling centers, career centers, writing centers, and others. Although prior research work has identified major stressors, little work has been done to compare sources of stress for graduate PhD students and the effects of these stressors on retention. With a research-backed identification of major stressors and their effects, these stakeholders above can be empowered to adopt programmatic changes or other strategies proactively addressing the stressors we will identify. The measure of doctoral students? stressors that we produce can be broadly implemented by other universities to identify where more supports are needed, to expand available supports, and by other researchers seeking to understand effects of stress on STEM education.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to identify top stressors for doctoral students across different phases of engineering PhD programs and to predict the effects of top stressors on retention in those programs. In Year 1, we will interview a diverse set of students (N = 57) about stressors and coping, to identify which  sources of stress occur the most frequently and are perceived by participants as being the most harmful. Participants will also complete existing questionnaires on stress and anxiety, and we will model changes in those variables over an academic year. In Year 2, we will develop a new questionnaire measuring the valence and frequency of top stressors, based on our results from work in Year 1. We will conduct cognitive interviews with doctoral engineering students to identify any confusing items and improve the questionnaire. Following this, we will test the psychometrics of the questionnaire in Year 2 with a diverse sample of 300 doctoral engineering students. In year 3, we will use the newly validated measure, together with other existing measures of stress and anxiety, to predict students? intention of leaving a doctoral engineering program (N = 300). Outcomes of the project will be findings about the prevalence of different stressors by groups (e.g., groups under-represented in engineering, early/middle/late in doctoral studies, domestic vs. international PhD students), a validated questionnaire widely usable by programs and researchers, and estimates of the effect of stress on intention to remain in a doctoral engineering program. A technical manual and non-technical descriptions of the findings will be made available to the public, together with presentations at research- and practice-focused conferences.

At current, there is little awareness of engineering education among engineering undergraduate students across the country to identify related interests. Further, there are limited professional venues targeted for students with interests in engineering education research related topics. With a growing need for scholars in the field of engineering education, this program will create a low risk?high pay off opportunity to promote exposure to the field at an early enough point to inform career trajectories. Additionally, as the number of Black and Latinx students attending graduate school across all engineering disciplines make up less than 4 percent combined, this experience could potentially serve to introduce an area of research that might differentially attract students compared to traditional engineering disciplines by the range of research promoting topics such as equity and social justice to makerspaces and asynchronous learning. As there is a direct link between research and practice, the goal is that diversifying the individuals conducting engineering education research could help establish more inclusive and just practices throughout engineering. The REU Site Establishing New Generations of scholars to Amplify and Grow Engineering Education (ENGagED) will address the aforementioned limitations by affording an introductory experience to research in engineering education for undergraduate students while also aiming to broaden participation in engineering. ENGagED will be led by Arizona State University (ASU) and University of Florida (UF) to provide a shared experience for engineering undergraduate students to engage in engineering education research and establish a visible pathway to careers in the field.<br/><br/>The goal of this ENGagED REU is to provide a rich exposure to and research experience in engineering education with a focus on underrepresented students. Having a broad range of projects anchored in engineering education research with threads of broadening participation woven into their framework will serve to expose students to the vast topics covered through the engineering education taxonomy. The goal is that ENGagED may serve as a model for identifying and attracting future talent to meet the growing discipline, promote visibility of the field, and potentially, provide a critical, formative experience in engineering education that results in increased student awareness, knowledge of pathways to the field, an expanded pool of talent and community of inclusive scholars. The explicit objectives of the ENGagED REU will be: 1) To provide engaging research experiences to undergraduates (i.e., depth), and specifically, students from underrepresented groups?which for this project will focus on Black and Latinx students and as a result of intersectionality may also include women, people from low SES backgrounds and first-generation individuals among other minoritized identities?that create awareness of and exposure to the field of engineering education; 2) To equip students with the foundation necessary to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate quality engineering education research; 3) To provide an opportunity for engineering undergraduates from underrepresented groups to be mentored by graduate students and faculty from underrepresented groups while all students learn to work collaboratively in a dynamic, interdisciplinary research environment; and 4) To use the introduction to engineering education research (i.e., breadth) facilitated by contributions of the faculty mentors and scholars network as a means of increasing exposure to research catalyzing interest in the field to grow the talent pool of future engineering education researchers, with an immediate focus on graduate studies. Through this REU site, cultivation of a diverse talent pool will serve to identify and develop future talent to populate the engineering education research community. The comprehensive set of expertise and breadth represented by the PIs, Faculty Scholars Network, faculty research mentors and Faculty Scholar of Outreach create an introductory exposure to engineering education for the REU students that will serve them well in any future engineering education pursuits.

Unfortunately, the power that can be generated from these renewable sources is intermittent and typically asynchronous with electrical energy demand. Thus, large-scale energy storage is indispensable for a sustainable economy with reduced reliance on fossil fuels. Representing a promising solution to this energy storage need, aqueous zinc (Zn) metal batteries can store energy at a low cost, with low environmental footprint and high intrinsic safety. However, Zn metal batteries suffer from short cycle life, primarily due to corrosion of the Zn metal anode by water. This corrosion drastically curtails the cycle life of Zn metal batteries and causes a safety concern due to the generation of explosive hydrogen gas?two challenges that require outside-the-box solutions. The recent emergence of highly concentrated ?water-in-salt? electrolytes offers a unique opportunity to re-define the stability between the Zn metal anode and the aqueous electrolyte. This project seeks to transform the cyclic stability and increase safe operation of aqueous Zn metal batteries. If successful, this will mark a significant breakthrough for energy storage technologies in the United States. For educational impacts, the investigators will leverage institutional programs their universities to increase the participation of community college students and high school students in summer research experiences. The training of graduate and undergraduate students will feed the workforce need of the next-generation energy sector.<br/><br/>The project will elucidate the water stability properties in extremely concentrated solutions by integrating research activities in materials electrochemistry, femtosecond Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio computation. These complementary methods are highly synergistic, providing insights from different vantage points that when integrated can enable deep understanding. In the concentrated electrolytes of study there are few water molecules per solvated ion; therefore, the solvation sheaths are often thinner or incomplete compared to standard dilute solutions. Such solvation structures significantly alter the properties of the solvated ions and the dynamic water molecules as a solvent. Preliminary results have revealed that water molecules exhibit unusually high electrochemical stability against hydrogen evolution and display an intriguing blueshift of vibrational frequencies in stimulated Raman studies. First-principles calculations indicate that there exist peculiar properties of water molecules to be explored in these concentrated solutions. This project will generate an in-depth understanding of the correlation between solvation structures of the concentrated electrolytes and the corresponding stability in contact with the Zn metal anode. The values of such knowledge will transcend different disciplines of physical sciences and engineering and impact a broad range of STEM learners and practitioners in academic and industrial settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Integration of connectivity features into modern vehicles is a main driving force behind the ever-expanding attack surface of connected AVs, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and data theft. Key vulnerabilities arise from the increased coupling of unsecured automotive control networks with multimedia networks and the integration of wireless interfaces such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks. As such, developing robust and reliable solutions to identify, localize, and mitigate cybersecurity threats to connected AVs is of societal importance. Existing solutions, however, are limited in their ability and scope as they are unable to reliably link the received data to the transmitting devices. The goal of this project is to safeguard AVs against growing attack surfaces and vectors by developing a holistic solution called the Linking2Source framework through three seamlessly integrated layers of defense, with each layer aiming to mitigate a specific set of attacks. The project also has a significant educational component, consisting of a set of inquisitive hands-on activities involving vehicle data acquisition, decoding, and data analytics, network packet injection, and intrusion detection aimed at outreach and broadening participation in STEM disciplines, including automotive cybersecurity, cyber-physical system security, statistical data analysis and digital forensics.<br/><br/>The first layer of the proposed Linking2Source framework aims to protect in-vehicle networks by developing real-time message authentication, intrusion detection, and localization tools based on unclonable signal attributes for physical fingerprinting of electronic control units (ECUs). The approach exploits uniqueness in physical signal attributes, leverages statistical signal processing and parameter modeling techniques for physical fingerprint estimation, and uses statistical machine learning methods for transmitting ECU identification and localization. The second layer aims to protect in-vehicle networks against firmware/software-level attacks using ECU behavioral fingerprinting through data-driven statistical graph analytics. The approach targeted by the research team here is the transformation of sequential in-vehicle network data into a directed-graph to leverage statistical graph analytics for ECU behavior modeling and intrusion detection. The third layer of defense aims to protect AVs against attacks at the sensing and actuation layer by using dynamical observers that rely on vehicle-physics-based modeling for fault detection and isolation. The faulty signals such as incorrect steering angle commands that are issued by the rogue ECUs and are not in agreement with the vehicle physics could cause unsafe maneuvers such as excessive yaw motions. The project exploits the physics-based vehicle model for verifying the correctness of the issued ECU signals over the in-vehicle network bus. By leveraging the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, the decisions from these layers of defense are optimally fused to integrate the three defense solutions in the Linking2Source framework. A key component of this project is to use in-vehicle network data both at the physical and datalink layers for modeling physical, behavioral, and vehicle-state fingerprints and using them for attack detection and localization and mitigation of the impact of malicious ECUs using a proactive cancellation policy. The research team will prototype the proposed solutions and evaluate them on the University of Michigan-Dearborn shuttle, on the University of Michigan MCity Test Facility, and on commercial tools, in addition to collecting large-scale data from a network testbed and from a real vehicle driving and sharing it with the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although SL research has a short history, rapid progress has been made in unveiling its critical role in controlling plant physiology and rhizosphere signaling. Despite these significant advances, several key questions concerning the mechanisms of hormone perception, signal transduction, and regulation of hormone metabolism remain unanswered. This project will support an integrated research, education, and outreach program that focuses on the study of the structure-function of SL signaling regulation by utilizing advanced interdisciplinary approaches. The knowledge generated from this project may have far reaching impacts in understanding the biology of the SL pathway and advancing technologies in agriculture, including germination control of crops and parasitic weeds. Additionally, as an integral part of the research activities, this project will create a unique teaching platform and outreach program to encourage young students to pursue knowledge in STEM with two major implementations: (a) developing a modern biochemistry classroom by implementing an interactive curriculum that integrates advanced visualization tools; (b) promoting STEM education for underrepresented groups by pioneering engaging workshops to inspire the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The recent identification of the key components of SL signaling, including a hydrolase receptor, an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, and a family of AAA+ ATPase chaperonin-like transcriptional repressor proteins, open up new avenues of investigation on the evolution, biochemistry, and physiology of this pathway and its impacts on a diverse array of developmental processes. However, a mechanistic understanding of the signal transduction pathway for this class of plant growth regulators will remain elusive until the structure and biochemical function of the SL signaling complex are elucidated. Therefore, the main research objectives of this project are to: (1) Study biochemically, structurally, and in planta the functional state of the SL-signaling complex. (2) Reveal the mode of action of AAA+ ATPase chaperonin-like transcriptional repressor proteins, and their role in regulation of SL physiological responses. (3) Elucidate the molecular basis of SL-dependent association with the ubiquitin proteasome system, in particularly with the MAX2 ubiquitin ligase, and the transcriptional repressors, by utilizing structural biology and plant biology approaches. Outcomes of this research may not only close a critical gap in understanding the biology of the SL pathway but may also uncover new paradigms in plant signaling and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using cameras mounted on the robot and a virtual reality headset, a person can see the environment around the robot. However, controlling the robot using existing technologies is hard: there is a time delay because it?s slow to send high quality video over the Internet. In addition, the fidelity of the image is worse than looking through human eyes, with a fixed and narrow view. This proposal will address these limitations by creating a new system which understands the geometry and appearance of the robot?s environment. Instead of sending high-quality video over the Internet, this new system will only send a smaller amount of information about how the environment?s geometry and appearance has changed over time. Further, understanding the geometry and appearance will let us expand the view visible to the person. Overall, these will improve a human?s ability to remotely control the robot by increasing fidelity and responsiveness. We will demonstrate this technology on household tasks, on assembly tasks, and by manipulating small objects.<br/><br/>The aim of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that integrating scene and networking understanding can enable efficient transmission and rendering for dexterous control of remote robots through virtual reality interfaces. This system will result in dexterous teleoperation that enables remote human operators to perform complex tasks with remote robot manipulators, such as cleaning a room or repairing a machine. Such tasks have not previously been demonstrated to be teleoperated for two reasons: 1) lack of an intuitive awareness and understanding of the scene around the remote robot, and 2) lack of an effective low-latency interface to control the robot. We will address these problems by creating new scene- and network-aware algorithms which tightly couple sensing, display, interaction and transmission, enabling the operator to quickly and intuitively understand the environment around the robot. This project will research new interfaces which allow the operator to use their hand to directly specify the robot?s end effector pose in six degrees of freedom, combined with spatial- and semantic-object-based models that allow safe high-level commands. This project will evaluate the proposed system by assessing the speed and accuracy of the remote operator?s ability to complete complex tasks, including assembly tasks; the aim will be to complete unstructured assembly tasks that have never been demonstrated to be remotely teleoperated before.<br/><br/>This project is in response to the NSF Cyber-Physical Systems 20-563 solicitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the prolonged life of these ultra-low-power systems poses a fundamentally new problem. While the devices last for years, programs that run on them become obsolete when the nature of sensory input or the operating conditions change.  The effect of continued execution of such an obsolete program can be catastrophic. For example, if a cardiac pacemaker fails to recognize an impending cardiac arrest because the patient has aged or their physiology has changed, these devices will cause more harm than any good. Hence, being able to react, adapt, and evolve is necessary for these systems to guarantee their accuracy and response time. <br/><br/>This project is aimed at devising algorithms, tools, systems, and applications that will enable ultra-low-power, sensor-enabled, computing devices capable of executing complex machine learning algorithms while being powered solely by harvesting energy.

(1) a personalized air quality index predictor for asthmatic individuals, (2) an ultra-low-power voice assistant that gives voice to everyday objects, and (3) a real-time tracker for shared resources.  <br/><br/>This research will enable smarter and more intelligent microbots and autonomous systems that will help improve healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and the environment. Outcomes of this research bear the potential to transform healthcare through the development of batteryless medical implants and wearable devices that will be able to monitor and learn person-specific physiologic parameters and thus be able to detect anomalies at their onset, which could be the cause of developing the disease. A direct impact of this research is the development of a low-cost, portable, real-time air quality monitor that will transform asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. Hardware and software tools will be open-sourced. Summer research opportunities will be opened up to high school students and undergrads. An Internet of Things-focused curriculum of interdisciplinary courses will be offered to broaden the participation of students from the health informatics program. Participation of women and members of underrepresented groups will be ensured. Outreach activities in collaboration with local makerspaces, a science center, and a high school will be performed to provide research exposure and to increase awareness of energy harvesting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The novel process operates at relatively low temperatures allowing the process to start and stop on demand, thereby enabling seamless integration with intermittent renewable resources, like solar and wind energy.  The process can use widely available low-grade iron ores not commonly used in steelmaking today due to high impurity content. Furthermore, the process uses only iron ore and renewable electricity as a feedstock. Thus, the process plant is easily co-located with mining operations to eliminate the logistics and carbon emissions from shipping iron ore, supporting the domestic iron and steelmaking industries. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the feasibility of a novel carbon dioxide emission-free iron-making process. The proposed solution leverages intermittent renewable energy to convert iron ore to iron metal via an electrochemical process.  The objectives of this project are to 1) develop a process to convert the solid iron ore to a liquid electrolyte suitable for efficient iron extraction in a subsequent step, 2) demonstrate high faradaic efficiency for materials regeneration in a continuous closed-loop process, 3) build a novel electrochemical device with total specific energy consumption comparable to the energy intensity of the conventional process. The approach combines a fundamental understanding of iron ore dissolution kinetics with a novel electrochemical regeneration scheme to enhance iron ore dissolution and enable efficient iron extraction. The project will seek to understand the impact of key process variables and iron ore impurities on performance and stability. It is anticipated that the core innovation will lead to a novel process of reducing iron ore to high-purity iron for steelmaking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rare earth elements are essential for inorganic phosphors used in commercial LED products. Even though the REEs are currently available; They are geographically unevenly distributed, so their availability is susceptible to various factors, such as social and political constraints, environmental regulations and economics, and thus, a high degree of uncertainty exists in their future availability. As a result, inorganic phosphors present an inherent risk to the long-term commercial viability and utility of LED lighting. Moreover, there exists an opportunity to improve the efficiency and light quality performance of existing inorganic phosphors. Improvements could result in reduced electricity consumption, which could lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions considering the wide application of LEDs. In addition to direct impacts on visual performance, light quality affects human mood and behavior. Improved light quality may lead to elevated mental states, sharpened alertness, and boosted productivity. <br/><br/>The proposed project develops an eco-friendly method to synthesize organic phosphors using an abundant natural product in place of rare earth elements, at a commercially competitive cost. The final product, a phosphor-imbed sheet, can be integrated into lighting products as the outer cover and achieve enhanced efficiency and color quality compared to rare earth element-derived inorganic phosphors. The team is the first to report the syntheses of highly fluorescent organic phosphors from theobromine, a molecule derived from cacao beans, through direct arylation. Using an abundant, non-toxic natural product and advanced green chemistry allows the research group to produce the desired organic phosphors at both reduced cost and environmental impacts. Moreover, introducing theobromine to organic phosphors enhances their ambient stability, which is essential for LEDs given their long lifetime. The synthetic and molecular design challenges the common conception that organic phosphors are expensive and unstable. Dr. Luscombe and her students recently developed theobromine-derived phosphors offering efficiency and light quality performance that exceeds most commercial products. Their next steps will focus on further enhancing the stability of the theobromine-derived phosphors through molecular optimization and encapsulation designs, aiming to narrow or eliminate the gap between lab research and a commercial product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the World Bank has invested billions of dollars in community-driven development, which emphasizes the participation of beneficiaries in decision making around development projects. Direct democracy, especially in the form of participatory budgeting, has spread across the globe. One motivation for promoting participation is the idea that by participating in decision making related to a local public good, participants will feel more compelled to invest in the maintenance of that good. In turn, public goods will provide more benefit to the community if they are well-maintained and last longer. Political theorists, too, have posed the question: does participation ?make better citizens?? An even more important question for policy makers is: which kinds of participation manage to do so? This research evaluates the influence of participatory mechanisms on behavioral outcomes in one county in a developing country. The results of the study inform the ongoing design of participatory institutions in that country, other countries on that continent, and around the world; there are more than 11,000 participatory budgeting programs and programs are expanding far more quickly than evidence can keep pace. The results of this study thus are immediately useful to governments and advocates of participatory institutions as they design, adopt, and expand public participation in pursuit of development.<br/><br/>The research uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of common participatory processes on individual willingness to invest in local public goods, such as a well, a health clinic, or solar array. The RCT takes place in 90 communities, where the researchers provide all villages with a local public good. The method of selecting a good for each community is randomly assigned to involve either: (a) preference aggregation through consultation, (b) preference aggregation through voting at a public meeting, or (c) consensus-building through deliberative discussion.The research team randomly recruits villagers to attend these meetings and surveys them on their attitudes and behaviors surrounding participation and development projects before and after the meetings. The researchers return 1 year later to measure the state of the public good and the participants? updated attitudes and behaviors. The researchers then leverage their strategy of random assignment of meeting rules and random selection of participants to compare villages across space and over time to identify the effects of the decision-making process on participants? selection and maintenance of the public good. This study thus provides rigorous evidence to inform future program design and investment in participatory institutions for development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, the project aims to leverage the texture and flavor of mushroom mycelia, and supplement this with recombinant muscle proteins to further enhance the taste and nutritional profiles and overcome many of the shortcomings of existing plant-based meat products. To date the concept of combining recombinant muscle protein and single cell protein is novel and has not been reported. Large gaps persist between plant-based and lab-grown meat, with regards to cost and consumer experience. Plant-based meat is more affordable but faces consumer resistance due to sub-optimal texture and nutritional profiles, while cultivated meat offers a consumer experience similar to that of animal meat but at a much higher cost. Towards this goal, muscle protein genes will be expressed in a microbial host and enzymatically cross-linked with vegetable protein to produce protein fibers that can be formulated into synthetic meat.

These applications require a large data storage system that is fast, elastic, cost-effective, and easy-to-use. Unfortunately, current cloud storage offerings are unable to satisfy all of these requirements: big data analytics applications can run up to 500X slower when they run as a cloud-native application using a cloud object store; provisioning more cloud storage resources does not solve the performance problem and storage over-provisioning leads to millions of dollars of extra cost. This project rethinks the design and implementation of next-generation, cloud-native storage infrastructures via a new approach. This approach is enabled by a novel take on the serverless computing paradigm -- serverless functions are elastic and truly pay-per-use, making them a fast and inexpensive storage medium. This project aims to build InfiniStore, a new cloud storage system, which elastically scales in response to constantly changing data access patterns by orchestrating the collective memory of serverless functions. Following an end-to-end, stacked approach, this project will develop an elastic and inexpensive memory store using serverless functions, techniques that provide strong consistency guarantees for data replicated in serverless functions, fault tolerance mechanisms to maximize the data availability in highly unreliable serverless environments, and a scalable serverless file metadata service to support file semantics.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to redefine cloud storage pricing models -- InfiniStore enables memory-store-level pay-per-access that lets cloud users pay for the data they access. This project will enable, in a broad range of disciplines, the development of new, stateful, serverless applications that have not been previously possible. All artifacts will be open source to support the use and development both in academia and industry. This project has an integrated educational plan, which also harnesses serverless computing but uses it to develop a new serverless notebook cloud service, called InfiniCloud, for interdisciplinary education. InfiniCloud will allow educators and students to write and run serial or parallel Python programs at any scale, without needing to manage servers or clusters. Moreover, this project will use InfiniStore and InfiniCloud as a basis for various educational activities including curriculum development, diversity building, undergraduate engagement, and workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In North America, the oceanic Pacific plate is subducting beneath the south coast of Alaska, generating powerful earthquakes and active volcanoes on Earth?s surface. But where inside the Earth does this subducted plate then go? Tracking this plate into the Earth tells us about the more recent history of plate movement on the surface over millions of years, as well as how the Earth has evolved since it formed over billions of years. To understand the present, we must investigate the past.  Much like ultrasound waves are used to look at organs inside a body, seismologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to investigate the inner workings of the Earth. The sharpness or blurriness of the images is controlled, among others, by the pitch (or frequency) of the waves that are used. Higher frequencies improve the focus but require heavy computations in the whole Earth. Assumptions can be used to simplify the calculations, reducing the heavy computations to the part of the Earth that we want to image. This simplification means that we can improve our focus and better track the history of subduction under Alaska. The study will support the training of a graduate student and provide support for an early-career investigator.  The PIs will share codes and models with the community, and will be involved in local outreach in the Bay Area.<br/><br/>The evolution of Alaska over the past 200 Ma features multiple episodes of subduction, collision and accretion. The remnants of this long subduction history should be present down to the lowermost mantle, but past regional and global tomographic models resolve inconsistent structures, likely owing to methodological limitations and limited sampling. Our understanding of the plate tectonics history of the Northern Pacific is currently incomplete. Remaining questions include: how deep do slabs penetrate beneath Alaska, what is the slab geometry and thickness, and how does it interact with the transition zone?  The primary objective of this proposal is to improve the resolution of whole mantle regional seismic images beneath Alaska using a Full Waveform Inversion method applied within a restricted region, referred to as ?box? tomography. Full Waveform Inversion is required to account for the effects of multipathing and wavefront healing that otherwise mask strong and local heterogeneity, such as slabs and surrounding mantle wedges. Moreover, the spatially restricted ?box? approach couples a fast 1D and slower 3D wavefield solver thus reducing computation time, which enables the team to use higher frequency regional and teleseismic body waves. Using a combination of 3-component surface wave, overtone and body waveforms, a shear velocity model will first be constructed. Increasing the maximum frequency of the computations as iterations progress, and with additional body waveforms sensitive to compressional velocity, compressional velocity images will be obtained. This analysis will significantly sharpen existing images of seismic wavespeeds and radial anisotropy, particularly at transition zone depths and the mid and lower mantle.  These higher resolution tomographic images of the mantle beneath Alaska will help to (1) constrain the history of subduction and mantle dynamics in this region, and (2) compute more accurate mantle corrections for core phases observed on polar paths from the south Sandwich Islands to stations in Alaska, which present a particularly large spread of travel time anomalies, at least part of which is likely due to Alaska slab structure. The results of the work will be of interest to geodynamicists for modeling flow in the mantle beneath subduction zones, and in plate motion reconstructions, by allowing better identification of subducted slabs. It will also be of interest to geodynamicists and mineral physicists investigating the pattern and origin of inner core anisotropy. Moreover, a robust, high resolution tomographic model of Alaska and a method for providing corrections for its effects will improve the utility of the USArray stations in Alaska for other deep Earth studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Designing faster and more reliable data analysis algorithms is a key challenge in broadening the scope of such applications. However, researchers have realized that the classical framework of algorithm design is inadequate for this task. This is because large data in almost every application is modeled using statistical models as opposed to the standard worst-case model used in algorithm design. Consequently, central challenges that involve an interplay between algorithms and statistically generated data remain widely unresolved not just in machine learning but also in statistical physics and cryptography. This project will address this critical deficiency by building a principled theory of algorithm design for statistical (aka average-case) data. The new paradigms explored in this work will unify the currently fragmented set of approaches for studying average-case computation. The curriculum development plan outlined in this project will train the next generation of scientists in the algorithmic methods tailor-made for problems in large scale statistical data analysis and disseminate the modern paradigms for understanding computation to both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Average-case complexity is a central thrust in the theory of computation with a direct impact on potential technological advances in machine learning and cryptography as well as basic questions in statistical physics. Examples include training expressive statistical models such as Gaussian mixture models and Sparse PCA to find patterns in large data in machine learning, ascertaining the security of pseudo-random generators in cryptography, and finding the lowest-energy states of spin-glass systems in statistical physics. Our current understanding of such problems is based on fragmented, domain-specific algorithmic schemes such as statistical query methods and method of moments (in machine learning), belief propagation (in statistical physics), and semidefinite programming hierarchies (in computational complexity). This project is devoted to building a unified theory of average-case computation that offers new tools to design better algorithms, prove sharp lower-bounds, and allow rigorously transferring insights between different specific frameworks. This investigation will build new bridges between theoretical computer science and several adjacent areas including machine learning, statistical physics, algebraic geometry, and probability. In addition, it will further develop the burgeoning understanding of the sum-of-squares semidefinite programming hierarchy, mixture models, and use of solution-space geometry in solving random constraint satisfaction problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ICT companies are at the same time continuously developing new approaches to advance online safety, security, and privacy. The shortage of cybersecurity professionals creates risks for both national and homeland security. These risks are exacerbated by the lack of diversity among cybersecurity professionals. Cybersecurity education programs that meet the needs of a more diverse group of students and can be easily implemented by educators are needed. These programs need to expose students to cybersecurity starting in the middle-school years when they begin to solidify their academic and other identities. By enhancing the knowledge of cybersecurity and positive motivation, such programs could lead to potential future interest in cybersecurity careers, thus creating a pipeline for a robust and diverse cybersecurity workforce. This project will formulate, design, and prototype innovative mixed-reality (MR) learning content to make cybersecurity concepts concrete and engaging for middle school students. The work will be guided by an interdisciplinary team of scholars from the University of Delaware and involves partnerships with the Delaware Chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association, local schools and districts. The project is intended to directly impact 10 middle school teachers and approximately 350 students including students with disabilities through the design, pilot, and implementation efforts.<br/><br/>The project is guided by three goals: (1) iteratively design a set of concrete and interactive MR activities addressing key cybersecurity concepts (e.g., steganography, phishing, and firewalls) with teacher and student input throughout the design process; (2) increase student knowledge of key cybersecurity concepts, understanding of the importance of cybersecurity, and interest in cybersecurity careers; and (3) produce a set of design principles for MR activities in computing. MR activities will be iteratively refined based on observations, teacher interviews, and student survey feedback. Short pre-pilots will test the usability of the materials and provide teachers a classroom context to evaluate success. A final pilot will be conducted in middle school classrooms utilizing a pre/posttest design with assessments of student cybersecurity learning and motivation. Based on the wide attention on cybersecurity in the workforce, this work will help create new models for K-12 cybersecurity education while exposing students to new and emerging technologies. The research instruments, assessment tools, and outcomes of this work will be disseminated through workshops, publications, presentations, and a web portal. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vaccine and drug development efforts are underway, but the efficacy of these treatments and their safety particularly for high-risk populations remain a concern. The proposed project is an anti-viral inhaler that delivers a natural immune defense salivary protein that blocks the activity of a molecule essential for viral replication in the lung. The candidate therapeutic will potentially be a safer treatment option for people with compromised health. The sustainability of this treatment relies on three factors. First, the therapeutic targets a viral genome replication process. Thus, this targeted technology will not be compromised by virus mutations and will maintain its efficacy against current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Second, it does not require clinical administration and is thus more easily accessible by patients. Third, the treatment has potential as an broad anti-viral therapy.<br/><br/>The proposed project will validate a novel anti-viral treatment against SARS-CoV-2.  First, the anti-viral action will be validated in a cell-based model that mimics human lung infected with coronavirus, alveolar epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Next, an in vivo model will be used to confirm that the therapy can reach the virus target site in the lung, undergo uptake by the alveolar epithelial cells and avoid the barriers of pulmonary delivery (e.g. mucus, pulmonary enzymes or macrophages). Finally, this project will confirm that the therapy does not elicit a pro-inflammatory response and toxicity in lung cells, so it can be safely given to people with compromised health without exacerbating their immune response. The treatment will be delivered by inhalation and ultimately become a therapeutic and prophylactic anti-viral inhaler.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With increases in frequency, severity, and levels of impact from extreme weather events,there is an imperative need to innovate equipping rural communities for greater preparedness and resilience. However, services provided by community organizations often lack spatial granularity,academic research products often ignore long-term sustainability and commercial products are often not designed for rural areas as profits margins are low. In this project, we will initiate an engagement-driven collaboration among academic researchers, community/civic partners and stakeholders to create scalable,sustainable, transferable and hyper-local services to assist rural communities with preparing for and recovering from extreme weather-related hazards and natural disasters. Designed for rural communities explicitly, our model is transferable to the rest of the US by leveraging the national Cooperative Extension system, Extension Disaster Education Network and transportation technology transfer centers. As rural communities supply food and water, the benefits from this collaboration also flow to suburban and urban systems that are dependent upon rural areas. Furthermore, the main intellectual contribution from this project is physically inspired computer vision (CV). This work will significantly advance CV for meteorological applications by estimating vertical profiles of horizontal wind speeds. If successful, this transformative approach will greatly enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts worldwide, far beyond the extreme weather forecast we focus on in this project.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the agricultural sector in New York (NY) state and the local-level transportation/energy infrastructures that support it. The main objectives are (1) to test technological feasibility, financial sustainability and social acceptance of the envisioned hyper-local services, and (2) to identify and integrate human/organizational resources towards creating an engagement hub for rural community resiliency to extreme weather. Teaming with civic and community partners across NY, we aim at three major innovations: turning a conventional camera into a low-cost, easy-to-deploy and highly accurate weather station and vertical profiler; developing IoT-based sensing packages to bridge critical data gaps; and optimizing a numerical model for hyper-local extreme weather forecasts using a genetic algorithm and machine learning techniques. Then we will test the effectiveness of integrating these innovations by creating a prototype hyper-local service to improve winter storm emergency response for local highway departments in rural communities. Leveraging existing programs and connections, the team will apply various participatory action research tools and mechanisms with partners to promote effective collaborations.

In current clinical practice, neuro-interventionalists cannot guarantee good outcomes, such as the successful healing of intracranial aneurysms immediately following treatment by an endovascular device. In such cases, treated patients have to wait a minimum of 3-6 months before their aneurysm is reassessed on medical imaging and the clinician decides if re-treatment is necessary. During this critical time, patients are still at risk of an aneurysm rupture, which may cause disastrous hemorrhagic strokes. Furthermore, if re-treatment is needed, the additional procedures have higher risk to the patient, and put further financial burden on hospitals and insurance companies. The proposed technology, a digital companion to medical imaging, can predict problem cases intra-procedurally, so that they may be immediately rectified, thus avoiding potential ruptures and reducing rates of re-treatments from 30% to 5%.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a software tool to analyze intracranial aneurysm (IA) hemodynamics and predict long-term treatment outcomes using quantitative angiographic imaging. This is a completely autonomous method that rapidly performs three tasks for each angiogram. First, artificial intelligence (AI)-based detection and segmentation of the aneurysm dome are performed with a Dice coefficient of 0.84. Next, physics-based quantitative angiographic parameters related to the nature of blood flow are automatically extracted from the aneurysm dome. High correlation is observed with parameters extracted by a human expert (Pearson correlation of 0.87) but the technology is 1,000 times faster. Finally, the parameters are input into an AI prediction algorithm to predict 6-month occlusion probability (successful treatment), which has an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 77%. This prototype software is designed to be seamlessly integrated into the imaging suite and provide a prediction in under 1 second. This software is 10?20 times faster than current methods, which involve neuro-interventionalists leaving the operating suite, loading the images on a separate workstation, and then analyzing the device placement with respect to the aneurysm. Moreover, the current time-consuming method does not provide information regarding the future healing of the aneurysm with treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current approaches are time-consuming, labor-intensive and low-throughput. Investing in these approaches is therefore relatively high-risk for most investigators and are most often employed only for proteins with well-defined functions. This technology represents a rapid and scalable method for protein labeling, allowing investigators to include a broader range of proteins of interest (POIs) in a given study. By reducing the initial investment required, both academic and industry investigators are likely to expand the POIs included in a given study. Our expectation is that the scalability and flexibility of this method will accelerate drug screening and development activities, revealing more promising lead candidates. <br/> <br/>The proposed project will advance translation of the homology-independent universal genome engineering (HiUGE) method, developed as a means of evaluating a broad range of proteins in neural function and development.

Pairing these vectors with the genome-wide library under development during this project will allow the company to rapidly provide cell lines expressing proteins of interest with customized modifications, all under endogenous promoter control. The specific goal of this project is to develop a scalable, high-throughput screening platform using the technology to label every protein encoded by the human genome. Technical tasks include: identify gene specific-gRNA sequences for all coding regions, searching and prioritizing insertion sites both at the N- and C-terminal regions of all proteins using defined criteria; develop a pilot scale screening library, comprising cells with HiUGE insertion sites in 96 genes of interest; apply new automation resources to scale for all 20,000 protein-encoding genes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These differences may arise due to firms? prior experience with similar projects or how farther along a firm is in R&D process. Firms have an incentive to learn what their rivals know. While learning about rivals? progress may be easier in some industries such as pharmaceuticals due to reporting regulations, it is challenging in other industries as firms protect their R&D specific information.  The project is centered around three major research questions. First, the project explores firm incentives to share private information with others and its impact on the society. Second, the research examines whether firms should make R&D progress public or not. Third, the project looks at the reasons behind why startups focus on radical innovations and new products whereas established firms tend to pursue incremental innovations and improvements to existing products. The project has policy and regulatory implications in understanding the role of information asymmetry and information sharing on R&D activities for startups and established firms.<br/><br/>This research focuses on R&D races where rivals have asymmetric information about the feasibility of the project. The project explores three issues. First, if firms can commit to be truthful, then the benefits of better information to a firm seem to outweigh competitive concerns. Although firms should have an incentive to share what they know, this decreases the probability of success and is detrimental from a social perspective. Second, firms can invest more in R&D if they do not share R&D progress publicly as information on a rival abandoning a line of research has a strong discouragement effect on others. Third, the observed regularity about incremental and radical innovations can be explained in terms of information: Smaller startup firms can usually observe the R&D activity of larger, established firms better than the other way around, which affects risk taking behavior. This project studies these issues in a rich setting incorporating imperfect monitoring of R&D activity by firms, capital constraints and intellectual capital.

Improvements in efficiency and power density of electric motors can also reduce the amount and types of pollutants emitted into the environment. Manufacturing design modifications aimed to improve the performance of electric motors can be a nightmare with conventional manufacturing techniques. 3D printing technologies offer unique versatility in size, shape and diversity of materials, promoting flexibility in motor design that is presently unavailable with conventional manufacturing technologies. To create the next generation of high performance electric motors, 3D printing can be used to strategically deposit material during motor manufacturing similar to the way spiders strategically deposit silk in key areas to optimize web design. Spiders use diversity in web silks to build a more structurally sound web. The variability of the silk properties is the strength of the web and enable it to perform its intended task more efficiently. Likewise, 3D printing allows motor designers to manufacture lightweight, robust motors.  This proposed project aims to stretch the imagination beyond conventional electric motor design to inform creation of new design rules and materials by adopting aspects of the inclusion based diversity in design used by spiders. The proposed project extends these concepts to strengthen the pipeline of talent in engineering as well. An integral part of the proposed project includes faculty-mentored undergraduate research experiences, as well as, development of inexpensive, project-based, pre-college basic physics courses for both in-person and virtual delivery. Virtual delivery will facilitate participation of students from underserved domestic communities and those on other continents. <br/><br/>Electric motor performance is dependent upon its design, properties of its materials and the processes used in manufacturing. Conventional manufacturing techniques place a ceiling on power density and inhibits production of more compact motor designs. Moreover, the inclusion of intricate design features that enhance motor performance is complex with conventional (subtractive and powder metallurgy) techniques. 3D printing (additive manufacturing) can potentially overcome many of the challenges that currently limit realization of many novel electrical machine designs. This proposed project will consider the capabilities of 3D printing, which mimic the intuits of a spider, which include material diversification, consideration for resources and environment as well as optimization of energy input without sacrificing functionality. The specific research goals of the proposed project are to rethink the use of homogeneous electrical steel in the design of stators and rotors and explore the capabilities of non-homogenous electrical steels for multi-material 3D printed magnetic cores. Topology optimization techniques are excellent options for exploring this uncharted territory; however, a model of the electric motor is required for accurate computation of the machine performance characteristics. Subdomain models will be developed to include local and spatial material heterogeneities. Each subdomain will include variations in thermal, mechanical, electrical and magnetic properties of the material (magnetic, conductive and dielectric). Exploration of optimization algorithms, including social spider optimization, genetic algorithms, and gradient methods, is required to select the algorithm that best handles multiple objectives, multiple variables, and multiple physics. Regression analysis, sensitivity analysis and analysis of variance will extract new design rules. Additive manufacturing processes in design of electric motors have not been adequately explored in literature or the engineering industry. The research activity will provide a broad knowledge base and advance the development of electric machines that capitalize on the benefits of additive manufacturing without sacrificing performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, current state-of-the-art ML algorithms still heavily rely on having a human in the loop in order to work properly. Indeed, the training process of a ML algorithm requires significant human intervention through twisting and tuning of the many knobs of the algorithm. Moreover, most of the time this tweaking process is carried out without any theoretical guidelines. The most common options for the ML practitioners are to follow their intuitions or to exhaustively evaluate all the possibilities, making the overall time needed to train these algorithms difficult to predict. In this project, the investigator aims at designing truly parameter-free training algorithms for ML, to remove the burden of human parameter-tuning and make ML algorithms more scalable. The investigator also proposes an Education Plan that is designed to fill the gap between theoretical and applied ML in the minds of most students. It will involve a collaboration with the PROgram in Mathematics for Young Scientists (PROMYS), to introduce the study of very basic concepts of the theory of machine learning to both high school students and teachers, and with the women?s Smith College.<br/><br/>The project stems from new methods the investigator has recently introduced to design optimal parameter-free optimization algorithms, e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent without learning rates, for the particular case of convex functions. In this project, the investigator proposes to go beyond convex functions.  In particular, the investigator plans to pursue the following inter-related aims:<br/>1. Computational complexity of learning without prior knowledge. The objective is to fully characterize the computational complexity of learning, without assuming knowledge of unknown quantities, in worst and ""easy"" cases. In other words, if a learning algorithm needs parameters to achieve optimal performance, the goal is to fully characterize the overall computational complexity, including the search for the optimal parameters.<br/>2. Non-convex stochastic optimization without parameters. The project's goal is to generalize recent results on parameter-free optimization to deal with the non-convex problems in modern ML algorithms.

It is essential for faithful genetic inheritance in animals, plants, and single-celled eukaryotes such as algae. The size, composition and cellular manufacture of the telomerase complex varies dramatically across diverse eukaryotic taxonomic groups.  This variation makes telomerase an outstanding model system for examining the evolution of enzymes that are complexes comprised of both protein and RNA.   In 2019, the two PIs identified the RNA component of plant telomerase, making it possible to ask new questions about the evolution of this critical enzyme in eukaryotic groups in addition to animals and plants.  The collaborative proposal intends to explore the components and structure of telomerases from single-celled eukaryotes that are photosynthetic but belong to different taxonomic groups than plants.  The proposed work also includes workshops  on scientific leadership and negotiation for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, provides research opportunities for diverse undergraduates to learn about scientific discovery in evolutionary biology, structural biology and genetics, and provides scientific and educational communities with a curated free database about diverse telomerase enzymes.  <br/><br/>More specifically, this research addresses a knowledge gap presented by the highly divergent structures of ciliate, plant, and vertebrate telomerase enzymes despite their conserved essential function.   By revealing the composition and architecture of telomerase from photosynthetic organisms, novel accessory factors and new modes of RNA-protein interaction may be uncovered. In addition, the transcription of the RNA component of telomerases is different in animals and plants; plant telomerase RNA is transcribed by RNA Pol III while in animals the telomerase RNA is transcribed by RNA Pol II and requires the protein dyskerin. The proposed research will investigate the unexpected observation that dyskerin is also needed for transcription of plant telomerase RNA even though it is catalyzed by different transcription nanomachines.  Expanding analysis of telomerase structure and function beyond land plants to the basal-branching photosynthetic eukaryotes provides a unique opportunity to reveal the ancestral features of the first telomerase.  More broadly, comprehensive analysis of telomerase structure, function and evolution will help to establish fundamental rules underlying the biomolecular transition from an RNA world to cellular life that primarily uses protein-based catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is evidence that social characteristics, like a speaker's age, gender, and so forth, can shift how listeners respond to their speech. For example, ambiguous sounding words are recognized quicker and more accurately when matched with pictures of speakers who are likely to say those words, and changing a visual cue about a speaker while keeping the audio constant can change listeners' judgments of what they heard. An unanswered question is whether social information is directly affecting perception, or if it is only affecting later decision-making. This study investigates how listeners use social cues in real-time by measuring the cues' influence on the earliest stages of speech perception. This is critical to our understanding of the role of social information during speech perception and will further develop our models of human language processing. Additionally, a more robust understanding of how social and acoustic cues interact may lead to the development of targeted therapies for certain types of language disorders.<br/><br/>Previous work has demonstrated that social cues can directly shift categorization behavior, but the paradigms used in the majority of this work do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the specific time-course of social and acoustic cue integration. The specific time-course of this process is critical to debates over the nature of linguistic representation (episodic vs. abstract) and processing (feed-forward vs. interactive models). This study investigates the following questions: whether social cues can influence on-line perception as detected via eye-tracking during (a) a Ganong task and (b) a compensation for coarticulation task, and (c) whether social cues can induce selective adaptation effects in perception. The data from these experiments will directly address questions of the time-course of speech perception and inform debates over the representations and structures of models of speech perception.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the winter months, the water is near the freezing point and contains high concentrations of nutrients. As the sun returns in the spring, these nutrients spur large phytoplankton blooms that in turn support much of the marine life. It has recently been hypothesized that, in addition to the remote source via the Bering Strait, nutrients can be mixed into the water locally from the sediments of the Chukchi shelf. This happens when there are small openings in the ice during winter that quickly re-freeze. This process makes the surface water denser, which then sinks to the bottom and stirs up the nutrients. From December 2020 to February 2021, the US Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star will be conducting a mission in the Chukchi Sea, which offers a rare opportunity to collect measurements of the water during this critical time of the year. We propose to outfit the ship with an easy-to-use portable system whereby expendable probes are launched twice daily to obtain profiles of temperature and salt content. This study will reveal how and where the cold water is being transformed.  By comparing these winter data with measurements collected the previous fall and following spring by other oceanographic expeditions, we can better understand the role of the near-freezing winter water in the Arctic ecosystem. The results from the Polar Star cruise will be incorporated into an existing community outreach program that engages local communities. <br/><br/>Pacific-origin winter water that flows northward through the Bering Strait is the predominant source of nutrients that spur the large productivity occurring each spring on the Chukchi Sea shelf. During its transit across the shelf during the cold months of the year, the winter water can undergo modification when subject to coastal polynyas. Recently it has been argued that this water mass transformation also takes place in small leads throughout the entire Chukchi shelf. If true, this has significant consequences for the regional ecosystem, since the convective overturning can readily reach the bottom and mix nitrate from the sediments into the water column. The recent decision for the USCG Polar Star to conduct a mission in the Chukchi Sea from December 2020 to February 2021 offers an extraordinary opportunity to collect profiles during the very time that the water mass transformation takes place. This proposal seeks funds to outfit the Polar Star with two easy-to-use portable systems for launching temperature/salinity probes twice daily. This will provide a rare view of winter water formation and transformation, including the degree to which it occurs, the atmospheric forcing, and the pathways of the newly ventilated water. Comparing the winter data to measurements collected in the previous fall and following spring/summer will enable us to determine the evolution and fate of the cold, high-nutrient water and better understand its role in the regional ecosystem. The investigator will be chief scientist on one of the summer cruises ? an NSF funded field program in the Chukchi Sea in August 2021 that entails a broadscale hydrographic survey of the shelf. As part of that effort, an outreach program will be carried out including a PolarTREC teacher and visits to local communities. The results from the Polar Star winter cruise will be incorporated into this outreach program to provide a broader context for the summertime measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All visible matter is made up of two components, heavy nuclei surrounded by much lighter electrons. The slow-moving nuclei are often assumed to respond weakly to the electrons hurtling around them. This premise is the cornerstone of modern simulation techniques in both physics and chemistry. However, extreme environments, such as in the center of planets and stars, create incredibly hot dense matter.  This results in fast-moving electrons that begin to strongly interact with the slow-moving nuclei, challenging previous assumptions. This award supports experimental work at some of the world's largest lasers, including the National Ignition Facility - the world's most energetic laser. The harsh astrophysical conditions will be recreated on Earth to measure the nuclei dynamics in regimes where data is scarce. Measurements of fundamental quantities, including particle diffusion and sound speed, will be used to validate state-of-the-art quantum mechanical simulations.  The project will help train the next generation of scientists by offering education and research opportunities to the global plasma community.  The education and outreach will focus on providing underrepresented students access to and training in high-performance computing techniques.<br/><br/>Simulations of dense plasmas typically employ the adiabatic approximation, usually justified through the disparate energy scales of the electron and ion motion. The electrons are assumed to instantaneously adjust to the ion fields, while the ions are confined to a single adiabatic surface. Recent approaches that go beyond this approximation have led to significant differences in the predictions of plasma properties, with a dearth of experimental measurements preventing discrimination between competing models. This research program will employ a new experimental platform, developed for the Omega and NIF laser facilities, to perform the first measurement of diffusion in the warm dense matter regime. This platform will employ Fresnel Diffractive Radiography, a novel diagnostic technique for laser-driven X-rays that measures the slow, diffusion-driven changes in density gradients with exceptional spatial resolution. The experimental work is supported by predictions of the diffusion coefficient using new advanced simulations that incorporate the electron dynamics within a complex, quantum-mechanical framework.  These simulations will be conducted by undergraduate students and performed with support from the University of Nevada, Reno High-Performance Computing team.  The primary research goal is to clearly discriminate between plasma models with fundamentally different approaches to non-adiabaticity.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This allows researchers to understand these identities in light of their history, complexity, and relationships to each other. However, the practical application and use of social identities as socially constructed ?objects of study? is uncommon in some fields of social science research. This project examines the research practices of experimental social psychologists. These researchers typically study the impact of the social environment on human behavior in a controlled laboratory setting. Despite some criticism, many social psychologists treat social identity categories as fixed, discrete objects to study them experimentally. These same types of studies are also criticized for other reasons, including lack of replicability and ease of fabrication. This project will investigate how social psychologists characterize and use social identity categories in their work, which may provide useful insights to address these critiques. Further, this research is important because the results of social psychology studies exert influence over decision-making in education, social and public policy, and the law. <br/><br/>The primary objectives are to: 1) investigate the theories informing how social identity groups are understood and utilized in experiments, 2) analyze the methods research teams in social psychology use to select their focus of study; 3) offer first-hand accounts of how researchers? identities affect their research products; and 4) analyze the impact and reach of social psychological experimental data. To meet these objectives, I will conduct ethnographic observations, interviews, and content analyses. Observations will allow documentation and analysis of social psychology researchers? processes and practices in the laboratory. It will also illuminate how disciplinary culture and training affect the use of social identity. Interviews will lead to deeper understanding of the connection between researchers and their objects of study, and of how researchers view theories of social identity. Tracking and analysis of highly cited studies and the public presence of research findings (e.g., a lab?s social media postings) will form proxies of the societal impact of the research being studied. Ultimately, this project aims to improve the science of social identity and illuminate the ways information about certain social groups, which gets produced through scientific practice, shapes how those groups are characterized in public domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those attacks exploit the fact that software, when executing on modern processors, leaves traces on microarchitecture structures, and the traces can reveal private user information. Current defenses against microarchitectural side-channel attacks aim to reduce information leakage but unavoidably incur performance overhead, because they lose the capability of fully exploiting performance optimizations in computing systems. This project will develop a toolset to enable productive trade-offs between security and performance in mitigating microarchitectural side-channel attacks.<br/><br/>The project tackles fundamental research problems in designing, evaluating, and using channel obfuscation techniques. The technical approach is to frame microarchitectural side channels, a computer architecture security problem, as a communication problem, and constructs quantitative channel models for microarchitectural structures. The first project thrust constructs the quantitative channel models, characterizing and quantifying the impacts of complex hardware events. The second thrust uses the channel models to measure the information leakage of the applications running on obfuscated architectures. The third thrust explores co-design channel obfuscation techniques with existing mitigation and detection solutions.<br/><br/>The project will develop a toolset to mitigate microarchitectural side-channel attacks efficiently. The toolset can benefit a wide range of people who design, manage, and use computing systems, including computer architects, system administrators, and software developers. In addition, this project will initiate an effort on course offerings in the area of hardware security at Massachusetts of Technology. This project will also offer research opportunities to undergraduate students and under-represented minorities. <br/><br/>This project will store all publications, code, and data-sets on public-facing websites, hosted at Massachusetts of Technology for at least 3 years after the end of the project.

The soft sensor adheres to the body wherever a pulse is palpable and measures the arterial expansion on the surface of the skin as a pulse wave traverses the artery. Soft sensor technology leverages the highly elastic properties of micro-nanostructure wrinkled electronic thin films developed using a novel shrinking fabrication process. Preliminary results using these soft wearable sensors established high correlation to the gold standard arterial line.

To feed the growing world population (estimated 9.8 billion by 2050), global food production must increase by 70%, while reducing impact on land use, the environment, and ecosystems. However, high salinity conditions and drought have reduced the potential yield of crops; furthermore, the excessive application of fertilizers is disrupting global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, reducing biodiversity, and causing aquatic pollution. This project will develop a technology to promote crop growth through improved stress tolerance and nutrient acquisition. The adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices could help farmers in increasing their profitability and reduce costs. This project will offer an effective solution to 570 million farms around the world for food production. By improving crop yield, the project could help address the economic loss of more than $27 billion/year in the US due to unproductive farmland. <br/><br/>The proposed project will generate innovative endophyte-based formulations for seed treatments to improve tolerance to abiotic stress. Seeds will be coated with a mixture of highly characterized safe (non-pathogenic) endophytic bacteria and yeast strains in formulation with selected osmoprotectants and prebiotics that improve the survivability and efficacy of the selected microbes. The bio-inoculants will improve crop tolerance to salinity stress while supporting nitrogen fixation and mineral nutrient acquisition. This project will validate the feasibility of this approach on treatments for selected vegetable seeds. First efforts will be dedicated to obtaining stable seed treatment formulations with a high shelf-life when used at scale in parallel with fungicide and insecticide treatments. The ability of bio-inoculant formulations to increase tolerance to salinity will be validated in the greenhouse.

The researchers will take advantage of existing quantitative genetics tests that can distinguish between natural selection and neutral evolutionary processes using morphological data that are informative about chewing biomechanics and brain size. The researchers will measure 3D models generated from surface scans of fossils from three major groups of Plio-Pleistocene hominins: Paranthropus, Australopithecus and early Homo. In addition, measurements from extant species will be used to model population patterns of trait variation and covariation as proxies for the extinct species. The extent of trait variation and covariation are key parameters influencing the ability of a population to respond to natural selection, as well as the manner in which populations change due to random processes like genetic drift.

During the last decade, significant research on numerous physical quantum systems has been pursued, with much progress towards the realization of high-performance, commercial quantum systems. However, the state of the developing quantum technology ecosystem will significantly benefit from focused advanced manufacturing research based on the specific challenges to realizing high-performance quantum systems. This project supports a two-day virtual workshop designed to disseminate information on the state of the art of different quantum system technologies, to identify and assess key challenges and opportunities in quantum system manufacturing and, ultimately, to invigorate and engage the community of researchers implementing quantum systems towards achieving manufacturing goals. Fundamental research in quantum manufacturing will revitalize American manufacturing, grow national prosperity and workforce, and reshape strategic industries.<br/><br/><br/>Quantum systems are based on the processing of quantum bits, or qubits, which can be realized in numerous two-state quantum systems, such as atomic states, spins, or photon polarizations.

Fundamental research has contributed to the advancement of bioluminescence imaging. The goal is to bridge the gap and expand the use of bioluminescent reporters. Specifically, the proposed technology will use biosensors for rapidly evaluating drug candidates in laboratory animals, in addition to cell cultured cells. This technology may have a significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) drug development and accelerate the optimization of drugs for brain malignancies.

Recently, bioluminescent reporters have been engineered to be brighter and red-shifted, thereby allowing deep tissue imaging of biological events. These molecular tools enable the detection of drug activity in an approach that is label-free, non-invasive, and pathway-specific. In addition, these biosensors may be used to monitor drug activity in living animals, thus circumventing the numerous limitations of terminal analyses. By evaluating targeted drug candidates in vivo, without termination, the performance and efficacy of the compounds can be more accurately appraised. This is especially valuable for optimizing molecules penetrating the central nervous system (CNS), in which the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has presented significant challenges in CNS drug development.

The project involves an examination and comparison of key convergence nodes in the global supply chains for illicit gold and mercury in Latin America and Africa. It specifically focuses on Peru and Kenya because of the similar characteristics they share on their respective continents as important trading hubs to other regional markets via both air and maritime transport, as well as acting as trading hubs for other illicit commodities and goods. In addition, both countries have significant artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors, that often operate at sites of informal gold production where the illicit gold supply chain begins and that use mercury to extract gold from the ore, representing the end of the mercury supply chain. This provides an opportunity for comparative analysis across two continents. One major challenge in Peru is that there are no organized records of illicit activities related to the gold and mercury supply chains, which presents difficulties in making decisions to combat them. Additionally, Kenya has not been thoroughly examined as an emerging hub for illicit gold in East Africa, especially gold from the ASGM sector originating from the DRC. Furthermore, actors from around the world are involved in the gold and mercury supply chains, and the micro problems in Peru and Kenya have global implications, including some that directly bear upon the national security of the United States. A more thorough understanding of the ways in which the illicit gold and mercury supply chains operate will support policy and enforcement interventions that target illicit actors without unduly harming vulnerable communities. <br/><br/>This research will advance knowledge of the illicit gold and mercury supply chains in Peru and Kenya, the international destinations of this gold, and the origins of the mercury entering the countries. It seeks to fill a knowledge gap raised in recent research coordinated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN): the co-dependency between the mercury and gold supply chains. Our interdisciplinary team with expertise in engineering, social science, computer science, and law will map the routes of gold from inland sites to major export hubs and the routes of mercury from major import hubs to inland mining sites. Particular emphasis will be placed on the maritime and air dynamics of the gold and mercury supply chains by focusing on the major convergence nodes, or collection points, transshipment hubs, and actors through which the illicit mercury and gold supply chains flow and intersect. This research expands the methodologies used to evaluate and understand illicit supply chains, by collating publicly available data, such as surveillance platform data and conducting ethnographic fieldwork with artisanal and small-scale gold miners and community members, other operators in the gold and mercury trades, and sources in security, law enforcement, and regulatory enforcement. By combining these data with a graph analytics approach, we will develop models that identify patterns transnationally and can help to disrupt both the illicit gold and mercury supply networks, as well as make connections with other types of illicit activities occurring and connected to global supply chain networks. This project will train STEM graduate students in interdisciplinary research methodologies, expose them to the complexities of mineral supply chains, provide them with tools to better understand these supply chains, and allow them to work with faculty, students, and collaborators from different disciplines. This research represents a concerted effort to leverage existing and emerging technologies, such as machine learning and advanced data analytics, to inform public policy not only in the targeted countries but also in other states facing related challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical DNA interactions within the genome, or network of genes, determine gene activities and thereby the development and function of cells, similarly as the software determines the operation of the hardware in a computer. Therefore, being able to program genomic interactions and thereby the development of communicating neuronal networks is at the basis of transformative applications. In this direction, optogenomics, or the control of the genome function through light, is proposed. Optogenomics offers an unprecedented means to control organ and specifically brain development and functions, or even new corrective treatments of cancer and other diseases. Such control will be enabled through development of novel directional light emitting nano-devices. The goal of this inter-disciplinary project is to study information processing and learning (and, thus, ultimately memory) in neuronal networks orchestrated by the light manipulation of the genome. For this, new photonic and electronic tools will be developed to program the genome in neurons and to study both the resulting changes in the structure and activity in networks of living neurons. This project will provide inter-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who will become versed in both nanophotonics and nanoelectronics as well as neuronal cell studies.<br/><br/>Beyond optogenetic platforms, which are aimed at the use of light to control cell-cell interactions, optogenomic systems allow the control of DNA interactions in the genome and, thus, the programming of the cell development and function. In this project, new optogenomic tools will be developed to control the development and information processing and learning in neuronal networks. In the proposed system, neural stem cells will be transfected with optimized optogenomic constructs that combine light-activated algae proteins and mammalian genome regulators. As the input to the system, the constructs will be activated globally across the cell culture through LED-based homogeneous illumination. The light-induced changes in the genome 3D structure and function will be analyzed using Chromatin Conformation Capture HiC/HiChIP, Atomic Force Microscopy, and RNAseq with the NextGene global genome sequencing. The output of the system will be the opto-electrophysiological analysis of signal processing in optogenomically constructed neuronal networks, with innovative transparent flexile beamforming nanophotonic devices combined with flexible high-density microelectrode arrays, using metrics like Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity, Hebbian learning and network science. An integrated Genome-Neuronal Function Model will be developed for the first time by correlating genomic topological networks to the functional gene networks and ultimately to the properties of the resultant neuronal network as they form in 3D model of the human brain ? cerebral organoids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Testing for COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been primarily limited to symptomatic patients who seek medical care. However, this approach misses infections in individuals with mild or no symptoms, who are, in fact, highly contagious. While the availability of diagnostic tests using state-of-the-art instrumentation has been rapidly scaled up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains woefully inadequate for effective disease surveillance and contact tracing. There remains an urgent critical need for ultrasensitive, simple, and rapid diagnostic assays at the point-of-care to enable wide-scale population testing and screening. The ongoing lack of quickly scalable and deployable diagnostic tools for effective wide-scale COVID-19 surveillance is a significant handicap in COVID-19 pandemic management. Such ultrasensitive diagnostic tools are likely to persist into the foreseeable future due to continuously emerging infectious diseases. The success of these tools can make a significant impact at the point-of-care for diagnostic and quantitation of cancer biomarkers and other infectious diseases as well as for the surveillance of environmental hazards and contaminants. This project will be closely integrated with the existing programs at the University of Houston to enhance the recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities into the fields of science and engineering. This research will enable a number of undergraduate Capstone Design projects. The knowledge gained over the course of this project will be disseminated through the Nano Engineering Minor option and graduate courses offered by the PIs in the Cullen College of Engineering.<br/><br/>This EAGER aims to demonstrate the feasibility of an inexpensive, compact, and ultrasensitive magneto electric biosensor platform designed for quantitative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleoprotein in patient samples. The proposed biosensor is based on magnetic reporter nanoparticles detection in a test line of a lateral flow assay (similar to the technology used in a pregnancy test) using magnetoelectric resonant sensors. Magnetoelectric sensors utilize strain-mediated energy transfer between magnetostrictive and piezoelectric sensor components. These sensors enable the efficient conversion of exceedingly weak external magnetic fields produced by magnetic nanoparticles into electrical signals. The technology is expected to be far more sensitive than current state-of-the-art antigen-detection diagnostics. The achievable sensitivity is also likely to be exceeding the sensitivity of the state-of-the-art tools currently available only at centralized laboratories. The new biosensors will leverage inexpensive and highly scalable manufacturing approaches routinely employed to fabricate micro-electromechanical systems. The biosensor will be comprised of disposable magnetoelectric lateral flow assay cartridges and a simple electronic readout built using low-cost off-the-shelf electronic components. The technology is ideal for sensitively detecting and quantifying the SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleoprotein in nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples. It has the potential to become an invaluable tool in pandemic management. Successful demonstration of the technology will establish an analytical and diagnostic platform widely useful in biomedical science and clinical diagnostics. This platform technology will be readily extendable to other types of infectious diseases, detection of cancer biomarkers, and food/environmental contaminants monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is an ambitious goal that has been recently advocated by internet pioneer industries as a response of the computing domain to climate change. Achieving this goal requires the decarbonization of operations of geographically distributed digital infrastructure, e.g., data centers, providing services such as video streaming, or hosting compute-intensive applications. Despite a decade of effort on the sustainability of digital infrastructure, the current design is still inadequate to achieve the 24/7 carbon-free goal. The current design focuses to minimize the energy cost and/or consumption or maximize renewable participation. The latter is the closest effort towards the decarbonization goal; however, when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, this design has no carbon intelligence, i.e., it obliviously draws energy from the grid without taking into account that the carbon intensity of grid changes over time due to existence of other carbon-free sources such as hydropower. This proposal explicitly considers carbon intelligence as a first-class design principle of digital infrastructure. It will develop and evaluate novel carbon-intelligent methodologies that are robust against uncertainty and provide a design space for data-driven adaptation for improved practical performance. <br/><br/>The proposed theories will create a foundation for designing robust and data-driven systems and will be applicable more broadly to the computer and network systems.

Unfortunately, as the technology scaling slows down, the semiconductor industry has been facing a major challenge in providing better performance while processing such large datasets. As a result, it is essential to redesign current systems to sustain the demand for computing over exponentially growing datasets. However, the fundamental model of computing has not changed over many decades. In our current Von Neumann model, data sits in the slower persistent storage and it is moved back and forth to faster memory for computation by the processor. This project focuses on enabling a paradigm shift in how data is stored and processed in future systems. Data should be processed close to where data is generated and data should be persisted where it is used. The goal of this work is to fundamentally rethink how persistent states are maintained in data centers and expose the persistency domain in the network for better performance, throughput, and tail latency. This work redesigns programmable switches and smart network interface cards (NICs) to manipulate persistent data in the network.<br/><br/>This project enables faster execution of applications that manipulate global persistent state, such as global-scale deep learning training.

This research project studies this technique, and others like it, using tools from computational and symbolic algebra. Results of the research are expected to advance theoretical understanding of these approximations, as well as to provide potential speed-ups to computations used in computer graphics and industrial design.<br/><br/>This research focuses on analysis and implementation of three central methods in approximation theory and geometric modeling: generalized barycentric coordinates, multidimensional splines, and polynomial interpolation.

For example, operating systems are designed to effectively utilize a computer's memory and processing units, and network protocols are designed to effectively utilize a networks' bandwidth. More broadly, a large fraction of the long literature on algorithm design and optimization is motivated by resource-allocation problems that arise in a wide variety of domains, ranging from project management and business administration to government policy and market design. Achieving effective resource-allocation outcomes is particularly challenging in multiagent systems, where a set of self-interested agents compete for shared resources. For example, in large computer networks there are multiple users that compete for the network's shared computational resources, such as its bandwidth, or access to its servers. Each agent's goal is to maximize its own utility, and the goal of the designer is to achieve system-level efficiency despite the agents' competing preferences. Without carefully designed resource-allocation mechanisms, the available resources would be underutilized, and massive amounts of social utility would be wasted; thus, it is imperative that these mechanisms are designed to the highest standard. The focus of this project is on the design of multiagent resource-allocation mechanisms that take into consideration the preferences of the participating agents and seek to maximize fairness and efficiency in the resulting outcomes.<br/> <br/>To address the competing incentives of the participating agents, the field of mechanism design in economics has provided very useful tools. By far the most effective among them is the use of monetary payments: charging for the use of the resources can ensure that only the agents who need them the most would be interested in paying the price. However, the use of monetary payments is often undesired or even infeasible, e.g., due ethical, legal, or practical considerations, so the mechanism needs to eschew monetary transfers. However, the vast majority of the literature on mechanism design has focused on the use of monetary payments, so money-free mechanisms are not well-understood. This project considers canonical domains of mechanism design without money from the perspective of the designer, with the goal of developing a coherent theory regarding what can and cannot be achieved in the absence of money. As a substitute for monetary payments, money-free mechanisms can instead penalize the agents by intentionally keeping some of the resources unallocated (a tool known as ""money-burning""). This way, the improved incentives come at a cost in social utility, introducing novel trade-offs for the designer who needs to strike a balance between incentives and effectiveness.  The main questions that this project focuses on are: 1) What incentives can the mechanism provide to the participants in the absence of money, and what cost in social utility do these improved incentives require? 2) From an algorithmic perspective what are the best worst-case approximation guarantees that can be achieved given the computational and informational constraints that these mechanisms may face?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent studies have focused on the macro-economic implications of climate-driven migration and displacement, but there remains a large research gap in our understanding of the multiplicities of climate related movement, or climate mobilities within a given locality. Mobility considerations encompass the social and economic disparities within coastal communities that may impede the ability of residents to cope with climate migration outcomes. There is a pressing need to understand local dynamics of climate migration as experienced across the spectrum of vulnerability to highlight equity considerations in sea level rise adaptation planning.<br/> <br/>The purpose of this research is to examine the intersection of sea level rise related exposure risk and socio-economic vulnerability and their combined impact on potential future climate migration outcomes through the creation of a novel climate mobility framework. The climate mobility framework distinguishes between four sets of communities - stable, migrating, displaced, and trapped- to assess potential inequities within sea level rise adaptation planning given deep uncertainty and competing societal demands for funding. This research has three primary objectives: (1) develop a conceptual framework that considers the multiplicities of sea level rise related movement, (2) test this framework among current residents of Miami-Dade County, FL though a mixed methods approach that includes spatial analysis and primary data collection through interviews and surveys, and (3) facilitate a process of co-production with government officials and community leaders to understand how the framework can advance equitable decision making for future climate resilience policy. This research employs publicly accessible datasets such as the U.S Census American Community Survey to develop socio-economic indicators of vulnerability, and integrates novel measures of exposure risk such as the Parallel Raster Inundation Model, or PRIMo, which provides high resolution regional compound flooding assessments for robust decision making. The climate mobility framework should be transferable to coastal communities in the United States and other societies where property rights and land-use tenure exist.

It is essential for faithful genetic inheritance in animals, plants, and single-celled eukaryotes such as algae. The size, composition and cellular manufacture of the telomerase complex varies dramatically across diverse eukaryotic taxonomic groups.  This variation makes telomerase an outstanding model system for examining the evolution of enzymes that are complexes comprised of both protein and RNA.   In 2019, the two PIs identified the RNA component of plant telomerase, making it possible to ask new questions about the evolution of this critical enzyme in eukaryotic groups in addition to animals and plants.  The collaborative proposal intends to explore the components and structure of telomerases from single-celled eukaryotes that are photosynthetic but belong to different taxonomic groups than plants.  The proposed work also includes workshops  on scientific leadership and negotiation for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, provides research opportunities for diverse undergraduates to learn about scientific discovery in evolutionary biology, structural biology and genetics, and provides scientific and educational communities with a curated free database about diverse telomerase enzymes.  <br/><br/>More specifically, this research addresses a knowledge gap presented by the highly divergent structures of ciliate, plant, and vertebrate telomerase enzymes despite their conserved essential function.   By revealing the composition and architecture of telomerase from photosynthetic organisms, novel accessory factors and new modes of RNA-protein interaction may be uncovered. In addition, the transcription of the RNA component of telomerases is different in animals and plants; plant telomerase RNA is transcribed by RNA Pol III while in animals the telomerase RNA is transcribed by RNA Pol II and requires the protein dyskerin. The proposed research will investigate the unexpected observation that dyskerin is also needed for transcription of plant telomerase RNA even though it is catalyzed by different transcription nanomachines.  Expanding analysis of telomerase structure and function beyond land plants to the basal-branching photosynthetic eukaryotes provides a unique opportunity to reveal the ancestral features of the first telomerase.  More broadly, comprehensive analysis of telomerase structure, function and evolution will help to establish fundamental rules underlying the biomolecular transition from an RNA world to cellular life that primarily uses protein-based catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By enabling rapid and inexpensive identification of pest- and disease-resistant honey bee colonies, this tool has cost and labor-saving potential for beekeepers and breeders, as it is likely to minimize miticide use, and facilitate sustainable prevention and monitoring of pest population buildup. Reduced use of miticides and improved pest and disease resistance may result in healthier honey bees and improved crop and natural ecosystem pollination. In addition, one compound used in the assay was recently associated with ant unpacking, a behavior comparable to honey bee hygiene, suggesting the potential for the development of related products for use in the control of ant and termite pest species.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a pheromone-based assay to predict and improve honey bee pest and disease resistance through hygienic behavior. Hygienic behavior is the ability of honey bees to detect, uncap, and remove unhealthy brood from the colony, and is an important mechanism of honey bee social immunity. This novel assay utilizes synthetic pheromones naturally produced by unhealthy honey bees to induce hygienic behavior. In the assay, a small area of brood is treated with pheromones and returned to the colony for two hours. Early field trials suggest that a colony?s hygienic response to the assay (calculated as a percent of cells manipulated) provides a measure of the colony?s natural pest and disease resistance. Specifically, a colony?s assay response predicts future parasite infestation levels, parasite removal ability, and winter survival, where high scoring colonies have fewer mites, demonstrate better mite removal, and are more likely to survive winter. The proposed research will employ behavioral, biochemical, breeding, and manufacturing techniques to optimize prototype efficacy, safety, and delivery.  The project will reduce production costs, assess prototype performance across environmental variables, and provide a proof-of-concept for heritability of parasite-resistance traits identified by colony assay response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The motivation for such changes can be due to many interrelated developmental, linguistic and social factors. This doctoral dissertation improvement research grant-funded project will investigate new dialect acquisition by mobile people relocating between two regions, one urban and characterized by a prestigious dialect, and one rural, whose dialect is stigmatized. Studies of dialect contact have been rare in comparison to studies of language contact, but such studies provide key opportunities to understand the processes of language change and the outcomes of contact situations broadly. This study will contribute new knowledge about how people are capable of learning and using new language forms and how speech sounds and words are represented in the mind. <br/><br/>Language samples from participants in each region will be collected according to gender, age, and length of residence in the new region. These and other social characteristics such as age of arrival, education level, occupation, social network, and language attitude will be examined for their possible effects on dialect acquisition. Each mobile speaker will take part in four activities: a conversational interview, reading a list of sentences, words, and minimal pairs. Importantly, by having an interview about the participants' experience growing up in their hometown and their experience in moving to a new region, this study can examine how participants vary their speech according to different topics. Transcriptions of interviews and associated audio files will ultimately form the basis of a corpus which will be shared with other researchers who are interested in the study of second dialect acquisition and variation within the studied language. This corpus will also be of value for related purposes, such as for forensic linguistics. Finally, by observing how both first dialect and second dialect features are used, this study will examine how speakers use linguistic features to craft identity-related meanings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum algorithms have been crucial in developing leading cryptographic assumptions, such as learning with errors, and concepts such as no-signaling have been used to build classical cryptographic protocols. In the last couple of years, a series of papers revealed another surprising, entirely different facet of this relationship: it was shown that classical cryptography could be used to address fundamental questions in quantum computing, such as whether quantum computers can be classically verified, or whether uniquely quantum properties, such as the inherent randomness in quantum computations, can be classically controlled. This project seeks to explore the ways in which classical cryptography can be used to harness the power of quantum computers. The interface between quantum computing and classical cryptography is largely unexplored, and the results mentioned above only hint at the potential impact of this field. This impact could span several areas, including both theoretical and experimental physics, complexity theory and of course cryptography and quantum computing. A major step in realizing this impact is to recruit both students and more senior researchers to the area. It will take significant effort to make quantum computing more approachable to computer scientists, and the investigator seeks to focus on making progress towards this goal, through education, mentoring and interdisciplinary collaboration. <br/><br/>The investigator will build on recent work which has shown that classical cryptography can be used to verify quantum computations, both generally and in more restricted settings. The properties of these protocols are not yet fully understood, and one objective of this project is to gain a better understanding of the extent to which cryptographic techniques can be used to characterize quantum machines. While the work on verification clearly shows that classical cryptography is useful in testing quantum devices, the connection between cryptography and quantum computing seems to have many more facets, as demonstrated by recent work which shows that cryptography can be used as a means of employing quantum computers for useful tasks. To do so, classical cryptography is used to leverage quantum properties, such as the inherent randomness generated in quantum computations. The second aspect of this project focuses on further exploration of this connection: can new, classically impossible primitives be built by combining uniquely quantum properties and classical cryptography? The study of these two general directions will yield insight into the power and limitations of quantum computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. Such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. However, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. Our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. By understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity.     <br/><br/>Many employees in the U.S. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (Galinsky et al. 2009). The incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; Allen, 2012). Moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (Bianchi & Milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. Yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. Such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. Specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (Smetana, 2008). In fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. Thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. Specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (Staines, 1980). Based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (Burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. Accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. First, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. Second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. Specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. We will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. Next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. We then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. The proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."

For example, the principal investigators will determine how the shape and structure of tulip poplar leaves enhance cooling on nearly-stagnant hot summer days while also reducing drag in tropical storm or even hurricane force winds. The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed. Hyperelastic material models will be developed and implemented in the immersed boundary framework to determine how strain-softening or strain-hardening elasticity affects leaf performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insulated glass manufacturers have a need for improvements to existing double-pane window manufacturing.  Residential insulated glass units represent a $2 billion market in North America alone. Currently, windows in the U.S. lose $20 billion dollars in energy each winter. A double-pane window with a sheet of aerogel between glass panes can achieve a vastly improved insulation, as an aerogel thickness of just 3 mm enables a product 50% more insulating than gas-filled double-pane windows, comparable to triple-pane products. Adoption could enable cost-effective energy savings of 1.2 quadrillion BTUs by 2030. This work also extends to other markets, such as transparent doors for refrigeration and ovens, and solar thermal receivers for process heat, which also represent significant opportunities for energy savings and viable market applications.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address key technical barriers for integration of super-insulating aerogels in window insulated glass units by focusing on two main risks. First, the project will further improve the optical clarity of the aerogel materials. The human eye is highly sensitive to haze and defects in transparent media, and although optical clarity meeting minimum requirements for the residential window market has been achieved, further improvement and testing are needed. Clarity will be improved by reducing haze through solution-gelation recipe optimization and by removing the fundamental causes of surface defects through development of mixing and molding strategies. Second, widespread adoption also requires straightforward incorporation of aerogel into insulated glass units. Bonding methods to attach aerogels directly to glass without reducing optical clarity will be developed, which will enable simple handling and incorporation into existing insulated glass unit manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project leverages advances in quantum-mechanics-based materials simulations, data science, and artificial intelligence to discover new solar cell materials. A fraction of excess energy of light in the form of high-energy photons absorbed by solar cell materials can be converted to heat rather than to electric current. This results in a loss of energy conversion efficiency. Many crystals are made of atoms that self-arrange in a regular spatially periodic pattern. Crystals can be made where organic molecules can form the fundamental unit instead of atoms. These molecular crystals may undergo a process known as singlet fission, which enables the conversion of that excess light energy into current carrying charges rather than heat. Singlet-fission-based solar cells are not yet a commercial technology due to dearth of suitable materials that exhibit this process. Over a million molecular crystal structures are known, but it is unknown for which ones singlet fission can occur. Experiments and even advanced quantum mechanical simulations are too costly and time consuming to test many known or predicted new molecular crystals. To overcome this barrier, the interdisciplinary team of experts in computational materials science and statistics will harness methods of data science and artificial intelligence. The team will investigate the use of machine learning methods to accelerate the process of materials discovery by rapidly identifying potentially promising candidate molecular crystals. The team will generate data from quantum-mechanics-based simulations to construct and iteratively improve machine-learned models.

There has been much interest in singlet fission because of its potential to significantly increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by harvesting two charge carriers from one photon. However, few materials are presently known to exhibit intermolecular singlet fission with high efficiency, hindering the realization of solid-state singlet-fission-based solar cells. The chemical compound space of possible chromophores is infinitely vast and largely unexplored. To enable computational discovery of materials that exhibit singlet fission, the interdisciplinary team will develop a multi-fidelity screening approach, integrating quantum-mechanics-based simulations at different levels of fidelity with machine learning and database mining. Machine learning algorithms will be used to learn from data generated by simulations and to steer simulations for further data acquisition. The machine learning models will dynamically adapt as more data is acquired. This will be implemented in a fully automated iterative workflow, designed to run on exascale high performance computers. <br/>This research will advance the discovery of new intermolecular singlet fission chromophores, which will catalyze the realization of ""third generation"" solid-state singlet-fission-based organic solar cells. Structure-property correlations revealed by machine learning will advance the fundamental understanding of singlet fission by deriving chemical insights and design rules for chromophores and crystal forms with enhanced singlet-fission efficiency. In addition to singlet-fission chromophores, materials may be discovered with desirable properties for other organic electronic device applications. In addition, this project will lead to new methodology needed to tackle the data-science challenges posed by searching for singlet fission materials. This project will lead to statistical developments in optimal sampling strategies for high-dimensional problems involving many data sources and in adaptive models that dynamically evolve as more data is acquired. The developed approach may be extended to other problems, where properties of interest arise from complex phenomena, for which data acquisition is costly or time consuming, and predictive descriptors are unknown. <br/>This project also supports training in advanced high-performance computing at the exascale, and community building at the intersection of materials science and data science through organizing workshops and conferences.

A CCA framework focuses on the policies and plans that communities have adopted and implemented to ?absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events?. The CCF is based on the fundamental framework of emergency management - hazard mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. To operationalize this vision, the objective of this project is to establish a transdisciplinary cross-sector knowledge-to-action network (KTAN). This network will co-develop new community-university partnerships (CUP) to enable evidence-driven solutions that foster evacuation preparedness and, thus, community resilience. This broadening of participation allows the project team to (1) hold virtual KTAN workshops to co-design physical reality/virtual reality (PR/VR) drills and resilience programs; (2) develop quantitative metrics of preparedness; and (3) create inclusive activities that focus on population segments.  This project will (1) yield significant societal impacts to engage community leaders, members, emergency responders, local and state emergency managers (EMs)/incident commanders (ICs), and researchers; (2) achieve interdisciplinary integration of social, engineering, and computer science to spark novel ideas at the intersection of them. <br/><br/>This project bridges existing gaps in connecting theoretical frameworks and emerging tools to help identify and assess the gaps in community preparedness and resilience programs.

Underlying this evolutionary change are spontaneous mutations in the germline (egg and sperm cells) that are passed on to the next generation. In addition, during the creation of germ cells, variations present in a parent's maternally and paternally derived chromosomes are shuffled into novel combinations by a process called recombination. For nearly a century, we have known that rates and patterns of mutation and recombination vary markedly across the tree of life ? yet, we still know surprisingly little about the underlying causes. By performing a series of comparative genomic analyses, this research aims to identify genomic features and quantify evolutionary processes that are driving these changes across the primate clade. Gaining a better understanding of these processes is of fundamental importance, not only mechanistically, but also clinically, as deleterious mutations and aberrant recombination can cause abnormalities that lead to genetic disease and developmental disabilities. The educational arm of this project focuses on multiple activities to teach the elementary skills of bioinformatics and computational genomics by offering i) a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) that actively engages students in explorative original research, ii) mentored research opportunities in the PI's lab, and iii) coding workshops for high school students. To increase public engagement with science, this project will additionally construct citizen-science activities and develop outreach materials to promote scientific literacy among K-12 students.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to characterize the extent and time-scale at which changes in the rates and patterns of mutation and recombination have evolved across the primate clade by implementing a streamlined comparative genomics analysis pipeline. To this end, the project takes advantage of both publicly available data and newly generated genomic resources for great apes as well as Old and New World monkeys to i) characterize the variation in mutation rate among families and between species, ii) quantify male mutation biases and parental age effects in the species, iii) improve our understanding of the influence of life history traits and sexual mating systems on mutation rate in primates, and iv) infer recombination rate variation across primates. The gained knowledge will enable the evaluation of competing evolutionary models aiming to explain the heterogeneity observed amongst primates, and elucidate the underlying population-level and genetic factors at play, ultimately leading to an improved understanding of the chronology of primate evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Limited public transit presents challenges in securing/maintaining meaningful employment for marginalized community members lacking personal transportation. This multi-phase project advances NSF?s mission to improve quality of life by enhancing LMI household mobility to jobs, healthcare, etc.   Employing groundbreaking research to better understand LMI decision- making for transportation and job access, the project takes a non-prescriptive approach to community engagement. It develops a replicable process for co-creating mobility strategies through active community engagement, pairing mobility strategies with human services (e.g., mobility training, workforce development) to connect residents with jobs and/or apprenticeships. The project develops strategies to scale/sustain the project beyond the pilot and a design toolkit that documents engagement, research methods, and data analysis tools that other communities can employ.  The project team is multidisciplinary and includes academic partners (Boston University, Brown University, and University of California Berkeley) and community organizations (Mobility Development, Building Futures RI, a workforce/apprenticeship development organization, and local affordable housing community based organizations Preservation of Affordable Housing, and NeighborWorks).<br/><br/>This project employs a community-based participatory mixed-method research approach that responds to participant needs and reflects community desires, demonstrates a pathway to sustainability (longer-term financial viability of mobility business models) and develops a pilot evaluation model.  The project combines qualitative (focus groups, listening sessions) and quantitative (survey, US Census) data to spatially analyze relationships among daily mobility challenges and existing transport systems, create mobility strategies and training materials, and develop a sustainable model and pilot evaluation.  This project also has a significant spatial component, integrating participatory mapping procedures with qualitative data collection methods. Engagement frameworks, methods, data, and analysis tools developed as part of this initiative will inform future planning, pilot projects, mobility business models, and research. All materials will be available in a toolkit for use by other communities.  This replicable strategy incorporates challenges impacting employment, which are often omitted from typical mobility assessments. Considering these daily struggles in the mobility hub design, the Stage 2 pilot will foster broader societal outcomes including: 1) Advancement of apprenticeships, employee attendance, job retention/creation (key metrics); 2) Participation of underrepresented populations; 3) Changes in modes used; 4) Vehicle miles traveled/air quality impacts; and, 5) Quality of life.  <br/><br/>This project is supported by the CIVIC Innovation Challenge program Track A.

Using cameras mounted on the robot and a virtual reality headset, a person can see the environment around the robot. However, controlling the robot using existing technologies is hard: there is a time delay because it?s slow to send high quality video over the Internet. In addition, the fidelity of the image is worse than looking through human eyes, with a fixed and narrow view. This proposal will address these limitations by creating a new system which understands the geometry and appearance of the robot?s environment. Instead of sending high-quality video over the Internet, this new system will only send a smaller amount of information about how the environment?s geometry and appearance has changed over time. Further, understanding the geometry and appearance will let us expand the view visible to the person. Overall, these will improve a human?s ability to remotely control the robot by increasing fidelity and responsiveness. We will demonstrate this technology on household tasks, on assembly tasks, and by manipulating small objects.<br/><br/>The aim of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that integrating scene and networking understanding can enable efficient transmission and rendering for dexterous control of remote robots through virtual reality interfaces. This system will result in dexterous teleoperation that enables remote human operators to perform complex tasks with remote robot manipulators, such as cleaning a room or repairing a machine. Such tasks have not previously been demonstrated to be teleoperated for two reasons: 1) lack of an intuitive awareness and understanding of the scene around the remote robot, and 2) lack of an effective low-latency interface to control the robot. We will address these problems by creating new scene- and network-aware algorithms which tightly couple sensing, display, interaction and transmission, enabling the operator to quickly and intuitively understand the environment around the robot. This project will research new interfaces which allow the operator to use their hand to directly specify the robot?s end effector pose in six degrees of freedom, combined with spatial- and semantic-object-based models that allow safe high-level commands. This project will evaluate the proposed system by assessing the speed and accuracy of the remote operator?s ability to complete complex tasks, including assembly tasks; the aim will be to complete unstructured assembly tasks that have never been demonstrated to be remotely teleoperated before.<br/><br/>This project is in response to the NSF Cyber-Physical Systems 20-563 solicitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are among the fastest-growing sectors in the $40 billion power semiconductor market. Today?s medium-voltage devices are mainly made of silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC). Gallium nitride (GaN) has superior physical properties over Si and SiC for power applications. Recently, the vertical GaN power field-effect transistor (FinFET), a new power transistor utilizing sub-micron-meter fin channels, has demonstrated one of the best performances in all medium-voltage transistors. However, all existing vertical GaN FinFETs employ small-diameter and high-cost GaN substrates, which hinders their commercialization. This CAREER proposal aims at developing a new generation of medium-voltage vertical GaN power FinFETs on low-cost, large-diameter Si substrates with high performance, and fabricating them on the same wafer with the low-voltage lateral GaN FinFETs or tri-gate transistors, hence allowing monolithic integration of the driving circuitry and medium-voltage power devices for the first time. This project, if successful, will enable an unprecedented advancement in the performance, frequency, efficiency, and form factor of the medium-voltage power electronic systems. This project provides opportunities for student education and outreach: (a) establishing an integrated undergraduate research program tackling interdisciplinary problems in the fields of materials, devices, and power electronics; (b) mentoring the participating students with the industrial collaborators and promoting the student interactions with the power semiconductor industries; (c) contributing to the pre-college summer camps and providing summer research opportunities to K-12 students and teachers in microelectronics. The program will actively engage students from a broad range of groups in microelectronics research and education. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The overarching objective of this project is to build a monolithic ?full GaN FinFET? platform on Si substrates, which shares common processing technologies and device building blocks, where the high-voltage, vertical GaN FinFET is employed for power processing and the low-voltage, lateral GaN FinFETs/trigate FETs are used for information processing. The interdisciplinary nature of this project offers significant intellectual merits in materials, devices, processing technologies, and power modules: (a) New characterization methods will be established to map the leakage current in GaN-on-Si with spatial resolutions down to the nanometers and characterize the trap-mediated breakdown voltage with temporal resolutions down to the nanoseconds. (b) Innovative function structures will be explored to overcome the insulating and highly-defective buffer layers in GaN-on-Si structure and enable superior electrical, thermal, and mechanical performances in fully-vertical GaN-on-Si power FinFETs. (c) Innovative epitaxial structure and fabrication processes will be established to enable the monolithic integration of medium-voltage vertical FinFETs and lateral digital FinFETs/tri-gate-FETs. (d) Advanced models and simulations will be explored to link the microscopic material non-idealities and circuit dynamics to device designs and optimizations, which has been a long knowledge gap in nitride devices and materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By combining time-resolved velocimetry with an extensively validated fluid-particle simulation methodology, this effort will break ground in uncovering new flow physics relating the influence of flow interactions on the entrainment and dispersion of droplets. Some of the anticipated outcomes include: (1) an extensive database of experimental measurements and high-resolution simulations; and (2) a sound theoretical foundation for modeling turbulent disperse two-phase flows. Such improved quantification of flow physics and development of reduced-order models will enable better prediction of droplet dispersion, a key step towards understanding the spread of viral infections. The methods developed will be used to study the interaction of droplet-laden expiratory jets with flow barriers (for example face shields) and evaluate their efficacy to mitigate the dispersion of impinging expiratory flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It requires integrating large amounts of uncertain, changing information to make consequential decisions in a short time frame under pressure, and the stakes are high. An opportunity exists to leverage recent research?in particular, the Integrated Scenario-based Evacuation (ISE) tool?to help meet that challenge. This team designed the ISE tool to be run for a particular hurricane as it approaches the U.S. When run at a point in time, it generates a set of contingency plans and defines the circumstances under which to implement each, depending on how the hurricane evolves. Each plan includes recommendations about whether or not to issue an evacuation order for each geographic evacuation zone, and if so, when.<br/><br/>While the new technology has promise, moving from research to practice brings its own challenges. The objectives of Stage 1, therefore, are to: (1) Determine how the new tool and its output can support emergency managers? natural decision-making process; (2) Conduct a needs assessment for the tool; and (3) Advance understanding of community innovation in disaster management. The Stage 2 objective is to implement an operational prototype of the ISE-based decision support tool for North Carolina. The emergency manager partners will ensure the tool is of practical use; the researchers will ensure it reflects the best science; and the industry partner will ensure its impact is sustainable by hosting it on their platform.<br/><br/>The ISE tool uses a multi-stage stochastic programming model to provide a tree of recommended evacuation orders and a performance evaluation for that set of recommendations. Benefits of the tool are that it provides an integrated hazard assessment with uncertainty that includes the effects of storm surge, wind waves, tides, river discharge, inland flooding, and wind; it explicitly balances competing objectives of minimizing risk and travel time; it offers a well-hedged solution robust under the range of hurricane evolutions; and it is adaptive, leveraging the value of decreasing uncertainty during an event. Stage 1 will include focus groups of key stakeholders to determine the process of innovation; a needs assessment; and analysis and planning for the next stage. In Stage 2, we will (1) make the tool faster and easier to run by moving it to a GPU platform and exploiting opportunities for parallelization; (2) develop an interactive graphical user interface; and (3) improve the modeling by adding treatment of institutionalized vulnerable populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pandemics emerge through incidental ?perfect storms?: molecular changes in pathogens, gradual trends in climate, subtle shifts in ecological interactions among potential hosts, and individual behavioral decisions by people, all colluding to make up the difference between an interesting but rare new variant of a known disease and an existential worldwide crisis. Being able to predict the emergence of pandemic threats, therefore, requires a fully integrated, multidisciplinary approach, able to consider the complexity of these realms across scales of interaction to predict and, ideally, prevent.  This workshop is one of four bringing experts from scholarly communities in the social and behavioral sciences, biology, engineering, and computer science together to discuss how to integrate the approaches taken by each community into a more effective, unified science of pandemic prediction.  The focus of this workshop is on developing understanding of how human attitudes, social behavior, and the drivers underlying both shape patterns of infectious-disease transmission and efforts at control and eradication.  This fundamental understanding in turn will facilitate pandemic prevention and control decisions that leave us better prepared when confronted with future pandemic threats.<br/><br/>The workshop is structured to focus on four topical areas of crucial importance, dealing with cultural transmission, information and communication, equity, and sustainability. The white paper that comes from this workshop will provide important guidance for incorporating insights into the social and behavioral sciences into predictive intelligence and pandemic prevention.   It will inform future research investments, institutional capacity-building, and other policy priorities aimed at keeping the US and the world safe from inevitable future pandemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mat worlds are dominated by motile filaments of microbes that variably use sunlight and chemicals in their daily routines and offer opportunities for discovering novel microorganisms and ecosystem processes. Recently, complex patterns of daily vertical migration has been observed in the field, suggesting different microbes migrate vertically to the surface of the mat during daylight and nighttime. This project is unraveling the who, why and how of daily microbial migration through integration of microscopy, cultures, molecular approaches, and process rate measurements in response to changing gradients of light, sulfide and oxygen over the day-night cycle. This project places the vertical migration of microbial mats into a broader geobiological context through comparisons with other globally distributed cyanobacterial mat systems such as terrestrial springs and ice-covered Antarctic lakes. Furthermore, the diverse and versatile sinkhole mats may serve as a useful working model for robotic exploration of similar life in extraterrestrial waters like that of Jupiter?s Europa or Saturn?s Enceladus. This project is generating compelling student projects, attracting public imagination, and fueling active collaboration between two predominantly undergraduate institutions and a National Marine Sanctuary.<br/><br/><br/>The functioning of cyanobacteria under sulfidic, low O2-conditions is a major gap in our understanding of Earth?s oxygenation in the past. Recently, time-lapse images of diel vertical migration (DVM) were collected revealing alternating waves of vertically migrating photosynthetic and chemosynthetic filaments that followed daily fluctuating light in microbial mats in Lake Huron?s sinkholes; observations corroborated with intact mats under simulated day-night conditions in the laboratory. Such synchronized diel movement, might have played a critical role in optimizing photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, carbon burial, and oxygenation during the Precambrian. This project is evaluating the taxa involved in DVM and is probing geobiological controls on DVM under low-O2, sulfidic conditions using macro- and microscopic imaging, physico-chemical microprofiling, culturing, genetics, and allelopathic studies. Three central issues are being addressed: (1) what taxa are responsible for the DVM? (2) how and why do they perform DVM? and (3) what are the ecosystem consequences of DVM community and activity synergies? The project is revealing specific microbial populations, metabolic pathways, and geochemical processes that underpin mat biogeochemistry over the diel cycle. Studying microbial communities that have regular and measurable daily rhythms in processes that can also be tracked at micrometer scales yields an unprecedented view of the molecular underpinnings of microbial mat biogeochemistry and lays the foundation for future studies aimed at re-defining the role of autotrophic communities in ancient seas and modern ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Privacy laws like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the proposed United States Consumer Data Privacy Act (CDPA) and Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (CORPA) give users new rights to control their data (e.g., access and erasure on request, rights to object to processing). With today's systems, compliance with these laws requires onerous manual labor, particularly from small and medium-sized organizations. This project investigates new systems that ? by construction ? comply with these privacy laws. The key idea is to provide a ""micro-database"" for each user, which stores all their data and which they can choose to withdraw or resubscribe. This design enables new, fundamentally privacy-centric models, such as automatically removing idle users' data while making it easy for the users to return. Realizing compliance-by-construction requires innovation in storage systems and data processing techniques. To succeed, compliant-by-construction systems must match the convenience and performance of today's systems, and the project will contribute systems that efficiently handle millions of per-user micro-databases by advancing the state-of-the-art in scalable computing techniques (e.g., dataflow systems).<br/><br/>The proposed research will lead to new, compliant-by-construction equivalents of today's popular web service software.

Success as an engineer today requires multicultural collaboration. To help engineering students sharpen their cultural skills, many engineering courses place students into multicultural teams. However, evidence suggests that students in these teams often struggle with psychological barriers, such as mistrust, that prevent effective collaboration. To mitigate these barriers, students of diverse cultural backgrounds need to develop the skills and aptitudes that support working together effectively. This project aims to build a scalable and sustainable tool to help engineering students develop multicultural teamwork skills.  It will apply research about mindset to develop an online learning module that will be integrated into introductory engineering courses.  Findings from the project will be incorporated into CATME (Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness), a widely used, freely available tool for forming and managing undergraduate teams in STEM and other courses.  Implementing the online learning module is expected to improve collaboration in diverse STEM environments and equip engineering majors for the workforce.<br/><br/>To improve engineering students? multicultural teamwork skills, the project aims to develop a cultural mindset module in three stages. In stage 1, the project team will complete a comprehensive literature review, focus-group interviews, and a survey of engineers in multicultural teams and use these data to develop a prototype cultural mindset module.  The second stage will determine mechanisms of cultural mindset effects in teams, generating knowledge to refine the module through a teamwork survey of current undergraduate engineering students and iterative pilot testing. The third stage will determine the module?s effectiveness with a randomized controlled trial in a first-year engineering program and follow-up surveys. It is expected that students who participate will demonstrate more positive attitudes and constructive behaviors in multicultural teamwork, resulting in improved climate and performance of their teams. Project findings will be disseminated in engineering education and psychology conferences and journals, and the module will be released on repositories of engineering education and cultural learning resources. The results generated by this project may catalyze future research on educational interventions that support a diverse society, as well as advance efforts to create more positive cross-cultural relations and inclusive climates in engineering programs.

An estimated $180,000 and 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide may be saved yearly per nuclear fuel/biosolids dryer compared to the alternative drying system which uses natural gas. The United States market, which has a total of 90 spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage sites and 14,748 wastewater plants is a potential market since current SNF is not recycled.

In existing dry casks, the nuclear fuel is sealed within steel canisters, which are then placed in a concrete overpack. The canisters are cooled by natural convection. Air enters the casks from the bottom, pulls heat from the canister, and exits from the top of the cask. The heated air is collected by the system and directed into a biosolid dryer. This approach avoids two main problems associated with the storage of nuclear waste: designing, licensing, and constructing completely new nuclear waste storage solutions, and transporting nuclear waste. This approach also provides a much-needed, year-round biosolid disposal service to wastewater treatment plants and creates a sustainable biomass from the biosolids.

The most vexing challenges require collaborative melding of expertise from different disciplines and partnership among different kinds of organizations ? convergence! Essential to the Convergence Accelerator?s approach is a tailored curriculum provided to grantee teams. A crucial part of that curriculum is ?Team Science.? The goal of the team science elements of the curriculum is to facilitate convergence team development and effectiveness. The funded teams are all highly interdisciplinary and incorporate expertise from different types of organizations, but in order to be effective in their projects ? and truly convergent ? grantee teams need to communicate and collaborate effectively and rapidly. Because Phase I Convergence Accelerator awards are only 9 months in duration, it is particularly important that teams build their communication and collaboration skills rapidly. <br/><br/>This project expands upon previous successful NSF-supported work by the Toolbox Dialogue Initiative (TDI) that has resulted in TDI?s professional development tools that have been used at more than 350 workshops around the world since 2005 to help researchers enhance their capacity for collaboration within cross-disciplinary teams. It also builds upon an effective train-the-trainer workshop provided to the first cohort of Convergence Accelerator grantees. The project will extend the Toolbox Dialogue effort to create an even more comprehensive Team Science communication and collaboration curriculum. The project will facilitate development of a training effort that integrates ?social-relational? as well as ?cognitive-epistemic? dimensions of collaboration. The project will do this by coordinating team science curricular offerings with two other experts. The project will result in new knowledge about and methods for facilitating productive collaborative environments that is likely to foster project innovation. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include increasing the effectiveness of Convergence Accelerator grantee teams.

This doctoral dissertation focuses on post-disaster asset allocation, specifically on housing and titles, to understand not only how humans respond to disasters and subsequent initiatives, but also how they create mechanisms for future resilience. It seeks to analyze whether demographic differences in homeownership influence outcomes in socio-economic capacity, social relations, decision-making, and personal autonomy after a disaster. The COVID-19 dimension offers a rare opportunity to analyze the factors associated with capacities to withstand different shocks. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student, this project will also engage a wider audience by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations and policymakers invested in disaster relief.<br/><br/>This ethnographic project centers on three neighborhoods devastated by successive disasters (a natural disaster, followed by COVID-19), and received differential post-disaster support. Post-disaster housing is explored as a site for analyzing the intersections between macro-level processes (disasters and subsequent initiatives) and their micro-level effects (intra-household dynamics). The researcher will collect data through participant observation, a survey and semi-structured interviews, to analyze a) how has the well-being of households been influenced by their degree of participation in post-earthquake initiatives; b) how does the response to COVID-19 and associated regulations affect intra-household dynamics; and c) how does successive disaster experience affect varied individual capacities and responses to the pandemic. The project offers the opportunity to gain comparative insights into how social relations are reconfigured within households and communities amidst successive disasters.  The collected data will contribute to the anthropology of disasters, households, and assets. Focusing on social relations at the intersection of housing and disasters, close attention to COVID-19 will enhance the anthropological understanding of the social impact of epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is centered at Carlow University, a private, liberal arts university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Over its five-year duration, the project will fund scholarships to 18 full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, chemistry, and/or data analytics. First-year Scholars will receive up to four years and transfer Scholars will receive up to two years of scholarship support. The project will support Scholars within a cohort-based Scholar learning community that includes mentoring and other high-impact support practices. The project also features a STEM faculty learning community centered on shared interest in Scholar outcomes, with the goal of enhancing STEM teaching and implementing best practices in Scholar support. The Scholar/Faculty learning community model is intended to foster connections among students and faculty that will contribute to successful graduation and pursuit of STEM careers. The project?s research study will provide insight into the effectiveness of a potentially replicable, dual learning community approach for supporting STEM student success. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Specific project objectives include: 1): Recruiting 18 low-income, academically talented, full-time students who pursue degrees in biology, chemistry, and data analytics over the grant period; 2) Increasing first-year retention and graduation rates of the Scholars; 3) Placing a high proportion of Scholars in STEM-related jobs or graduate school within six months of graduation.  The project will also examine the impacts of participation in learning communities on women in STEM.  Despite abundant research on learning communities, few studies have examined the extent to which learning communities contribute to success of low-income women in STEM. A social science researcher will address this gap by conducting a research study measuring the impact of learning communities on Scholars? confidence in overall college success and their attitudes, learning experiences, and intrinsic motivation in STEM, including their academic abilities, interest in working in STEM fields, and ease in the social transition to college. A project assessment and evaluation plan, conducted by an external evaluator, will inform improvements throughout project implementation.  Results of this evaluation will be disseminated via local, regional, and national conferences and publications to inform the academic community and provide opportunities for replication. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

The physical DNA interactions within the genome, or network of genes, determine gene activities and thereby the development and function of cells, similarly as the software determines the operation of the hardware in a computer. Therefore, being able to program genomic interactions and thereby the development of communicating neuronal networks is at the basis of transformative applications. In this direction, optogenomics, or the control of the genome function through light, is proposed. Optogenomics offers an unprecedented means to control organ and specifically brain development and functions, or even new corrective treatments of cancer and other diseases. Such control will be enabled through development of novel directional light emitting nano-devices. The goal of this inter-disciplinary project is to study information processing and learning (and, thus, ultimately memory) in neuronal networks orchestrated by the light manipulation of the genome. For this, new photonic and electronic tools will be developed to program the genome in neurons and to study both the resulting changes in the structure and activity in networks of living neurons. This project will provide inter-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who will become versed in both nanophotonics and nanoelectronics as well as neuronal cell studies.<br/><br/>Beyond optogenetic platforms, which are aimed at the use of light to control cell-cell interactions, optogenomic systems allow the control of DNA interactions in the genome and, thus, the programming of the cell development and function. In this project, new optogenomic tools will be developed to control the development and information processing and learning in neuronal networks. In the proposed system, neural stem cells will be transfected with optimized optogenomic constructs that combine light-activated algae proteins and mammalian genome regulators. As the input to the system, the constructs will be activated globally across the cell culture through LED-based homogeneous illumination. The light-induced changes in the genome 3D structure and function will be analyzed using Chromatin Conformation Capture HiC/HiChIP, Atomic Force Microscopy, and RNAseq with the NextGene global genome sequencing. The output of the system will be the opto-electrophysiological analysis of signal processing in optogenomically constructed neuronal networks, with innovative transparent flexile beamforming nanophotonic devices combined with flexible high-density microelectrode arrays, using metrics like Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity, Hebbian learning and network science. An integrated Genome-Neuronal Function Model will be developed for the first time by correlating genomic topological networks to the functional gene networks and ultimately to the properties of the resultant neuronal network as they form in 3D model of the human brain ? cerebral organoids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These differences may arise due to firms? prior experience with similar projects or how farther along a firm is in R&D process. Firms have an incentive to learn what their rivals know. While learning about rivals? progress may be easier in some industries such as pharmaceuticals due to reporting regulations, it is challenging in other industries as firms protect their R&D specific information.  The project is centered around three major research questions. First, the project explores firm incentives to share private information with others and its impact on the society. Second, the research examines whether firms should make R&D progress public or not. Third, the project looks at the reasons behind why startups focus on radical innovations and new products whereas established firms tend to pursue incremental innovations and improvements to existing products. The project has policy and regulatory implications in understanding the role of information asymmetry and information sharing on R&D activities for startups and established firms.<br/><br/>This research focuses on R&D races where rivals have asymmetric information about the feasibility of the project. The project explores three issues. First, if firms can commit to be truthful, then the benefits of better information to a firm seem to outweigh competitive concerns. Although firms should have an incentive to share what they know, this decreases the probability of success and is detrimental from a social perspective. Second, firms can invest more in R&D if they do not share R&D progress publicly as information on a rival abandoning a line of research has a strong discouragement effect on others. Third, the observed regularity about incremental and radical innovations can be explained in terms of information: Smaller startup firms can usually observe the R&D activity of larger, established firms better than the other way around, which affects risk taking behavior. This project studies these issues in a rich setting incorporating imperfect monitoring of R&D activity by firms, capital constraints and intellectual capital.

The effect on people?s health and safety was devastating and long-lasting. Due to climate change, places like Puerto Rico are confronting more frequent and destructive disasters; government agencies and offices at all levels are increasingly grappling with the limitations of their resources and capacity to meet the needs of these impacted communities. While individuals and community groups operating outside of the official disaster management system demonstrate adaptability, innovation, and responsiveness in contributing resources together with time, knowledge, and skills, they have been largely undervalued, leading to the marginalization of local information and knowledge in disaster risk reduction. The goal of this project is to engage and empower individuals and communities to become a more integral part of disaster resilience, specifically addressing the structural and social barriers that will lead to improvement in allocation, coordination, and delivery of relief services and supplies.<br/><br/>This project aims to enhance disaster resilience and fill information gaps through development of a new participatory, community mapping platform based on local information and knowledge.

Molecular interactions are commonly measured using optical techniques and specialized optical labels on the molecules of interest. Recent advances in modern electronics and nanoscale materials potentially allow continuous monitoring of molecular interactions in a more natural state without optical labels and instruments. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a single-molecule high-speed nanoelectronic platform to better understand the function of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated enzymes known as ""molecular scissors"".  These enzymes allow gene editing and have revolutionized many basic and applied research areas. The knowledge gained will be beneficial for many applications in CRISPR engineering, pharmaceutical drug discovery, clinical diagnostics, and agricultural science. The project will promote early research involvement and mentorship opportunities to a new generation of engineers and scientists pursuing a career of interdisciplinary research intersecting modern biology, nanotechnology and engineering.<br/><br/>The investigator?s scientific career vision is to explore the utility of nano-electronic systems to develop transformative and customizable biosensing platforms for pharmaceutical, clinical, and environmental applications. As part of this vision, this project focuses on the integration of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) with high bandwidth graphene field effect transistors (gFETs) designed for single-molecule sensing. The platform provides unique electronic signatures representing the molecular interactions that happen concurrently between the CRISPR and target DNA/RNA at different timescales. The CRISPR-Cas system is a family of RNA guided enzymes that is widely used for gene editing as it is capable of double-stranded DNA binding and cleavage, producing insertions and deletions (INDELs) at specific loci within the genome in vivo. The application areas of CRISPR technology are rapidly extending beyond genome editing, such as targeted gene regulation, in vivo imaging, epigenetic modulation as well as nucleic acid detection for diagnostic applications. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to provide a tool to evaluate the enzymatic activity of newly discovered or engineered CRISPR-Cas enzymes to better understand their biology and the impact of CRISPR-Cas mutagenesis, guide RNA modifications as well as genetic variation of the target on their functions. Successful development of the single molecule high bandwidth gFET for CRISPR analysis coupled with trained machine learning models, will provide a tool for detailed analysis of the CRISPR interactions with its target sequence in terms of binding, cleavage, and release of the target in real-time as well as identification of the variables most important for predicting CRISPR function. The information obtained can direct the design and optimization of CRISPR-Cas enzymes toward enhancing their efficiency and safety in wide range of applications.

Accordingly, the goal of this project is to design the Multimedia Streaming Cloud (MSC) platform with high-level management abstractions that can reap the benefits of the continuum while hiding the complexity of working with it. MSC promotes the Function-as-a-Service computing paradigm and offers the Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) abstraction as a first-class citizen to represent various streaming sources, hence, relieving the users and developers from both the resource and data management difficulties. OaaS enables flexible migration of the objects across the continuum and accelerates the development of streaming services too. Preserving the object's state facilitates seamless object migration, hence, elasticity and mobility of objects across the edge-to-cloud continuum are achieved. MSC offers cost-efficient and robust QoS to each streaming object via smart task management and resource allocation methods operating on heterogeneous cloud resources. An open-source prototype of the MSC platform is developed and tested via recording devices, a local edge computing system, and a public cloud to assess its usability and robustness. <br/><br/>The MSC platform democratizes multimedia streaming and lays the foundation for the next generation applications operating based on multimedia streaming. MSC will pave the way for stream providers to become solution-oriented and let them focus on developing advanced streaming services and integrate them to their applications. The project results will impact not only the forefront of scientific discovery, but also benefit the society by offering flexible and robust streaming services across various applications. The object abstraction and the intelligent resource allocation methods of the MSC platform can be adapted to and employed in other soft real-time computing systems.

Conventional wet scrubbers for SO2 removal are expensive to install and are highly limited by their large footprint, reducing the practicality of their implementation for mobile or space-limited applications. The proposed approach to SO2 capture uses electricity to directly remove the contaminant from a gas stream, providing significant improvements in energy efficiency and eliminating the need for caustic chemicals inherent to conventional SO2 scrubbers. The need for innovative solutions for SO2 removal is highlighted in the maritime shipping industry, where recent legislation on SO2 emissions has created an immediate need for technology that can be retrofitted into existing infrastructure on cargo vessels. This project can potentially be extended to many applications where electrical energy is supplied.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed method of SO2 removal uses a technique known as electro-swing adsorption (ESA), which uses a polymer-composite electrode containing an electroactive species that can capture and release a target gas through charge/discharge cycles. This technology has been demonstrated for CO2 capture, but there are significant challenges associated with developing novel chemistry for capture of SO2. Phase I research will focus on gaining a molecular understanding of the electrochemical mechanism of SO2 reactivity. The binding constant for the target gas can be ascertained as a function of the reduction potential of the electroactive species, providing a method of selecting optimized candidates for SO2 capture that are highly reactive and selective over other gases present in exhaust streams, such as CO2. The absorption capacity of the electroactive species will also be assessed using packed-bed absorption columns to simulate an electro-swing adsorption device.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the World Bank has invested billions of dollars in community-driven development, which emphasizes the participation of beneficiaries in decision making around development projects. Direct democracy, especially in the form of participatory budgeting, has spread across the globe. One motivation for promoting participation is the idea that by participating in decision making related to a local public good, participants will feel more compelled to invest in the maintenance of that good. In turn, public goods will provide more benefit to the community if they are well-maintained and last longer. Political theorists, too, have posed the question: does participation ?make better citizens?? An even more important question for policy makers is: which kinds of participation manage to do so? This research evaluates the influence of participatory mechanisms on behavioral outcomes in one county in a developing country. The results of the study inform the ongoing design of participatory institutions in that country, other countries on that continent, and around the world; there are more than 11,000 participatory budgeting programs and programs are expanding far more quickly than evidence can keep pace. The results of this study thus are immediately useful to governments and advocates of participatory institutions as they design, adopt, and expand public participation in pursuit of development.<br/><br/>The research uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of common participatory processes on individual willingness to invest in local public goods, such as a well, a health clinic, or solar array. The RCT takes place in 90 communities, where the researchers provide all villages with a local public good. The method of selecting a good for each community is randomly assigned to involve either: (a) preference aggregation through consultation, (b) preference aggregation through voting at a public meeting, or (c) consensus-building through deliberative discussion.The research team randomly recruits villagers to attend these meetings and surveys them on their attitudes and behaviors surrounding participation and development projects before and after the meetings. The researchers return 1 year later to measure the state of the public good and the participants? updated attitudes and behaviors. The researchers then leverage their strategy of random assignment of meeting rules and random selection of participants to compare villages across space and over time to identify the effects of the decision-making process on participants? selection and maintenance of the public good. This study thus provides rigorous evidence to inform future program design and investment in participatory institutions for development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is known as the spatial mismatch problem, and it is likely to pose even bigger challenges for low-income mothers with young children, given their parental responsibilities.  While this problem has existed for decades, the recent and widespread diffusion of smartphones has enabled a proliferation of new transportation options that offer some of the flexibility of personal vehicles without the high fixed cost of vehicle ownership.  Could these new transportation options significantly expand the geographic and socioeconomic mobility of low-income mothers? If so, how?  To explore these possibilities, this project proposes a set of field experiments which provide low-cost access to these transportation options for a treatment group and compare the mobility and socioeconomic outcomes to a control group.  The experiments can use the GPS capabilities embedded in modern smartphones to measure the quantity and nature of increased geographic mobility thereby conferred on low-income mothers in the treatment groups.  Through innovative partnerships with local government agencies, this project will measure the impact of increased geographic mobility on socioeconomic mobility in the short-run and the long-run. Through partnerships with a diverse set of regional nonprofits, this project will directly involve low-income mothers in our research design.  The results of the research will provide immediate guidance for policymakers seeking to fund practical policy and engineering solutions to the spatial mismatch problem. <br/><br/>Given the rapid diffusion of these transportation options across the country and around the world, policy lessons derived from our study could be implemented in hundreds of cities, potentially impacting the lives of millions.  The research will also support fundamental breakthroughs in the modeling of regional transportation systems.  Transportation researchers currently have limited visibility into how new transportation options are impacting multi-modal transit choices within regional transportation systems.  By leveraging the detailed data collected through our proposed research, this project will create new methods for modeling these regional transportation systems.  The new models will reflect the growing interaction between conventional mass transit and a range of complementary new (and old) transit technologies.  The knowledge gained from these models could further expand mass transit ridership and resident mobility, while also promoting environmental sustainability. This project is supported by the CIVIC Innovation Challenge program Track A. Communities and Mobility: Offering Better Mobility Options to Solve the Spatial Mismatch Between Housing Affordability and Jobs through a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Energy Vehicle Transportation Office.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to this ubiquitous uncertainty and complexity, feedback control loops are and will continue to be pervasive in autonomous systems.  Classical control theory techniques require intricate and detailed models of dynamical systems, and assume that information is provided by simple, single output sensing devices (e.g., accelerometers), assumptions that clearly fail in the scenarios envisioned for future autonomous systems.  Conversely, while techniques from machine and reinforcement learning can accommodate both uncertain dynamic conditions and rich perceptual sensing modalities, they tend to either focus solely on performance and ignore safety/robustness concerns, or if they do address safety, are only applicable to a limited class of systems.  Despite recent progress in principled integration of learning and control, there still exists a wide gap between the class of systems that can be certified as safe, 2045834robust, and high-performing, and real-world autonomous systems.  This project aims to develop a research plan that builds the foundations of a novel theory of robust learning and robust control that simultaneously addresses the challenges of safety and performance across a wide range of safety-critical real-world autonomous systems.  The research outcomes of this project will be integrated into a synergistic education plan which includes developing both graduate and undergraduate courses at the University of Pennsylvania aimed at enriching the curriculum for teaching autonomy and control systems to engineers.   Publicly available education platforms and outreach programs within the University of Pennsylvania will also be leveraged to build a pipeline for STEM majors entering college, to advance public communication around autonomy and control systems, and to disseminate research results.<br/><br/>This proposal argues that a novel cross-disciplinary perspective on robust control and robust machine learning is required to unlock the true potential of learning-based control in safety-critical complex, dynamic, and uncertain scenarios.  Thrusts will develop novel robust learning-based control strategies that explicitly characterize and account for the effects of uncertainty in the learning and control pipeline.  The first thrust focuses on learning to control an unknown dynamical system using contemporary high-capacity models, such as deep neural networks, through a synergistic integration of robust learning and robust control techniques aimed at mitigating the deleterious effects of distribution shift on closed-loop performance.  The second thrust focuses on extending the robustness and stability guarantees of control theory to systems with complex, high-dimensional sensing modalities such as cameras, by developing tools that allow for such complex perceptual sensors to be abstractly viewed as ?noisy-virtual sensors? that are amenable to traditional robust control methods.  Finally, the third thrust initiates a study of the fundamental limits of the robustness and sample-complexity of learning-enabled controllers, using perception-based control as a case study.  Thus, through an interdisciplinary mix of tools from control theory, machine & reinforcement learning, statistical learning theory, and robust optimization, this project will develop novel broadly applicable joint robust learning and robust control tools that come with strong guarantees of performance, robustness, safety, and sample-efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two main reasons why an object is difficult to image optically: 1) the object does not significantly scatter or absorb light and is practically invisible, and/or 2) the object information is reduced by the imaging systems performance and resolving power. The challenge in current imaging technologies is the crucial need for smart and active systems that adapt themselves to increase the visibility of objects or features of interest with high specificity. This project addresses the requirements for a reconfigurable imaging system that provides quantitative information with high specificity and selectivity. This will enable faster and more accurate studies of biological and industrial samples. For example, automated and more accurate diagnoses will dramatically improve advances and outcomes in the fields of microbiology, personalized medicine, pathology, visual optics, brain imaging, and ultra-precision manufacturing industries. These applications can directly impact US national security, productivity, economic growth, and the health of its citizens. Improved quantitative information will provide more effective ways to harness ""big data"" using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. The project includes hands-on research and mentoring experiences in physics and photonics for high-school students and teaching strategies to foster the curiosity and talent of undergraduates. Specific outreach components are designed to make STEM education more accessible, especially for high schools in North Carolina. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/>This CAREER research project addresses the critical need for a reconfigurable imaging system that provides the required image information with quantitative attributes and high specificity by smart and adaptive selectivity of spatial frequency content. The spatial frequency content of an image carries information on the size, shape, and orientation of the object or features to be analyzed. Selective enhancement, or isolation of key spatial frequencies, for the object will include background noise from small-angle scatter, for example, which reduces visibility. The goal of this project is to address these issues and provide a new mathematical framework for wavefront, and hence spatial frequency, shaping to enhance those spatial frequencies relevant to improved imaging.  This framework will provide new fundamental knowledge to advance nonlinear imaging and smart adaptive methods based on nonlinear effects for general imaging needs. The derived models will be validated in an optical system and contribute to study objects with low visibility (transparent and small area compared to the field of view). This research project will leverage smart optical materials for adaptive use and wavefront shaping techniques to extend the frontier of today's imaging systems. Research outcomes are expected to overcome signal-to-noise ratio limitations, provide active selectivity of an object's or it's feature's visibility, and thereby provide accurate 3D measurements and advance the field of quantitative imaging. This project aligns with the Ten Big Ideas from NSF by developing a method that can deliver quantitative information and parameters to harness massive data, enable automated analysis allowing collaboration between machines with humans, and strengthen networks in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project leverages advances in quantum-mechanics-based materials simulations, data science, and artificial intelligence to discover new solar cell materials. A fraction of excess energy of light in the form of high-energy photons absorbed by solar cell materials can be converted to heat rather than to electric current. This results in a loss of energy conversion efficiency. Many crystals are made of atoms that self-arrange in a regular spatially periodic pattern. Crystals can be made where organic molecules can form the fundamental unit instead of atoms. These molecular crystals may undergo a process known as singlet fission, which enables the conversion of that excess light energy into current carrying charges rather than heat. Singlet-fission-based solar cells are not yet a commercial technology due to dearth of suitable materials that exhibit this process. Over a million molecular crystal structures are known, but it is unknown for which ones singlet fission can occur. Experiments and even advanced quantum mechanical simulations are too costly and time consuming to test many known or predicted new molecular crystals. To overcome this barrier, the interdisciplinary team of experts in computational materials science and statistics will harness methods of data science and artificial intelligence. The team will investigate the use of machine learning methods to accelerate the process of materials discovery by rapidly identifying potentially promising candidate molecular crystals. The team will generate data from quantum-mechanics-based simulations to construct and iteratively improve machine-learned models.

There has been much interest in singlet fission because of its potential to significantly increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by harvesting two charge carriers from one photon. However, few materials are presently known to exhibit intermolecular singlet fission with high efficiency, hindering the realization of solid-state singlet-fission-based solar cells. The chemical compound space of possible chromophores is infinitely vast and largely unexplored. To enable computational discovery of materials that exhibit singlet fission, the interdisciplinary team will develop a multi-fidelity screening approach, integrating quantum-mechanics-based simulations at different levels of fidelity with machine learning and database mining. Machine learning algorithms will be used to learn from data generated by simulations and to steer simulations for further data acquisition. The machine learning models will dynamically adapt as more data is acquired. This will be implemented in a fully automated iterative workflow, designed to run on exascale high performance computers. <br/>This research will advance the discovery of new intermolecular singlet fission chromophores, which will catalyze the realization of ""third generation"" solid-state singlet-fission-based organic solar cells. Structure-property correlations revealed by machine learning will advance the fundamental understanding of singlet fission by deriving chemical insights and design rules for chromophores and crystal forms with enhanced singlet-fission efficiency. In addition to singlet-fission chromophores, materials may be discovered with desirable properties for other organic electronic device applications. In addition, this project will lead to new methodology needed to tackle the data-science challenges posed by searching for singlet fission materials. This project will lead to statistical developments in optimal sampling strategies for high-dimensional problems involving many data sources and in adaptive models that dynamically evolve as more data is acquired. The developed approach may be extended to other problems, where properties of interest arise from complex phenomena, for which data acquisition is costly or time consuming, and predictive descriptors are unknown. <br/>This project also supports training in advanced high-performance computing at the exascale, and community building at the intersection of materials science and data science through organizing workshops and conferences.

Algebraic geometry has ancient origins with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and number theory. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to robotics and to the analysis of large data sets, and a recent revolution in the foundations of algebraic topology has broadened its applicability to other fields of pure mathematics. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several well-known questions and conjectures in algebraic geometry. Some of these questions will be investigated jointly with students as part of undergraduate research projects in the Mathematical Computing Laboratory at UIC, which the PI founded in 2015 with David Dumas and Jan Verschelde. This integration will provide valuable opportunities for students to engage in research and impact ongoing research.<br/><br/>The PI will work on several projects at the border of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. Three projects aim to use various topological methods to understand the Brauer group and Azumaya algebras as well as the role of higher algebraic structures in algebraic geometry. (1) The PI will study (higher) algebraic representatives of tale cohomology classes, generalizing the connection between the Picard and Brauer groups and low-degree cohomology groups. (2) The PI will explore separate applications of motivic homotopy theory and persistent homology to the period-index conjecture with the aim of finding algebraic counterexamples to the conjecture. (3) The PI will explore the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem in characteristic p, specifically focusing on the question of whether or not the local-global spectral sequence for Hochschild homology degenerates at the E_2-page for smooth projective surfaces in characteristic 2."

These mat worlds are dominated by motile filaments of microbes that variably use sunlight and chemicals in their daily routines and offer opportunities for discovering novel microorganisms and ecosystem processes. Recently, complex patterns of daily vertical migration has been observed in the field, suggesting different microbes migrate vertically to the surface of the mat during daylight and nighttime. This project is unraveling the who, why and how of daily microbial migration through integration of microscopy, cultures, molecular approaches, and process rate measurements in response to changing gradients of light, sulfide and oxygen over the day-night cycle. This project places the vertical migration of microbial mats into a broader geobiological context through comparisons with other globally distributed cyanobacterial mat systems such as terrestrial springs and ice-covered Antarctic lakes. Furthermore, the diverse and versatile sinkhole mats may serve as a useful working model for robotic exploration of similar life in extraterrestrial waters like that of Jupiter?s Europa or Saturn?s Enceladus. This project is generating compelling student projects, attracting public imagination, and fueling active collaboration between two predominantly undergraduate institutions and a National Marine Sanctuary.<br/><br/><br/>The functioning of cyanobacteria under sulfidic, low O2-conditions is a major gap in our understanding of Earth?s oxygenation in the past. Recently, time-lapse images of diel vertical migration (DVM) were collected revealing alternating waves of vertically migrating photosynthetic and chemosynthetic filaments that followed daily fluctuating light in microbial mats in Lake Huron?s sinkholes; observations corroborated with intact mats under simulated day-night conditions in the laboratory. Such synchronized diel movement, might have played a critical role in optimizing photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, carbon burial, and oxygenation during the Precambrian. This project is evaluating the taxa involved in DVM and is probing geobiological controls on DVM under low-O2, sulfidic conditions using macro- and microscopic imaging, physico-chemical microprofiling, culturing, genetics, and allelopathic studies. Three central issues are being addressed: (1) what taxa are responsible for the DVM? (2) how and why do they perform DVM? and (3) what are the ecosystem consequences of DVM community and activity synergies? The project is revealing specific microbial populations, metabolic pathways, and geochemical processes that underpin mat biogeochemistry over the diel cycle. Studying microbial communities that have regular and measurable daily rhythms in processes that can also be tracked at micrometer scales yields an unprecedented view of the molecular underpinnings of microbial mat biogeochemistry and lays the foundation for future studies aimed at re-defining the role of autotrophic communities in ancient seas and modern ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for controlling a system.  A typical commercial aircraft has several independent hydraulic systems and one or two pumps to pressurize the systems. These systems are used to control the flight surfaces that control the movement of the aircraft in the air. These systems add a great deal of weight to the aircraft. In the development of vehicles for the aerospace industry, space and weight are always of great concern. This technology has the potential to reduce the weight and footprint of actuators used in aircraft by eliminating the need for hydraulic systems. This project has a potential added benefit of also reducing the fire risk for aircraft experiencing an emergency in the air or during landing. Finally, this technology has the potential to aid satellite and rocket manufacturing industries with similar motivations for adoption.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of additive manufacturing strategies for shape memory alloys. Shape memory alloys are a class of materials that allow the materials to be formed into a desired shape, which is called the parent shape. This parent shape can then be deformed and upon the application of heat above a certain threshold, the material will revert to its parent shape exhibiting a ?shape memory.? Nickle and titanium are readily alloyed to produce shape memory alloy actuators. However, traditional machining of nickel titanium alloys are challenging due to their high hardness and the fact that the heat generated during machining has the potential to change the properties of the material. The use of additive manufacturing using a high-powered laser to melt powdered metals is used to address the difficulties associated with traditional machining. The use of specific printing strategies has been developed to modify the threshold temperature of the actuator during printing and thus, enable the material properties to be tailored.  This tailoring allows the development of actuators customized to the customers? specific needa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ARDS causes deactivation of the lungs? surfactant, which is responsible for keeping the lung structure inflated and dry. This causes inadequate blood oxygenation and mutli-organ failure without invasive mechanical ventilation. ARDS is believed to account for 7% of the world?s ICU beds and can be caused by many root causes, including both direct lung injuries (i.e. bacterial/viral pneumonia) and indirect lung injuries (i.e. trauma). In the case of the pandemic, current data suggests that 14% of COVID-19 cases require hospitalization. Of these patients, 1 in 3 will develop ARDS, reducing their chance of survival to 60%. In a normal year there are 3 million ARDS cases globally (220k US) that are highly resource intensive (avg. $82k treatment cost), which presents a considerable financial burden on patients and healthcare systems. A therapeutic treatment would reduce patient deaths and frequency of chronic complications.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a different approach to ARDS treatment via a synthetic Polymer Lung Surfactant (PLS) technology. This PLS technology overcomes shortcomings of previously attempted therapies as it is engineered to be safely used in the body, highly surface-active (lower surface tension), water-soluble (prepared in injectable aqueous suspension), and resistant to protein deactivation. Suspended in solution, PLS is evenly distributed in the lungs of mechanically ventilated patients. When PLS reaches the alveoli, it forms a gas-permeable micelle monolayer that mimics the function of human lung surfactant without being deactivated.  Doing so re-inflates the alveoli while reducing fluid accumulation and inflammation so that blood oxygenation can be restored. Building upon promising PLS safety/efficacy proof-of-concept data, specific aim #1 of this project will optimize delivery parameters in mice that have been induced with ARDS by differing root causes (infection vs. acid-aspiration). Specific aim #2 will use iodine-labeled PLS to generate distribution and clearance data in mice from delivery to several days post-treatment. This data will be used to optimize key delivery and PLS parameters to ensure that maximum efficacy is sustained for several days.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological therapies remain the standard for autoimmune diseases, but patients can have immune system problems due to the production of autoantibodies. This project addresses this challenge with a novel encapsulation technology that delivers biological therapies to hard-to-reach inflammation sites. This technology could be advantageous because it reduces immunosuppression and anti-drug antibodies production. This project will improve patient treatment outcomes and reduce treatment reduce cost. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will test a proof-of-concept that entails demonstrating that an exosome-based delivery vehicle for biologics will potentially inhibit inappropriate TLR-driven inflammation. Induction of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus strongly correlate with chronic inflammation driven by inflammatory signaling pathways mediated by endosomal TLRs. Our goal is to develop an exosome-based therapy that can inhibit poorly accessible endosomal TLR7-driven inflammation. To test this concept, our plan involves genetically modifying human cell lines to produce engineered exosomes that contain anti-TLR7 antibody to inhibit endosomal TLR7-driven inflammation. We will develop a drug encapsulation platform in which engineered exosomes bear an anti-TLR7 antibody fused with an exosome transmembrane protein called tetraspanin. This complex delivers an antibody payload to TLR7 targets located in on endosomal membrane inner surface. This anti-TLR7 antibody will bind to dimer-interfaces of TLR7 monomer and thereby block TLR7 receptor dimerization, which in turn blocks proinflammatory signaling. This work is important because blocking TLR7 receptor activation, which is situated upstream in the signaling cascade, will presumably diminish immunosuppression and lead to a better outcome that current anti-TNF therapies that are more broad spectrum because their site of action is downstream in a signaling pathway axis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the genomics of bacteriophages.<br/><br/>Northwest Indian College (NWIC) students will collect and isolate their own mycobacteriophage (phage) from samples collected on or near campus, with one project focusing on the cyanobacteria of the Salish Sea. Students will purify the elected phage and isolate its genomic DNA, and then conduct a restricted digest analysis of a portion of phage genomic DNA to confirm genomic DNA integrity and to examine if the restriction pattern is similar to previously characterized phages. Students will also prepare electron microscopy grids fixed with their purified phage and work with NWIC's Salish Sea Research Center to determine their phage morphology. The genome of one phage will then be sent to the University of Pittsburg for genomic sequencing, and during the second half of the course the students will use gene-searching tools to identify and annotate the probable genes. Students will also compare the results of their gene coding to known, characterized mycobacteriophage genomes before uploading their completed product to GenBank, an online database of genetic sequences maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Current microscopes are limited by a tradeoff between image resolution, viewing area and video frame rate, which presents a bottleneck in many imaging experiments. For example, current microscopes cannot observe model organisms such as the zebrafish and fruit fly at cellular detail during free movement. By simultaneously capturing high-speed, high-resolution video over a large viewing area, this proposal?s new microscope will overcome the limitations of standard microscopes to allow scientists to make new discoveries surrounding fundamental behaviors.It will also dramatically increase the speed and scope of current high-content screening experiments that observe many organisms at high-resolution in parallel, and will also open  new applications in high-throughput industrial inspection. <br/><br/>The proposed project will address the limited throughput challenges faced by current microscopes by adopting a novel parallelized imaging strategy. To overcome current trade-offs between image resolution, field-of-view and frame rate, the project?s first research objective is to develop a new type of microscope consisting of an array of micro-cameras simultaneously observing a large viewing area at high resolution and high speed. Synchronized image data captured by 54 micro-cameras, arranged in a 9x6 array, will be digitally combined via novel software into 100 megapixel-per-frame video at 100 frames per second. The resulting video stream will contain 10-100X more pixels per frame than any other high-speed image sensor currently on the market. The project?s second research objective is to create software that can efficiently process the large amount of resulting image data to enable efficient storage and analysis. The software?s first specific goal is to track, crop and analyze video data of multiple freely moving organisms to extract key behavioral statistics (e.g., position, orientation, body length/curvature). The project?s third research objective is to test and verify the new imaging hardware and software in a series of biological experiments monitoring the high-speed behavior of Drosophila Melanogaster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing open-source and commercial tools used in industry and academia, to predict dispersion of droplets and aerosols, rely on simplistic models that fail to capture details of the underlying turbulent flow physics. In this project, through a combined experimental and computational approach, advancements are made towards the development of improved models that could be easily embraced through direct implementation into existing tools. This project also encompasses significant education and outreach activities. The investigators will expand their ongoing efforts to adopt Virtual Reality based imaging to enable immersive three-dimensional representations of droplet-laden expiratory flow as an educational tool. These educational tools will be used for outreach events and workshops at both Auburn University and the University of Michigan.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this collaborative experimental and computational project is to quantify the fundamental flow physics that govern the transport and dispersion of droplets in a pulsatile expiratory flow. Using an ex-vivo cough simulator and human subject experiments combined with direct numerical simulations we will quantify the role of flow interactions, generated by pulsatile expiratory flow, on aerosol dispersion and assess the penetration length of secondary expulsions. By combining time-resolved velocimetry with an extensively validated fluid-particle simulation methodology, this effort will break ground in uncovering new flow physics relating the influence of flow interactions on the entrainment and dispersion of droplets. Some of the anticipated outcomes include: (1) an extensive database of experimental measurements and high-resolution simulations; and (2) a sound theoretical foundation for modeling turbulent disperse two-phase flows. Such improved quantification of flow physics and development of reduced-order models will enable better prediction of droplet dispersion, a key step towards understanding the spread of viral infections. The methods developed will be used to study the interaction of droplet-laden expiratory jets with flow barriers (for example face shields) and evaluate their efficacy to mitigate the dispersion of impinging expiratory flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A foliation looks locally like a decomposition of the manifold as a union of parallel submanifolds of lower dimensions. Such geometric structures naturally arise in physics and geology. And in mathematics the depth and breadth of foliated objects made mathematicians use tools from many different branches of mathematics including differential geometry, homotopy theory, noncommutative geometry, ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The PI intends to use new tools from homotopy theory to investigate the relation between foliations and diffeomorphism groups.<br/><br/>The existence and classification of foliations and the implication of such structures on the global topology of manifolds have been extensively studied in the past five decades. However, there are still many mysteries, perhaps the most important of which in the homotopy theory of foliation is the Haefliger conjecture. Haefliger asked whether all plane fields on a manifold whose dimensions are roughly less than the half of the dimension of the manifold are integrable up to homotopy. It was shown by Mather and Thurston that the homotopy theory of foliations is naturally related to the homological invariants of the diffeomorphism groups made discrete.  But the group homologies of diffeomorphism groups as discrete groups tend to be very large and are poorly understood. On the other hand diffeomorphism group with the Whitney topology is better understood, in particular, Galatius and Randal-Williams' program developed new tools to study the classifying space of these groups with the Whitney topology. The PI's plan is to combine the new homotopy theoretical methods that stem from the evolving field of the moduli space of manifolds with the classical foliation theory to study homological invariants of diffeomorphism groups made discrete.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Being able to predict the emergence of pandemic threats, therefore, requires a fully integrated, multidisciplinary approach, able to consider the complexity of these realms across scales of interaction to predict and, ideally, prevent.  This workshop is one of four bringing experts from scholarly communities in the social and behavioral sciences, biology, engineering, and computer science together to discuss how to integrate the approaches taken by each community into a more effective, unified science of pandemic prediction.  The focus of this workshop is on developing understanding of how human attitudes, social behavior, and the drivers underlying both shape patterns of infectious-disease transmission and efforts at control and eradication.  This fundamental understanding in turn will facilitate pandemic prevention and control decisions that leave us better prepared when confronted with future pandemic threats.<br/><br/>The workshop is structured to focus on four topical areas of crucial importance, dealing with cultural transmission, information and communication, equity, and sustainability. The white paper that comes from this workshop will provide important guidance for incorporating insights into the social and behavioral sciences into predictive intelligence and pandemic prevention.   It will inform future research investments, institutional capacity-building, and other policy priorities aimed at keeping the US and the world safe from inevitable future pandemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such interactions are responsible for forming new stars, growing a galaxy's central supermassive black hole, and driving energetic outflows. However, the detailed physics behind them is still poorly understood. Though nearby and easily studied, the Milky Way's center is relatively quiet. Few stars are forming in this region, and the black hole is not active. Because of this, the Milky Way is not a representative example of the full suite of processes that occur in these environments. This project will make the first comparison of gas properties in the Milky Way center with those in a more active galaxy. This work will lead to advances in our understanding of how the physics of the gas in galaxy centers is linked to inflow and outflow processes. In addition, this work will support a partnership with a prison education program to develop and teach math-intensive astronomy courses that will prepare incarcerated students to be part of a STEM-literate workforce. <br/><br/>A key area of investigation, and a priority identified in the 2010 Decadal Survey, is what goes on in galaxy centers: the interactions between stars, black holes and gas. Until recently there has only been one galaxy where these interactions can be investigated in detail: The Milky Way, an inactive and relatively sedate galaxy. Now however, the capabilities offered by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) make it possible to conduct detailed comparisons of gas properties and interactions in the Milky Way center with those in other galaxy centers. Using new radio and millimeter observations of the Milky Way's Galactic center, this project will first make detailed studies of gas properties to constrain how accretion itself modifies gas conditions, and not just feedback from processes it drives (e.g., starbursts which are absent in the Galactic center). By relating the gas properties on sub-parsec scales determined by this study (scales that can only be probed in our own Galaxy center) to the properties on the parsec and larger scales, this work will test how well global properties probed in other galaxies represent the true properties on smaller scales. Ultimately, this project will directly compare the properties on parsec scales with new ALMA observations of the nearest starburst galaxy on identical parsec scales. Their work is the first 'apples to apples' comparison of detailed gas properties in galaxy nuclei: probing how interstellar medium properties change in the presence of a starburst, and advancing the understanding of our Galaxy center beyond a single case study. Finally, this program will produce a library of templates for the extreme gas properties in these nuclei that can be used to interpret conditions in distant, high redshift galaxies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond its legal ramifications, its definition impacts tribal culture, member well-being, and even tribal survival.  Tribal constitutions serve as a component of tribal sovereignty, and many tribal governments regard their constitutions as a cornerstone of self-determination.  But constitutions do not develop in a vacuum; they are the result of historical trajectories and power processes that shape modern states. The decision to constitutionalize, and the content of a constitution, give insight into how a society thinks about self-determination, self-governance, and justice. This relationship is complicated in the context of tribal constitutions because tribes, as sovereign-dependent nations, developed their claims to self-governance in the shadow of empire.  <br/><br/>The investigators have compiled a comprehensive database of 1,053 tribal constitutions or amendments from 304 tribes (88% of the currently 345 federally recognized Indian tribes in the continental U.S.), representing nearly 150 years of tribal constitutional history. They have developed a comprehensive coding scheme to map constitutional provisions and track historical change over time.  Using this database, they will study four constitutional areas closely connected to sovereignty: (1) tribal constitutional origins; (2) citizenship and rights; (3) tribal courts; and (4) legislative power.     Each area of research raises questions of how power is constructed, whether through coercion, resistance, economic development, institutional structures, etc.  Finding answers to these questions will depend on comparison of numerous institutions, a reading of complex constitutional documents with interacting institutional forms, and methods which allow visualization of changes over time.  The investigators will use a multi-methodological approach, combining computational social science methods, causal analysis, and qualitative legal analysis.  This research exploring the documents and institutions of tribal governance will expand our understanding of tribal power today and its development over time.  The findings will contribute to discussions of tribal sovereignty and the relationship between tribes and the federal government and will bring tribal governance into the rich field of constitutionalism and comparative constitutionalism.  Centering the experience of tribes in constitutional studies will not only advance work on colonialism and self-determination, it will provide concrete insights into the ways in which constitutional language shapes political discourse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GVHD is a devastating illness that afflicts transplant recipients who are recovering from chemotherapy and who suffer from suppression of their bone marrow function and immune system. GVHD associated illnesses lead to a very high rate of premature death in these patients. This project focuses on the development of a novel biocomputational platform to generate patient-derived stem cells to be subsequently reintroduced to the same cancer patient. This completely bypasses third-party bone marrow and blood donations, decreasing, and potentially eliminating, lethal GVHD and drastically improving outcomes. The use of cells derived directly from the same patient (e.g. skin cells) to reconstitute the blood system is considered one of the highest and most challenging goals of blood system regenerative biology research. This will advance bioinformatics and cell therapy research and will advance the state-of-the-art in cancer treatment and personalized medicine.<br/><br/>The proposed project will use a high-fidelity prototype computational tool to generate transcription factor recipes for cellular transdifferentiation, test those predicted recipes through systematic and high-throughput wetlab validations, and demonstrate proof of concept for the autologous production of persistent HSCs that maintain long-term multilineage engraftment and self-renewal, potentially enabling recapitulation of the entire blood lineage. The project scope includes an effort to survey, identify, and procure appropriate initial cell types; determine cell type-specific predictions for reprogramming into HSCs; prioritize the most promising recipes and carry out appropriate viral transductions; create an in vitro analog of target HSCs and determine alignment with the human HSC phenotype; and perform reprogramming experiments for the top transcription factor recipes. Data analysis will include key comparisons of reprogrammed HSCs, in vitro analog HSCs, primary human HSCs, and data from prior published efforts to produce HSCs. HSCs are fundamentally different from the differentiated cell types previously targeted with the computational tool, as they retain proliferative potential and are therefore very difficult to generate. Proof of concept in this challenging system will not only address GVHD, but also further prove the efficacy of the overall biocomputational platform for use in numerous other biological systems and potential cures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the research on these topics do not consider the distinction between couples and singles. This project utilizes a rich framework including both couples and singles to examine taxation, Social Security, and Medicaid, with the goal of evaluating the costs and benefits of these programs. The findings in this research will have broad policy implications on these government programs. The research will respond to the urgent need in understanding these costs and benefits given the recent COVID-19 induced recession and corresponding challenges in raising taxes and financing government programs.<br/><br/>This research project will yield two main contributions. First, it will carefully estimate a rich structural model of longevity and medical expenses risks, and bequest motives of couples and singles during retirement. Second, it will develop an overlapping-generations model with working and retirement stages for couples and singles and it will use this model to study the costs and benefits of several Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid reforms, in conjunction with various tax changes. The first part of the project will yield new findings about the elderly, which will help in understanding the risks that they face and the tools that they currently have at their disposal to insure these risks. The second part of this project will explore how to reform Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security in a model that incorporates couples and singles, the risks that they face, and their motivation to work and save.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At many institutions, part-time faculty teach introductory STEM courses.  As a result, these faculty have an essential role in creating equitable opportunities for student success in STEM. However, institutional reliance on part-time faculty has been associated with lower first-year persistence and lower graduation rates.  Few research studies have examined what part-time faculty do in the classroom and how their actions relate to student learning. STEM education reform efforts often do not include part-time faculty, even though studies document the desire of part-time faculty to be included in institutional efforts, their interest in collaboration, and their need for greater awareness of campus resources and policies. This Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project intends to enhance the effectiveness of part-time faculty, leading to increased student success and persistence of students in first-year STEM courses taught by the participating faculty. <br/><br/>The project will develop a comprehensive faculty development program for part-time STEM faculty at Elmhurst University. Over the three-year duration of the project, 45 part-time STEM faculty members will participate in intensive faculty development.  The development programming will combine training in teaching methods with training about campus resources, including institutional support mechanisms as well as retention and inclusion initiatives. This comprehensive approach may serve as a model for other small, liberal arts institutions, that increasingly rely on part-time faculty. Through this sustained multi-year professional development effort, it is expected that part-time faculty will develop more student-centered conceptions of teaching, increase their use of evidence-based and inclusive teaching practices, and exhibit an increased sense of belonging with the institution. The project will expand institutional support for part-time STEM faculty by establishing a STEM department chair workshop focused on integrating part-time faculty into departmental conversations around teaching and learning, as well as supporting sustained professional development through participation in an online course in effective teaching. The improvements in instruction, combined with a greater ability to connect students with campus resources, are expected to enhance student success in first-year STEM courses. The proposed research study associated with the project will investigate specific changes in the part-time faculty members? attitudes and behaviors related to their conceptions of teaching, use of evidence-based practices, and sense of belonging to the institution. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The risk-compensation bias argues that individuals adjust their at-risk behaviors to achieve a balance between potential risks and benefits and thereby maintain a target level of risk. Derived from external (e.g., task or environmental-related) and internal (e.g., individual characteristics) sources, risk compensation ultimately influences an individual?s (deliberative, affective, and experiential) risk perception as a central predictor of health and safety-related behaviors and certain risky decisions. Decision making under risk is mainly studied at the individual level in the construction-safety setting. However, drawing on social influence and behavioral intention theories, coworkers? risk-taking serves as an ?extra motive? of risk-taking behavior among workers in the workplace. Thus, studying the risk-compensation effect in the construction environment can become more complicated given that construction workers work in groups, and coworker behavior can influence safety-related behavior. Furthermore, the effects of heat exposure and subsequent heat stress might translate into an increased risk of injury caused by physical discomfort, fatigue, and reduced vigilance that can influence worker emotional state and risk perception, and lead to cognitive failure, misperceiving hazards, and neglecting precautionary behavior. Accordingly, this multidisciplinary project addresses these gaps by integrating psychological science, artificial intelligence (AI), and advances in construction safety to deliver a novel theoretical platform and empirical process to understand the latent changes in worker decision dynamics following an intervention for greater protection from injury.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of this study are to (1) examine the extent to which individuals? characteristics and psychological states, along with task and environmental factors (e.g., time pressure, extreme heat) influence workers? at-risk decisions; (2) determine the role of risk compensation bias on team risk perception, decision making, and work behavior; and (3) develop a multidimensional AI model to identify at-risk workers and interpret their risky decision-making, using limited attributes including individual, task, and environmental-related factors. To achieve these objectives, a multi-sensor immersive 360 mixed-reality environment that consists of passive haptics and environmental modalities is used to raise the workers? sense of presence, capture their realistic responses to safety features during various current and future construction tasks. A combination of qualitative and quantitative measures serve to investigate the underlying mechanisms of workers? risk-compensatory behaviors and decisions. The measures derive from location-tracking sensors, vision-based sensors, wireless neuropsychological and cognitive brain monitoring (fNIRS), eye-tracker, photoplethysmography (PPG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) psychophysiological sensors, semi-structured interviews, demographic, and psychographic surveys. The collected data constitutes information about workers? behavioral changes simulated using agent-based modeling, and used to develop a multidimensional predictive model to minimize the likelihood of risk compensation and to prevent incidents and injuries. The project outcomes have the potential to impact the performance of a nationwide industry and create a novel platform for enhancing the national research and education infrastructure.

In the course of a year, COVID-related illness has claimed the lives of more than 2 million people across the globe and more than 400,000 people in the United States. The outbreak has exposed critical vulnerabilities in our healthcare system and created unprecedented logistical challenges in the distribution of equipment, vaccines, tests, and other resources. Furthermore, policymakers have found themselves facing difficult choices regarding the timing and severity of non-therapeutic interventions which slow the spread of disease but also incur negative economic and downstream health impacts. An optimal adaptive decision strategy uses accumulating data to inform how resources should be allocated over space and time to maximize cumulative health while controlling cost. In this context, an optimal decision strategy has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives, use resources more efficiently, and reduce negative economic impacts. This research project develops new methodologies for estimation of optimal decision strategies using heterogeneous data streams including human mobility data, air traffic, as well as information on disease spread and vaccine dissemination. This project also provides training opportunities for students and a postdoctoral scholar. <br/><br/>This research project advances statistical and mathematical disease models by including behavior-change into stochastic compartmental models. The integration of multiple data streams including human-mobility, the census, incidence and testing reports, vaccination dissemination, and air-travel allows for richer and more realistic models than those fit using a single data modality. Furthermore, mobility data linked with census data will generate new knowledge about heterogeneity in response to interventions such as shelter-in-place across demographics. These models are integrated into novel spatio-temporal reinforcement learning methods for estimation of an optimal decision strategy that recommends how resources and non-therapeutic interventions should be allocated across multiple resolutions (e.g., locally and nationally) to minimize disease spread subject to constraints on economic and other downstream impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The measures derive from location-tracking sensors, vision-based sensors, wireless neuropsychological and cognitive brain monitoring (fNIRS), eye-tracker, photoplethysmography (PPG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) psychophysiological sensors, semi-structured interviews, demographic, and psychographic surveys. The collected data constitutes information about workers? behavioral changes simulated using agent-based modeling, and used to develop a multidimensional predictive model to minimize the likelihood of risk compensation and to prevent incidents and injuries. The project outcomes have the potential to impact the performance of a nationwide industry and create a novel platform for enhancing the national research and education infrastructure. They advance protection mechanisms for thousands of American workers and save estimated billions of dollars in financial costs per year in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project builds on the notion that this assumption is unlikely to hold. The public debt is like an asset whose cash flows are the government?s future primary surpluses. Because surpluses are cyclical in the short run and track the country?s output in the long run, this cash flow is risky and should earn a risk premium. The proper discount rate must exceed the risk-free interest rate. This project develops a model for pricing government debt considering the risk in cash flows and assesses the implications of this for taxpayers and for bondholders. This research points to the important distinction that risk-free rate should not be compared to the GDP growth rate, but to the risk-adjusted growth rate. The project has potential deep and broad contributions to policies on government debt capacity and sustainability of fiscal policies.  <br/><br/>In any equilibrium model with permanent shocks to output and reasonable asset pricing implications for the returns on stocks and bonds, the time series properties of the surplus that are consistent with the U.S. data result in government debt that is risky. Assumption of risk-free debt impose tight restrictions on the government?s surplus dynamics such that these restrictions are violated in the data. This project analyzes the underlying trade-off between the insurance provided to bondholders by keeping the debt risk-free and the insurance provided to taxpayers and transfer recipients. This insight gives rise to key questions that are explored in this project. First, the project looks at why the returns on the U.S. Treasury portfolio are so low if the surpluses are risky. Second, the research explores other developed countries in this regard to understand whether U.S. is different, and then considers the role of the demand for safe assets and the role of the U.S. as the world?s main supplier of safe assets within this context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The global power device market exceeds $15 billion in 2019 and is fast growing. Gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are commonly perceived as the next generation of power devices. Despite their initial commercialization recently, their wide adoption in industrial applications is hindered by the limitation in reliability and robustness, resulting in considerable over design, rendering device performance far below the material limit. This project will develop a new generation of robust, charge-balanced GaN HEMTs through innovation in the semiconductor materials and device structure. Interdisciplinary research will be carried out in materials, devices, fabrication processes, and circuit-level tests through collaboration between Virginia Tech and the University of Southern California in the United States, as well as University of Cambridge in United Kingdom under the ?NSF Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Lead Agency Opportunity (ENG-EPSRC)?. This US-UK collaborative project provides opportunities for student education and international exchange, development of cross-university teaching modules, and industrial collaboration for potential technology transfer. This interdisciplinary, cross-continent project also involves outreach activities for K-12 students and teachers, and promotes educational activities related to microelectronics and power electronics technologies.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This overarching hypothesis is that robust gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) can be implemented by selective-area, nearly defect-free embedding of p-type regions into the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel, forming a novel charge-balanced super-junction structure. This novel 2D-3D super-junction structure can not only enhance the device robustness by managing the electric field and avalanche capability, but also allow significantly higher 2DEG density while maintaining the normally-off operation, thereby decreasing the device specific on-resistance and boosting its switching frequency. Despite these promises, major gaps exist in the device physics of the novel super-junction, interfacial material properties, and the dynamic performance of super-junction HEMTs in power electronic circuits. Funded by the ?NSF Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Lead Agency Opportunity (ENG-EPSRC)?, this project aims to address the scientific knowledge gaps in four relevant areas through the US-UK research collaboration: (a) to explore the design space and performance limits of the novel super-junction HEMT device; (b) to probe new methods of selectively introducing p-type dopants into the 2DEG channel to realize the super-junction functionality; (c) to develop an in-depth understanding of the dopant profiles, carrier transport, and trap dynamics in the nitride super-junction structure; and (d) to correlate the nano/mesoscale materials and interface properties with the dynamic characteristics and robustness of GaN HEMTs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to continuous, layer-based, additive deposition processes, this approach relies on discrete assembly.

The goals of this project are to define a material system (constituent material, unit cell geometry, and fastening solution) that can achieve high stiffness-to-weight ratios at low cost. Such properties do not currently exist in a single monolithic material; rather, they are achieved through expensive processes to shape traditional materials into complex geometries. These methods are labor-intensive and have significant capital expenditure for tooling. This project will demonstrate the ability of discrete lattice materials to match state-of-the-art while offering cost reductions through automation, reduction in factory overhead, and performance benefits unachievable with traditional methods.

In addition, the technology may democratize artificial intelligence (AI) to ordinary organizational managers who may not possess sophisticated analytics skills. The current AI models lack interactive and intuitive storytelling.  Matching the hierarchical clustering of data with a causal knowledge graph, the proposed technology will prepare user data in a way that mimics a general manager?s intuitive thinking.  The technology addresses a commercial gap in the market  - that of a lack of prescriptive capability, that is, telling end-users what they should do. Data may be collected from different sources in an organization, so they are fragmented and the causal links are lost. The external source of a causal knowledge graph fills the gap by presenting and interpreting the hidden causal links in EPM data.

The proposed technology delivers cold plasma directly to wound sites over a short treatment time (measured in minutes), that will promote wound healing, reduce overall bed rest, and lessen the use of topical ointments formulated for surface wound healing. The technology utilizes a physical means to disinfect wounds allowing it to treat chemically resistant infections. Additionally, the technology utilizes plasma-generated radical species to promote late phase inflammation and wound contraction through the activation of fibroblast cells that induce the production of collagen. The technology is designed to deliver cold plasma through a device to promote wound healing while maintaining a level of sterilization to prevent reinfection. The device may be manipulated allowing for the treatment of a large variety of wound sizes.  Various studies have shown that the technology may produce up to a 25% reduction in wound healing time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Prairie View A&M University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to access energy resources with vast available space and fewer restrictions and regulations. The project seeks to analyze floating offshore wind turbine uncertainties that arise due to the ocean environment and hydrodynamic calculations, as well as due to uncertainties in the structural and mechanical systems, which threaten the reliability and the feasibility of FOWTs. Undergraduate students, high school students and students from community colleges will gain research experiences through this project. <br/><br/>The current floating offshore wind turbine technologies have challenges to be resolved in order to produce sustainable and cost-effective power. Semi-submersible type FOWTs are known to be one of the most promising options with construction and maintenance cost problems yet to be solved. This project focuses on identification of the uncertainties and on estimating the structural safety factors. The research objectives of this project are to: understand the uncertainties that exist in FOWTs; predict the structural behavior and life-cycle structural reliability of FOWTs;  and obtain safety factors for structural design of semi-submersible-type FOWTs that uniquely consider the uncertainties and coupled dynamics of aerodynamics of the wind turbine and hydrodynamics of the floating body under extreme environmental loads. By considering the uncertainties found, the probabilistic capacity and demand models for structural components of FOWTs will be developed using a Bayesian Method. Lastly, the developed models will be used to estimate the life-cycle structural reliability and to obtain the safety factors for the base tower moment and shear forces of FOWTs. The results of this research may eventually reduce the current challenge of the high cost of FOWTs."

Food waste is a critically important global challenge. Approximately 30% of food produced for human consumption around the world is either lost or wasted each year ? more than enough to feed the hungry.  It is estimated that food loss and waste also contribute 8% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions. The methods used to reduce waste by extending shelf life are not only ineffective, but they also exacerbate other global problems, such as adversely impacting the environment through extensive use of plastic packaging. The proposed solution uses non-GMO corn to create new edible coatings that will reduce food waste by doubling the shelf life of whole and cut fresh fruits and vegetables, enabling greater access to fresh foods for all communities and improving the environmental impact of food waste. <br/><br/>The proposed project will advance translation for a process using corn zein, considered a water insoluble protein and therefore prohibitively expensive to functionalize in food production. This has prevented its use in food coatings. This project advances translation of a relatively simple process to convert commercial grade zein to a readily water-soluble formulation. The project will develop an effective edible food coating that incorporates other plant-based ingredients, such as fatty acids and plasticizers, to create a hybrid protein/lipid film that (1) exhibits excellent gas barrier as well as moisture barrier properties and extends the shelf life of many under-served commodities; (2) can be generated at reasonable cost; and (3) can be delivered in a single application on existing food processing equipment. The R&D plan will target coatings for a variety of fresh produce that allows comparison with competitive coatings where possible, and provides new coating options where few options are available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by coordinating NNA projects and broader communities, focusing on interactions among social systems, the natural environment, and the built environment.<br/><br/>The Navigating the New Arctic Community Office (NNA-CO) provides leadership to support use-inspired convergence research that solves complex challenges related to the changing Arctic. This approach is crucial for addressing societal needs, such as food sovereignty, climate resilience, and environmental security. The NNA-CO builds awareness, partnerships, opportunities, and resources for collaboration and equitable knowledge generation within, between, and beyond NNA projects. The NNA-CO increases recognition of Indigenous knowledge and data sovereignty; promotes inclusive and collaborative research design and implementation; and coordinates effective knowledge dissemination, education, and outreach. The office builds capacity in early career researchers and provides unique opportunities to inspire and engage a wide audience toward a more holistic understanding of the Arctic?its natural environment, built environment, and diverse cultures and communities.<br/><br/>The NNA-CO is a distributed office with three parts located at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU), Alaska Pacific University (APU) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). The Central Office at CU gains efficiency through affiliations with the co-located Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and the Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR). APU, a tribally controlled, Alaska Native-serving institution, hosts a Community Extension Office for Arctic communities by facilitating local/regional NNA research partnerships and interfacing NNA research with Indigenous cultures, knowledge systems, and research needs. An Education and Outreach (E&O) Field Office at UAF facilitates connections among NNA researchers and communities, teachers, and students across Alaska to maintain coordinated, culturally appropriate, and place-based E&O activities. The NNA-CO serves the NNA community through enhanced communication, coordination, and learning, with a focus on (1) co-production of knowledge with Indigenous Peoples, (2) convergence research, (3) culturally responsive education and outreach, and (4) open science for greater integrity, data-sharing, and reproducibility within NNA projects. The future activities of the NNA-CO will be guided by research and Indigenous advisory boards. Rapid Response and Convergence Working Groups, focused on a range of research areas (e.g., food security, coastal systems, and global connections), bring together relevant NNA investigators and partners to serve as the primary organizing mechanisms. NNA-CO activities extend the impact of NNA projects by creating collaborative opportunities for applying knowledge and usable science to Arctic decision-making. The NNA-CO is essential to advancing knowledge and awareness of the role of the Arctic in the global system, including within biophysical, economic, and socio-cultural contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the US and this number is growing rapidly due to a drastic increase in the number of diabetics, the obese, and the elderly--all populations in which wound healing is impaired. Mesenchymal stem cells (commonly known as adult stem cells) and insulin applied to wound surfaces have each shown promise in healing otherwise unhealable wounds. Mesenchymal stem cells assist wound healing by secreting factors that promote actions critical to wound healing, such as new blood vessel formation, increases in the production of skin components, and recruitment of cells that clean wounds and form scar tissue. Insulin assists wound healing by recruiting mesenchymal stem cells and skin cells to the wound area.  Motivated by the recent observation that wounds treated with a combination of mesenchymal stem cells and insulin-producing cells healed faster than normal and without scarring, the objective of this project is to identify the type of insulin needed to achieve the observed accelerated healing and reduced scarring and to uncover the wound healing pathways that are recruited.  Research results have the potential to transform wound care by enabling rapid healing that would avert the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic wounds and to enhance reconstructive and plastic surgery outcomes by reducing or eliminating scar formation.  The project's long-term educational goal is to present future engineers with tissue engineering research in unfamiliar contexts, like aviation, to inspire innovative thinking for future careers in biomedical engineering. In pursuit of this goal, this project's educational objective is to apply research principles to teaching and to develop tissue engineering research modules that integrate research, teaching, mentorship, and learning for use in biomedical engineering course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). The educational and outreach approach is to recruit female students, group them in teams and provide hands-on research activities with wound healing models that will enable them to formulate hypotheses and models, and to propose, conduct, and present experiments that will further their understanding of research. The women will be required to present their research in scientific meetings and to K-12 graders in an aviation science club.<br/><br/>The project's research focus is on investigating the impact of mesynchymal stem cells (MSCs) and insulin producing cells (IPCs), both individually and coencapsulated, on wound healing and its pathways, and on identifying how cell-cell vs. cell-wound interactions govern the secretome of encapsulated cells.  The project is motivated by recent studies from the PI's lab that achieved dramatically accelerated (14 vs 40 days), scar-free wound healing after combining these cells.  The research plan has four specific aims.  Aim 1 is to dissect, via in vitro studies, the role of IPCs vs insulin in survival and function of the coencapsulated cells, i.e., whether it is insulin itself, the presence of the IPCs or the hormone release that improves survival and function.  Aim 2 is to dissect, via in vivo studies in mice, the role of IPCs vs insulin in the accelerated wound healing, i. e, whether insulin-producing fibroblasts have the same effect as commercially available IPCs (RIN-5F and RIN-14B) that secrete additional products. Aim 3 is to determine the extent, via in vitro studies, that coencapsulation promotes MSC factor release in comparison to MSC factor release elicited by wound environments, i.e., whether the Akt signaling pathway, which is critical to MSC survival, is activated more strongly in MSCs coencapsulated with IPCs or in MSCs delivered singly to wounds.  Aim 4 is to determine the extent that IPCs+MSCs reduce scar formation, i.e., to extend the work to a limited study in pigs, which have an epidermis and dermis similar to human skin and heal at a comparable rate.  In summary, this project will examine the metabolic pathways involved in IPC+MSC wound healing, the interplay between the two cells and the wound environment, and whether lessons learned can be applied to other cell therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Object detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) involves a large amount of computation, which impedes its implementation on resource/energy-limited, user-end devices. The reason for the success of DNNs is due to having knowledge over different domains of observed environments. However, only a limited knowledge of the observed environment at inference time is required, which may be learned using a shallow neural network (SHNN). The TKD (Temporal Knowledge Distillation) is a system-level design that is proposed to improve the energy consumption of object detection on the user-end device. An SHNN is deployed on the user-end device to detect objects in the observing environment. Also, a knowledge transfer mechanism is implemented to update the SHNN model using the DNN knowledge when there is a change in the object domain. Experiments demonstrate that the user-end device's energy consumption and the inference time can be improved by 78% and 71% compared with running the deep model on the user-end device.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the fuel ethanol industry, traditional antibiotics, such as virginiamycin or penicillin, are introduced prophylactically into the fermentation process to reduce occurrences of bacterial contamination. However, widespread use of such antibiotics has increased the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms that pose an ever-growing risk to human health and the environment. Additionally, these antibiotics have been shown to persist in downstream coproducts such as distillers? grains, which is becoming a major concern for consumers of livestock that are fed the byproduct. Therefore, the production of novel antimicrobial agents with similar selective toxicity, better biodegradability, and effectiveness against antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains would be highly marketable and useful in industrial yeast fermentation environments. If commercialized successfully, the proposed innovation may offer industrial consumers a sustainably derived antibiotic product to combat contamination during fermentation without the pitfalls of traditional antibiotics. In addition, valorization of lignin waste streams for value-added products may allow future lignocellulosic-based biorefineries to be more cost-effective.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an antibiotic replacement produced from lignin waste streams. Lignin is one of the most abundant natural phenolic polymers on earth, plays an important role in plants? natural defense mechanisms, and is currently considered a major waste product in the paper and pulp industries and lignocellulosic biorefineries. Despite the widely reported antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, lignin-derived antimicrobials have poor selectivity thus limiting their real-world applications. The proposed technology offers a potential solution by converting lignin into a cost-effective and biodegradable antimicrobial product that may selectively inhibit bacterial contaminates and increase ethanol yields during fuel ethanol fermentation.  By oxidatively depolymerizing lignin into a liquid product under mild reaction conditions, the resulting product has shown selective antimicrobial properties against lactic acid bacteria, including antibiotic resistant strains, without affecting yeast growth and hydrolase activity. Proof of concept has been demonstrated at the lab scale, but further development of the technology demands a better understanding of the potential customer needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like a bell sounding its last notes, these problems all share a common feature: they exhibit oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes around an equilibrium state. A famous theoretical example concerns gravitational waves, recently detected by the LIGO detector. In technological settings, the ratio between the oscillation and decay rates to equilibrium is called the quality factor. Minimizing this ratio improves the stability and rigidity properties of the materials involved. Such technological applications include engineering graphene-like insulators; conception of waveguides and optic fibers; and design of high-quality microelectrical systems. <br/><br/>The mathematical study of such phenomena relies on a unified framework called resonance theory. It investigates natural  generalizations of time-harmonic states in situations where the energy may escape or decay. Generalized energies of such states form a discrete set of complex numbers called quantum resonances (in quantum scattering), quasinormal modes (in general relativity) or Pollicott--Ruelle resonances (in dynamical systems). Their imaginary parts describe the typical frequency of the associated resonant states while the real parts describe their decay or growth outside bounded regions. Mathematically, they are the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the Hamiltonian resolvent. Much of the theoretical work consists in studying their stability and asymptotic distributions; and how they affect time evolution. This project specifically deals with the emergence of resonances under symmetry-breaking perturbations in periodic structures; the exponential convergence of Hawking radiation in black-hole spacetimes; and the relation between topology and Pollicott--Ruelle resonances in dynamical systems.

The nation has a number of dams and reservoirs to produce low cost-electricity. However, sediments transported every year by floods consume the storage capacity of dams and must be removed. For example, the Hoover Dam is full to a depth of only 90 ft. Similarly, some 1430 dams are at risk of collapsing or overflowing from floods, such as the Prado Dam and Mojave Dam in California, and two dams collapsed in Michigan in 2020, flooding towns and displacing thousands of residents.  Traditional dredging costs $20-70 per cubic yard and poses a major barrier to restoring the storage capacities of those dams. This project will reduce the cost to $8 per cubic yard by switching from a slurry to a capsule technology. The payback would be in the 1% power capacity restored from lower sediment accumulation. This could also protect turbines from erosion. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project advances translation of a system to address sediment accumulation. The proposed project represents an extension of technologies to move pressed coal logs. The sediments are first pumped to shore from a depth of 50-200 ft. They are dewatered in settling ponds and excess water is returned to the reservoir. The dewatered sediments are then packed into large plastic capsules and sent to a dedicated pipeline some 30 miles away from the dam. Since the capsule is streamlined, it needs little water to be supported in the pipeline by hydrodynamic forces. For this purpose, a new natural gas fired capsule pump is developed; this liquid piston pump engine can pump up to 60 million gallons per day; it is also compact and does not need a complex system of locks and pump bypasses. It can be easily relocated to a new site and operates on low-cost natural gas.

New tectonic plate is continuously generated along the ridges at rates of one to 20 cm per year. Global seawater composition, and thus Earth?s climate, is maintained over geologic timescales by a balance between chemical-exchange reactions that occur when seawater infiltrates into hot rock at mid-ocean ridges, and salts flowing into the ocean from continental rivers systems. Mantle rock has a radically different chemical and mineral composition than crustal rock, and the nature of its chemical interactions with seawater, along with the larger implications for seawater composition, are poorly understood. The goal of this proposal is to build understanding of the processes by which seafloor mantle-rock exposures are fractured to permit seawater infiltration, and thus facilitate water-rock chemical exchange on roughly half of the global mid-ocean ridge system. Results from this study will be integrated in the undergraduate Earth Science courses and independent research projects for undergraduate students at Bennington College, a small liberal arts institution.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to understand how pre-existing ductile deformation fabrics and the tectonic environment of mantle peridotite exposures control the process by which rock permeability is generated during brittle fracturing. Rock samples collected from three mantle peridotite exposures along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) that formed by very different types of fault zones will be examined using several distinct microanalysis and imaging techniques: 1) micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscope imaging will be used to characterize the micro-scale geometry of fracture networks, 2) thermogravimetric analysis and helium gas pycnometry will be used to quantify the degree of hydrothermal alteration and 3) confocal Raman spectroscopy will be used to place additional constraints on the nature of hydrothermal exchange with micro-analysis of alteration minerals and trapped fluids.

The global power device market exceeds $15 billion in 2019 and is fast growing. Gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are commonly perceived as the next generation of power devices. Despite their initial commercialization recently, their wide adoption in industrial applications is hindered by the limitation in reliability and robustness, resulting in considerable over design, rendering device performance far below the material limit. This project will develop a new generation of robust, charge-balanced GaN HEMTs through innovation in the semiconductor materials and device structure. Interdisciplinary research will be carried out in materials, devices, fabrication processes, and circuit-level tests through collaboration between Virginia Tech and the University of Southern California in the United States, as well as University of Cambridge in United Kingdom under the ?NSF Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Lead Agency Opportunity (ENG-EPSRC)?. This US-UK collaborative project provides opportunities for student education and international exchange, development of cross-university teaching modules, and industrial collaboration for potential technology transfer. This interdisciplinary, cross-continent project also involves outreach activities for K-12 students and teachers, and promotes educational activities related to microelectronics and power electronics technologies.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This overarching hypothesis is that robust gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) can be implemented by selective-area, nearly defect-free embedding of p-type regions into the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel, forming a novel charge-balanced super-junction structure. This novel 2D-3D super-junction structure can not only enhance the device robustness by managing the electric field and avalanche capability, but also allow significantly higher 2DEG density while maintaining the normally-off operation, thereby decreasing the device specific on-resistance and boosting its switching frequency. Despite these promises, major gaps exist in the device physics of the novel super-junction, interfacial material properties, and the dynamic performance of super-junction HEMTs in power electronic circuits. Funded by the ?NSF Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Lead Agency Opportunity (ENG-EPSRC)?, this project aims to address the scientific knowledge gaps in four relevant areas through the US-UK research collaboration: (a) to explore the design space and performance limits of the novel super-junction HEMT device; (b) to probe new methods of selectively introducing p-type dopants into the 2DEG channel to realize the super-junction functionality; (c) to develop an in-depth understanding of the dopant profiles, carrier transport, and trap dynamics in the nitride super-junction structure; and (d) to correlate the nano/mesoscale materials and interface properties with the dynamic characteristics and robustness of GaN HEMTs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The sensor will be used for ultra-fast (less than 1 minute) non-invasive screening of samples to ensure safety. The ultimate goal is a home-based test that minimizes the exposure and transmission of virus to clinical technicians and others at testing locations. This testing ability will identify and isolate carriers of the virus and thereby control the spread of virus. This technology is timely to counter COVID-19; However, it can be extended towards detecting other bacteria and viruses and has shown promise for detecting HIV as well. The versatility of the sensor will be investigated. In general, the innovation may lead to ensuring the healthcare of the population by monitoring the condition of individuals rapidly without causing discomfort. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on a new technology for COVID-19 diagnosis. The ultra-fast COVID-19 (UFC-19) detection sensor is a fast, portable, small size instrument that operates directly with saliva (it does not require special swabs or collection devices) for COVID-19 diagnosis with the ability to sense the presence/absence of the virus SARS-CoV-2 in a sample in less than 1 second.  The portability and the speed of results makes this sensor a potentially important diagnostic tool for fast initial screening of samples and continuous monitoring of an individual. The UFC-19 technology is based on the electron transfer reaction between the proteins present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This innovation advances the current understanding of electrochemical sensors for point-of-care applications by utilizing multidisciplinary contributions from electrochemical engineering, virology, and physiology, among others. Through this I-Corps program, the team intends to learn about the proposed market to pave the path for commercializing the sensor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This time is influenced by the contribution of younger versus older water coming from direct rainfall events and groundwater. Estimating the proportion of these waters along a river system and how these contributions vary through time and space is key to predicting water quality and evaluating ecosystem health. This project evaluates how quickly rain moves into rivers by measuring isotope compositions of rain, groundwater and river water. Specifically, the research aims at quantifying how the proportion of young versus old streamflow varies from headwaters to lowlands by collecting water samples and measuring a broad range of hydrologic tracers and common ions in these samples. Outcomes of the project will advance knowledge on interactions between surface water and groundwater, the type of water that contributes to streamflow and the evolution of solute concentrations as water moves downstream in a river system. Through training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students the project will contribute to the development of a strong workforce in geosciences. The project will also build collaboration with the Nature Conservancy to enhance research translation for planners and decision makers.  <br/><br/>Despite the importance of understanding the time water takes to flush through a watershed, there is limited understanding of landscape-scale controls on these transit times. Furthermore, the relative contributions of young and old water to streamflow in steep headwaters versus flatter lowlands remains poorly understood. Quantifying watershed transit times is vital to quantifying biogeochemical cycles and predicting contaminant fate and transport. This project aims at determining the contribution to streamflow from young water derived from recent rain events versus old water derived prior to rain events to better understand how runoff generation and streamflow sources differ among headwaters versus lowlands. It further aims at quantifying the relationships between young versus old streamflow and solute concentrations and their (co)evolution downstream. The work will conduct intensive monitoring and sampling along a single stream network in a southern and coastal California Watershed. Samples of precipitation, river water and groundwater will be collected at high spatiotemporal resolutions and analyzed for various tracers, including 18O/16O, 2H/1H, Na+, Cl- and 35S. Hydrograph separation techniques will be applied to assess the contributions of young versus old water to streamflow and quantify the relationship between these contributions and solute concentrations. The study will fill knowledge gaps on groundwater/surface-water interactions in disturbed lands and Mediterranean climates across topographic conditions. Results obtained will be relevant to other Mediterranean ecoregions around the globe.

Past research suggests that Arctic sea ice loss will likely lead to stronger winds near the surface, accompanied by more frequent and/or intense storms.  This project is testing the hypothesis that such interactions represent an important but unrecognized feedback: reduced sea ice coverage leading to stronger surface winds and storms, greater surface evaporation, and stronger and more frequent ""atmospheric rivers"" flowing into the Arctic, leading in turn to accelerated sea ice loss. Discoveries from the study will help decision makers address numerous environmental challenges in the Arctic that affect the region's people, ecosystems, economy, and security. For example, stronger storms and reduced sea ice coverage likely will lead to stronger wind-driven waves and greater coastal erosion affecting Arctic communities.  In addition, stronger waves and storms may hinder plans for expanded Arctic marine navigation.  <br/><br/>This project takes an original perspective by investigating as a system the interactive roles of sea ice, moisture, and atmospheric/oceanic dynamics in the Arctic's ongoing climate transformation.  Past studies have investigated coupled responses between certain components, but this research will advance knowledge by broadening the analysis to encompass a semi-enclosed and partially reinforcing system of physical processes involving sea ice, cyclones, wind, and moisture/precipitation (including atmospheric rivers). To achieve these objectives, the researchers are studying archived global climate model simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensembles, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (versions 5 and 6), and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) in combination with two sets of innovative modeling experiments using the latest CESM2 version.  They are using these results to assess the interactive physical mechanisms comprising the proposed feedback system loop and address three overarching research questions: (1) how extratropical cyclones, associated atmospheric rivers, and Arctic winds affect sea ice through heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes; (2) how sea ice in turn affects cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and Arctic winds; and (3) how a changing climate will affect these feedback processes and their relative importance over different spatial and temporal scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mainly composed of iron, the core?s outer shell is liquid while its most inner part, the inner core, is solid.  The core plays a central role in the planet?s geomagnetism, dynamic processes, and thermal evolution. Here, the team conducts laboratory experiments at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in Earth?s deep interior.  They measure the properties of the iron-rich materials that make up the core, e.g., their deformation mechanisms and viscosity.  These properties can be dramatically altered at core conditions. The results give insight into why seismic waves travel at different speeds through different parts of the inner core. They constrain how the Earth?s magnetic field is generated and unveil its past evolution. These outcomes are valuable to many researchers studying deep Earth?s processes: mineral physicists, seismologists, and geodynamicists. The project promotes technical advances useful across disciplines, in geoscience and materials science, and in the industry. It also provides support for a female graduate student, training for undergraduate students, and outreach toward K-12 students and the public.<br/><br/>The project aims at characterizing key rheological properties of iron and iron-rich compounds and alloys at the extreme conditions of the deep Earth. Two fundamental questions are addressed: (1) What causes inner-core seismic anisotropy? (2) How does viscous dissipation in the outer core influence the evolution of the geodynamo? To address the first question, the team characterizes the dominant deformation mechanisms and strength of solid iron at high pressures and temperatures. The lattice preferred orientation that develops during iron crystallization is also measured. The goal is to understand how the alignment of elastically anisotropic iron crystals may be acquired during solidification or subsequent deformation (or both).  To this aim, the researchers carry out static compression experiments in resistive and laser-heated diamond anvil cells. They perform in situ X-ray imaging and diffraction measurements at national synchrotron facilities.  Addressing the second question requires measuring iron viscosity at core conditions. While traditional measurements are limited to lower pressures, the team benefit from new technical developments; these enable a path toward measuring the viscosity of iron dynamically compressed to outer core conditions. Thus the team carries out dynamic compression experiments and use novel X-ray diffraction and imaging techniques at the Materials at Extreme Conditions instrument at the Linac Coherent Light Source (SLAC) and the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. These experiments represent new opportunities to leverage the considerable resources and expertise available at national laboratories and apply them to better understand the Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last 20 years have seen significant advancement in understanding of how to create effective learning environments for STEM education. While many individual faculty have adopted new approaches to teaching, change has not been deep or widespread enough to make a major impact across all of STEM education. Better understanding is needed of how faculty can become change agents in order to effect this change. This study focuses on exploring the experiences of early career engineering education faculty as they attempt to impact the engineering education experiences of students locally and more broadly. Engineering education faculty are unique in that they have formal training in the types of change desired, and are often embedded in disciplinary engineering departments where they can apply their knowledge to create change. Understanding their experiences and the academic cultures in which they are working will provide information on they can and cannot influence education practices in their departments. Doing so will enhance our efforts to train and develop faculty prepared to drive change in engineering education.<br/><br/>In the first phase of a two-phase study, collaborative inquiry and collaborative autoethnography methods will be used to systematically examine the PIs' own experiences as six early career faculty members in diverse settings: this will include scrutinizing acceptance of ambiguity, responses to disappointments and challenges, willingness to adapt, and ability to collaborate. Subsequently, in the second phase, the experiences of 12-15 additional early career faculty members will be examined to refine and expand on the phase one results, increasing their applicability to multiple settings. The results of this project will (1) advance the engineering education community's understanding of existing structures for facilitating change (or the lack thereof) in engineering education (2) identify barriers and supports for making change as early career engineering education faculty; and (3) develop a co-constructed understanding of how to better prepare and support faculty to exercise agency as it relates to impacting engineering education during their first few years in academic positions. These advancements are critical because the calls for change in engineering education will continue as technological advances are made and the role of engineers in society continues to evolve. By identifying the barriers and supports that affect early career faculty's abilities to take strategic and intentional actions towards achieving impact, the results of this study will enable engineering education graduate programs and national engineering education organizations to make programmatic changes to benefit future faculty. In addition, the evidence-based insights resulting from this study have the potential to expedite the on-boarding process of new engineering education faculty, promote improvements in STEM education nationally by faculty at all stages of their careers, and support the development of the field of engineering education research."

Airway intubation procedures currently require training periods of three to four years to achieve consistently safe and high-quality outcomes. Even so, over 1 million major complications occur in the pre-hospital, emergency room, and intensive care units yearly. Many such complications result from first-pass attempt intubation failures. Lives and dollars may be saved via improved intubation. For example, U.S. military medics perform tracheostomies on the battlefield because of the inability to safely intubate injured warriors. Reducing the skills and knowledge needed to safely intubate patients via augmentation of the video laryngoscope may positively impact such areas.

Specifically, this project will support faculty to create STEM course modules that include issues of civic engagement and equity.  Community colleges provide STEM education to an increasingly diverse audience.  This education needs to provide students with STEM knowledge and skills, as well as equip them with both systems thinking and civic engagement tools.  To achieve these educational goals, the project will help faculty improve their STEM courses by developing course modules that address the science of environmental change within a socially relevant context.  This approach may provide a scalable model for strengthening STEM teaching and learning, while simultaneously broadening participation in STEM and preparing citizens and scientists for 21st century challenges.<br/><br/>This project builds upon and extends Bellevue College?s and North Seattle College?s successful faculty professional development efforts by incorporating two curriculum design frameworks:  Science Education for New Civic Engagement and Responsibility and the Equity Ethic.  The project will develop a new professional development curriculum intended to support STEM faculty as they modify environmental lessons to build students' civic engagement, systems thinking, and equity-minded skills. The project will analyze the effectiveness of this course module approach versus a traditional whole-course approach. The project plans to engage at least 35 STEM faculty and 1,800 STEM students at the two colleges, with the potential to impact many more faculty and students if the model is adopted by other institutions. The design of a transferrable professional development curriculum will benefit from the two-college collaboration, which enables the investigators to pilot, revise, and implement the curriculum in two different community college contexts.  These two contexts will enable large scale implementation and comparative evaluation. The project team will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of the professional development curriculum on STEM teaching, the impact of the modules on student learning outcomes, and how incorporation of the modules affects students? systems thinking skills as related to civic engagement and equity.

A growing body of evidence demonstrates that hospital architecture systemically affects patient health, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction. However, architects often lack the tools to reliably predict how design choices will impact building operations.   Often hospitals and clinics designs fall short with building owners not able to achieve organizational metrics and goals, and patients can see poorer quality of care, increased medical errors, and even higher mortality rates.  The commercial impact will stem from a software platform that equips architects with no-code workflows necessary to deploy data-driven design while managing project timelines and internal costs. Although the Phase I project focuses on healthcare architecture, the broader impact will be that architects will be able to design all buildings to optimize health, productivity, and organizational goals.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of 1) algorithms that generate structured architectural data capturing spatial qualities that affect occupant health, 2) data visualization interfaces for exploring and validating spatial data and health data jointly, and 3) statistical and machine learning models for identifying meaningful relationships between architectural characteristics and health outcomes across large-scale datasets. These tools will be tested and evaluated by conducting a proof of concept study with a large health system. The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of untested statistical machine learning methods to identify meaningful relationships between architecture and health outcomes. The proposed research will provide new types of insight into architecture's role in affecting health outcomes, providing a novel approach to data-driven design. Though the focus of this proposal is on architectural data, the principles explored will push boundaries of current limits by 1) incorporating qualitative and quantitative data in machine learning models, 2) assessing new modes of interpretability via data visualization, and 3) advancing methods for working with sparse but rich datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include tsunami earthquakes, shallow slow slip events, and the extension of fast coseismic slip to the seafloor. How subduction zones produce this range of fault behaviors is still poorly understood. Here, the researchers investigate the effects of fault network geometry and frictional properties on their potential ruptures. They explore whether interactions between faults and with the seafloor can generate the observed range of behaviors.  They use a combination of innovative theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.  The goal is to constrain the relationships between shallow fault behavior and large megathrust earthquakes. The simulation outcomes unveil gradually the mechanics of earthquakes and tsunamis.  They help assessing the associated risks. The codes developed by the team are shared with the community as open source.  The project also provides support for an early career scientist and training for an undergraduate student at Columbia University.<br/><br/>This project is focused on understanding the spatial and temporal relationships between different types of slip behavior in the shallow region of subduction zones. The researchers conduct complimentary theoretical and numerical analyses of slip on a dipping thrust fault that obeys rate and state friction. They use a new technique to include the effects of the wedge-shaped geometry that is typical of shallow subduction zones. The goal is to determine how sliding stability of the fault is controlled by interactions between frictional and elastic properties and effective stress with the wedge taper angle and distance on the fault from the trench. The team also develops and implements a numerical model for slip on a fault network in a shallow subduction zone geometry. The network consists of a main plate-interface fault with a single splay thrust fault that branches off and intersects the seafloor. The model is used to simulate sequences of slip on the fault network. A special focus is to understand how shallow fault patches can alternate between producing events with different stability characteristics, and how this behavior influences megathrust events that nucleate in the locked zone. These analyses will allow answering important questions about the slip behavior of subduction zones, including: How does fault zone geometry control the sliding stability of thrust faults? How do shallow slip events nucleate and propagate within a subduction zone fault network over multiple seismic cycles?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent viral outbreaks of measles, Ebola, Zika, SARS-CoV, and the COVID-19 pandemic have illustrated the need for fast and accurate diagnosis to contain the outbreak, as well as for decentralized testing during periods of quarantine or general global epidemiological surveillance. The technology will enable at-home or remote location specimen collection without the need for traditional, costly, draw stations and overnight cold-pack shipments.  The initial target is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections.  The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that adults should be screened for HCV infection at least once in their lifetimes, and women should be screened during each pregnancy. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will focus on solving the inherent instability of RNA viruses.  RNA viruses, in liquid blood and especially dry, degrade rapidly.  It is why SARS-COV-2 is primarily a contact/aerosol transmission and not a problem with packages.  RNA samples have a high sensitivity to ribonucleases (enzymes that catalyze the degradation of RNA) and degrade in a short period of time when dried.  Thiis project will create a special protective environment so that when the specimen dries it does not degrade; it will consist of a device that retains a fixed and known amount of specimen, desiccant for drying, and modified atmospheric packaging (MAP) preventing specimen degradation at ambient temperature for up to 14 days.  The MAP prevents gas exchange during transit, enabling collection and transport in any weather conditions including cold, heat, and high humidity.  Upon arrival at the laboratory, an extraction process will recover the RNA virus for testing via RT-qPCR.

Past research suggests that Arctic sea ice loss will likely lead to stronger winds near the surface, accompanied by more frequent and/or intense storms.  This project is testing the hypothesis that such interactions represent an important but unrecognized feedback: reduced sea ice coverage leading to stronger surface winds and storms, greater surface evaporation, and stronger and more frequent ""atmospheric rivers"" flowing into the Arctic, leading in turn to accelerated sea ice loss. Discoveries from the study will help decision makers address numerous environmental challenges in the Arctic that affect the region's people, ecosystems, economy, and security. For example, stronger storms and reduced sea ice coverage likely will lead to stronger wind-driven waves and greater coastal erosion affecting Arctic communities.  In addition, stronger waves and storms may hinder plans for expanded Arctic marine navigation.  <br/><br/>This project takes an original perspective by investigating as a system the interactive roles of sea ice, moisture, and atmospheric/oceanic dynamics in the Arctic's ongoing climate transformation.  Past studies have investigated coupled responses between certain components, but this research will advance knowledge by broadening the analysis to encompass a semi-enclosed and partially reinforcing system of physical processes involving sea ice, cyclones, wind, and moisture/precipitation (including atmospheric rivers). To achieve these objectives, the researchers are studying archived global climate model simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensembles, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (versions 5 and 6), and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) in combination with two sets of innovative modeling experiments using the latest CESM2 version.  They are using these results to assess the interactive physical mechanisms comprising the proposed feedback system loop and address three overarching research questions: (1) how extratropical cyclones, associated atmospheric rivers, and Arctic winds affect sea ice through heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes; (2) how sea ice in turn affects cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and Arctic winds; and (3) how a changing climate will affect these feedback processes and their relative importance over different spatial and temporal scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ways in which major brain parts that are structurally distinctive have changed over evolutionary time are also poorly understood. These knowledge gaps are partly due to the fact that fossil brains are rare and have been difficult to study. This project features scientists from three collaborating laboratories who will pool their resources to identify a set of invertebrate brain centers that mediate learning and memory. Structural and functional similarities and differences among these areas will be established across modern insect and crustacean species. The major question this research is answering is whether these brain centers share common genetic and computational attributes due to the brain?s fundamental organization being inherited by the descendants from a common ancestor; or, because brains that have arisen independently in different invertebrate groups are not able to perform certain functions unless brain areas that give them these same abilities have also arisen independently. These questions will be answered by precisely measuring the brain structures in fossilized invertebrate animals and comparing their basic arrangements with modern counterparts. The broader impact of this research will be to identify invertebrate proxies of the learning-and-memory brain centers found in vertebrate animals alive today, including humans. Identification of such proxies will inform us about how brains have evolved, and will contribute to a broader understanding of how memory centers are organized. The results will impact theories of, and research on, neural networks and artificial intelligence, and at the same time the scientists carrying out this research will develop novel strategies for identifying genealogical correspondence of brain structures across a very broad range of species. Brains analyzed for this research will be digitally reconstructed in 3D and uploaded to an open-source database for education and research purposes. The research will also provide advanced neuroscience structural analysis and genomics training to students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The neuronal organization and circuit properties of insect mushroom bodies are well known, as are their functional properties for learning and memory. While the existence of mushroom-body-like centers exist across arthropods, it is not known whether these phenotypically or genotypically correspond to the centers in insects. The planned research will identify mushroom body-like centers across a broad range of species, analyze their discrete neural arrangements, circuit organization, and molecular attributes. These comparisons will identify the species within and outside Arthropoda that possess functional and morphological correspondences in these structures. Transcriptomics will address whether phenotypically-corresponding centers share common genomic attributes, and whether there are unique genetic networks that define arthropod mushroom bodies or whether these networks differentiate mushroom bodies in different groups of arthropods such as in insects and crustaceans. The identification of broad phenotypic and genotypic homology of these centers across a broad phyletic spectrum would suggest an ancient origin of these learning and memory centers. Equally intriguing would be results suggesting convergent evolution of learning and memory centers across taxa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing global temperature and chances of drought threaten the forest ecosystems. Droughts can limit the ability of trees to cycle carbon and water due to limited amount of water in the soil and atmosphere. Like many plans, trees move water from the soil into the roots, up through trunks and branches, and out through the leaves into the atmosphere.  They can move and store large amounts of water that play a key role on maintaining plant functions and prevent drought stress. Bigger trees typically have larger volumes of water storage, protecting them from soil water stress. This study assesses the role of forest water storage in how trees respond to water supply and demand stresses in a temperate and a semi-arid forest. The work will develop a new sensor to measure water content in trees and generate an extensive dataset of water content in living, mature trees that will advance knowledge on how different trees acquire, store, and use water. It will further develop computer models to simulate the effects of forest water storage on the water and carbon cycles and apply new satellite data analysis to assess where the water is residing and predict the likelihood of droughts, tree mortality, and forest fires. An interactive virtual field trip of different forests will be developed, both in English and Spanish, to increase access to field experience and expand diversity in the Earth sciences. <br/><br/>The central goal of this research is to increase understanding of the physics of water storage and use in trees. This novel understanding of capacitance will be used to develop plant hydraulics models and to connect individual-based ground measurements of biomass water storage to remotely sensed data products at regional and global scales for use in model evaluation, as well as to generate predictions of ecosystem stress. This research effort will couple field-based observations and instrumentation development with model development and evaluation. Measurements of biomass water storage, water potential, and sap flux will be used to create individual-based plant hydraulics models capable of reproducing the capacitive response to rewetting after drought. These data will also be used to ground truth regional-scale remotely sensed biomass water content using a statistical scaling algorithm. Finally, this work will provide a pathway to incorporate remote sensing observations of water content into plant hydraulics-capable land-atmosphere models at the regional scale. This research will shed new light on the role biomass water storage plays in governing transpiration response to VPD and soil water stresses and will enhance our ability to model vegetation responses to both drought stress and drought recovery at multiple scales. Simultaneously to these research activities, interactive digital field trips will be created to allow students at high school and college levels to immerse themselves with the scientific team to learn more about carbon, water, and energy cycling in different forest types.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, many cities have taken on smart city and urban computing initiatives where a set of disjointed sensor networks have been deployed in various parts of the city. These include: motion sensors, video cameras, biological sensors, audio recorders, fire detectors, gunshot location systems, and other monitoring tools.  The proposed technology is based on a cyber-physical system framework to bridge the physical space, cyberspace infused and Internet of Things (IoT). For example, people with vision loss or other special needs may have difficulties in perceiving signals directly in physical space, but they may be able to make these connections in cyberspace. These cyber connections and real-time information exchanges may enable and enhance their interactions in the physical space and allow them to be more aware of the environment around them.

The goal of the project is to develop an oil removal device that can be deployed to remote regions with low cost and effort, reducing the length and cost of a spill response. The first aim of the project will optimize the nanoparticle synthesis to minimize costs and maximize active yield at commercial scales. A laboratory-scale, prototype oil removal device will be designed, built, and validated to enable pilots with larger volumes of contaminated water.

As part of the ARC-Network Research, AWIS will: 1) Support Virtual Visiting Scholars who will conduct meta-analyses and analytics on key topics from the literature; 2) Organize and hold small workshops on emerging research in various topical areas to produce new research agendas and partnerships; and 3) Work toward community standards for research, evaluation, data, and metadata on STEM faculty equity and systemic change.  AWIS will build a diverse, multi-disciplinary, and cross-sector ARC-Network Community of stakeholders including STEM faculty and administrators from all types of institutions of higher education, and representatives from industry, government, and STEM professional organizations.  The community will be supported by: 1) Strategic in-person meetings for scholars and practitioners; 2) A robust online platform with a rich curated resource library; and 3) Active community engagement and dissemination efforts.<br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of women faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate."

The scientific goals of this CAREER plan are (i) A thorough investigation and experimentation into the impact of slanted-sidewall and N implantation in the inter-fin areas on electric fields to enhance breakdown voltage. (ii) Fabrication and characterization of FinFETs on both metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown and halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE)-grown epi-structure to analyze and compare the impact of growth technique, and material quality on device performance. This study assists in selecting the appropriate growth technique for each process module in the future. (iii) A systematic study of the substrate thickness impact on device characteristics such as Ron. (iv) Development of ?-(Al,Ga)2O3 regrowth on the fin sidewalls by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) and a complete investigation of the impact of regrowth conditions on electron mobility in the channel, interface trap density, and FinFET characteristics. This will be the first demonstration of sidewall regrowth in this material system. (v) Development of robust and reliable Hf(Si)O2 dielectrics by PAMBE as well as investigation and analysis of deposition conditions on dielectric quality (breakdown, dielectric constant, leakage, etc.).

The proposed technology utilizes probes that may be targeted to the cancers and illuminated using short-wave infrared (SWIR) light emitted upon excitation, which allows researchers to see cancer lesions deeper in tissue and with better resolution. This technology will address a major unmet need in personalized medicine, where patients with difficult to treat cancers have limited time to pursue the best treatment regimen.  The solution relies on harvesting, grafting and screening patient cancers using animal models to rapidly identify the most effective, patient-specific treatment.  The global small animal imaging market is expected to grow by 6-8% to $3.6 billion by 2024 (?Preclinical Imaging Market Analysis? Grandview Research; 2016), while optical imaging represents ~20% of the market.  The proposed technology has the potential to expand and disrupt some of the current optical imaging technologies within this market.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a cancer surveillance technology, a bundled disease and drug screening platform of infrared light-emitting, cancer-targeted nanoprobes paired with an imaging system for scanning live animals. The nanoprobes have a rare earth nanoparticle core (Er3+, Ho3+, Tm3+) and are rendered biocompatible through encapsulation in an albumin shell. When excited with near-infrared (NIR) light, they emit short-wave infrared (SWIR) light that travels further through blood and tissue than does light from other optical imaging modalities, thus allowing imaging of tumors and other tissues deeper in the animal. The rare earth-based nanoprobes have been shown to detect smaller deep-seated diseased lesions in the animal and have been used to monitor multi-organ metastases longitudinally. The proposed nanoprobes are engineered to emit at multiple differentiated narrow bandwidth SWIR wavelengths, resulting in the unique ability to multiplex for detection of multiple diagnostic markers.  The proposed technology has been shown to have significantly greater sensitivity for early detection of cancers than the current standard for preclinical imaging (bioluminescence (BLI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). In addition, the technology has been used to track the response of different tumor subsets to drugs, positioning it as one of the first methods for precise detection of therapy response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is becoming increasingly important for government agencies, policy makers, and emergency management officials to be capable of addressing major crisis scenarios under acute time and resource constraints. Using social media platforms more efficiently would be a critical step towards this vision.  For example, such communications platforms could to be leveraged to better communicate the COVID-19 risk. The goal of this project is to understand and validate the need for this capability in civilian or emergency management agencies, and federal, state, or city level government agencies.

The proposed tool will be grounded on state-of-the-art network science, social science, and data science theories and concepts. Using the Application Programming Interface (API) of publicly available social media platforms such as Twitter, large-scale crisis communication data has been collected in the emergence and outbreak of the novel coronavirus. These data may serve as proof-of-concept for the ability to develop and operate publicly-available, novel social sharing platforms to automatically and passively detect and control information tipping points to facilitate better response in pandemics and other societal emergencies.

Knee injuries account for ~50% of all acute musculoskeletal injuries in physically active individuals and military personnel and can result in substantial health care costs and reduced quality of life. Individuals (particularly young females) who have greater knee joint laxity have more difficulty in stabilizing the knee during sport activity and have a greater risk of knee ligament injury. Thus, therapeutic interventions that enhance functional joint stability in those with excessive joint laxity are critically needed from both an injury prevention and rehabilitation standpoint.  The proposed innovation is intended to fulfill this critical need by designing an external knee support to enhance joint protection and ensure safe motion limits are not exceeded during physical activity. When injury does occur, the technology also may be used to protect and support the knee while ligaments are healing.  The technology may function as a stand-alone protective device but, ideally, would be used in conjunction with a comprehensive injury prevention or rehabilitation neuromuscular training program designed to increase functional stability of the knee. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a knee support that is customized to an individual?s knee laxity profile to provide dynamic motion limits when prescribed thresholds are reached. While external knee supports are readily available on the market, initial customer discovery research suggests a gap in the market for devices focused on injury prevention and the treatment of excessive knee joint laxity. Project activities will: 1) test the hypothesis that the proposed technology addresses an important gap in injury prevention and rehabilitation, 2) solidify the target market and customers who would most benefit from the technology, and 3) refine the value proposition of external knee supports, including what the pain points are, and what the desired features and performance characteristics are that would enhance the perceived value. This effort also will advance knowledge of the knee brace industry including key manufacturers, modes of distribution, and potential price points based on other devices customers currently purchase or recommend or are prescribed to them. The potential to apply this innovation to other joints of the body also will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology differs from the current solution in that it doesn't rely on proteins for wound healing, and thus the product doesn't get consumed by the body at such a rapid rate.

By adopting the proposed technology, software development teams will avoid critical bugs that, in turn, will avoid financial loss. The proposed technology will help chief technology officers (CTOs) and chief information officers (CIOs)  - not only developers - carry out several critical activities including: gaining actionable insight into the state of their code; accurately estimating the scope and cost of code cleanup; and assessing code quality trends and how to repair these code quality issues.

The proposed anti-icer is a potent alternative to traditional deicers, as it may be applied to road surfaces before a snow storm hits the targeted area, eliminating the need for deicer operations to be performed during the storm. One of the most commonly-used anti-icers is sodium chloride (NaCl, salt brine). While salt brine typically has been used as an anti-icer on roadways and in airports, the use of the salt brine corrodes vehicles, bridges, and asphalt and is known to damage the surrounding environment. It is also known that salt brine has a high transport rate in the surrounding environments and low hold-over time.  Organic alternatives to the salt brine in the market are calcium-magnesium acetate (CMA) and potassium acetate. However, these products cost about a $700-$1,000 per ton.  Commercial potential of the proposed anti-icer will be evaluated as a cost-effective and environmentally benign alternative to its competitors. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an anti-icer road surface treatment.  It is produced from simultaneous use of anaerobic digestion and accelerated bioleaching processes to form a liquid organic anti-icer from digestion of grass or any high protein plant substrates (green waste) co-digested with molasses or any other potassium rich organic material. The two simultaneous processes take place inside an anaerobic digester filled with green waste and molasses and water at optimum proportions and equipped with a recirculation system. In the process of anaerobic digestion, insoluble organic compounds are hydrolyzed and broken into simpler soluble organic compounds by the naturally occurring anaerobic bacteria present in the grass. During this process, acetate is produced, and through a reaction with potassium present in molasses, it forms potassium acetate, which may be used as liquid organic anti-icer. Preliminary results have shown that the proposed anti-icer may be effective at temperatures as low as 15?F.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the cost for the immersive experience drops, VR video streaming introduces new bandwidth and performance challenges, especially in live streaming, due to the delivery of 360-degree views. This project develops a new content-based viewport prediction framework to improve the bandwidth and performance in live VR streaming, which predicts the user's viewport through a fusion of tracking the moving objects in the video, extracting the video semantics, and modeling the user's viewport of interest.<br/><br/>This project consists of three research thrusts. First, it develops a content-based viewport prediction framework for live VR streaming by tracking the motions and semantics of the objects. Second, it employs hardware and software techniques to facilitate real-time execution and scale the viewport prediction mechanism to a large number of users. Third, it develops evaluation frameworks to verify the functionality, performance, and scalability of the approach. The project uniquely considers the correlation between video content and user behavior, which leverages the deterministic nature of the former to conquer the randomness of the latter.<br/><br/>With the rapidly increasing popularity of VR systems in domain-specific immersive environments, the project will benefit several VR-related fields of studies with significant bandwidth savings and performance improvements, such as VR-based live broadcast, healthcare, and scientific visualization.

Complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain.

Many classical results in the subject consider bounded domains in complex Euclidean space, assume that the boundary is smooth, and make assumptions about the CR-geometry of the boundary. For domains with non-smooth boundary, the PI will prove new variants of classical results by assuming geometric conditions on the Kaehler-Einstein metric instead of conditions on the boundary.  Using this approach, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory where metric space techniques applied to group theory not only lead to progress on old problems, but also many new and interesting examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience.

However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.  The researchers come from the fields of archaeology, paleolimnology and palaeoclimate, and ecological modeling. A principal objective will be to combine high-precision dating of agricultural systems with paleoclimate conditions reconstructed from lake cores.

Thin scaffolds that can guide organic semiconductor crystal formation and growth during deposition from solution will be incorporated directly into solar panels. As a generalizable strategy to control solution-phase crystallization, the findings from this research will promote the progress of science and advance the national prosperity in a broad range of scientific disciplines, from disposable sensors to pharmaceutical manufacturing. By engaging students in emerging renewable energy technologies, this project will serve as a platform to promote long-term retention of K-12 students and women in science and engineering. <br/><br/>Confinement of crystals within nanoporous scaffolds is a powerful strategy to select for specific crystal orientations and polymorphs and has contributed to a fundamental understanding of critical nucleus sizes and crystal growth mechanisms. This research project endeavors to restrict nucleation events to nanoscale environments but allow subsequent crystal growth to proceed unconfined above the scaffolds. In doing so, control over the crystal orientation and structure will be retained while significantly increasing the accessible crystal surface area. By systematically varying solute-solvent interactions, solute-substrate interactions, and processing conditions, relationships between molecular parameters and the orientation, density and structure of nuclei will be uncovered.

For example, control over the orientation of nuclei will enable the first realization of vertical organic semiconductor crystal arrays in which the stack direction is aligned with the charge transport direction in solution-processed organic solar cells.

The Spring 2018 DMD will be hosted at UMass Amherst, https://sites.google.com/view/umass-dms/dmdspring19,  and universities in the region are being given the opportunity to host the remaining five DMD meetings. This project aims to further cultivate and enhance a network of students, post-doctoral researchers, faculty and industry mathematicians spread across the institutions in New England and New York working in the area of combinatorics (discrete mathematics), which is a thriving and rapidly advancing mathematical discipline. Motivated by applications to computer science, data science, cybersecurity, bioinformatics and more, combinatorialists have developed powerful new tools in recent years and have identified fundamental mathematical problems that, if solved, will have far-reaching impact in these applied areas. Connections to other areas of mathematics abound as well. <br/><br/>This project puts particular emphasis on service to students and faculty, particularly women and members of other groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The project's design particularly targets students and faculty at small, more remote institutions, a cohort that has made significant contributions to the field. With three one-day meetings per year as anchor activities, the project envisions an intentional infrastructure that facilitates ongoing interactions among researchers throughout the year. The PIs, together with the rest of the NCN leadership (meeting hosts and Steering Committee) will advance a set of activities that, while low in cost, provide key resources to researchers in the region. These activities include: a central NCN website to improve communication and collaboration, the Virtual Combinatorics Colloquium series that allows remote viewing and interaction, a series of ""New Directions"" presentations of accessible problem areas to foster undergraduate research and also engage early career faculty, and an on-line discussion forum that extends collaborative interactions that may start at any one of the regular meetings.

We rely on these algorithms in part because they perform better than alternatives and they can be easy to customize to new applications. Many machine learning algorithms also have a big weakness: it is difficult to understand how and why they compute the answers they provide. This opaqueness means that the answers we get from a machine learning algorithm could be subtly biased or even completely wrong, and yet we might not realize it. This project's goal is to make machine learning algorithms easier to understand, as well as to leverage some of the techniques used by attackers to trick machine learning algorithms into making mistakes to build computer systems that are more resistant to attack. In addition to making fundamental contributions to how machine learning algorithms are designed and used, the project includes outreach efforts that will entice students to gain hands-on experience with machine learning tools.<br/><br/>This project focuses on deep neural networks (DNNs).  A groundswell of research within the past five years has demonstrated the propensity of these models to being evaded by inputs created to fool them -- so called ""adversarial examples."" These types of attacks leverage DNNs' opacity: while DNNs can perform remarkably well on some classification tasks, they often defy simple explanations of how they do so, and indeed can leverage features for doing so that humans might find surprising. This project leverages DNNs and the attacks against them to gain insights into how to build more resilient computer systems. Specifically, the project will use DNNs to model adversaries trying to attack computer systems and then ""attack"" these DNNs to learn how to improve these systems' resilience to attack. This modeling will be done using Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), in which ""generator"" and ""discriminator"" models compete. Central to this vision are the abilities to evade DNNs under constraints and to extract explanations from them about how they perform classification. Consequently, this project will make fundamental advances both in developing better methods to deceive DNNs and in improving this important machine-learning tool.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The applications include energy (nuclear, wind, solar, etc.) generation, control and manufacturing, atmosphere-ocean modeling, weather prediction, surface water and ground water contamination, and so on. For all of these applications, the model problem is subject to numerous sources of uncertainty that include uncertain model parameters, forcing functions, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. For instance, in numerical weather prediction, to deal with uncertain initial conditions the weather model needs to be run multiple times with different initial conditions to generate an ensemble of possible model outputs, which will be analyzed and predictions made according to these data. This process is called ensemble forecasting, which is commonly done at all major operational weather prediction facilities worldwide, including the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). One common problem faced in these calculations is the excessive cost in terms of both storage and computing time. For many complex systems, especially those that deal with large spatial scales, running the model once is already very expensive. Running the model multiple times within a given limited computational time is very challenging even with modern supercomputers, and is not feasible in most large-scale applications. An efficient ensemble simulation algorithm that can reduce the computing cost significantly is thus highly desirable. This project seeks to develop novel, efficient ensemble algorithms and their analytical foundation for fast calculation of flow ensembles that is required to account for uncertainties in predictive simulations of fluid flows.<br/><br/>The inevitable conflict of high-resolution single realizations and computing ensembles is a central difficulty in many engineering and geophysical applications that are subject to uncertainties in both input data and model parameters. The development of efficient methods that allow for fast calculation of flow ensembles at a sufficiently fine spatial resolution is of great practical interest. This research is to develop novel, efficient ensemble algorithms for fast calculation of flow ensembles and conduct rigorous numerical analysis for the new algorithms and methods. The first research problem is to develop new efficient ensemble algorithms to compute multiple realizations for the Boussinesq equations. This includes the development of partitioned ensemble algorithms so that highly optimized Navier-Stokes-equation codes can be used to solve the problem. The second is to advance higher-order time discretizations for ensemble algorithms based on artificial compression. The third problem is the development of novel, efficient ensemble algorithms for the fast calculation of flow ensembles with varying model parameters. The methods studied will allow efficient determination of the multiple solutions corresponding to many parameter sets."

Theoretical and modeling studies agree at relatively small scales, where the flow becomes less dominated by the rotation of the earth, motion, especially along the vertical direction becomes more energetic, with pronounced impacts on ocean biogeochemistry, and air-sea fluxes. However, no study has focused on wave breaking variability and related bubble mediate gas transfer due to wave-current interactions. Most parameterizations of gas transfer coefficients today depend on wind speed rather than more detailed representation of wave dynamics, resulting in large uncertainties. Recent parameterizations include wave effects through integral wave parameters such as significant wave height or wave age, neither which can explain the modulation due to wave-current interactions at sharp fronts.  A recently developed model of wave breaking statistics provides a framework to explicitly account for breaking on air entrainment and bubble-mediated gas fluxes. The model is suitable for coupled earth system simulations providing a unique opportunity to study the effect of wave-current interactions on the variability of bubble-mediated gas transfer and fluxes. The results will have direct applications for climate studies. They can explain the uncertainty of the observed gas fluxes in coastal environments, helping to reduce the uncertainty of global CO2 budgets. Other impacts include training students. Specifically, an undergraduate student will participate in the research. The project will enhance the participation of underrepresented groups by contributing to the career of a Hispanic, early-career scientist, and by exposing the students at UCSB, a designated Hispanic-Serving Institution, to the research and its results. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the work is to investigate the modulation of bubble-mediated gas transfer due to wave-current interactions at submesoscales. The modeling is based on recent advances on surface wave breaking and related air-sea fluxes, which provide a physics-based framework to model bubble-mediated gas transfer coefficients. Realistic numerical simulations will be used to investigate the spatial variability of bubble-mediated gas transfer and their impact on gas fluxes (i.e., CO2). Preliminary model results show that wave breaking statistics forced by realistic winds and currents confirm previous findings from observations and theoretical analysis on the modulation of waves by currents, where wave breaking is enhanced in conditions with winds obliquely aligned with ocean fronts. The wave breaking modulation by currents is enhanced with increasing model resolution at submesoscales. Submesoscale frontal surface convergence and downwelling velocities overlap with areas with enhanced wave breaking with oblique wind forcing. It is hypothesized that under these conditions air-sea gas fluxes are enhanced. This will be tested with numerical simulations at an eastern boundary current during upwelling conditions. Upwelling areas have been shown to exhibit significant variability in CO2 concentrations that is not well understood. Dissolved CO2 will be modeled neglecting biological and chemical reactions starting from a background equilibrium level and then forced with realistic fluxes, including bubble-mediated transfer coefficients. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing model solutions at varying resolutions against a control run using standard transfer coefficient parameterizations that depend only on wind speed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The role of amylin in negatively impacting beta-cell function has recently been described. UCP2 is known for decreasing the number of oxygen radicals resulting from a metabolic process, which suggests that UCP2 may work to keep beta-cells healthy since a high number of oxygen radicals can lead to poor cell function.

They also play a critical role in storing carbon and in providing other benefits to society. Our knowledge of how forests function depends on our understanding of the drivers of tree growth, death and reproduction. The importance of these drivers may change with tree age, species and environmental conditions. Yet, the nature and relative importance of these different drivers is difficult to study because they act over very long timescales and large spatial scales. This research project will examine tree performance in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate forests to address this challenge. The project makes use of long-term datasets about these forests to understand the slow processes involved. Specifically, the research team will measure growth, mortality and reproductive rates for 16 common tree species, including those that dominate eastern North American forests. The three dimensions of biodiversity- genetic, functional, and phylogenetic- will be integrated in this project. The data produced by the project will be valuable for those studying the biology of forests in this region. Lastly, the project will train one postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students and two undergraduate students based in the United States and will provide two training workshops for early career United States researchers. <br/><br/>Forest dynamics emerge from demographic outcomes on the level of individual trees. This project examines how the fundamental tradeoffs in tree performance are determined by the three dimensions of biodiversity as well as environmental conditions. The core questions of this project are: (1) Are the drivers of the tradeoffs underlying tree performance consistent across a taxonomically and functionally diverse sample of species? (2) How are intra-specific functional and genetic similarity of individuals within a population linked to their demographic success? (3) How does intra-specific functional and genetic diversity vary across populations and how is this linked to tree performance across life stages? and (4) How does variation in the abiotic and biotic environment drive tree performance? The project will use long-term 50 hectare forest plots in the U.S. and China to study tree demography across temperate, subtropical, and tropical forest systems. Reference genome assemblies will be produced for 14 species of phylogenetically diverse trees. Finally, a large greenhouse experiment with tree seedlings under different conditions will help provide mechanistic understanding of the tradeoffs for young trees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, mitochondria are not just any cellular component; they are the result of an ancient bacterial infection. They essentially are bacteria that permanently live in our cells; they have become part of us. Until just a few years ago, it was thought that the mitochondrion (and its partner structure in plants, the chloroplast) was unique in biology. Recent work has shown that many mitochondrion-like relationships exist in biology. Insects in particular have repeatedly developed relationships with bacteria that have taken up permanent residence in their cells. These bacteria show many similarities to mitochondria, particularly in reference to genome structure. The goal of this project is to use recent discoveries about the bacteria that live inside cicadas as a window into the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts and how they integrate with the cells in which they are found. . The work described in this project will use cutting-edge genomic experiments to accomplish these goals. This work is computationally intensive, and as such the educational component of this research will focus on teaching computer programming and its applications to Montana students at all levels. This work will have the important outcome of increasing the competitiveness of Montana students by giving them the computational tools they need to handle diverse, complex, and large sets of data. <br/><br/>Mitochondria originated only once in the history of life, a very long time ago, and the details of  their evolution remain obscure. Research into the mitochondria of diverse plants, animals, and single-celled organisms has revealed striking diversity in mitochondrial genome structure and size. Insects acquired bacterial endosymbionts much more recently than the origin of mitochondria, and so many of the features associated with the origin and establishment of the mitochondria are seen in insect endosymbionts but are less evolved. Recent work has shown that, like mitochondria, some insect endosymbionts have undergone extensive genome fragmentation and expansion. This research will use genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, molecular evolution, and field biology to provide insight into why some endosymbiotic genomes stay stable, while others diversify. This project includes activities that will teach University of Montana undergraduates and graduate students the fundamentals of computer programming using genomic data. The proposal will bring together students of biology that lack any computational background with students from the graphical arts for whom data visualization techniques are routine into a single course. These students will work collaboratively with each other to create new ways of visualizing massive genome data."

For example, previous major cascading blackouts such as the U.S.-Canadian blackout in 2003 and the Indian blackout in 2012 have caused many component failures, significant economic losses, and severe social impacts. Therefore, greatly enhancing the complex system resilience and keeping the lights on are thus very critical for minimizing the service disruptions and maintaining the economic growth and prosperity. However, the existing cascading failure study heavily relies on simulation models, which are either too general to be able to provide implementable prevention/intervention strategies or too difficult to benchmark or validate for drawing reliable conclusions. In this CAREER project, the significant limitations of the existing approaches will be addressed by developing a fresh-new real outage data driven research framework in order to better analyze, prevent, and intervene cascading failures. The research on cascading failure analysis, prevention, and intervention to be conducted in this project will help greatly reduce the risk of catastrophic blackouts and enhance the resilience of power systems, bringing tremendous economic and social benefits to U.S. and other countries around the world. Several educational activities including curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate level, engaging undergraduate students in research, and involving Hispanic and women students in the project are proposed. For K-12 and community education, a demonstration based on a cascading blackout scenario will be built. Academic community will be engaged with webinars, seminars, and panel sessions at conferences.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to initiate a new data-driven research direction for studying cascading failure and power system resilience and develop systematic, transformative theoretical foundations and algorithmic techniques for data-driven cascading failure analysis, prevention, and intervention, addressing the inherent limitations of existing approaches, refreshing the understanding of real-world cascading failure, and providing tools to analyze, prevent, and finally intervene cascading failures. Network science, statistical inference, data science, and deep learning will be seamlessly integrated with power system domain knowledge in order to obtain a unique solution to the very challenging problem. Specifically, the following three inter-related projects will be highlighted to significantly advance the research agenda: 1) A solid foundation of the data-driven cascading failure approach will be built through an efficient and accurate estimation of failure interactions to convert utility outage data to information, addressing the challenges of propagation pattern evolution over cascading stages, high heterogeneity among cascades, and data scarcity. Deep learning approaches will be developed to reveal the structural features of the interactions and recover the missing component interactions. 2) Utilizing real utility outage data, the complex and universal temporal-spatial properties of cascading failure propagation will be investigated based on the estimated failure interactions to convert information to knowledge, revealing the temporal evolution of cascading behaviors, spatial propagation patterns, and criticality in both temporal evolution and spatial propagation. 3) The very challenging cascading failure prevention and intervention study will be advanced by converting knowledge to actionable wisdom. Cascading failure prevention is to be developed based on the identified critical components using the expected number of outages. Structural or operational signatures of critical components will be identified using both the failure interaction network and the original system topology. Further, a novel cascading failure intervention problem will be formulated and solved by a deep, safe reinforcement learning approach that utilizes both the learned information/knowledge from real outage data and the power system domain knowledge. By interpreting the high-level abstraction of the learned optimal policies, useful insights about cascading failure intervention will be provided.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project team will use sonomyographic sensors in combination with mechanical sensors to infer the user's intent in anticipation of ambulation mode or joint motion, for example locomotor transitions from walking over level ground to ramps or stairs. The team will then perform human subject experiments comparing the ability of participants with transfemoral amputation to ambulate with and without various sonomyographic control algorithms enabled. If successful, the project will have positive impact on national health and welfare by improving the lives of individuals with amputation in terms of their independence and ambulation abilities, and by mitigating undesirable secondary effects of amputation such as a fear of falling and long-term joint health.

While a technological revolution in systems neuroscience yielded a broad array of tools to observe and manipulate neural circuits, behavioral technologies have lagged behind. The problem of behavioral measurement and description is as complex as behaviors are diverse. To study behavior, laboratories employ complex behavioral systems, often in combination with custom-made hardware and software, and use these to define the tasks animals are required to learn and perform. As a consequence, the descriptions of behavioral tasks are tied to the hardware of each system, and there is no general, abstract description format to bridge across laboratories employing different systems. Building on insights from computer science, computational linguistics, and psychology, the goal of this project is to develop a formal language to describe behavioral tasks. This new behavioral task description language enhances accurate task design, improves reproducibility of existing tasks, enables widespread sharing and publication of task descriptions, and supports cross-system implementation. The project has broad benefits for improving scientific rigor and reproducibility in behavioral neuroscience. Moreover, the project reduces a significant barrier to sophisticated behavioral neuroscience experiments, putting them within reach of undergraduate class projects, and exposing students to a highly interdisciplinary approach, drawing on neuroscience, computer science, psychology, and linguistics.<br/> <br/>The project entails the development of a formal computer language that can describe all laboratory behavioral tasks in a platform-independent manner. Currently, behavioral tasks are described largely with a combination of flowcharts and textual explanation, beyond the specific software codes used to control behavioral hardware. These descriptions do not provide formal accounts that ensure identical re-implementation or the rigorous comparison of similarly described paradigms. In addition, the hardware-bound codes tend hide the logic of behavioral tasks. The objective of this project is to design a new language, an extension to finite state machine descriptions, that can serve both as abstract illustrations for publications and also ready-to-run programs to control hardware. The new behavioral task description language builds on the class virtual finite state machines, a finite state machine extension framework that was developed to provide software specifications for real-time control systems. Additionally, the new task description language introduces ways to encapsulate common design motifs so they can be treated as primitives and additional features to define trial structures. The consistent high-level description enhances behavioral task design, distilling critical features into an easy-to-understand and formally rigorous structure. To demonstrate the use of this language, a turn-key implementation, including a graphical editor, is produced. In addition, templates for an array of commonly used behavioral tasks are produced. The platform-independent behavior description language exposes the underlying behavioral task logic and makes it easier to describe, reproduce, and share behavioral tasks across laboratories.

Due to the prevalence of these new services, today's wireless networks are witnessing not only an unprecedented growth in the volume of traffic, but also a significant change in the types of traffic (e.g., a much higher percentage of voice/video traffic with more stringent delay requirements). These new trends require next-generation wireless networks to provide not only high data rates (tens of gigabits per second), but also ultra-low latencies (sub-millisecond). Moreover, as wireless networks grow and support an increasingly large number of users, network control algorithms must also incur low complexity in order to be implemented in practice. However, the question of how to simultaneously achieve high throughput, low delay and low complexity remains largely open. Addressing this major research challenge is a main goal of this project. Not only is this research expected to substantially advance our understanding of designing efficient control algorithms for wireless networks with jointly optimized performance, but it would also expand/create the much-needed theoretical foundations for developing simple and practical protocols to optimize the key performance metrics needed in the design of next-generation wireless networks. This research will also be closely integrated with a comprehensive educational plan, which is focused on providing research experiences to undergraduate and K-12 students, recruiting and training underrepresented students, and engaging in curriculum development activities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create new theoretical foundations for designing provably efficient network control algorithms that perform well in all three dimensions of throughput, delay, and complexity. Specifically, this research will be carried out around three main thrusts: (i) it focuses on intra-cell control for a multi-channel cellular network, and aims to build a theoretical framework for designing low-complexity scheduling algorithms with provably guaranteed optimal throughput and optimal (or near-optimal) large-deviations delay rate-function; (ii) it considers a more challenging setting of network-wide control for larger systems (e.g., a dense multi-cell system or an ad hoc wireless network), and aims to develop a new node-based approach for designing efficient scheduling algorithms with provable throughput and evacuation time performance; and (iii) it considers distributed network-side control and aims to design low-complexity algorithms that achieve high throughput and low delay."

The proposed research will make a concrete step toward bridging this gap by developing new communication algorithms and protocols for wireless networks, specifically multi-hop wireless networks. Multi-hop communication brings many benefits such as enlarged network coverage, reduced radio transmit power, and relaxed requirements for network infrastructure, yet interference severely degrades network performance. This project investigates this fundamental issue by developing practical approaches to managing interference in multi-hop wireless networks, with the objective of maximizing their throughput performance.

However, limitations to developing SOC yet to be overcome include: 1) the atmospheric channel is dynamic and not well-understood, preventing its statistical characterization; 2) the traditional communication system design ignores full use of relevant information from real-time data; 3) the complexity of the systems required to achieve the performance gain of SOC (over RF) would increase rapidly, hence SOC engineering solutions must incorporate the complexity as a constraint. To address these challenges, this research develops a systematic design framework which combines model-based and data-driven design paradigms for SOC and where the system 1) models and predicts the long-term dynamics of the atmospheric channel, and 2) proactively adapts its communication and networking strategy to the dynamics of the environment, thereby maximizing end-to-end system performances in terms of data rates, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and link reliability. The proposed approach will demonstrate how SOC can be a reliable platform that complements existing technologies to fulfill the requirements of easy deployment, high data rates, and affordable complexity of future systems. Potential benefits of the project include deploying broadband internet via optical drones in poor countries, thus enabling access to information and education; ensuring connectivity between aircraft, thus improving the safety, reliability, and efficiency of air travel; and enhancing the reliability of space exploratory missions, thus increasing our potential for discovery. The research effort will be integrated with the principal investigator's educational career goal of promoting undergraduate research, encouraging enrollment of high-school students in STEM and recruiting underrepresented students by working with the institution's existing diversity recruitment and support programs.<br/><br/>Current communication systems are either difficult to deploy at large scale or limited by the RF spectrum licensing burdens. This project's contributions are significant because they show, via a mix of theoretical and practical frameworks, how SOC can be a reliable platform that complements and enhances existing technologies. The first objective of the research is to derive the performance limits of SOC, which describe the best error probability and channel capacity that a well-designed system can achieve in various relevant settings such as multiple access and relay channels, and accounting for atmospheric impairments. To mitigate the atmospheric effects, a sharp statistical channel model will be devised. The work will encompass deep-space, near-earth and space system networks. While deep space communication is well described via the Poisson channel model, the effects of the atmospheric attenuation and pointing error could be captured via statistical models. Depending on the communication scenarios, an input-dependent or an input-independent Gaussian noise could also be incorporated. The methodology to undertake this objective is based on applying tools from information and communication theories along with a non-parametric statistical channel learning approach. The second objective is to develop powerful machine learning techniques to perform signal classification, estimate parameters of the atmosphere, determine the mapping between input and output data and infer probability distributions in order to design communication systems that can efficiently perform without relying heavily on channel models. Block structure Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based as well as end-to-end DNN-based designs, for point-to-point and multiuser settings, will be considered. The methodology to undertake this objective relies mainly on designing SOC auto-encoders with gradient-free optimization techniques and block structure DNN-based channel estimation, signal classification, and detection.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the key challenges in enabling smart urban communities lies in integrating pedestrians? needs into the design of the urban infrastructure. For example, lack of timely support to cross the streets at intersections, particularly in inclement weather conditions, frustrates many pedestrians and is conducive to jaywalking, a well-documented source of pedestrian fatalities in big cities. It is, therefore, of a fundamental importance to provide pedestrian-centric services, particularly for vulnerable pedestrians such as children, the elderly, and the disabled.  This proposal aims to develop and build CrossGuard, a system which will make crossing at intersections safer and, in the process, elevate pedestrians' quality of experience. CrossGuard will explore new opportunities available at the nexus of intelligent infrastructure, data analytics, intelligent sensing, and engaged pedestrians towards Vision Zero, a world-wide initiative that aims for zero traffic fatalities. The design of CrossGuard is inspired by human crossing guards, often stationed at busy intersections, most notably near schools. Just like a vigilant crossing guard, CrossGuard will anticipate pedestrian needs and accommodate them promptly and effectively. We expect this project to have a profound and lasting societal impact. <br/><br/>The objectives of CrossGuard will be realized via the exploration of four research questions: (1) Investigating and developing an understanding of the challenges facing the pedestrian community; (2) Designing algorithms to identify vulnerable pedestrians and developing stochastic models for ensuring that they can cross safely; (3) Developing sensing modalities and resource allocation strategies for the successful provisioning of CrossGuard?s services; and (4) Expanding CrossGuard to non-signalized intersections. <br/>The team will actively engage citizens and officials from the cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach in a meaningful dialogue via focus groups and workshops. They will also make efforts to ensure participation from a representative cross-section of the citizens, particularly parents of school-age children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. The team envisions that the wealth of real-time traffic data collected in conjunction with perceived traffic trends will make the seamless integration of pedestrian and vehicular traffic possible. In turn, this will offer new opportunity for connected urban spaces, and will drastically reduce traffic accidents involving pedestrians, especially children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spanning these two data types, spatial networks represent a crucial data structure where the nodes and edges are embedded in a geometric space. Nowadays, spatial network data is becoming increasingly popular and important, ranging from micro-scale (e.g., protein structures), to middle-scale (e.g., biological neural networks), to macro-scale (e.g., mobility networks). The modeling of spatial networks is extremely difficult due to the significant challenges involved, including: 1) incompatibility between the treatments for continuous spatial properties and discrete network properties, 2) the close interactions between spatial and network topologies, and 3) their extremely high dimensionality. These challenges echo numerous unsolved critical issues in the real world such as modeling and understanding the ""protein structure folding process"" and ""mental disease mechanisms in brain networks"". Until now, there has been a significant gap between our lack of powerful models and the extremely complex research issues involved in modeling the generation of spatial networks. To fill this gap, this project focuses on developing a transformative framework for spatial network generative modeling, which can automatically learn the underlying complex generation process from massive spatial network datasets.<br/><br/>This project generalizes existing generative models of spatial networks into deep and expressive architectures. The developed framework aims at: 1) automatically learning new generation and transformation process of spatial networks, 2) embedding user-specified principles to constrain and regularize the generated spatial networks, and 3) pursuing the model interpretability and automatically distill new understandable principles of spatial network process. The research activities are conducted along the following themes: i) novel spatial and spectral graph decoders for large spatial networks, ii) deep generative modeling and optimization with spatial and topological constraints and regularization, iii) a variety of novel spatial- and spectral- graph transformation strategies, and iv) a novel system for interacting the predefined and distilled principles between human and models. The techniques developed in this project aim at benefiting various social and natural science domains by enabling efficient and accurate discovery and synthesis of complex spatial network behavior. The success of this project can benefit crucial domains including medicine design, mental disease early diagnoses, and disaster management.

It contextualizes how crucial nutrient recycling processes vary across gradients of coral cover and nutrient availability, two factors highlighted as the main drivers of reef decline in the Anthropocene, making the results useful to managers seeking to enhance ecosystem-based approaches to reef restoration. The investigators are collecting diel measurements of microbial and biogeochemical processes at coral reefs around Mo?orea at the Long Term Ecological Research site there (MCR-LTER).  They are using established spatial gradients of benthic cover, from coral to macroalgal dominance, and nutrient inputs. Overall the research improves our understanding of how these key environmental factors influence diel microbe-DOM interactions and nutrient recycling. The ongoing macroalgal phase shifts observed at Mo?orea are hypothesized to be related to nutrient pollution, and this work directly informs understanding of how these changes are impacting nutrient cycling in the reefs of Mo?orea. The training of several undergraduate students and two graduate students, one in Biology and one in Oceanography is shared between two minority serving institutions of higher education. The project also supports active outreach programs with the Ocean Discovery Institute focused on engaging underrepresented high school students in ocean-oriented careers in San Diego, and with the UH College Sea Grant Program to support coral reef resilience initiatives locally in Hawai?i.<br/><br/>Coral reefs exhibit some of the highest rates of primary production and decomposition of any ecosystem type yet persist in some of the most oligotrophic waters on the planet, implying tight recycling of macronutrients through organic matter. The last half century of work on the biogeochemistry of reefs have highlighted this bacterial decomposition of organic matter as a likely mechanism for maintaining nutrient retention and reef productivity. This project applies modern metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics to test clearly defined hypotheses of how diel microbe-DOM interactions drive nutrient recycling and retention in reefs. The investigators are first resolving coupled in situ diel dynamics of organic and inorganic C, N and P (using bulk elemental and spectroscopic methods), microbial abundances and population structures (using DNA sequencing and flow cytometry) and the chemical composition of DOM (using untargeted tandem mass spectrometry) in multiple reef habitats across a gradient of benthic cover and nutrient availability. These patterns inform the second in situ diel sampling campaign resolving the dynamic coupling of metabolic pathways (using metagenomics), exoenzymatic activity (using transcriptomics and enzyme assays) and transformations of specific metabolites (tracked via molecular networking) to distill common mechanisms of microbial organic matter decomposition that play a role in nutrient cycling. This project is being conducted within the Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research program, leveraging a wealth of time series data on multiple reef habitats as well as contextualizing our in situ sampling with ongoing physical, geochemical and biological monitoring programs.

This approach exploits sensor information and scene geometry to provide improved and more predictable wireless network performance. It also uses information received over the network to aid perception functions such as object recognition and point correspondence. The team first explores the design space of network architectures for blending perception and communications by designing low-energy tags and visual signaling strategies. The team then develops simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms that blend conventional strategies with network information to enhance robustness. It also designs geometric matching techniques to enhance object association in images with network information. At the network and link layers, the system will exploit knowledge about physical obstacles and the surrounding geometry obtained from camera views and other sensors to provide more predictable and seamless high-bandwidth coverage.

A fundamental question in all these scientific domains is how to effectively explore the space of all possible forms of a dynamic system to uncover those that satisfy non-trivial constraints imposed by function.  The most visible instantiation of this question in computational structural biology is de-novo protein structure prediction (PSP). PSP takes a structure-driven view of understanding molecular mechanisms in the cell and seeks to determine one or more  biologically-active/native structures of a protein from knowledge of its chemical composition. Elucidating such structures is central to inferring the biological activities of a rapidly-growing number of protein-encoding gene sequences and thus advancing our understanding of the inner workings of a cell. While PSP has a natural formulation under stochastic optimization, current efforts are approaching a saturation point. This project proposes a radically-different, complementary approach. Inspired by recent momentum in generative deep learning, the project approaches de-novo PSP under the umbrella of generative, adversarial deep learning. The approach is firmly grounded in information integration and informatics, as it proposes generative models that learn in an adversarial setting to generate native-like tertiary protein structures. The project benefits researchers in machine learning, deep learning, and information integration with interests in graph generative models, molecule generation, and protein structure prediction. The project will result in open-source codes, online teaching modules and tutorials, publicly-available data and models, workshops, software demos, and will broaden the participation in computing of under-represented students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The activities in this project chart a new algorithmic path under the umbrella of information integration and informatics to address the current impasse in structure-function related problems in molecular biology. The focus is on the de-novo protein structure prediction problem.  With experimental structure determination lagging behind the rapidly-growing number of protein-encoding gene sequences by high-throughput sequencing technologies, computational approaches have a central role in molecular biology research. Great progress has been made through stochastic optimization, but current approaches are experiencing diminishing returns, partly due to fundamental challenges concerning the resource-aware exploration-exploitation control in complex search spaces and inherently inaccurate scoring functions. This project puts forth a novel approach to structure prediction under the umbrella of generative, adversarial deep learning, leveraging recent advances and opportunities in graph generative learning, adversarial learning, and deep learning. Generative models learn in an adversarial setting to generate native-like tertiary protein structures. The proposed activities span multiple disciplines and promise to make general contributions in machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI, molecular modeling, and computational biology. The work will also benefit researchers and students interested in modeling complex, dynamic systems. The investigators will disseminate the proposed research via open-source codes in C++ and Python so as to reach diverse communities of researchers and students, online teaching modules and tutorials, trained models and data. They will actively educate involved communities through workshops, tutorials, and software demonstrations. This interdisciplinary project also creates excellent opportunities to broaden the participation in computing of under-represented students of all backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineering programs present considerable challenges, including the need to motivate students and the need for students to have positive attitudes toward learning. Prior research demonstrates that high motivation and positive attitudes towards learning occur when students feel in control of their own learning, place a high value on what they are studying, can regulate their anxiety, and recover from setbacks.  While asking students questions about these issues is useful, there is a more direct way to study them - by measuring students' physical responses in real time. A unique element of this study is that in addition to surveys, the investigators will monitor students' body stress responses through sweat and saliva to capture students' anxiety during an exam. The intellectual merit of this ECR project is to broaden understanding of factors related to success using physical signs that a student cannot consciously control and of which they may not even be aware. The broader impacts of this research will come from integrating students' reported perceptions with their unconscious responses to better understand students' emotional and motivational responses to learning, especially those of underrepresented students, who face even greater challenges.  This ECR project will support innovative learning environments that promote student success and entrance into the workforce.<br/><br/>More specifically, the intellectual merit of this project is to extend theories of motivation and emotion by integrating physiological responses of students with more traditional measures to better predict student beliefs and behaviors, as well as performance on accepted metrics of success in engineering programs. In addition to surveys, we will use physiological markers based on sweat on the skin (electrodermal activity) and saliva (particularly hormonal markers) to capture students' emotion and anxiety during an authentic exam setting associated with a foundational engineering course. The project will also be integrative in drawing upon theoretical and practical knowledge from engineering education, psychology, physiology, and the learning sciences. It will also broaden understanding of factors related to student emotion, motivation and self-regulation using physical signals that a student cannot self-report as they cannot consciously control and may not even be aware of. The broader impact will come from applying these findings to improving student outcomes, especially those of underrepresented students, who are trying to succeed in an especially challenging environment."

This study deals with two globally important agricultural systems, the Heihe River Basin in China and the Central Valley of California, USA, that exemplify the complexities of large scale water-energy systems.  The Heihe and the Central Valley represent billions of dollars in economic productivity and produce billions of kilowatt hours of electricity every year.  While the two basins are in many ways similar (water flows from high in the mountains to nourish crops below), there are key differences in their history and management that provides many important information. This project brings together researchers from the US and China to better understand tradeoffs between water and energy supply in these complex agricultural systems. Advantage is taken of computer simulations, datasets and research from US and Chinese teams in their local basins and collaborate to advance our shared understanding of these basins.  The state of the art computer simulation platforms developed and applied here are designed to capture connections between humans and natural systems not possible with previous modeling approaches. This project also seeks to educate the next generation of water users, planners and scientists on groundwater sustainability by developing K-12 education materials for both the US and China that will be piloted in real classrooms in both countries. This project will help us better understand weaknesses in managed food-water-energy systems like the Heihe and Central Valley to strengthen them moving forward.  <br/><br/>Water connects food production, energy demand and energy production in irrigated agricultural systems.  Intensively managed basins routinely have surface water irrigation, groundwater irrigation and hydropower production operating in tandem. While there have been many operational studies of large scale irrigated systems, the majority of tools applied to these problems focus on the human systems and simplify the natural hydrology. This study bridges this gap developing novel tools that can simulate FEW interactions in complex human and natural systems. In this project leverage of international advances in physically based integrated numerical modeling is accomplished by bringing together two teams of modelers from the US and China. The goal is to explore the tradeoffs between agricultural water supply, hydropower production and environmental degradation in two globally important agricultural systems: the Central Valley of California (USA) and the Heihe River basin in China. Specifically, exploring (1) how the vulnerabilities of food and energy systems differ, (2) where conflicting interests can lead to system inefficiency and environmental degradation, and (3) the advantages of applying integrated hydrologic models to these human systems.

By studying policies, with a particular focus on those directed toward training, accountability, community-oriented policing, ""hot-spot"" policing, calls for service, and other deployment strategies, the project can help identify which policies are most successful at reducing racial disparities and what conditions moderate that relationship.  This knowledge will assist in reducing racial profiling and bolster equitable policing.<br/><br/>This project will examine how common policies in policing influence racially disparate outcomes across formal policy, organizational climate, geospatial, and community-guided police activity domains.  This investigators will use an interdisciplinary approach to identify specific mechanisms of policing that can contribute to more or less unequal outcomes.  By examining outcomes across these domains, they will provide a large multi-site assessment of how organizational policy produces racially disparate outcomes, with special attention given toward identifying how to reduce those disparities.  The investigators will draw heavily on theoretical frameworks from social psychology, economics, and sociology, such as implicit bias, resource efficiency, and social stratification.  They will trace causal chains from police department (and related municipal and state) policies (such as training and supervision) through the social and organizational attitudinal climates of departments in order to examine how these policies and climates interact with different deployment approaches (such as ""hot spot"" and proactive policing) to affect outcomes for citizens, especially racially and ethnically discriminatory outcomes in stops, searches, arrests, and excessive use of force.

The project has the potential to substantially improve health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and diminish the spread of disease by significantly reducing the time and resources required to identify affected individuals. Partnering with the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health (NCSLPH), the project investigates pooling strategies for combining individual laboratory samples to measure the concentration of a disease-related marker. Pools that test positive for the disease marker then undergo follow-up testing to identify positive-testing individuals. Pooling is a highly efficient strategy but must be performed carefully so as to control for imperfect medical testing technologies, heterogeneous populations, dilution effects, variable disease progression, and other uncertainties in testing and disease parameters. This project will provide public health agencies with effective strategies to mitigate existing and emerging threats to communities and populations. <br/><br/>This award supports fundamental research in operational methods to design effective and efficient sample-based screening strategies by exploring novel, rigorous approaches to pooled testing using an optimization framework. The framework will incorporate disease (marker) progression models, imperfect tests with continuous outcomes, pooling dilution effects, and demographic variables, including risk-factors, in a realistic manner. The framework will be used to study the effects of non-uniform screening policies, the impact of more accurate but costly test procedures, policy robustness, and measures of equity among screened subpopulations. By deriving structural properties of solutions to the resulting non-convex optimization problems, this research will generate insight and principles on the use of pooling. In collaboration with NCSLPH, pooling strategies will developed, calibrated, and validated for two of the most prevalent sexually-transmitted diseases in the United States.

For example, many engineering analyses are still based on 1D profiles of the subsurface, or pseudo-2D/3D profiles constructed from several 1D soundings.  When true 3D imaging is performed, the depth and resolution of exploration is often limited.  While the problem of subsurface imaging is quite complex, the ability to develop rapid, realistic, 3D images of the subsurface, with accompanying engineering properties (e.g., shear modulus), would significantly advance engineering for more resilient and sustainable infrastructure.  This research aims to develop a new 3D subsurface imaging method using recordings of ambient noise obtained from a grid of surface sensors. The new 3D Ambient Noise Tomography (3D ANT) method will provide a rapid, non-intrusive, robust way of imaging the subsurface in 3D at m-scales over the top 50- to 100-m of the subsurface. While numerous example applications for accurate and deep 3D subsurface imaging exist within infrastructure engineering, this project will specifically address two needs related to natural hazards: (1) the need for developing realistic 3D subsurface models for use in earthquake ground motion studies, and (2) the need for improved 3D in-situ imaging for anomaly (e.g., void/sinkhole) detection.  Furthermore, significant and broad benefits for society, both anticipated and unanticipated, will result from developing deeper, higher-resolution 3D subsurface imaging methods.  The ability to look inside the earth and retrieve rapid and reliable models using ambient noise will impact fields as diverse as: natural resource exploration, subsurface hydrology, pure earth science, archeology, underground development, military/security studies, and space/planet exploration. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research center around testing the hypothesis that accurate 3D subsurface P- and S-wave velocity models can be extracted at m-scales down to 50- to 100-m depth from surface recordings of ambient noise.  To test this hypothesis, the research will develop a novel 3D ANT method and verify the method with numerical simulations and field experiments.  The use of ambient noise for 3D subsurface imaging presents inherent challenges related to the uncontrollable frequency content and propagation direction of ambient noise.  However, ambient noise is rich in low frequency energy, allowing for deeper imaging than what is currently possible using active-source 3D full waveform inversion (FWI) methods.  Hence, 3D ANT, when coupled with active-source 3D FWI, will provide high resolution images to depths presently unobtainable.  The 3D ANT method will require collecting ambient noise recordings from a 2D grid of closely spaced surface sensors.  The noise recordings will be used to extract experimental correlation functions between every possible pair of sensors. 3D viscoelastic wave equations will then be used to obtain synthetic correlation functions, which will be matched with the experimental ones using a Gauss-Newton FWI approach for extracting 3D subsurface models.  Optimization of the 3D ANT algorithm will include parametric studies on field testing configurations (i.e., number and spacing of sensors) and ambient noise characteristics (i.e., frequency content and azimuthal distribution).  Ultimately, two well-characterized field sites with ground truth have been selected to test the methodology under real-world conditions.  This research will only achieve its broadest impact if we are successful at training students to carry it into the future, disseminating results, and developing tools that practitioners can use in industry. We aim to tackle these challenges while simultaneously broadening the participation of women in natural hazards engineering.  Hazards engineering is about transforming how civil infrastructure can be designed and rehabilitated such that communities and individuals are more resilient to the devastating effects of natural hazards, and studies have shown that women are more interested in STEMM fields when they have direct societal impacts.  This work will help foster a natural intersection of interest and purpose in a diverse and talented group of future engineers with skills that will be critical for revolutionizing natural hazards engineering, such as coding, analyzing big-data, and supercomputing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project builds fundamental insight about how different computational approaches aid methods for detecting network patterns in illicit wildlife supply chains and new understanding about how illicit wildlife supply chain organizations operate (even using legal networks at times).  The study will inform resource allocation, monitoring and enforcement, and communication to facilitate effective interdiction activities to combat wildlife trafficking. Further, the award will benefit decisions about how, when, and where to intervene and disrupt illicit wildlife supply networks. The interdisciplinary approach creates new channels of communication between geography, supply chain management, operations research, conservation social science, and computer science.  The project supports broad engagement of PhD students in interdisciplinary science, will diffuse results into research journals via publications, university education via business case studies, and conservation practice via engagement of practitioners. <br/><br/>Using complementary lines of inquiry into the global problem of wildlife trafficking, the project develops a new, fundamental understanding of wildlife trafficking supply chains (WTSCs), including decision points, behavioral patterns of participants, dynamic linkages between component parts, and convergence with legal supply chains. The research will define, describe, and map key nodes and components of a specific supply chain using existing, team-collected data from an illicit WTSC, create qualitative framework models associated with decisions about WTSCs, develop methods to detect meaningful patterns of weakness and resilience in WTSCs, and create new quantitative WTSC interdiction models and solution approaches building on techniques for network design optimization, the multi-armed bandit, the orienteering problem and green security games. Our outcomes will be to measure operations in a real-world system, develop geospatial information science and computational models about system operations, refine and revise these models to predict resiliency, and test the scalability, performance of the models at tactical and strategic levels and convergence with other illicit supply chains.

Physical flexibility combined with cost and weight advantages opens a wide range of application areas, including wearable electronics, medical sensing and rollable displays. However, the performance and capabilities of purely flexible electronics are currently much more limited than the silicon technology. Emerging flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) integrates rigid silicon chips and printed electronics to bridge the gap between today's complex systems and flexible electronics. Hence, FHE can drive the next big leap forward in the form factor design, similar to the shift from desktop and laptop computers to hand-held devices. FHE systems differ significantly from traditional computing systems. First, physical flexibility and stretchability expands the design space into an uncharted dimension, which introduces intricate trade-offs with the traditional power, performance and area metrics. Second, bending and stretching can alter the characteristics of FHE systems. Finally, large batteries and heat sinks are prohibitive due to flexibility and wearability constraints. Therefore, there is a need for theoretically grounded and practically applicable tools that quantify physical flexibility as a new metric. The proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in FHE by developing modeling, flexibility-aware optimization and run-time management techniques. <br/><br/>FHE can be an enabler for ubiquitous devices for wearable computing, internet-of-things, body sensors, and medical applications. This project will help in transforming lives by providing a systematic approach to design wearable systems and arbitrarily shaped objects. For example, FHE can enable electronic patches equipped with motion, physiological and biochemical sensors, and wireless transceivers. These patches can be used to examine movement disorders anytime and anywhere, in stark contrast to the current practice, where a patient has to stay in a clinical environment. The educational goal of this project is to enrich the engineering curriculum with FHE. A digest of research outcomes will be presented to undergraduate and graduate students through a new course. This project will also provide hands-on training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to strengthen the STEM workforce pipeline."

In contrast, modern artificial intelligence systems like Siri and Alexa need to be trained extensively on massive data sets; even then the linguistic abilities of such systems lag far behind those of a child. Scientific research on language acquisition and structure has taught us that children come to the task of language learning with preconceptions of what their language will look like. They use such preconceptions, referred to as ""biases"", to guide their learning, favoring language structures that are compatible with those biases. By structuring computers systems to incorporate these biases, we could construct computer interfaces that would be more effective not only for languages such as English and Spanish, but also for the many languages where training data is scarce, spoken in smaller communities within the United States and internationally. Moreover, understanding more about how the biases necessary for language learning can be instantiated in a computer model will help to resolve a long-standing debate about the nature of these human biases: are they specific to language or are they the result of more general properties of human cognition?<br/><br/>The current project explores the learning of regularities in natural language syntax by computer systems. The focus will be specifically on systems based on neural networks, which have been behind the recent revolutionary advances in language technologies. The project will study a wide range of neural network architectures, some with explicitly represented linguistic biases and some not, and compare them with respect to their abilities to learn carefully defined linguistic patterns. In contrast to past work that has evaluated linguistic knowledge of neural networks indirectly through a language modeling (word prediction) task, this project instead explores tasks that are formulated as transformations, which map one linguistic form to another (e.g., question formation, verbal inflection, negation, passivization, mapping to logical form). Not only are such mappings at the basis of a widely applied class of neural network architectures, so-called sequence to sequence networks, but they are also a common way of characterizing syntactic processes in linguistics. As a result, the use of such mappings allows a more direct assessment of the networks' linguistic abilities. Part of the project will involve the collaborative development of training and testing datasets for the mappings, with involvement by an interdisciplinary team of linguists and computer scientists, and these will be made available as a resource for the entire research community.  These datasets will then be used as the basis for the detailed analysis of neural network representations of linguistic structure. Furthermore, explicit comparisons will be carried out between neural network and human performance on the mapping tasks under study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
