Future quantum computers will be able to solve problems important to materials science and chemistry, to code-breaking and to machine learning. Which features of a problem make it a good target for a quantum computer, and what resources quantum computers use to solve problems faster, are difficult and poorly understood questions. This project will make possible the hire of a theoretical computer scientist working in quantum information at Tufts University. This hire will contribute to research in quantum information science and to training the next generation of quantum information scientists who will go on to achieve the goals of the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) act. <br/><br/>The new Faculty hire in Computer Science at Tufts University will work on questions in quantum algorithms and the use of existing, near-term and far-future quantum computers. The search for quantum algorithms, distinct quantum complexity classes, and other theoretical computer science topics are central to quantum information. Currently algorithms are known in the areas of number theory, computational algebra, quantum simulation from quantum chemistry to high energy physics, quantum optimization and machine learning. Questions of current interest span the range of future quantum computers from near term to far future. They include the search for algorithms that can provide a quantum advantage on near-term machines with 50-100 qubits but which lack error correction, the so-called Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. They also include the search for completely new quantum algorithms for large-scale quantum computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how these signals arise and change over time is therefore a fundamental goal of modern biology. In this IRES project, undergraduate students from around the U.S. will be trained to investigate this topic by combining cutting-edge techniques in fields of neuroscience, behavior, and computational biology. Specifically, participants will train with leading PIs that are part of an international research team that takes an integrative approach to studying how the nervous systems controls complex behavioral traits, as well as the way modifications to these physiological systems can support signal innovation. The program will recruit a total of 6 students per year, with a strong emphasis on selecting both FirstGen and underrepresented minority students. Participants will then work abroad in Austria and India for a 10-week period during the summer in the laboratory and field to conduct team-led research and independent research. This experience will be bookended with pre- and post-travel training to hone the students? technical and cultural training, while providing extensive career preparation from a diverse set of mentors. In this way, we will focus on building skills related not only to scientific acumen, but also international proficiency and awareness. Our program therefore promises to fulfill the goals of the IRES program by producing college graduates who are ready to join the global STEM workforce in the 21st century.  <br/><br/>International research collaborations are vital to biology, laying the groundwork for major discoveries that cross disciplinary lines and uncover principles about the diversity of life. However, undergraduate students from the U.S. often experience significant hurdles that prevent them from participating in such collaborative work. This is especially a problem for students from historically underrepresented groups, including both FirstGen students and underrepresented minority students. As a result, many undergraduates are ill-prepared to join the modern global STEM workforce. We therefore propose a program to address this issue by bringing 6 undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups and 1 graduate student each year to Austria and India, where they will participate in a 10-week experience studying the physiological basis of display evolution in frogs. They will conduct research in large teams and independently to investigate adaptations to motor control systems that underlying social signaling behavior. They will also use advanced phylogenetic comparative methods to track how these motor systems change over time to support the diversification and elaboration of signaling behavior in frogs. Participation in the project involves working closely with PIs in Austria and India, where our species of interests are found. It also involves combining elements of laboratory work and field work to address fundamental questions about how social signals work in physiological and functional contexts. Accordingly, students who participate in this IRES project will be given the chance to not only address fundamental questions in the field of biology, but also do so in an international context that helps prepare them for STEM careers in a global landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications has accelerated and broadened the use of computational resources from research in creating new and more environmentally friendly materials to improving medicine in our fight against deadly diseases. There are three main challenges to meeting this rapidly evolving landscape of national computational needs: a shortage of capacity, increasingly diverse applications, and computational literacy and training. This project aims to meet these challenges and transform the way computing is delivered by developing and deploying a composable advanced computing resource, Anvil, to the national research community to significantly increase both the computing capacity and accessibility. Anvil integrates a large-capacity high-performance computing (HPC) cluster with a comprehensive ecosystem of software, access interfaces, programming environments, and composable services to form a seamless environment able to support a broad range of current and future science and engineering applications. Through a carefully designed student training program and partnerships with regional and other universities, XSEDE, and Women in HPC programs, this project will develop computing competency in the next-generation workforce, and engage and train a broader audience including underrepresented students at minority-serving and EPSCoR (Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) institutions.<br/><br/>Built with a forward-looking architecture with a high core count, and improved memory bandwidth and I/O, Anvil can effectively support traditional HPC with fast turnaround for high throughput, mid-scale computation jobs. Anvil consists of 1000 128-core computing nodes based on the next-generation AMD Epyc ?Milan"" architecture that can deliver a total peak performance of 5.3 Petaflops. Each node has 256 GB of memory, and a 100 gigabits/second bandwidth from the Mellanox HDR InfiniBand interconnect, allowing multiple jobs of up to 1024 cores to be run at full speed over the interconnect fabric. These nodes are complemented by 32 large-memory nodes with 1 TB of RAM each, and 16 Nvidia GPU nodes with 4 ?Volta Next? GPUs per node. The GPU nodes are capable of 1.57 petaflops of single-precision performance to support machine learning and a wide range of current and future science and engineering applications. Anvil?s multiple tiers of storage systems include a long-term archive, persistent file and campaign storage, a 10 PB scratch file system, a 3 PB flash burst buffer, and object storage to support a variety of workflows and storage needs. <br/><br/>Anvil will lower the barrier to entry to advanced computing CI by providing interactive computing and desktop environments that ease the transition for users from diverse domains new to HPC. By providing feature-rich interactive environments such as Open OnDemand and ThinLinc, users can rapidly become productive on Anvil through Linux and Windows desktops, or familiar tools through their browser (e.g., Jupyter, RStudio). Complex scientific software environments and application stacks will be supported via containers orchestrated within a powerful composable subsystem. Anvil supports cloud-bursting of computational workloads as well as use of public cloud machine learning platforms including GPU and FPGA accelerators and software tools to automate hyperparameter tuning and algorithm selection for exploratory ML research. An existing production-quality science gateway at Purdue will support XSEDE researchers to share their data and tools online and facilitate easy access to Anvil and other XSEDE resources in classroom instruction and training activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, advances in computational and data-intensive research techniques are employed in a growing number of fields, both as primary methods of investigation and as complements to traditional modeling and simulation methods. Underpinning these advances is an accelerating shift in many research applications away from traditional processors to the vastly parallel floating-point processors available in modern computer graphics hardware. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will deploy and operate Delta, an advanced computing and data resource that will capture the essence of change in technology and practice that NCSA, as a global leader in advanced research computing, pursues in its mission to advance human understanding.<br/><br/>Delta will advance the productivity and usability of advanced computing resources by deploying modern interfaces, such as science gateways and other web-based interfaces that will both improve usability and provide results to researchers in real-time. Federation across the national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem will enable integration as a component of multi-site workflows that include campus, national, and commercial cloud resources. NCSA will partner with the Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI) to implement the science gateway infrastructure that will enable broad communities of researchers to take advantage of the advanced computing and data analytics capabilities of the system. Significant development will take place to evaluate and advance the accessibility of Delta by individuals with disabilities and to disseminate these advances throughout the broader research computing and data ecosystem. NCSA will take an active role in identifying applications and research teams that have the greatest potential for application acceleration through the adoption of GPU computing, thus greatly expanding the adoption of GPU-based computing as a growing norm and reducing time-to-solution for a broad range of research endeavors.<br/><br/>The Delta system will be a unique addition to the NSF-funded ecosystem of advanced computing resources due to its balanced mixture of a substantial GPU capability alongside more traditional CPU processing capabilities. Taking advantage of next-generation processor architectures and NVIDIA graphics processors, Delta will include what will be, at its launch, the most performant GPU computing resource in the National Science Foundation portfolio with its 800+ graphics processors.<br/><br/>The compute elements of Delta will employ an advanced network interconnect, delivering at least 100 gigabits per second of bandwidth to each compute node for application communications and access to an innovative storage environment. Data-intensive research will be accelerated by a nearly 10 petabyte high-performance storage subsystem, which incorporates three petabytes of flash-based, relaxed-POSIX file system which NCSA will use to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern file systems in advancing the performance of data-intensive and high-performance computing applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous research shows that supporting students' development and use of their metacognitive skills can enhance their success in STEM courses. For example, by using their metacognitive skills as they learn about new ideas, students can better identify concepts they do not understand. This knowledge allows them to select, implement, reflect upon, and adjust their learning strategies to build better understanding over time. While collaborating in small groups, students can also ask questions and make statements to stimulate metacognition in one another. STEM students who develop strong metacognitive skills are positioned to learn more effectively and persist in their majors. Thus, we need to better understand the changes that occur as life science students acquire metacognitive skills across their college careers, how small group work can be designed to enhance social metacognition, and the effects of students' metacognitive abilities on learning, reasoning, and problem-solving in the life sciences. This knowledge will inform how life sciences learning environments can be designed to support undergraduate students' development and use of metacognition in and out of the classroom.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>This project will advance knowledge by characterizing: (1) the development of metacognition in undergraduate life science students throughout their college careers (without intervention); (2) how students prompt metacognitive thinking in one another (social metacognition) and how this prompting influences their reasoning during small group problem solving; and (3) the relationships between individual and social metacognition. Metacognitive development will be characterized via development of longitudinal case studies of life sciences majors at University of Georgia (a doctoral university), University of North Georgia (a master's university), and South Georgia State College (an associate's/baccalaureate college). The investigations will focus on when and how students use their metacognitive skills, and how students' personal epistemologies and self-efficacy may affect metacognition. Yearly profiles of each student will be constructed based on analyses of semi-structured interviews, think-aloud protocols while problem-solving, as well as responses to published inventories. Social metacognition will be investigated through analysis of video recordings of small-group work in an upper-level Cell Biology classroom. Later cohorts of students will then be guided in the use of effective types of social metacognition while working in small groups. Ultimately, the project will apply the research findings to create and evaluate a Metacognition in Biology seminar course for first-year life science students taking the Introductory Biology course at the University of Georgia. This course will be integrated with university programs that support talented rural and first-generation college students.

Given the scale of these problems, solving such PDEs requires supercomputing resources. The latest supercomputing architectures are different from the previous generation of leadership class architectures and and are characterized by high levels of diversity within and across machines. Such diversity and heterogeneity makes it extremely difficult to effectively distribute work, i.e., partition the data or tasks, across disparate computing resources. Since the primary objective of building leadership class machines is to further scientific discovery and national prosperity, it is essential that applications, old and new, are able to scale and utilize these machines to their full potential. This project develops novel data and task partitioning algorithms that factor in the architectural characteristics of modern supercomputers to enable efficient and scalable utilization of current and future computing architectures.<br/><br/>Existing data and task partitioning schemes do not explicitly consider the underlying architectural topology while partitioning or is done indirectly during the design of the algorithm and codes. Ignoring topology leads to loss of scalability and performance, while shifting the burden to algorithm/code design increases the development costs and complexity, and decreases portability.  While data and task partitioning for parallelization, along with mapping the partitions to processes, have been studied for a long time, they have not been considered as a combined problem. To a large extent this was due to the simple structures and symmetry that existed in cluster computing architectures. Inefficiencies that did not significantly impact performance and scalability ten years ago are starting to inhibit scalability and thereby scientific discovery. This project is a first step in ensuring that scientific discovery is not hampered as a result of the difficulty in porting codes to new architectures. This project develops new graph and space-filling-curve-based partitioning algorithms that are aware of the architectural topology and are able to automatically generate data/task partitions and mappings to address problems with current schemes. The algorithms and software developed as part of this proposal will have wide-ranging impact, by improving the performance and scalability of legacy applications and reducing the development cost and improving the portability of new applications, to run efficiently on systems ranging from simple shared memory architectures to the largest heterogeneous clusters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these benefits are typically confined to large-scale computer systems, such as cloud computing and supercomputers. Embedded resource-constrained environments, such as autonomous systems and aerial drones, can make limited use of GPUs due to constraints on available energy, computing and communication resources, and timing requirements (real-time constraints). This project fundamentally rethinks the design of GPU-enabled computer systems in embedded resource-constrained environments with real-time behavior. This research consists of three main goals: (1) to develop energy-efficient and elastic microarchitectures for computational resources and storage structures, (2) to develop timing-aware GPU hardware schedulers that coordinate with an operating system real-time task scheduler, and (3) to dynamically balance timing requirements and energy-elastic microarchitectures by holistically coordinating across the entire software-hardware computing stack.<br/><br/>These next-generation real-time embedded GPUs provide more computational power to enable future embedded autonomous systems to become safer and more energy-efficient. This proliferation of computing power can also lead to myriad impacts on society such as improved portable medical devices that are smaller and with expanded capabilities, automobile collision detection systems with improved accuracy and safety, and lower electricity consumption for internet-of-things and even for larger-scale GPU-based computer systems. This project will offer research opportunities to undergraduate students, and broaden participation of underrepresented minorities, providing training to a new generation of computer engineers who will meet the design challenges of future embedded systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project is designed to increase the number of highly effective STEM teachers in high-need K-12 school districts in Colorado. At least 80% of school districts in Colorado serve rural communities and have trouble recruiting and retaining STEM teachers. To address this need, the project will recruit undergraduate STEM students, provide them with scholarships, professional development, mentoring, and other supports as they pursue their STEM degrees, become certified teachers, and begin their teaching careers.  The project includes a central goal of providing these Noyce Scholars, as well as in-service teachers, with professional development focused on Place-Based Education.  Lessons based on Place-based Education principles include a goal of promoting civic engagement, and are locally relevant, practical, and transdisciplinary.  The project intends that professional development in Place-based Education will help in-service and new STEM teachers design lessons that engage their students in meaningful inquiry activities, and also help the new teachers become more familiar with and rooted in their new school community. An additional feature of the project is its focus on recruitment of new STEM teachers by supporting potential candidates in discipline-specific educational coursework. The anticipated outcome of this project is to prepare 32 highly qualified STEM teachers for high-need Colorado school districts.  These new teachers will help to fill critical shortages of these teachers in rural areas of Colorado.  <br/><br/>This project at Colorado State University includes partnerships with Poudre, Thomas, and Morgan County School Districts in Colorado. The project will prepare and support 32 undergraduate STEM majors (in four cohorts) to become STEM teachers. The targeted majors include mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics. Project goals include: (1) recruiting new prospective STEM teachers by hiring undergraduates to be STEM Assistants in local K-12 schools; (2) building capacity for prospective and current STEM teachers to develop robust, standards-based curricula that integrates locally-relevant place-based issues; and (3) improving the quality and retention of novice STEM teachers in high-need K-12 schools. The project intends to develop a pipeline for recruiting new STEM teachers, as well as to create an interdisciplinary community of pre- and in-service teachers dedicated to locally relevant STEM teaching in high-need schools, especially those in rural school districts. The broader impact of this project will be demonstrated by developing and testing a model for universities to develop strong teacher education programs across STEM disciplines. The project evaluation plan is designed to provide insights into the effectiveness of project strategies to identify the effective ones for replication in other settings. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Archaeology requires first-hand field experience.  However, inaccessibility of excavation sites may make these experiences impossible for students who use wheelchairs.  The lack of access to field sites can impede students? access to comprehensive training in archaeology and in other field-based sciences such as geosciences.  This project will adapt currently available virtual reality hardware to accommodate the needs of wheelchair users, maximizing usability and comfort. Subsequently, the project will create an immersive, interactive archaeology class to accommodate the needs of wheelchair-using college students. In this class, students will learn the physical methods of archaeological excavation in virtual reality, thus gaining field work experiences.  The class will also help students learn to use a scientific approach to problem solving by couching activities within a professional archaeology scenario. At the same time, the project will evaluate the effectiveness of the scenario-based learning on student motivation and engagement. <br/><br/>This project will adopt the goals of universal learning to proactively create learning environments that address wheelchair-using college students' contextual needs (i.e., movement and logistics of classrooms and excavation sites) and functional needs (i.e., develop excavation skills through systematic learning processes) for teaching field-based sciences. The project will adopt iterative procedures of design-based research to incorporate and evaluate scenario-based learning. Testing and assessment of the virtual reality system will be guided by four development questions: 1) To what extent are the scenario features within the virtual reality activities clearly presented and how conducive are they to wheelchair users' interactivity with the system? 2) How do virtual reality activities increase wheelchair users' cognitive engagement with the designed activities? 3) To what extent do wheelchair users receive adequate system feedback within the virtual world to complete the assigned tasks? and 4) In what areas and to what extent do virtual reality activities need to be modified for students who are using wheelchairs? This project will further investigate the potential of scenario-based learning in engaging wheelchair users in colleges with an array of field and laboratory-based tasks guided by the following research questions: 1) What are the relationships between scenario features, their motivational support, and learners' engagement with the virtual reality activities? and 2) How does the adopted design framework align the virtual reality module's features with their motivational and cognitive support in learning archaeology? The proposed study will advance theoretical and empirical design theories when developing virtual learning environments for college students who are using wheelchairs and will generate an improved way to present educational material that is geared towards the current, digitally empowered generation that is diverse in cognitive and physical capabilities.

Specifically, it will address: (1) What is the local time extent of active reconnection?; (2) How is the extent related to local magnetopause current sheet conditions?; and (3) How is the extent related to upstream solar wind conditions? Conjunctions of in-situ and remote-sensing observations will be used. Specifically, NASA?s Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission and Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission will be used to identify reconnection events and NSF?s Super Dual Auroral Radar Network will be used to measure the extent of reconnection. Local magnetopause conditions will be obtained from space-ground conjunctions. The solar wind conditions will be provided by spacecraft including NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer, Global Geospace Science Wind satellite, and Geotail, and NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project will work with local community colleges to promote the entry and success of community college students in CalTeach, the University?s STEM teaching credential program. Within two years after transfer, the community college students will earn a Bachelor of Science degree and single subject teaching credential in mathematics or science. Supporting these students as Noyce Scholars will accelerate the pathway from community college to credentialed STEM teaching. The project will offer cross-enrollment opportunities in lower division CalTeach courses for community college students. It will also provide Noyce scholarships to transfer students in the CalTeach Program and support incoming transfer students through a week-long Summer STEM Research Institute for Future Teachers.<br/><br/>This project at the University of California-Irvine is a collaboration between the Schools of Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Education, working in partnership with four local community colleges: Cerritos, Santa Ana, Mt. San Antonio, and Santiago Canyon. The Santa Ana Unified School District and the Unity Middle College High School and other area districts also serve as partner districts. Despite its diverse population, Southern California has some of the most inequitable and segregated school districts in the nation. The project?s main goals are to enable transfer students to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree and teaching credential in four years and to prepare and deploy K-12 teachers who reflect and understand the communities in which they teach. This program will support at least 24 pre-service teachers over five years.  It has the potential to improve equity and access in Southern California?s school districts, to increase interest of students in STEM students, and place more highly effective teachers into in high-need schools. The project?s broader impacts include scholarships and an accelerated program to support undergraduate transfer students' pursuit of a teaching credential. In addition, it will place highly trained student teachers in high-need districts and increase the number of high-quality, credentialed teachers from underrepresented backgrounds.  Project evaluation by external evaluators will determine whether the project meets its goals and whether the program can serve as a model for other institutions. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

Among the best approaches to this goal is topological quantum computing (TQC). The hardware for TQC is provided by topological phases of matter -- the subject of the 2016 Physics Nobel prize.  TQC currently relies on quasi-particle excitations or anyons in topological quantum media to perform computing. The mobility of anyons introduces local noise, a major impediment to scaling quantum computing. Anyons are also difficult to realize and manipulate - they are realized in two-dimensional phases, while three-dimensional (3D) materials are more available and practical. With the mathematical theories underlying anyons mostly established and the relevant both promising and challenging experiments being carried out extensively, the project seeks to expanding the scope of TQC beyond just two-dimensional anyons. The goal is to not only provide new approaches to TQC beyond anyons, but also strengthen the connection between topological physics, higher category theory, and topology. <br/><br/>The key foci of the project are on quantum error correction, computational universality, and mathematical foundations of TQC beyond anyons. The project systemically investigates three related aspects: fracton phases, loop excitations in 3D topological phases, and symmetry defects. Firstly, the investigators will explore error correction properties and mathematical foundations of fracton phases, which form an exotic class of lattice models that cannot be described by conventional topological quantum field theories. Secondly, the project will develop methods to compute the exchange statistics of loop excitations in 3D topological phases of matter.  New techniques in representation theory and topology are utilized to compute motion group representations associated with 3D topological field theories. Thirdly, the project will study the interaction between topological phases and symmetry defects. The defects, like anyons, also provide stable ground state degeneracy and non-Abelian statistics, and hence can be used to perform quantum computing more powerfully than anyons alone. The investigators are especially interested in non-Abelian defects arising from Abelian anyons and seek to examine if they can be made universal for quantum computing under realistic physical conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the openness of the Internet is challenged by powerful countries around the world who today engage in nationwide censorship of Internet traffic.  For decades, security researchers have engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with censors, developing new schemes to evade censors, who in turn have developed increasingly sophisticated countermeasures.  Censors have long had an inherent advantage in this arms race: details of their systems are typically not made publicly known, and thus researchers have had to undergo manual, laborious steps of measuring, innovating, implementing, and testing for new evasion techniques.  This project proposes an ambitious research agenda towards developing artificial intelligence to automate the rapid discovery of new methods for evading and understanding nation-state censors.  The ultimate goal of the project is to safely reach the logical conclusion of the evade/detect arms race--and to prepare for the next one.  This project also includes an education plan that seeks to address the meteoric rise of enrollment in undergraduate computer science programs, by exploring ways to scale-up and broaden participation in undergraduate research.  The project proposes Breakerspace, a lab designed around group undergraduate research projects, and integrates these into the work on automating censorship evasion.<br/><br/>The proposed research follows three broad thrusts: (1) Developing new AI-based techniques for automatically evading in-network censors of various kinds, (2) Deploying AI-assisted censorship evasion strategies and developing new algorithms to efficiently scale-up discovery of new strategies via collaborative, crowd-sourced training, and (3) Performing AI-assisted measurement of censorship at unprecedented scale.  The proposed research plan takes a practical approach--training, evaluating, measuring, and deploying against real nation-state censors, and making evasion software freely available for censored users.  If successful, the AI this project builds and deploys, and the measurements it performs, will enable more agile evasion of new forms of censorship, and will lend deeper insight into how censors (fail to) work, how to circumvent them, and how they update over time.  As a result, this project has the potential to break the manual evade/detect cycle that researchers and censoring regimes have engaged in for decades, thereby assisting millions of users around the world in achieving open access to information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surface plasmons are collective electronic excitations in metal-dielectric composite structures which can interact strongly with excited states in molecules and solids to significantly change their optical characteristics.  In plasmonic systems, the optical interactions between surface plasmons and excitations in semiconductor nanostructures or dye molecules underpin numerous plasmonics applications in photovoltaics, optical sensing, and photochemistry, among others.  The project aims at modeling the optical properties of hybrid plasmonic systems that are defined by coherent interactions and/or energy transfer between system constituent parts.  This research will be carried out at Jackson State University and will substantially aid the development of human resources capacity in a historically black university that primarily serves educational needs of local minority students.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The project aims at modeling the optical processes and interactions in hybrid plasmonic systems such as metal-dielectric structures conjugated with semiconductor nanostructures or dye molecules.  The main topics include studies of (a) spontaneous emission beyond the plasmon field enhancement limits, (b) Forster energy transfer and the transition to the strong-coupling regime, (c) intermediate exciton-plasmon coupling and exciton-induced transparency, (d) Fano interference in hybrid plasmonic systems, and other pertinent issues.  The research will be mainly focused on coherent interactions between the system constituents and on related optical processes that determine the optical properties of hybrid systems.  The methods include a combination of analytical and numerical tools suitable for analyzing plasmonic systems with many constituent parts.  The results will be used for modeling of experimental findings and are expected to aid the development of plasmon-based device applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To effectively analyze and make sense of this ever-growing cache of information, and to make it possible to leverage new artificial intelligence tools for research, researchers need on-demand, interactive, and programmatic cyberinfrastructure (CI) delivered via the cloud. Jetstream 2 is a system that will be easy to expand and reconfigure, and capable of supporting diverse modes of on-demand access and use, The system will also revolutionize the national cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem by enabling ?AI for Everyone? with virtual GPU capabilities and widespread outreach through the five partners, led by Indiana University. The project promises to enable the research community to use a greater variety of computational resources and to expand its reach into student populations, drawn from a broad range of disciplines, thus contributing to building the future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Jetstream 2 will be an 8 PetaFLOPS (PFLOPS) cloud computing system using next-generation AMD ?Milan? CPUs and the latest NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs with 18.5 petabytes (PB) of storage. Consisting of five computational systems, Jetstream 2?s primary system will be located at Indiana University, with four modest regional systems deployed nationwide at Arizona State University (ASU), Cornell University, the University of Hawai?i (UH), and the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). Additional partnerships with the University of Arizona, Johns Hopkins University, and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) will contribute to Jetstream 2?s unparalleled usability and support for a broad range of scientific efforts.<br/><br/>The Jetstream team has been at the forefront of training the research community to transition from batch computing methods to adopt cloud-style usage. Jetstream 2 will continue this path and will ease the transition between academic and commercial cloud computing. Some of the advanced features include push-button virtual clusters, advanced high-availability science gateways services (including commercial cloud integration), federated authentication for JupyterHubs, bare metal and virtualization within the same system through programmable CI, support for on-demand data intensive workloads in addition to on-demand computation, high-performance software-defined storage, and advanced multi-platform orchestration capabilities.<br/><br/>Jetstream 2 will have far-reaching societal benefits. As enhanced educational infrastructure, it will serve more students, from traditional undergraduates to domain-science experts desiring training in computational techniques, than any other NSF-funded CI resource. These students will be better equipped to fully participate in the evolving STEM workforce. In addition to enabling new research, discovery, and innovation across many disciplines, Jetstream 2 will advance the national CI ecosystem and extend the broader impacts of existing NSF investments. Jetstream 2?s ?Core Services? will demonstrate a practical model of distributed cloud computing that will give academic institutions an incentive to invest their own funds in new advanced CI facilities. Although modest in scale, these facilities will represent the state of the art in reconfigurable computing. The implementation of Jetstream 2 will also demonstrate that colleges and universities can invest sustainable amounts of their own funds in highly-effective, flexible CI resources that generate a significant return on investment. In sum, Jetstream 2 will transform the national CI landscape and greatly benefit the nation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is designed to broaden participation in these career pathways and careers by iteratively developing and testing bilingual computer programming curricula in middle school mathematics classes attended primarily by multilingual Latinx students. Aligned with standards in computer programming and mathematics for middle schools, these Spanish and English curricula will guide educators and students through authentic programming tasks, such as those practiced by programmers in Artificial Intelligence fields. With the assistance of undergraduates who are majoring in computer science or a related field, middle school mathematics teachers will implement and revise the proposed curricular materials in partnership with the research team over the course of six semesters. Five middle school students in each class will also serve as co-facilitators of the curricula. Quantitative and qualitative research will determine whether and how the curricula support students? mathematics learning and attitudes toward mathematics, as well as whether and how the youth co-facilitators reported transformative or challenging experiences relative to their self-concepts in mathematics.  Because many students begin to opt out of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) classes and career pathways in middle school, this project will advance knowledge regarding educational approaches that prepare bilingual youth for continued pursuits along STEM career pathways. The bilingual curricula, which uses low cost and widely accessible programming platforms, will be posted on a project website, and empirical findings and practitioner materials will be disseminated widely. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>In the context of action research conducted with middle school mathematics teachers, this project will iteratively develop, test, and refine Spanish and English curricula, based in principles of translanguaging, which infuse computer programming and mathematics. The mathematics teachers and undergraduates with expertise in computer science will participate in professional development in which they have opportunities to learn, use, and revise the curricula. This project will use a mixed methods research design to study whether and how computer programming supports the teaching and learning of mathematical content; whether and how the use of the bilingual curricula support teachers? interactions with Latinx students; whether and how the curricula support Latinx and emergent bilingual students? mathematics learning; and whether changes occurred in middle school students? attitudes and learning, among other outcomes. The project will employ qualitative analyses of transcripts from interviews with middle school teachers, undergraduate facilitators, and middle school student facilitators; teaching documents such as lesson plans; video-recordings of classroom observations and professional development sessions; and student work. It will also employ quantitative analysis of pre- and post-measures of attitudes and learning in mathematics. In addition to sharing the curricula on a public website, the project will result in video tutorials that will support online and offline class delivery for middle school mathematics teachers with examples of teacher-adapted materials. Empirical research and implications for practitioners will be disseminated widely in peer-reviewed journals and professional conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Other nanoparticles appear as byproducts from industrial manufacturing that are released into water sources that move through environmental soils. Controlling the transport and distribution of nanoparticles inside the body and in the environment is critical to developing effective therapeutic treatments and strategies for mitigating impacts of pollutants. This project will support research into the transport of nanoparticles in complex environments, such as those encountered these biological and environmental settings, where nanoparticle motions are influenced by the presence of nearby confining surfaces and large macromolecules such as polymers. The research will focus on the flow-driven transport of nanoparticles through solutions of polymers confined in porous media. Experiments will be used to image particles as they move through the confined polymeric fluids.  Complementary computer simulations will help characterize mechanisms of nanoparticle transport and interactions between nanoparticles and nearby surfaces that are mediated by polymers in the surrounding fluid. Results of the research will lead to improved predictions of confined nanoparticle transport in complex fluids, which will benefit applications ranging from drug delivery to wastewater treatment. The research team will participate in activities that engage K-12 students and the general public in science and engineering, including hands-on activities at the Children?s Museum of Houston, the Houston Energy Festival, and the GRADE summer camp for women and students from underrepresented groups. The researchers will disseminate results of the project to local industrial scientists and engineers at the Texas Soft Matter Meeting. Scientific results will be available through publicly accessible open-source software projects and through online videos. <br/><br/>This project will employ particle-imaging experiments and computational models to investigate the flow-driven transport of nanoparticles through complex fluids confined in porous media. This overarching objective will be achieved by integrating particle synthesis and imaging and microfabrication techniques with advanced simulation methods to (1) elucidate the mechanisms by which polymers influence the transport of nanoparticles through well-controlled porous media and (2) understand how these mechanisms are affected by particle shape and size. Particle imaging and tracking techniques will be used to characterize the transport of nanoparticles through porous media, including quasi-two-dimensional arrays of nanoposts and three-dimensional packed beds. Complementary dissipative particle dynamics simulations will be used to characterize the structure and dynamics of polymers confined in the porous media and the polymer-mediated depletion interactions between the nanoparticles and nearby surfaces.  Diffusion and dispersion coefficients of nanoparticles through the model porous media will be measured in experiments and simulations as a function of polymer concentration and molecular weight and particle size and shape. By judiciously combining simulation and experiment, this project will elucidate the physical processes controlling the equilibrium and non-equilibrium (flow-driven) transport of nanoparticles through confined complex fluids. Results will lead to modifications of existing theories to account for polymer-mediated processes that affect nanoparticle transport and dispersion in strong confinement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This means that, locally, one can move in three independent directions: left/right, forward/backward, and up/down.  However, the global nature of our three-dimensional space is not known.  For example, it is not known whether our universe extends infinitely far in every direction or if it curls back on itself.  To complicate things, it becomes more natural to view the space we inhabit as a four-dimensional space by including time.  The goal of low-dimensional topology is to study and classify three-dimensional and four-dimensional spaces.  One important aspect of this program is to understand the topology (or ""shape"") of the four-dimensional sphere, which is a four-dimensional analog the spherical surface of a solid ball.  Amazingly, despite over one hundred years of study, very little is known about the topology of the four-dimensional sphere.  In contrast, the analogous objects in dimensions greater than or less than four are much better understood.  The goal of this research project is to apply novel techniques and approaches better understand four-dimensional sphere.  This  work will help to inform and advance the general study of four-dimensional spaces, such as the spacetime expanse that we inhabit. The award provides funds to support research training for undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Perhaps the most important open problem in low-dimensional topology, the Smooth Poincare Conjecture, ask whether any smooth four-manifold with the homotopy-type of the four-sphere is equivalent to the four-sphere. This problem has been open for more than 100 years, yet has seen almost no progress.  Rather than approach this problem directly, this research program aims to study the smooth topology from four distinct, but related, angles. One angle is to study four-manifolds with the homotopy-type of the four-sphere that admit simple handle-decompositions. Recently, the PI and Zupan gave new results in this setting, offering the first general progress towards the Poincare Conjecture in 30 years. The first aim of this research is to build on this work to obtain results that apply in even broader settings.  In another direction, the introduction of theory of trisections by Gay and Kirby in 2016, and the subsequent development and expansion, especially by the PI and Zupan, has ushered in a new era in four-manifold topology, with applications emerging to many interesting aspects of low-dimensional topology. This research project aims to advance and refine these theories, broaden their applicability, and bring to fruition many applications and connections. In particular, the PI will investigate what sort of trisections the four-sphere can admit. In the process, connections will be established with important open problems in low-dimensional topology, such as the Andrews-Curtis, Generalized Property R, and Slice-Ribbon Conjectures. The project will include an investigation of trisections of genus three, where the additivity of trisection genus will be explored in search for exotic copies of familiar four-manifolds.  Finally, the PI will employ the theory of bridge trisections to study knotted surfaces in the four-sphere. This theory was introduced by the PI and Zupan and offers a powerful new way to study knot theory in dimension four. In particular, the PI will work to give connections between the braid group and potentially exotic knotted spheres.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This, in turn, can reflect on the opportunities for rural students to learn the high quality, up-to-date science ideas, practices, and concepts that are required by state standards, especially those aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). To advance equitable opportunities for all students to learn science, the project team will design and provide an online course to support rural teachers who teach science in grades 6-12. The course will focus on improving classroom science assessment practices and instruction to meet the unique needs of rural educators and their students. Too often, science concepts are removed from the lives of rural students, although their homes, communities and natural environments are filled with ideas and experiences that can make science come alive. When teachers link assessment and instruction to students? everyday lives, students have enhanced interest in and identification with science. This, in turn, can lead more students to pursue science and applied science fields beyond high school, to broaden the STEM pipeline. In addition, students are better prepared to participate in science in their communities as empowered citizens. This study focuses on working with teachers to develop assessment practices that not only focus on the three NGSS dimensions of science ideas, practices and cross-cutting concepts, it also adds two more dimensions;  teachers will develop assessment tasks interesting to students, and promote the development of their science identities. The researchers refer to this as 5D assessment.<br/><br/>Researchers at Colorado University Boulder and BSCS Science Learning will use design-based implementation research to collaboratively design an online course sequence that targets 5D assessment in science. The study will proceed in three phases: a rapid ethnographic study to assess the needs of teachers serving a variety of rural communities, a study of teachers? use of an online platform for their professional learning, and lastly an experimental study to research the effects of the online course on teacher and student outcomes. Researchers will recruit 10 teachers to take the on-line course for the professional development and collect data on participating teachers? implementation of the course ideas through classroom videotaping and surveys designed to capture their changing practices. In the third year of the project, researchers will conduct an impact study with 70 secondary science teachers taking the re-designed on-line course, and compare their outcomes with a ?business-as-usual? condition. The impact of course will be measured by questionnaires that address their vision for teaching the NGSS and self-reported instructional practices; classroom observations; and, teacher-constructed student assessments. Student outcomes will be measured using science interest and identity surveys, and an examination of student work products that demonstrate students? ability to use the science and engineering practice of modeling, a practice likely to be encountered in all NGSS science classrooms. The project will identify conditions under which learning about 5D assessment task design can support instructional improvement, increase student interest in science and engineering, and enhance students? opportunities to learn. The researchers hypothesize that the online program will have a positive impact on teachers? vision, classroom practices, and their use of high-quality 5D tasks. They also hypothesize that teacher participation will result in significant increases in student interest in and identification with science, and that these effects will be mediated by teacher outcomes. Finally, the researchers hypothesize that effects will be equitable across demographic variables in rural communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Overcoming these multifaceted barriers is a matter of equity, and is critical for scientific progress,<br/>United States STEM workforce development, and national security. The researchers have developed a 19-week undergraduate research experience in Houston and the Galpagos islands, Ecuador. The Program is designed purposefully to help underrepresented minorities overcome the social barriers that limit their participation and success in STEM. However, the combined cost of Program<br/>tuition, travel, research station fees, and lost time from work means that participation is cost-prohibitive for<br/>many students.

In addition, the data generated by students are used to understand the natural<br/>functioning of the Galpagos, and can guide policy recommendations that ensure responsible<br/>development and conservation not just of these islands, but of any ecologically sensitive near-coastal<br/>areas that experience growing ecotourism pressures or that are on the margins of emerging urban<br/>environments.

Through the course, students<br/>also engage in numerous cohort building (e.g., camping, behind-the-scenes zoo tours) and professional<br/>training activities (e.g., how to read the scientific literature critically, how to present findings, RCR, use of<br/>field biology gear). They then conduct collaborative research for four weeks in the Galpagos with faculty<br/>based at the Galpagos Science Center on San Cristbal island. Undergraduate teams contribute to<br/>faculty-led projects focused on basic biology and ecological health of the Galpagos under different<br/>intensities and forms of stress from development. While in the islands, students are immersed in local<br/>culture through home-stays with local families, build their professional networks and STEM identities,<br/>develop STEM self-efficacy, etc. Upon return to UH, students engage in several structured academic and<br/>developmental activities such as training in the use of personal narrative to communicate their<br/>experiences and research, guidance in presenting findings at professional meetings, developing<br/>applications to graduate school, etc. These activities are aimed at facilitate transition to continuing<br/>undergraduate research, post-graduate study, or careers in STEM,<br/>The full cost of Program participation is considerable, and excludes students with financial need.<br/>The IRES Award aims to provide financial support to academically talented Program aspirants with unmet<br/>financial need; funds will cover the full cost of Program participation, including tuition, travel, housing,<br/>Galpagos park and research station fees, and income lost from student time away from outside work.<br/>Data generated by the students increases our understanding the Galpagos, and has clear<br/>applied value for ecologically sensitive near-coastal areas globally.

Based on recommendations from eyewitness scientists, a large number of jurisdictions across the country have reformed their identification procedures to address this problem. Nevertheless, even the best lineup procedures fail to weed out all mistaken identifications. Hence, police and prosecutors still must attempt to sort between reliable identifications and unreliable identifications even when the best lineup procedures are followed. It is important to determine what variables can help police and prosecutors with this task. Postdiction variables are a particularly promising class of variables. Postdiction variables are variables that are influenced by the presence or absence of the guilty suspect in the lineup. These include eyewitness behaviors such as expressed level of confidence, the amount of time it takes the witness to make an identification decision, visible evidence of effort, verbal utterances, among others. The purpose of the present work is to examine how well postdiction variables extracted from video recordings of real-world witnesses making identification decisions can sort between reliable and unreliable identification decisions. To the extent that postdiction variables prove useful for sorting between reliable identifications and unreliable identifications, these findings would also encourage jurisdictions that are not yet video recording identification procedures to begin doing so. Indeed, only by video recording the entirety of the identification procedure can these jurisdictions ensure a complete and accurate record of these variables that can be used to sort between reliable and unreliable identifications.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to determine what combination of postdictors best sort between reliable eyewitness identifications and unreliable eyewitness identifications in real-world lineups. The findings will then be leveraged to develop an algorithm that police and prosecutors can use to assess the reliability of eyewitness identifications in future investigations. The District Attorney?s Office of Santa Clara County, CA and the San Jose Police Department will provide video-recordings of witnesses completing actual police lineups. Santa Clara County is unique as an early adopter of best-practice eyewitness identification procedures (a requirement for valid assessment of postdiction variables) and more recently implementing a policy of video-recording all lineups. As these videos become available, blind scorers (blind as to whether the identified person is the suspect or a filler) will assess a host of known postdiction variables. These postdiction scores will then be regressed on the outcome variable of whether the witness identified the suspect or a known-innocent filler. A critical mass of suspect identifications are likely to be culprit identifications whereas all identifications of fillers are definitive instances of mistaken identifications. Accordingly, postdiction variables that are useful for separating accurate from mistaken identifications should distinguish between suspect identifications and filler identifications. In addition to examining the predictive validity of known postdiction variables (e.g., confidence, decision time, verbal utterances), we will use an extensive coding scheme to code for numerous other eyewitness behaviors and we will examine whether these additional eyewitness behaviors can improve classification performance over and above the performance achieved with know postdiction variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent reports, such as the ?Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America? distributed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, have generated a renewed hope for the millions of people around the world affected by this disease. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to understand the most effective use of available resources in light of the new prophylaxis treatment and the continued improvements of the highly active anti-retroviral treatment, particularly in the case of non-compliance. A realistic mathematical model, including these two treatments, as well as disproportional effects on disparate subpopulations, is essential for effective resource utilization. The broader impacts of this proposal are far-reaching from a public health perspective, but will also serve as a platform to train primarily underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of mathematics and medicine. This collaboration between researchers at Howard University, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the National Institutes of Health will train students to work in a collaborative team environment focused on addressing a pressing scientific problem.<br/><br/>Realistic mathematical models can suggest best courses of intervention that can significantly reduce the number of HIV infections. The effect of the pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PrEP) will be included in a previously developed mathematical model of HIV. Previous models of imperfect vaccines have shown the potential for a backwards bifurcation that can dramatically affect the dynamics of the epidemic. As a result, the same intervention that brings a model without a vaccine to the disease-free equilibrium, could drive the dynamics of the model with PrEP to a stable endemic equilibrium. Transmission of HIV depends on the viral-load of the infected individual. Thus, realistic mathematical models must include the effect of non-steady highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) through structured treatment interruptions, lack of adherence to drug regimen and drug resistance. Non-steady HAART treatment regimes and the subsequent two-way movement between virally suppressed and chronically infected will require using non-exponential treatment stages into the model, which will be fitted to publicly available Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) data from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since public health data will be used in the mathematical model, parameter identifiability will be addressed structurally and practically. Several numerical tools for accessing structural identifiability of the model will be used. The profile likelihood method will be used to assess the practical identifiability of model parameters and to provide confidence intervals for parameter estimation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As part of this effort, large-scale systems (onshore and offshore wind turbines) have been thoroughly investigated. On the opposite side of the ?spectrum?, micro-scale wind energy has been examined for the purposes of deployment of small sensors that are self-sufficient and self-recharging. Both technologies have reached an advanced maturity. In contrast, the meso-scale range, i.e., the intermediate scale of a single-family household or a street block, is largely unexplored and has good potential for growth and innovation. This project addresses the need for clean energy at the meso-scale level, using a simple and compact wind-based energy harvester. The power generator exploits the torsional aeroelastic instability (i.e., torsional flutter) of a blade-airfoil apparatus. The technology will be viable since its operational mechanism is simpler than other, similar harvesting technologies in the recent past. The research plan will include fabrication and testing of a reduced-scale prototype unit. The project results will demonstrate how the apparatus can be implemented in urban settings and provide a valuable energy source for electric and mechanical systems.<br/><br/>The project will examine the technical feasibility of the wind energy harvester that exploits torsional flutter.  Torsional flutter is a single mode aeroelastic instability phenomenon, which triggers a diverging vibration of a flexible body. The project will make use of preliminary results, in which a numerical model was employed to predict mechanical vibrations and induced currents. The investigation will include analytical, numerical and experimental stages. The objectives of this research are: 1) advancement of the current theory and analytical modeling of flutter energy ?scavenging?; 2) assembly of a prototype unit used in the verification and validation studies in the laboratory; and 3) deployment and monitoring of the unit at full scale. The first objective will consider the modeling of post-critical dynamics, nonlinear aeroelastic force and response, and the calibration of the key parameters of the wind energy harvester. The second objective will be accomplished through the design of a reduced-scale unit, followed by validation and verification through wind tunnel tests, which will include operational efficiency. Finally, an exploratory study will be carried out through the deployment at full scale on a building roof. The educational plan includes a set of outreach activities and demonstrations for various audiences (e.g., students, engineers).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do this, students should learn how scientists work and communicate. It also calls for changes in how teachers teach science, which in turn creates a need for high-quality professional development so they can be more effective in the classroom. Professional scientists can also benefit from training preparing them to support teachers, motivate students, and model for students how scientists think and work. Preparing teachers and scientists through collaborative professional development can help maximize the impact they can have on student outcomes. To have the broadest impact, such professional development should be cost-effective and available to teachers in rural or underserved areas. This project focuses on high school life science (biology) teachers and their students. It will make use of an online mentoring platform, a student-teacher-scientist partnership program established in 2005. That study found that implementing in combination with high-quality, in-person collaborative teacher/scientist professional development resulted in positive and statistically significant effects on student achievement and attitudes versus business-as-usual methods of teaching the same science content. This project has two main components: 1) a replication study to determine if findings of the previous successful study hold true; and 2) adding an online format for delivering collaborative professional development to teachers and scientists enabling one to compare the effectiveness of online professional development and in-person professional development delivery formats for improving student outcomes.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study how the integration of an online curriculum, scientist mentoring of students, and professional development for both teachers and scientist mentors can improve student outcomes.

Teachers will use their training to teach the curriculum to their students with students receiving mentoring from the scientists through an online platform. Evaluation will examine whether this curriculum, professional development, and mentoring by scientists will improve student achievement on science content and attitudes toward scientists.

However, the superior performance of deep learning comes at the cost of extremely high computational complexity associated with large datasets. Therefore, deep learning algorithms are traditionally implemented in software and executed on powerful general-purpose cloud computing platforms. In contrast to the prevailing research in general-purpose counterparts, the application-specific deep learning IC has much lower power consumption, thereby ideal for integration with power-constrained IoT devices.

These features are called oceanic transform faults and they have a similarity to hazardous faults on land, such as the San Andreas fault in California.  But because the seafloor has a far simpler geology than land the ocean settings are ideal natural laboratories to study some of the important processes occurring throughout the earthquake cycle. Furthermore, scientists have observed that, at transforms, large earthquake activity occurs in fairly regular cycles with repeat times of 5-6 years, allowing experiments to be planned that capture the faults as they experience an earthquake sequence. The understanding that comes from such studies can further the advancement of earthquake prediction. The repeating cycles of earthquakes at one such oceanic transform fault, the Gofar in the east Pacific, was first observed through deployments of seismometers - instruments which measure the motion of the seafloor - around the fault. One factor thought to be important for earthquake generation is the amount of seawater that is present in the top several kilometers of seafloor. Yet, there is little data on fluid distributions within active faults. This experiment will provide such data in the well-studied Gofar region by measuring the ability of the seafloor to conduct electrical current, a property that is directly linked to the amount of seawater in the seafloor. Instruments will be deployed on the seafloor that measure electric and magnetic fields. Signals from a transmitter of electromagnetic energy towed behind the research vessel will be recorded by the seafloor instruments. By surveying different parts of the fault system that behave differently when earthquakes occur, it will be possible to understand better the different properties of the fault and how these relate to seismicity. Early career participants will be invited on the expedition. The project supports the training of graduate students and a postdoctoral investigator.<br/><br/><br/>Oceanic transform faults (RTFS) offer a natural laboratory for understanding key processes occurring throughout the earthquake cycle, and an outstanding opportunity to further the advancement of earthquake prediction. The role of fluids in fault processes has been hypothesized, but there is surprisingly little data available on fluid distributions within active fault networks. This experiment would provide such data in a well constrained framework of seismicity studies. A primary reason for studying RTF settings is the relatively predictable cycle of seismicity observed, with quasi-periodicities on the order of 5-6 years. To that end, deployments of ocean bottom seismograph (OBS) instrumentation captured foreshock activity building up to a large M6.0 event across the Gofar RTF in the east Pacific. Another deployment of OBS instruments is planned for the Gofar, starting in late 2019 through 2021, with the aim of capturing the end of two current seismic cycles and the goal of understanding why these faults are so predictable. This experiment will focus on areas with different levels and types of seismicity. Within the Gofar transform is a region that repeatedly inhibits rupture propagation and that primarily fails aseismically. Seismic velocities are significantly different in the seismic rupture region and in the rupture barrier.  Pull-apart conditions might allow deep seawater penetration into the fault resulting in persistently high porosity and fluid pore pressures at depth. The net result of these fluids is to promote dilatancy-strengthening of the fault which has been observed to inhibit dynamic deformation. A series of CSEM profiles at different parts of the Gofar system will directly measure seafloor electrical resistivity, a property most closely related to porosity of the crust. The experiment will therefore map porosity variations throughout the system, particularly in the damage zone of primary seismicity and within the area that has been seen to repeatedly inhibit rupture propagation, allowing us to directly test the role of fluids in the seismic cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When a polymer in a volatile solvent is evaporated, it results in cooling of the solution.  Water from the atmosphere then condenses on the cold surface of the polymer solution.  The self-assembly and subsequent crystallization of water droplets produce an ordered array of two- and three-dimensionally (2D and 3D) packed holes in the polymer film.  Water droplets condensing on a cold solid surface is seen in a variety of situations in everyday life.  Common examples of this phenomenon include dew formation on leaves early in the morning, fogging of eyeglasses when one enters a cold room, water condensing on the lids of coffee cups from Starbucks, and breathing on glass as one polishes it.  This research examines the phenomenon of ""breath figures"" - the condensation on a polymer surface - and paves a new way to construct macroscopic 3-dimensional porous structures from a variety of polymers in a very short time.  The fundamental knowledge gained from this study may impact ultrasmall volume reactors, diffraction gratings, and to cell growth scaffolds.  In addition, this project provides training of undergraduate and graduate students with emphasis on its integration with this research.  The project also develops outreach programs connected to Lawrence Hall of Science to communicate the value of this research to the public.<br/><br/>With this support from Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials, Professor Srinivasarao?s research team elucidates the mechanism behind the phenomenon of moisture condensing on a cold surface called breath figures.  Although it is known that macroporous polymers could be used as a template to make ceramic and metallic structures with 2-dimensional pores, the mechanism by which the structures form is far from understood.  This research studies the physics and physical chemistry of the phenomena involved in the self-assembly of breath figures.  The team investigates key processes such as nucleation and growth, ordering dynamics, noncoalescence, surface tension driven instabilities, packing of spheres, and heat/mass transport, and wetting.  These measurements are carried out by using high-speed video microscopy.  Understanding the formation kinetics/mechanism of breath figures and the optical/physical properties of the resulting 3-dimensional structures may lead to a simple and effective way to rapidly create ordered, macroporous structures from a variety of polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wong of the University of California-Riverside is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to utilize new computational hardware, known as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  The goal of this research project is to enhance the speed and energy efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations.  Modern quantum chemistry calculations depend critically on massively parallelized computational hardware to enable their predictions. Massively parallel is the term for using a large number of separate computers (or computer processors) to perform a set of coordinated computations simultaneously. Quantitatively accurate predictions from such calculations impact several chemical technologies including combustion, catalysis, process modeling, and chemical production industries. However, the supercomputing centers used to run these predictive calculations consume enormous amounts of energy and resources.  Also many such calculations do not scale well as the studied chemical systems grow larger. To address these important issues, FPGAs are being harnessed to enhance the computational speed, as well as to maintain the delicate balance between performance and energy efficiency for large-scale quantum calculations. In addition to addressing these scientific and technological needs, this project is  carried out at the University of California-Riverside, which is an accredited Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).  As such, Professor Wong's institution is an ideal place to attract researchers who might otherwise not be aware of the employment opportunities in science and engineering.     <br/>  <br/>An FPGA consists of an array of thousands of connection and logic blocks seamlessly connected with each other to create extremely re-configurable programming units. Like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), FPGAs are ideal for parallelization, but with the added advantage of having reprogrammable circuitry at the hardware level to enable even further parallelization and significant energy gains. This EAGER project is sub-divided into two main (but highly connected) thrusts. Thrust 1 will extend the use of FPGAs to accelerate Fock-matrix builds and Hamiltonian diagonalization for ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and linear-response time-dependent density functional theory calculations, respectively. Thrust 2 will subsequently assess and demonstrate the immense energy efficiency (compared to CPUs/GPUs) of FPGAs for these quantum calculations. The field of quantum chemistry has yet to utilize FPGAs for production-level calculations of any kind, creating an exciting opportunity for transformative leadership in this area. Together these thrusts address basic (yet practical) parallelization issues in quantum chemistry with non-conventional computing approaches, and introduce a new computational capability to perform these quantum chemistry calculations in an energy-efficient manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Palermo at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are using visible light to precisely direct the synthesis of large nanostructures.  The synthesis method utilizes a combination of several different light-based techniques and is reminiscent of classical photography, with the exception that it does not require a projected image using a photomask. The approach can create extremely small patterns, down to a few tens of nanometers in size. Precise control of the shape and size of the objects it creates is also provided. Additionally, patterns can be printed over an entire surface cost-effectively. Research associated with this award has the potential to enable super-resolution printing in 3D without the need to utilize expensive state-of-the art equipment. The new techniques could advance the design of biomedical devices and other advanced manufacturing applictions. The research team is continuing their commitment to education and community outreach, with a particular emphasis on promoting women and under-represented minorities in science through innovative family-based learning activities and design projects. The educational broader impacts include the creation of hands-on learning activities, the development of educational videos, and the mentorship of K-12 students, all of which inspire and promote participation of under-represented students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The central goal of this research is to create 3D bicontinuous nanostructured materials using a combination of functional macromolecular chemistries and advanced optics, especially super-resolution optics and interference lithography. In the first objective, a deeper fundamental understanding of the underlying chemical kinetics needed to enable super-resolution 3D interference lithography is developed. A library of spirothiopyran derivatives with systematically varied structural features is synthesized in order to precisely tune the kinetics of photo-switching and click reactions leading to a cross-linked polymer gel or thermoset. The second objective focuses on the development of a self-consistent computational model that captures the coupled interaction of the three dimensionally varying light and chemical concentration fields as a function of time.  Self-consistent solution of differential equations results in an electromagnetic simulation at each time step of the chemical concentration evolution; This is a departure from conventional finite-element (FEA) or finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) techniques (prohibitively long computation times). The last objective concentrates on bicontinuous super-resolution nanostructures in which the configuration of 3D super-resolution interference lithography consists of a uniform excitation exposure and a depletion pattern that is obtained by the interference of multiple beams of coherent light. Control over the formation of nanostructured materials using unmasked light, with precision over large areas, has a potential to advance the development of photonic crystals, microtrusses and biomedical devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is especially true for global issues related to water, given that the scarcity of reliable and clean water supplies to support growing human populations is one of the world?s most pressing environmental and social issues today. This IRES supports an international program for U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, the ?Andean-Amazonian Watershed Experience: Exploring Sustainability of Mountain Ecosystems in Ecuador? (AWESOME). The program takes place in the Andean-Amazonian region of Ecuador, which is currently experiencing a range of water-related issues along with a diversity of policy responses aimed at finding solutions, and thus provides an ideal landscape for engaging students in international research experiences. AWESOME will support 18 U.S. students over three years to conduct individual research projects over two months at two sites in the upper Andean-Amazonian region: alpine paramo in the Paute watershed, and rainforest in the Napo watershed. Students will be supported by faculty mentors from three collaborating Ecuadorian institutions, the<br/>University of Cuenca, the Regional University of Amazonia, and the University of Azuay, and UNH faculty mentors from diverse disciplines. Two cohort experiences, an orientation watershed tour and a synthesis workshop (10 days each), will introduce students to water resource science and policy across diverse natural ecosystems and human communities, foster their capacity for systems-thinking and interdisciplinary analysis, and help them to conceptualize their own research as part of a complex and interconnected world.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Technical description. <br/>Addressing global water-related challenge requires that future leaders have a strong understanding of the science of watershed sustainability and complex socioecohydrological systems (SEHS), and the ability to apply that understanding to developing effective policy solutions using transdisciplinary approaches. The goals of AWESOME are to, (1) provide an international research experience that enhances student understanding of the complex dynamics of coupled SEHS in response to diverse global change drivers, and (2) investigate science-based policies for improving watershed sustainability. Student research projects will focus on six themes: 1) hydrologic regulation?from leaves to watersheds; 2) biogeochemical cycles?water quality and carbon storage; 3) biodiversity?biotic interactions and watershed functions; 4) social dynamics andcommunity resilience; 5) economic-ecological tradeoffs of water funds, and 6) water policy. Themes are unified under a conceptual framework of watershed sustainability that incorporates the complex interactions and feedbacks between the human and biophysical systems within SEHS. This conceptual model is grounded in the theories of coupled natural-human systems dynamics, watershed sustainability, community resilience, and inter/transdisciplinary research, providing a strong intellectual framework for guiding the AWESOME experience. Students will participate in interdisciplinary and intercultural research teams and engage in transdisciplinary discussions with diverse watershed actors, which will support their development and refinement of mental models of watershed sustainability. By leveraging ongoing research collaborations between Ecuadorian and U.S. faculty and partner academic institutions, our research team will offer a unique and transformative international research experience that will have an impact on students? personal and professional trajectories. AWESOME will result in an innovative model for international research and experiential learning around SEHS and watershed sustainability, with broad impacts on educational programs between the U.S., Ecuador, and beyond. Through established partnerships and interactions with local watershed actors, research results and their implications for water resource policy will be shared and discussed at a synthesis workshop and in student reports. A seminar will be organized through the NH International Seminar Series to highlight the AWESOME experience, with U.S. and Ecuadorian students and researchers giving presentations and facilitating discussions, which will be widely disseminated via a webinar. Pedagogical approaches will be developed for using international research opportunities to enhance student learning regarding issues of watershed sustainability while cultivating academic, professional, and personal growth. Finally, this IRES will create international research collaborations and exchange programs that will be sustained beyond the tenure of the AWESOME program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to develop a highly sensitive approach for studying the human serum transferrin protein (hSTf), which is a vital iron carrier in blood and of clinical importance.  The sensing technique would allow differentiation of the free hSTf protein from the iron-bound protein and evaluation of iron deficiency or iron overload from very small blood samples.  Successful development of this sensor would also enable profiling of a wide range of other proteins and biological molecules, e.g., DNA.  This project offers excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary research training as it combines biochemistry, nanoengineering, photonics, and electrical engineering.  The outreach efforts to K-12 schools through various programs at the Southern Methodist University and  the University of Texas at Arlington help to inspire more students to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degrees.<br/><br/>The stacked plasmonic nanosensor is based on the self-induced back-action (SIBA) actuated nanopore electrophoresis (SANE) sensing concept.  The stacked nanopores are uniquely designed to enable 1) controlled trapping, releasing, and recapturing of proteins or the substrate-bound protein complexes, 2) transient deformation of the biological molecules, which can be induced by thermal effect or a combination of optical and electrical techniques, and 3) study of their deformation dynamics.  The SANE concept implemented in the stacked nanopore sensor allows investigation of protein interactions at concentrations 1000-fold below the equilibrium dissociation constant in bulk solution, making this technique ultra-sensitive.  An important aim of this research is the study of the properties of free-hSTf protein and the iron-bound protein complex using the SANE sensor.  Optical signature profiles are established for each of the species to enable selective admission of bound complexes over unbound proteins in a mixed solution to the underlying pore. It uses symmetric (VCapture = VRecapture), followed by asymmetric (VCapture ? VRecapture) voltage conditions to facilitate the investigation of the strength and kinetic parameters associated with protein-substrate binding, protein relaxation times, and whether voltage-induced protein unfolding is reversible or not.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These NCs exhibit mid-infrared intrabands and localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs).  However, little is understood about their dependence on the NC size, shape, surface chemistry, and doping density/dopant activation.  This is due to the inhomogeneities present in doped NC ensembles, which is unavoidable in current colloidal NC syntheses.  Limited means exist for conducting highly sensitive, mid-infrared optical measurements of single NCs.  With this support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Kuno?s research team addresses this important need in the field.  The research team employs a newly developed, super-resolution infrared absorption technique, called infrared photothermal heterodyne imaging (IR-PHI), to measure the local absorption of self-doped NCs.

This vision will be accomplished by creating and integrating transdisciplinary scientific techniques in the fields of data analytics, computational modeling, and model-based inference. The objective is to develop scientific foundations for a live digital platform that evolves with new data and dynamically updates the long-term (seasons/months ahead) to short-term (weeks/days ahead) pre-ignition fire risks at regional and community scales, and predicts the post-ignition fire behavior in near-real-time at the fire front. Once developed, the computational platform will increase the efficiency of wildfire management process by providing actionable information to decision-makers for pre-ignition risk mitigation and post-ignition emergency response management. Involvement of key stakeholders and utility companies, preparation of future workforce, and K-12 outreach programs are integral parts of the project.<br/><br/>The research promises to provide a rigorous computational approach to quantifying and predicting wildfire risk. Scientific advancements that are anticipated include: (i) an overarching computational platform for probabilistic wildfire loss assessment at different spatial and temporal scales that evolves with data as they become available; (ii) an integrated simulation framework including a wildfire model, urban-fire model, and socioeconomic model to predict the wildfire loss in terms of economic and social losses; (iii) a novel data-driven modeling approach for urban-fire simulation, and a new empirical model for change in quality-of-life (QoL) due to wildfire; (iv) new data collection modules and advanced data processing techniques to collect refined data, process and infuse different sources of data, and quantify uncertainty in the measurement data; and, (v) a Bayesian model inference framework to quantify modeling uncertainties and update the fire spread in ear-real-time by integrating new measurement data modules with the wildfire model. In perspective, the project aims to lay the scientific foundations of a holistic new computational platform to predict and monitor wildfire risk.

Developing sustainable and efficient energy sources is one of the greatest challenges facing mankind. One attractive solution is solar-based fuel cells that utilize the sun's energy to produce hydrogen from water.  This hydrogen can then be used as a fuel, producing only water when it is burned (combined with oxygen). However, high cost, and low efficiency and durability are the main factors that hinder the large-scale use of this solar cells. One way to meet these challenges is to utilize quantum dots. Attaching a molecule to the quantum dot surface alters its ability to capture light. This modification can significantly enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion to chemical energy. This research may result in more efficient solar cell components. Computational predictions guide the rational design of novel, cost-effective materials for energy applications. This project also provides educational and research experiences for high school, undergraduate and graduate students in computational chemistry and materials chemistry modeling.

Since research experiences may be limited at many two-year college campuses, students at these institutions would benefit from expanded opportunities to engage in authentic research experiences. Educating enough skilled technical workers who are prepared for advanced technology industries has become a national priority in the United States, and it is essential for the country to retain its global leadership in science and technology. Community and technical colleges play a vital role in meeting this demand, especially for preparing students who are well qualified to enter the technical workforce or transfer to a four-year university to earn STEM baccalaureate degrees. An efficient and rapid way to produce the STEM professionals that the nation needs would be to increase community college student persistence in STEM fields. This project proposes to achieve that goal by providing more undergraduate research experiences to community college students.  The research experiences are expected to help students gain deeper STEM knowledge and skills, to increase their academic success, and to enable them to develop the highly valued professional skills needed to enter the STEM technical workforce.<br/><br/>The project will build on three distinct goals: (1) providing authentic undergraduate research experiences to a large number of STEM students to help strengthen their interest in STEM careers and gain professional skills that are critically important in the technical workplace;  (2) modifying an assessment tool, EvaluateUR, for use in shorter (8-week) summer research experiences; and (3) implementing EvaluateUR to assess the intellectual growth and development in the students? disciplinary and professional skills acquired through participating in the undergraduate research experiences. The project is aligned with the goals of the Advanced Technological Education program and leverages the vast research facilities and resources at the University of California, Irvine, together with the technical resources and support for modifying and implementing EvaluateUR available through SUNY-Buffalo State and the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College. Four cohorts of 20 STEM students will be recruited and engaged in an undergraduate research experience. Student and faculty mentors will be assessed using the modified EvaluateUR tool. This tool has been shown to measure a broad range of desirable outcomes that include both content knowledge and the outcomes that are critically important in the workplace, including communication skills, ability to solve obstacles, problem solving skills and critical thinking.  The project will work to ensure educational equity through activities that support the recruitment of women, veterans, first-time college students, racial and ethnic minorities; these groups represent an important, talented STEM pool for growing the nation's technological workforce. The project outcomes will be published through a dedicated website, presentations at local and regional conferences, including the ATE Principal Investigators Conference, the American Association of Community Colleges annual convention, and the Council on Undergraduate Research Conference. The lessons learned while implementing this project will likely be of interest to all community colleges and other academic institutions with an interest in engaging students in similar research experiences. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics perspective, the resulting datasets can be thought of as matrices, with the rows representing individuals and the columns representing loci in the genome that correspond to common or rare polymorphisms. Analyzing such datasets, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have reported over 10,000 strong associations between genetic variants and complex traits. However, tools that allow efficient analysis of very large scale datasets are still missing. Extracting useful information from such datasets promotes the progress of science and, at the same time, advances public health, prosperity, and welfare. This project will bridge the gap between state-of-the-art algorithms  developed in the theoretical computer science community and the application of such algorithms to the analysis of the increasingly larger volume of datasets in the human genetics community.<br/><br/>This project will explore how randomized linear algebra, from a theoretical and practical standpoint, can be used to speed human genetics data analytics. The first research direction will investigate Linear Mixed Models or LMMs: LMMs form a linear model of the genetic effects on the phenotype of interest. Randomized linear algebra tools will be used to speed up the solution of the resulting optimization problem, without sacrificing accuracy. The second research direction will investigate Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), which typically operate by first selecting a large number of genetic markers (often in the tens of thousands) out of all available markers (often in the many millions) using single marker significance tests. This feature selection stage is followed by building regression models on the selected markers to predict phenotypes. Randomized linear algebra tools will be used to speed up PRS approaches, while preserving generalization accuracy. Finally, the third research direction, will explore how the particular structure of population genetics datasets can be leveraged in order to design improved randomized linear algebra tools for the analysis of human genetics datasets. The investigators will disseminate their results to a broad community of applied mathematicians, theoretical computer scientists, and population geneticists. They both participate in population genetics conferences and workshops and publish in high-profile journals in population genetics, as well as in conferences and workshops in Computer Science.

Majority of the deaths is due to disease spreading to other parts of the body (metastasis) and impairment of vital body functions. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer remains a challenge despite the widespread use of mammography, due to limited sensitivity and specificity. The study proposes to develop an integrated system with two novel screening technologies to identify cancer cells among a cell population at very early stages of the disease. The first technology uses two identical laser beams to trap and stretch cells without any mechanical contact to characterize their elasticity which changes in presence of cancer. The second technology is to identify cancer-related biomarkers by using the principles of light scattering from the cell or tissue samples, called Raman effect. The proposed technology aims to predict the onset of cancer early enough to allow effective preventive treatment and reliably differentiate between deadly vs. non-deadly, or localized vs. metastatic breast cancers. In terms of educational impact, the study offers experiment-centric teaching methodologies for high school teachers which may help in attracting high caliber students to STEM disciplines. Innovative senior undergraduate design projects will be developed aiming at student retention and recruitment to graduate programs. The project will provide minority students an invaluable experience and exposure to modern research practices and will prepare them for successful STEM careers.<br/><br/>The proposed study envisions a novel strategy to integrate two optical screening technologies on a microfluidic platform to identify cancer cells among a cell population at very early stages of the breast cancer disease. The investigators hypothesize that by performing two independent but complementary cell characterizations, it is possible to identify the presence of breast cancer in cells even before the structural disease manifestation begins to show up. The following two screening methods are proposed: a) biomechanical characterization of cytoskeletal elasticity as an indicator for malignancy using optical tweezer (OT) cell-stretcher, and b) biophotonic characterization of cell biomarkers using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectrometry (SERS). The project has two specific aims: 1) OT/SERS profiling device development to produce a portable microfluidic platform capable of performing bioelectric characterization of cells based on SERS imaging and mechanosensitive characterization using a laser tweezer microstretch assembly, and 2) Identification of non-invasive, pre-invasive, and invasive breast cells from triple-negative, hormone receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive models to test the ability of the OT/SERS profiling device to distinguish early cellular changes that occur in cancer progression. Instead of individually screening for numerous morphological and biochemical markers of breast cancer, the investigators propose an innovative approach to screen their combined phenotype by quantifying cell's cytoskeletal elasticity and biophotonic signatures. The technology can be adapted for early cancer detection in clinical setting using blood, saliva, and other bodily secretions samples containing live cells. The study has potential to significantly impact the field of cancer diagnostics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, it will develop a framework for building intelligent tutors that makes it easier to create personalized learning experiences that adapt to individual learners.  The resulting intelligent tutoring system will use data to determine what actions the system should take, when the system should act, and explain why these actions should lead to improved learning.  This new intelligent tutoring system has the potential to transform STEM learning environments by providing accessible, low-cost, individualized instruction for complex STEM topics. <br/><br/>This project will develop a generalizable data-driven framework to induce a wide range of instructional interventions and robust, yet flexible pedagogical decision-making policies across three STEM fields (logic, probability, and programming) and types of intervention (worked examples, buggy examples, and Parsons problems).  The system will be designed to allow use of the intelligent tutor in a wide range of STEM-related domains.  The system will use advanced machine learning and data mining techniques to generate instructional interventions, mixed-initiative pedagogical policies, and human-in-the-loop explanations.  This research will advance knowledge about data-driven generation of mixed-initiative decision making that balances a student?s sense of agency with their need for effective instructional interventions at critical decision points.

The goal of this research is to study and simulate the control of photochemical reactions through the tuning of specialized laser light.

However, on a short timescale, all three are coupled. The Kilin group is developing first-principles molecular dynamics approaches for coupled electrons, nuclei, and light to fill the gap in computational investigation of laser-driven chemical reactions. The approaches rely on the combination of Rabi theory and surface hopping approximations. The research program includes an effort for validation of utilized approximations. A hypothesis driven search of acceptable approximations showing accuracy versus numerical cost facilitates an effort of establishing standard approaches for reactions at extreme conditions. Various corrections are being implemented accounting for the quantization of nuclear degrees of freedom, the higher level of electronic structure calculations with increased precision, and the treatment of coherent superposition of quantized states. The practical applications of the improved methodologies focus on photofragmentation of metal-organic compounds, photopolymerization of silicon containing compounds, photografting, and photodesorption of covalent functional groups on carbon nanotubes.

Biofilms play important roles in ecological, industrial, and biomedical processes of national relevance. For example, they are associated with biofouling, where microorganisms attach to surfaces and reduce the performance of machines. In medical fields, biofilms play a key role in the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Biofilms often form in wet environments under fluid flow. Although a large body of knowledge on biofilm formation exists, little is known about how initial single- and multi-cell interactions and fluid flow influence the growth and final structure of biofilms. This project will analyze the fundamental processes that govern cell interactions within a biofilm in fluid flow environments. The results will improve understanding of the developmental stages of microbial biofilm formation by investigating the bacteria cell responses under flow conditions. This may ultimately lead to a way to control biofilm evolution.  These outcomes could also help with novel diagnosis and treatment methods for problems caused by biofilms. This project is a collaboration between researchers at two two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and one national lab.  The institutions are Howard University, Florida A&M University, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The project supports the interdisciplinary training of underrepresented groups.

It is important to tissue formation, wound healing, and immune response. Abnormal behavior of motile cells may lead to serious conditions, including vascular disease and cancer metastasis. Therefore, understanding and controlling the mechanisms that control cell migration is useful.  The migration of single cells has been profusely studied.  It is known that this migration may be spontaneous or guided by external cues. However, our understanding of the coordinated motion of multiple cells remains limited. This award will support fundamental theoretical and computational research to study the collective motion of loosely connected cell clusters.  Specifically, cell interaction through simultaneous biochemical and mechanical signals simultaneously will be observed. This type of collective motion is known to tightly regulate early embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. Therefore, the results of this project will advance our scientific knowledge on collective cell migration, and also have a sustained impact on national health and prosperity.<br/><br/>Most research on collective cell migration has focused on the coordinated motion of tightly-packed monolayers of epithelial cells. The collective migration of loosely connected cell clusters that communicate via mechanical and chemical interactions has received little attention partially because the computational methods for tightly-packed collectives are not applicable to loose clusters that interact mechanically and biochemically. We researched a unique and enabling computational method to study this problem. The research will have a transformative impact in the field of collective cell migration, but in addition, the project will also deliver a general computational framework that can be used to study other problems in future work in the general area of biomedical engineering.  This computational framework could ultimately yield new insights into wound healing, immune response, and metastasis. The computational framework is also expected to have impact in other fields of engineering such as fluid-structure interaction, pore-scale modeling of porous media flow, and additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are known as nonlinear problems, and they are solved iteratively, by generating a sequence of successive approximations.  For many such problems, even state of-the-art solution methods can be slow, can fail, and may not be robust with respect to changes in the underlying problem data. This project aims to develop faster and more reliable iterative solution techniques using methods that recombine information from previous approximations to create a more accurate next approximation.  Theory will be developed to mathematically show how these methods improve current solution techniques, and the improved methods will be demonstrated on a wide range of systems that arise from important practical problems in optics and fluid mechanics. This project provides research training for graduate students.<br/><br/>The efficient solution of systems of nonlinear equations is essential to the high-fidelity simulation technology necessary for predictive physical modeling throughout engineering and the life sciences.  An extrapolation technique commonly referred to as Anderson acceleration (AA) has been known since 1965 to often improve the efficiency and robustness of iterative solvers for nonlinear problems. It has been successfully used in a surprisingly wide variety of applications, however theoretical understanding of its convergence properties remains largely open. Better theoretical understanding of mathematical algorithms is fundamentally important for both practical implementation and for the creation of the next generation of algorithms. The aim of this proposal is to improve theoretical understanding for AA, and to develop robust and efficient variants with improved convergence properties, both in general settings and for specific nonlinear PDEs. The main theoretical components are (1) the analysis of a variant using principal component analysis; (2) the design and analysis of robust adaptive damping and algorithmic depth strategies for noncontractive operators; (3) the analysis of the superlinear convergence of accelerated Newton iterations for degenerate problems.  The proposed work will include theory and practical application of AA to several difficult nonlinear PDEs from fluid mechanics and optics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study will benefit science and engineering fields such as exploration, transportation, and defense, by boosting the development of bio-inspired locomotion based on the fundamental principles that make fish-swimming highly efficient and agile. Accurate modeling of the interplay between a flexible body and the surrounding fluid is crucial to understanding and optimizing energy consumption, speed, and maneuverability. Existing models of undulatory swimming are restrictive in the forms of motion and the flow conditions they can describe accurately. This study will help to overcome those restrictions by introducing more realistic body motion and flow conditions. A novel body-fin dynamical model will be developed that includes previously ignored key elements important for swimming performance. This research combines vibration theory, fluid and solid mechanics, and both numerical and experimental analyses, offering interdisciplinary research for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as creative activities for K-12 outreach including fish-design competitions.<br/><br/>Undulatory swimming is a result of the nonlinear interaction between the body and surrounding fluid. Subtle changes in internal forcing and body deformation may induce significant differences in swimming performance. This award supports research that will address the fundamental challenges of accurate fluid-structure modeling under variable body-fin configurations with diverse swim gaits and conditions. A reduced-order model of undulatory swimming motion of a slender body as a forced hydroelastic oscillator will be developed to connect internal muscle forcing, external fluid forces, and body motion in an efficient approach based on state-variable modal analysis. Nonholonomic constraints on fins will be used to bypass the fluid-force prediction based on classical hydrodynamic models, which are restricted to idealized geometry and flow conditions. The use of nonsynchronous modes will enable the description of general body waves with longitudinally-varying properties. High-fidelity computational fluid-structure simulations, and innovative water-tunnel measurements based on refractive index matching, coupled with the structural analysis, will be used to investigate detailed features of the interactions between the fluid, structure, and neuromuscular activation and improve the reduced-order model. Then, the model will be used to evaluate optimized morphology and internal forcing patterns in viscous to inertial swim regimes, for uniform and complex background flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central hypothesis is that the local electrostatic interactions encoded in the coronal block sequence of amphiphilic mBCPs influences the equilibrium aggregate structure by modulating the interchain packing, chain conformation, and water distribution in the aggregates.  There are three main objectives associated with the project.  The first objective focuses on the synthesis of amphiphilic polypeptoid multiblock copolymers having defined block length and sequence of ionizable monomers by sequential controlled ring-opening polymerization methods.  In the second objective, the effects of coronal charge pattern on the equilibrium polypeptoid aggregate structures that result from their solution self-assembly in water are systematically investigated.  The last objective concentrates on stimuli-responsive behavior of these polypeptoid aggregate solutions, with a strong emphasis on the pH-induced structural transitions.

Cellulose has remarkable mechanical properties, making it as a promising building block for high performance functional and structural materials. While plants are the common source of cellulose, it requires extra physical and chemical processing to isolate and purify cellulose from plants, and such processing can potentially decrease the mechanical performance of plant cellulose. Moreover, trees often take years or decades to mature, posing substantial time cost to plant cellulose. Bioderived Cellulose produced through a microscopic organism enabled fermentation process is chemically 100% pure with much better properties than plant cellulose and can be obtained at industrial scale at a low cost within days. This research program aims to use both experimental and computational studies to investigate the fundamental science that governs the superb mechanical properties of bioderived cellulose. The success of this research program can potentially lead to a low-cost and long-sought solution in designing high performance engineering materials. The research will also be complemented by establishing a well-rounded educational and outreach program including research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, internship for underrepresented minority high school students, public outreach at the annual Maryland Day, and research dissemination via cyberinfrastructure. <br/><br/>The specific goal of this research program is (a) to explore a promising but largely unexplored strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of bioderived cellulose materials via ion infiltration, and (b) to decipher the fundamental correlation of the superb mechanical properties of bioderived cellulose materials with cellulose fiber length/alignment and water content. The research will be conducted via a coherent research framework integrating experiments and multiscale modeling. By revealing the fundamental science of the superb intrinsic mechanical properties of cellulose, the project holds promise to drive a paradigm shift in the usage of cellulose beyond its conventional way. The new knowledge generated from this research program will shed light fertile opportunities to exploit the full potential of the intrinsic superb mechanical properties of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. The fundamental scientific understanding emerging from this study can enrich the disciplines of mechanics of materials with multiple tantalizing research frontiers and be readily adapted and generalized to other material systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Winds above the ocean surface can generate currents and promote mixing. The combined effects of wind and buoyancy on the ocean are ultimately felt throughout the entire ocean. In response to the changing ocean conditions (especially, the sea surface temperature or SST), atmospheric circulations can arise to govern patterns of clouds and rain, which in turn impact the wind and buoyancy forcings on the ocean. To this end, mechanisms involving buoyancy and winds at the air-sea interface are critical in establishing the timescales, patterns, and amplitudes of many climate variations we observe and simulate in climate models. Yet, complete understanding of these mechanisms remains elusive due to sparse ocean observations and complicated dynamics. The research will decompose the relative effects of winds versus buoyancy forcing using climate model experiments, with emphasis on two features expected to substantially change in a future climate, namely the surface temperature and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).<br/><br/>In particular, many open questions remain about the importance of winds versus buoyancy forcing as pathways through which the atmosphere communicates intrinsic and externally forced variations to the ocean. Addressing these questions is made more difficult by a wide gap in the model hierarchy, between fully coupled models with a complete dynamical representation of both the ocean and atmosphere and models that represent the ocean as a motionless slab that is only thermally coupled to the atmosphere. This work will be implemented by closing said gap in the model hierarchy via leveraging a mechanically decoupled (MD) version of a climate model, which isolates variations in the ocean circulation that are driven solely by buoyancy from the wind-driven variability captured by fully coupled models. With the MD as an intermediate step between fully coupled and slab ocean models, a clearer mechanistic understanding of the drivers of climate variations is possible. These three model versions will be used together to identify the relative roles of buoyancy and wind variations in driving intrinsic SST variability, anthropogenic trends in surface temperature, and intrinsic and anthropogenically forced AMOC variations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, one major obstacle to implementing this technology is the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems that can effectively transport the required molecular machinery into cells to execute genome editing. To address this challenge, this project proposes the design, synthesis, and investigation of a series of delivery molecules made from natural amino acids and peptides.  These compounds will be evaluated for their efficiency and safety for delivering two pieces of RNAs into cells for performing CRISPR-based genome editing.  Structure-function studies will shed light on important design principles for effective molecular carriers.

CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing offers a tremendous potential for therapeutic applications and is actively being pursued for addressing a wide range of human diseases. However, one major obstacle to implementing CRISPR-mediated genome editing is the lack of safe and efficient delivery vehicles. The PI lab recently developed an innovative design of bioreducible dendronized polypeptides (BDPs) that show high efficiency for co-delivery of Cas9 mRNA and gRNAs. It is proposed that further investigation of this system will generate a new platform delivery system that can effectively and safely co-deliver CRISPR/Cas9 mRNA and gRNA into various cells. Furthermore, capitalizing on BDP?s well-defined molecular structure, we propose to conduct fundamental structure-property studies on the BDP system with the aim to gain critical insights for the design of new gene delivery vectors. If successful, the proposed study will provide a new, general, and biocompatible delivery system for CRISPR technology and offer critical insights for guiding the design of new gene delivery systems.

To do so, it plans to assist instructors in generating high quality, multiple choice questions that provide insights into the areas where students struggle.  The project will accomplish this goal by using coevolutionary algorithms to identify appropriate distractor (i.e. incorrect) answers for multiple-choice questions used for peer instruction. A frequently used form of peer instruction starts when the instructor presents students with a multiple-choice question and asks them to submit an individual answer. The students then discuss their answers in a group of peers and submit a group consensus answer, which may or not be the same as the individual answers. Finally, the instructor discusses the solution and the distractors. The project will develop software to algorithmically select distractor answers that best reveal student understandings and misunderstandings. The resulting multiple-choice questions will be usable in quizzes and tests, and as questions for peer instruction activities in physical or virtual courses. The system will also provide instructors with data analytics and visualizations, thus helping them better understand how students are performing and where they are struggling.  Finally, because the software can use open-ended answers generated by students or faculty to any question, the software will not be specific to computer science, but could be used for courses across STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project is based on the novel application of coevolutionary techniques as an approach for understanding both student-student interactions and to generate teaching artifacts that adapt to changing student populations. The work focuses on ways to develop new coevolutionary techniques that also involve students in the process of authoring peer instruction multiple-choice questions. This approach leverages techniques generally found in Human-Based Evolutionary Algorithms. Such techniques are crucial to enabling the artificial evolution of semantically complex teaching artifacts, such as multiple-choice questions, that could not be automatically generated otherwise. The first stage of the project will apply various coevolutionary algorithms to select distractors from a pool of instructor-authored options. The second stage of the project will provide a software tool that will allow students to select distractors from the instructor-authored pool for questions given to their peers. The third stage of the project will allow students to author their own distractors. The project will study which algorithms are able to generate the most pedagogically sound distractors and how the algorithmic approach compares to human-selected distractors. This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources.   The IUSE: EHR program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. This project is in the Engaged Student Learning track, through which the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nuclei of atoms are made up of nucleons, which can be either protons or neutrons.  These, in turn, consist of quarks, and are bound together by gluons.  These quarks and gluons are confined to the protons and neutrons and cannot be observed individually. In order to study the strong nuclear force that holds the quarks and gluons together, heavy ions such as gold or lead nuclei are collided with each other at ultra-relativistic speeds. This forms an extremely hot and dense liquid drop of matter, where the quarks and gluons are no longer confined into normal matter as we know it.  This new state of matter is called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).  Understanding the QGP allows for a better understanding of the strong nuclear force, which is necessary to discern how sub-atomic matter organizes itself.  <br/><br/>There are two facilities in the world that can create this matter, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Europe and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) located in Brookhaven National Lab, in Long Island, New York.  In some of the heavy ion collisions, two nucleons will strike each other hard enough to knock a quark or gluon out at a high rate of speed.  This quark or gluon will travel through the QGP, losing energy to it via its interactions, and then produce a spray of particles called a ""jet"".  The jets created in this fashion can then be used as probes of the QGP, by comparisons with collisions where QGP was not formed.  This award supports studying this phenomenon at the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment, which has recorded several large data sets ideal for jet measurements.  Additionally, it will support measuring jet results using a new experiment, called sPHENIX, which will start taking data in the last few years of the award.  This experiment has a central hadronic calorimeter (HCal), which allows nearly all the energy within a jet to be measured and will increase the precision of all jet-based measurements.  In addition to the jet related analysis, this award includes testing electronic components of the Electromagnetc Calorimeter (EMCal) and HCal and helping with the final assembly.  A dedicated test stand will be set up at the PI's institution, which will allow the electronic boards used by both calorimeters to be characterized by undergraduate and graduate students at Lehigh. These students will then spend some time at Brookhaven, assisting with the final assembly so that they can see how detectors are designed, tested, and assembled.  Additionally, the students will continue to assist with the installation, commissioning and calibration of the STAR Event Plane Detector.  This detector was constructed with the help of a previous award and forms a vital part of the STAR experiment by determining the impact parameter of the colliding nuclei within the STAR experiment.  <br/><br/>The diverse undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will gain skills in the analysis of big data, develop hardware skills, and be able to network within the large experimental collaborations at RHIC.  These will be important for both preparing and mentoring the next generation of STEM workers.  Additionally, this award will be used to continue the K-12 outreach program at Lehigh University, which will allow the younger students to work with a diverse group of scientists.

The working hypothesis of this project is that socially sustainable solutions to complex societal problems will be found at the intersections of related but distinct problem areas, where diverse stakeholders can find agreement because the array of issues cuts across the usual narratives that frame social conflict.  Oklahoma EPSCoR will employ a social science framework that heavily incorporates social dynamics theory and is informed by theories of public policy learning to invest in science at the intersections of four key focus areas: changing seasonal to sub-seasonal weather patterns, variable and marginal quality water supplies, shifting terrestrial water and carbon dynamics, and sustainable water and energy infrastructure. A social science framework will provide for systematic and iterative engagement between key stakeholders, the public, and technical focus area teams to identify convergent solutions. This project will be administered by Oklahoma State University in collaboration with five other Oklahoma academic institutions, which include two Minority Serving Institutions: University of Oklahoma, University of Tulsa, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Langston University (a Historically Black College or University (HBCU)), and the College of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation (a Tribal College).  Additional project partners include regional universities and community colleges, the Noble Research Institute, an agriculture-focused non-profit organization, and the Oklahoma Museum Network.  The use of social science to generate solutions within a polarized environment has high potential for broader impacts, because it addresses needs that are relevant to Oklahoma?s citizens.  The resulting solutions developed will benefit the quality of life for Oklahomans associated and unassociated with the project.  In addition, the project will promote STEM education across the jurisdiction and broaden the participation of underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines.  <br/><br/>This RII Track-1 Oklahoma EPSCoR project will develop and test socially sustainable, science-based solutions for wicked (complex) problems at the intersection of land use, water availability, and infrastructure.  The unifying research question is whether science-based assessment, coupled with the engagement of Oklahoma opinion leaders and citizens, can result in development of socially sustainable solutions. Oklahoma EPSCoR will identify how both problems and potential solutions for water use, landscape-carbon cycle, and energy and water infrastructure are interlinked in complex ways by focusing on four challenges addressed by the focus areas: 1) improving the knowledge of atmospheric and land processes that lead to seasonal to sub-seasonal events and increasing understanding of predictive skillsets to enable the creation of outlook forecasts;  2) understanding terrestrial carbon and water dynamics across Oklahoma to identify potential options for increasing carbon uptake and storage while sustaining water supply by using  an Earth Systems Science approach to quantify water and carbon dynamics at a statewide scale; 3) developing new engineering technologies and modeling schemes for the reuse and improved understanding of water treatment efficiencies;  and 4) developing an aggregated resilience model for interdependent infrastructure systems that includes the effects of uncertainties in severe weather, weather extremes, wildfires, and induced seismicity on networks, and network-to-network interdependencies.  Technical focus area teams will engage in a systemic, iterative process of conducting science with added direction from social narratives that citizens, opinion leaders, and scientists use to comprehend and evaluate potential research impacts.  The project will also conduct education, outreach and broadening participation activities that include:  1) STEM curriculum and training for K-12 teachers; 2) non-traditional STEM educator training; 3) K-12 student STEM education, and 4) growing of Oklahoma?s citizen science network. These activities will address the state?s STEM needs and reach thousands of Oklahoma trainees, teachers and citizens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HD computing is a brain-inspired machine learning paradigm that transforms data into knowledge at very low cost, while being extremely robust to errors. When completed, this project has the potential to change the way machine learning is done today ? instead of depending on the cloud, IoT systems will be able to make quality decisions on the spot, in real time, regardless of connectivity, with long battery lifetime.    This will be made possible by designing: i) novel HD encoding schemes to represent various data in IoT applications including numerical feature vectors, time-series data, and images, ii) a novel distributed learning framework for IoT networks by incorporating active learning to considerably reduce communication overhead and learning costs, and iii) a reliable learning solution based on the error-tolerant characteristic of HD computing.

The vision of the education and workforce development program is to create a statewide Data Science and Analytics educational ecosystem, where learners receive a designed, consistent, sequenced, and modular education in data science with job or further educational opportunities available at appropriate points in their academic path. These efforts, combined with intensive industry collaboration, will provide the pillars of support needed to improve research capability and competitiveness in Arkansas. DART will develop: 1) the means to increase the speed and efficiency of data curation and labeling; 2) techniques to protect privacy and identify impartial content; 3) methods for harnessing the predictive power of machine learning while increasing the interpretability of the processes behind the predictions; and 4) data science curricula that are more inclusive and better prepare students for a data-centric future. These advances will be made possible by bringing together in one research project a large group of talented scientists from diverse, but complementary, research areas. The project will support basic research in math, statistics, data science, and computer science that will enable data-driven discovery through visualization, better data mining, privacy and security protections, machine learning and more. The project will build an open computational infrastructure for researchers and students and develop innovative educational pathways to train the next generation of data scientists. DART will include a data science summer institute for undergraduates and extensive curriculum support for middle-school teachers. A key opportunity in the design and development of the Data Science and Analytics degree program will be to leverage DART research areas and topics as real-life examples for the courses and to integrate these into the curriculum. <br/><br/>DART will bring together data science researchers with diverse, but complementary, research interests, backgrounds, and skills to stimulate innovation. DART scientific objectives contribute to the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea in foundations, algorithms, and systems in data science and further develop a coordinated state-wide data cyberinfrastructure. The project will study key barriers to better big data analytics and develop improved algorithms and methods to provide: 1) the means to more automatically curate heterogeneous, unstructured, and poorly-structured data; 2) faster and more robust model training by augmenting manual methods; 3) more secure data by protecting the privacy of contributors; 4) improvements in metrics of data quality; 5) novel unbiased model predictions and decision support systems; and 6) a better balance between the predictive power of complex machine learning models and the interpretability provided by statistical models. Each of these research outcomes will create a better framework for balancing the risks and benefits of new data analytics technologies. As the state better aligns its investments with industry strengths, more opportunities to improve the quality of life in Arkansas and to steadily increase educational attainment and wages will develop. DART will include a data science summer institute for undergraduates, summer internships and research experiences, increased data science educational opportunities, integrated support for middle school teachers across the state, and revamped curricula to include relevant data science topics and capstone projects. Developments in data cyberinfrastructure will increase sharing of information among educational institutions, research institutions, and industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The plants? ability to catch and digest insect prey has long fascinated the public as well as botanists. In addition to these plants? unusual method of acquiring nutrients, sundews also appear to possess striking variation in chromosome number and structure, but large-scale surveys are lacking owing to the need for living organisms and advanced microscopy techniques to evaluate these features. This project will take advantage of extensive living collections of sundews available to the researchers, as well as targeted collecting efforts, to survey the chromosome numbers and genome size of numerous sundew species, as well as the environmental conditions in which the plants grow. Researchers will also reconstruct the evolutionary history of the sundews using phylogenomic data, allowing them to evaluate the history of chromosome evolution and habitat specialization in this group and their role in driving diversification. This project will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students and will enable the development of collaborations for an early-career researcher. In addition, the researchers will deliver hands-on educational modules for first-year undergraduate students and K-12 students. They will also assemble a living collection of sundews that will be available through the College of Biological Sciences Conservatory at the University of Minnesota for research, teaching, and public access.<br/><br/>A multi-layered dataset will be generated for reconstructing the history of chromosomal evolution of the sundews and to test the macroevolutionary link between chromosome number variation and lineage diversification. Species relationships will be estimated by sampling at least 80% of the 250 species in the genus using a combination of transcriptome and Hyb-Seq data. Chromosome number and genome size data will be obtained for at least 40% of sundew species, and immunostaining will be used to determine the centromere type, which is thought to vary substantially in Drosera, in 15 species across the genus. Additionally, species occurrence data will be compiled from publicly available specimen databases to enable reconstruction of climatic niche and soil characteristics. The researchers will use state-of-the-art methods in phylogenomic data analysis to model chromosome changes, combined with sampling hundreds of genes across the genome to determine the placement of whole genome duplication and single chromosome gain and loss events. This project will not only enable subsequent investigations into the mechanisms of chromosome evolution in sundews, but it will also establish a rigorous analytical framework for comparative analyses of chromosome evolution across the tree of life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Guam, located in Micronesia in the western Pacific, is the westernmost reach of U.S. influence in the world.  As such, it is located in close proximity to the nation?s most diverse, complex and understudied coral reef systems.  Unfortunately, due to factors such as climate change, these coral reef systems are under threat from diseases.  Coral diseases can be devastating to not only the corals themselves but also to the animals and plants that live within the corals.  This project will study these systems using state-of-the-art techniques to understand how these coral reef systems, and their associated animals and plants, respond to climate change and diseases that are becoming more prevalent in the region.  In addition, the project will create an on-line catalogue of animals and plants that live in the region so that they can be archived in perpetuity for future generations.  Finally, this project will develop a cadre of effective programs to educate the workforce in science fields. The project will engage the community in order to promote island sustainability and will help build new and innovative business opportunities to that end.   <br/><br/>This research infrastructure improvement project will create a world-class research and STEM training facility that will address challenges to the survival of coral reefs under rapidly changing environmental conditions within the region. Guam has the nation?s most diverse and complex coral reef systems and there is an urgent need to bring modern and cutting-edge studies to this ecosystem to address climate change challenges. This project will implement a systematic, diverse research agenda incorporating new knowledge of biodiversity, population genetics, genomics, phylogenetics, ecology, microbiology, oceanography, and mathematical modeling to document and predict the taxonomic and functional diversity of reef-builders and associated taxa in a changing environment. To this end, the project will address questions involving: 1) the role of genetic diversity and connectivity in conferring reef resilience; and 2) detection of key traits for resilience for reef builders.   Additionally, the project will facilitate the expansion of a state-of-the art digitization, imaging and mapping laboratory and an online database within the University of Guam.  This biorepository will include over 4,000 taxa from existing and new collections on Guam, improve the curatorial infrastructure, and provide broad-based documentation and understanding of biodiversity on Guam and throughout the Pacific. The biorepository will provide specimens, curatorial services, and biodiversity analyses to the entire scientific community.  This project will also develop innovative programs for STEM education, workforce development and community engagement to promote island sustainability.  In particular, the project will target the underserved Pacific Island Chamorro communities.

Specifically, a novel biomechanical method will be used to quantitatively assess how tissues and organs form.  Mapping the characteristics of cells and tissues during embryonic development has been a broad topic of interest in biology. Current methods to analyze tissue growth are invasive and either damage tissue or are potentially toxic. This study will observe the formation of live embryonic bodies safely. Specifically, the work will generate a 3-dimensional stiffness map of zebrafish embryos during their growth. The process of functional tissue and organ formation is well conserved among vertebrates.  Therefore, the knowledge obtained from zebrafish embryos is applicable to human embryos. A better understanding of embryonic structural development will promote studies in developmental biology and biomedical sciences.  The results of this work may ultimately enable monitoring of embryo development in humans and contribute to public health. This research will be integrated into the PI's educational efforts through the design and development of low-cost, do-it-yourself robotic systems, which can be easily modified and used in K-12 schools.  <br/><br/>This research aims to obtain a spatiotemporally-resolved, whole-body 3D map of the elastic modulus of healthy and abnormal zebrafish embryos, which will be used to quantitatively profile their growth and pathology. Three aims will be pursued: (1)  Obtain a whole-body 3D elastic modulus map via integrated mechanical indentation, high-resolution 3D light microscopy, and finite element methods. (2) Validate the spatiotemporal stiffness measurement during embryonic development as a significant biomarker through correlation studies with molecular analysis. (3) Assess the effect of tissue indentation on embryonic development to prove that the tissue indentation can be conducted safely without perturbing growth. The study will advance a methodology of tissue phenotyping through the label-free, in situ, biomechanical characterization of embryonic development. This approach offers advantages over current methods, such as histology-based tissue phenotyping and genomic analysis, which do not directly quantify the mechanical properties. The biomechanical characterization method will be used to study somitogenesis during embryonic development, which is governed by the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), one of the most fundamental cellular processes throughout tissue and organ development. The biomechanical method can be easily adapted to quantify other cellular and tissue processes that are known to involve stiffness changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This type of work is often called ?team science,? an approach that engages the skills of individuals from different fields to tackle a complex problem, such a modeling the spread of infectious disease.  The project will study the impact of embedding team science training in multidisciplinary course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Over the course of the project, the investigation will include approximately ~6000 undergraduate students across multiple STEM disciplines.  CUREs are known to be a high-impact STEM teaching practice, but there is limited understanding about how CURES might help students develop team science competencies.  This project will investigate the impact of mentorship and team science training in multidisciplinary CUREs across biology, chemistry, engineering, and geological sciences.  In these CUREs, students will receive training in both research and in team science.  They will apply both their team science competencies and research skills to collaboratively solve research problems.  The project is designed to achieve two key outcomes.  First, it is expected to advance foundational knowledge about effective practices for and the impacts of integrating team science training into CUREs.  Second, it is expected to prepare students for careers as STEM professionals who can work collaboratively across disciplines to solve challenging national and global problems. Because 35% of the undergraduates at Eastern Carolina are low-income and/or first-generation college students, it is expected that this project will help to broaden participation in STEM careers.<br/><br/><br/>This project aims to develop empirical evidence about how embedding team science training in undergraduate research experiences affects the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes as transportable team science competencies and what factors contribute to successful, inclusive, and scalable implementation of undergraduate team science training across disciplines.

The Alaska megathrust also generates the most recorded earthquakes of any fault system in the U.S. In 2018-2019, the geophysical community deployed the first major shoreline-crossing seismic array off Alaska, placing 75 high-quality seismometers on the sea floor to complement several onshore synchronized deployments. This dataset, now openly available, provides the first comprehensive nearby sampling of signals from small to moderate earthquakes along the megathrust in Alaska. This project will analyze a range of earthquake-generated signals from this new dataset, to address questions such as: why are earthquakes more common in some places than others despite similar geology? where are the active faults in the region? and what is the nature of fault materials that allows earthquakes to be generated? The results will greatly improve the working models by which we understand the physics of earthquakes, of tsunami generation, and other related hazards. This project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>One of the best-known examples of along-strike variability of a megathrust is observed along the Alaska Peninsula. In a few hundred km, the plate interface varies from fully locked and capable of generating M9.2 earthquakes near Kodiak, to fully creeping near the Shumagin Islands. The fundamental controls on the rupture variability of megathrusts are poorly known, relevant to both along-strike variations as seen in Alaska, as well as updip/downdip changes that are seen along all subduction zones. A major new publicly available community seismic dataset has just been acquired along this segment of the Aleutian megathrust. The 15-month broadband dataset, termed the Alaska Amphibious Seismic Experiment, AACSE, provides extensive coverage far offshore and onshore of seismicity and structure, with uniform sampling. This project focuses on the megathrust sampled by the AACSE by characterizing and understanding the earthquake sources on it, the tremor produced along it, and by imaging the fine-scale structure using local-earthquake and teleseismic signals. Specifically, waveform-based methods will be used to greatly increase the quantity and precision of earthquake hypocenters along the megathrust, enabling characterization of along-strike variability. These will be complemented by studies of earthquake source properties to better understand spatial variation in rupture behavior, and to separate megathrust earthquakes showing upper plate and lower plate deformation. Modern tremor detection methods will be applied to the full dataset, to characterize any regions of downdip and potential updip tremor, and their along-strike variation. High-frequency mode-converted signals and autocorrelation of local-earthquake coda will be used to image the megathrust targeting spatial variations in its reflectivity strength and thickness; these analyses will be integrated with collocated receiver functions to generate a wide-band image of the plate boundary. This research will address several fundamental questions: Where is the plate boundary (as opposed to nearby regions in the upper and lower plate) seismogenic? How does the slip behavior and earthquake dynamics vary down-dip, and between locked and creeping sections? Do sharp boundaries in coupling correlate with strong variations in seismic behavior? How do earthquakes on the plate boundary relate to structure, and how does structure relate to dehydration or lithology? What explains the along-strike variability between locked and creeping sections? Do major potentially seismogenic splay faults exist in the upper plate? How is non-volcanic tremor related to regular earthquakes? The extensive amphibious array here allows an unprecedented opportunity to accurately resolve seismicity, tremor and structure in exactly the same place, with a variety of techniques, and in doing so provides an excellent opportunity to make progress on these issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Programs that develop ways to help students master algebra concepts and a belief that they can perform algebra may lead to more students entering engineering careers. This project will provide an online engineering program to support 9th and 10th grade Baltimore City Public Schools students, a predominantly low-income African-American cohort, to develop concrete goals of becoming engineers. The goals of the program are to help students with a growing interest in engineering to maintain that interest throughout high school. The project will also support students aspire to an engineering career. The project will develop in students an appreciation of requisite courses and skills, and increase self-efficacy in mathematics. The project will also develop a replicable model of informal education capable of reinforcing the mathematical foundations that students learn during the school day. Additionally, the project will broaden participation in engineering by being available to students during out-of-school time and by having relaxed entrance criteria compared to existing opportunities in supplemental engineering curricula. The project is a collaboration between the Baltimore City Public Schools, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Expanded School-Based Mental Health programs to support students both during and after participation. The project will benefit society by providing skills that will allow high school students to become members of tomorrow's highly trained STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The research will test whether an informal, scaffolded online algebra-for-engineering program increases students' mastery and self-efficacy in mathematics. The research will advance knowledge regarding informal education by applying Social Cognitive Career Theory as a framework for measuring program impact. The theoretical framework will aid in identifying mechanisms through which students with interest in engineering might persist in maintaining this interest through high school via algebra skill mastery and increased self-efficacy. The project will recruit 200 youth from the Baltimore City Public Schools to participate in the project over three years. Qualitative data will be collected to assess how student and school socioeconomic factors impact implementation, student engagement, and outcomes. The research will answer the following questions: 1) What effect does program participation have on math mastery? 2) What direct and indirect effects do program completion and supports have on students' mathematics self-efficacy? 3) What direct and indirect effects do program components have on engineering career goals by the end of the program? 4) What direct and indirect effects does math self-efficacy have on career goals? 5) To what extent are the effects of program participation on engineering career goals mediated by math self-efficacy and engineering interest? 6) How do school factors relate to the implementation of the program? 7) What socioeconomic-related factors relate to the regularity and continuation of student participation in the program? The quantitative methods of data analysis will employ descriptive and multivariate statistical methods. Qualitative data from interviews will be analyzed using an emergent approach and a coding scheme guided by theoretical constructs. Project results will be communicated to scholars and practitioners. The team will also share information through school newsletters and parent communication through Baltimore City Public Schools. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The confluence of topology, geometry, group theory, complex analysis and dynamics in dimension two is a constant source of rich structure and influences many fields both directly and by analogy. Because surfaces are simple and flexible, they admit large parameter spaces of shapes. The study of these spaces is useful directly in topology and geometry in all dimensions.  The PI will explore the geometry of the space of shapes of a surface, and the relationships between flows within this more abstract space and the ways in which three-dimensional structures are built out of families of two-dimensional structures. By way of analogy, ideas in two and three dimensions have also inspired powerful techniques in allied fields such as geometric group theory and dynamics. Part of the PI's work will explore some of these connections. Graduate students funded by the grant will, in addition to their research work, be trained in mathematics education and outreach, preparing them for contributions to society through higher education and other leadership roles. Additional activities of the PI and his students and collaborators will include public educational activities for local school children and their families, bringing cutting-edge mathematical knowledge to the greater New Haven community.<br/><br/>The PI plans to study a number of aspects of the Weil-Petersson geometry of the Teichmuller space of a surface, and its connections to the theory of 3-manifolds and more broadly to group actions in other settings.  Recent work of the PI and coauthors has shed some new light on the study of the geodesic flow of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space, and its connection to the structure of fibered 3-manifolds. With these results in mind, the PI plans a more detailed study of the coarse structure of the Teichmuller space as made visible by the cubical and metric structure of its asymptotic cone. This point of view suggests interesting questions about minimal surfaces in the Teichmuller space, and avenues toward resolving the visibility problem for the WP geodesic flow. New connections of Weil-Petersson geometry to the structure of fibered 3-manifolds and Thurston's norm on homology hint at deeper structure which the PI plans to investigate.  In the theory of 3-manifolds, the deep interaction between decompositions along surfaces, structure of curve complexes and mapping class groups, and hyperbolic geometry continues to provide challenging questions. The PI will work on developing a more complete theory for canonical decompositions of 3-manifolds, focusing on the interactions of Heegaard splittings, fibrations and subsurface projections. He will study the problem of finding uniform models for hyperbolic manifolds and obtaining a priori bounds on skinning maps. The setting of Heegaard splittings and handlebodies connects to a new approach on character varieties of free groups, via a technique of graph folding in hyperbolic space.  Additional projects (some with students) include the study of hierarchically hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces, and relations between hyperbolic earthquakes and the Teichmuller horocyclic flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, it will look for connections between information from potential teacher candidates, such as test scores and STEM grades; their admittance to and enrollment in STEM teacher education programs; and their later retention and effectiveness as STEM teachers. There is intense interest in improving the quality of the U.S. STEM teacher workforce. However, surprisingly little is known about whether information in applications to teacher education programs predict or do not predict STEM teacher retention and effectiveness.  This study is designed to generate empirical evidence about admissions into teacher education programs, the crucial first step to influencing the quality of the nation?s STEM teacher workforce. The specific research questions to be investigated include:  1.  Are specific types of applicant information predictive of STEM teacher retention?   2.  Is applicant information predictive of STEM teacher effectiveness?  3. Is applicant information differentially predictive of retention along the effectiveness distribution? 4. Is applicant information differentially predictive of retention and effectiveness in high-need educational agencies?  Answers to these questions may reveal connections between applicant information and teacher outcomes.  Such information could inform decisions about recruitment and admissions into STEM teacher education programs.  As a result, the project has the potential to improve the nation?s overall strategy for ensuring a high-quality STEM teacher workforce.  <br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between the Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research at the American Institutes for Research, Washington State?s Education Research and Data Center and five Washington State universities that prepare STEM teachers (Central Washington University, Pacific Lutheran University, University of Washington, Washington State University, and Western Washington University). This research study is made possible by statewide data about students and teachers in Washington that include: 1) data from all high-need educational agencies in the state; 2)  college transcript data about STEM teacher candidates enrolled in public colleges and universities in the state; and 3) data about admissions processes and admissions from the five collaborating Universities. These sources of quantitative data will be combined to permit regression-based analyses of the attributes of college applicants that are correlated with STEM teacher effectiveness and retention. The project will also collect qualitative data from faculty at collaborating universities to better understand what faculty in STEM teacher education programs value in prospective teacher candidates and whether what they value is related to admission and enrollment in the participating universities. The project is informed by economical and socio-cultural theories.  The economical theoretical basis places teacher education program operations within a public labor market in which applicant information is filtered by decision makers? backgrounds, experiences, and social contexts. Given the breadth of potential relevance of this work, project results will be disseminated not only through academic journals, but also through national and state conferences, project websites, and a project conference with stakeholders from around the state. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This understanding is important for society as beneficial species of filamentous fungi are used to produce billions of dollars of commercial products annually, while pathogenic species are responsible for billions of dollars in crop damage and are a significant threat to human health. In both beneficial and pathogenic species of fungi, the cell wall plays a critical role enabling the fungus to grow and survive in diverse environments. To help understand the fungal response to stress, sophisticated mathematical models will be developed to describe system behavior and these models have the potential to extend to other biological systems. This research will also have a broad impact on human capital, as it has a significant educational component. In the three different laboratories involved, work will include both graduate and undergraduate students. The plan also includes outreach to underrepresented minorities through the UMBC Meyerhof Scholars program. These robust and interdisciplinary training opportunities will contribute to the development of a diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>While the ability to respond to cell wall stress is a critical feature of growth and morphogenesis in filamentous fungi, the different regulatory modules that underlie this response are not well understood.  We seek to determine how three specific regulatory modules interact to mediate the response to cell wall stress. To do this, we use phosphoproteomic analysis to reveal kinase-mediated regulatory behavior and transcriptomic analysis to reveal stress-associated changes in gene expression. An important aspect of the proposed work is that dynamic data will be gathered to understand how phosphosite occupancy and gene expression change with time. In addition to experiments, we will use a novel mathematical modeling approach to build a robust kinetic model (set of coupled ordinary differential equations) describing wall stress response. A key feature of the modeling is that in addition to gene expression values, a critical variable will be phosphosite occupancy. We note there are often multiple phosphosites on a single protein and that these are often the substrates of different protein kinases. Our model will help us make connections in this complex network. To develop the model, we will use a Design-Build-Test-Learn approach, wherein the model is used to make network predictions which are then tested experimentally. The data from these experiments will then be used to improve the model. This will allow us to evolve the model to accurately represent system behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to provision of prescribed functionalities of sensing, computing, and processing, these ICs must meet stringent reliability specifications in order to safeguard performance and safety of the whole mission-critical system where deployed. Circuits designed to be fail-safe by design exhibit low occurrences of failure. However, having a sign of no failure under typical verification and test procedures yields no guarantee for meeting a given near-zero or extremely-low failure specification. On the other hand, exhaustiveness may never be achieved by brute-force failure detection, which results in an unacceptably high cost in simulation and testing. This project will develop efficient machine-learning techniques for extremely-rare circuit-failure detection without needing large amounts of expensive simulation or test data. The proposed techniques will enable cost-effective verification and test of reliability-critical ICs and mission-critical systems in general.  The research undertaken will also enable the two groups at UC Santa Barbara and UT Dallas to educate and train undergraduate and graduate students, including women and underrepresented groups, thus expanding the and contributing to the much needed US technological workforce. <br/><br/>It is believed that extracting critical failure information via machine learning within practical limits of available measurement or simulation data can go a long way towards extremely rare failure detection. This project centers on developing an active-learning framework that intelligently samples in the high-dimensional space of complex interacting design parameters, manufacturing variations, and operating conditions, achieving the goal of data-efficient detection of rare circuit failures. The targeted active-learning framework will be supported by the development of machine-learning model foundations and robust learning methods that can scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces. The key objective of this project is to make extremely-rare failure discovery and identification of the underlying failure mechanisms practically viable by extracting the maximum amount of useful information possible from a small amount of available data.

Sexual selection also sets the stage for sexual conflict, a situation in which the evolutionary interests of the two sexes fail to coincide, resulting in traits or genes that can be beneficial to one sex but harmful to the other sex. While the effects of sexual selection and conflict on traits are well understood, little is known about how these mechanisms affect the genome. A key test of theory relating sexual selection, sexual conflict and genome evolution would entail genome comparisons in groups of related species in which some have had a history of strong sexual selection and some have had a history of weak sexual selection. In this project, the researchers will use seahorses and the related pipefishes to conduct such a test. Seahorses and some pipefishes are monogamous with long-term pair-bonds, and this mating system results in weak sexual selection and little sexual conflict. Other pipefishes have independently evolved polygamy (multiple mating by one or both sexes), which results in strong sexual selection and substantial conflict. The researchers will apply modern sequencing methodologies to delineate the impacts of sexual selection and conflict on genome evolution in these species. This project has significance well beyond seahorses and pipefishes, as many species, including humans, have had a recent evolutionary history involving sexual selection and conflict. This history can explain why the sexes are different at the level of the genome and why the same gene can have different effects in the sexes. This project will also train a new generation of graduate students and undergraduates in cutting-edge genomic techniques and statistical methodologies. In addition, it will expand the pipefish and seahorse research community by offering week-long workshops and a new wealth of publicly available genomic data.<br/><br/>The project will involve a total of twelve taxa, including three seahorses and nine pipefishes, chosen for their phylogenetic relationships and known patterns of sexual selection. The seahorses (genus Hippocampus) and three of the pipefish species (genus Doryrhampus) are monogamous with pair-bonds, and the other six pipefish (three each from the genera Syngnathus and Nerophis) are polygamous with a history of strong sexual selection. The project will involve (1) the complete sequencing of the genomes of all twelve taxa, (2) comparative transcriptomics, which will examine patterns of sex-specific gene expression, and (3) comparative population genomics, which will detect contemporary genome-level selection. Data will be integrated across these three levels of approaches to understand the genome-level effects of sexual selection and sexual conflict in light of evolutionary theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum technology is still in its infancy, but rapid developments are underway. On the theoretical side, fundamental questions need to be addressed regarding how to control the dynamics of quantum systems, as well as the effects of noise and environment. The PI and his group will pursue research to uncover critical characteristics of intricately controlled dynamics of quantum states. An example is determining how best to control the time dependence of an initial quantum state to prepare a desired quantum mechanical state.  Theoretical insights gained will be applied to simulating on quantum computers problems that are intractable on traditional modern computers, including simulating complex quantum materials. The PI will focus on quantum computers based on superconducting qubits, which harnesses a state of matter where the electrons in some materials at sufficiently low temperature can collectively behave quantum mechanically. The PI will also explore the development of robust methods and algorithms for computing on another platform that harnesses a different many-electron quantum mechanical state that offers reduced susceptibility to noise based on topological properties of materials. <br/><br/>The research project involves condensed-matter physics and quantum information science and will contribute to the development of efficient quantum software for near-term quantum computers.

The world around us is described by quantum mechanics, yet quantum mechanical phenomena are absent from our day-to-day life. This anomaly comes from the enormous complexity of the many interacting atoms that make up everyday objects, which wash out quantum effects to give the classical world. By isolating electrons and atoms from this complex environment, experimentalists have made enormous strides towards realizing quantum effects in increasing large and practical devices, which has become known as the second quantum revolution. This revolution will further the need for understanding quantum physics at its most fundamental level, which is the overarching goal of this CAREER award. <br/><br/>The research will focus on a class of systems known as many-body cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which gives access to quantum properties of light and insight into the interaction between light and matter. Quantum mechanics tells us that light comes in individual units called photons, but conventional lasers contain so many photons that seeing quantum effects from each one is impossible. Cavity QED works by confining the light between two nearly perfect mirrors. One then prepares states where there are not millions or billions of photons in the cavity, but rather one or two. When the photon number is so low that individual photons can be seen, the photons behave quantum mechanically. Many-body cavity QED consists of these photons interacting with atoms that behave quantum mechanically as well. This project will study how these systems respond when they are kicked out of equilibrium, which is anticipated to give qualitatively new features due to the quantum mechanical push and pull between the light and the matter. These interactions should further provide applications down the road in a variety of quantum technologies, such as next-generation lasers and high-precision sensors.<br/><br/>The research will be complemented by an educational program built around designing a virtual reality (VR) module allowing users to interact with simple quantum mechanical systems such as the hydrogen atom. By virtually shrinking the user to the size of the hydrogen atom, the VR module will enable them to interact with the quantum mechanical world directly. From an educational standpoint, the quantum VR module will provide a new route to learn about the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics without the mathematical overhead. This will create understanding and excitement which is relevant to training next-generation scientists and engineers, as quantum mechanics becomes an increasingly indispensable part of science and technology.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education into nonequilibrium states of interacting light and matter. Time-periodic, or Floquet, driving is one of the most powerful tools for engineering quantum systems. Traditionally, a strong high frequency drive is used to modify the effective Hamiltonian, enabling the realization of artificial structures such as strong effective magnetic fields in neutral atoms. Recently, new phases of matter have been discovered that exploit the fundamentally nonequilibrium nature of the Floquet drive. Examples such as the Floquet time crystal were quickly realized after their theoretical discovery, opening the door for novel nonequilibrium routes to symmetry breaking.<br/><br/>In practice, the Floquet drive is often done by microwave or optical photons. Confining these photons to a cavity, they may also be treated as quantum degrees of freedom, a paradigm known as many-body cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The semiclassical Floquet limit is obtained when the cavity photon occupation is large, but cavities afford the intriguing possibility of going to quantum limit by decreasing the photon number, thus accessing a different regime of strongly coupled quantum light and matter.<br/><br/>This research will study the many-body cavity QED limit of nonequilibrium Floquet phases of matter. Doing so naturally leads to new nonequilibrium states of matter with anomalous behavior, which may be thought of as arising from competition between native local interactions and global interactions mediated by the cavity. The research will involve three broad directions: (1) understanding the competition between thermalization and many-body localization in a cavity, (2) demonstrating symmetry breaking states such as time crystals in the presence of the cavity, and (3) classifying topological states of matter coupled to one or more cavities, including quantized photon pumps.<br/><br/>This work will bridge the active but mostly independent fields of many-body cavity QED and Floquet physics, providing a pathway to new phases of matter that lie between the limits that are often considered. The research team will extend the classification of nonequilibrium phases of matter, where anomalous states induced by the interplay of short- and long-range interactions remain particularly challenging. Experimental realizations will be explored in nitrogen vacancy centers, superconducting circuits, ultracold atoms, and trapped ions. The resulting entangled states of strongly coupled light and matter will have relevance to the fundamental science of quantum information and applications in quantum metrology.<br/><br/>This research will be complemented by designing a virtual reality (VR) module allowing users to interact with simple quantum mechanical systems. The quantum VR will illustrate some key aspects of quantum mechanics, such as the wave nature of electrons, quantum measurements, and radiative decay, which have proved elusive to many learners. This is vital for both public science and technological applications as quantum technologies become increasingly relevant, lowering the barrier to entry for scientists, engineers, and members of the public. Feedback from users will serve as a seed for future development of visualization methods in a broader range of quantum systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding brain size, structure, and function are among the most important frontiers of science.  Brain size is considered to be influenced by social life, but the relationship is unclear. The research will address two significant questions: how does the brain change with body size, and how is brain function affected by the social nature of species.  These questions will be addressed by comparing different species of ants, which are remarkably variable in size and social life. Ant brain sizes will be computed using a novel method and a new highly sensitive technique will allow energy use in individual brains to be measured.  By comparing colonies that exhibit large size and division of labor with less socially complex small colonies, the effects of social life on brain size and energy use can be understood.  Broad insights into the factors that affect brain evolution in all animals, including humans, will be gained.  The project will train the next generation of scientists to become skilled in research, and will engage teachers and students to improve the experience of K-12 science education.  The science curriculum of students from underrepresented groups and diverse minorities at the Laboratory Schools of the University of Chicago and Boston-, Phoenix-, and Providence-area schools will be enriched. The project will broadly address critical national needs to improve science literacy and inspire career choices that will enhance the global competitiveness of the United States.<br/><br/>The hypothesis that complex social life selects for increased brain size and adaptive compartmental allometries to neurally support behavior is controversial and continues to be tested and debated.  Importantly, the energetic cost of operating the brain is virtually unknown.  Eusocial insects offer excellent models to address these questions of brain evolution.  The PIs will robustly sample brain size, scaling, and metabolism in ant species that range widely in social complexity (colony size, physical caste) and worker body size to test the hypothesis that the energetics of ant brain tissue are independent of worker body size, morphological caste, or species, and thus scale in direct proportion to brain size.  Scaling relationships of brain size and metabolism - and metabolic rates of brain regions that have social functions - with worker body size and colony size will be assessed.  Respiration rates of individual worker brains and individual workers will be measured to determine the integrative physiological principles governing the evolution of brain size, structure, and function in the context of ant social evolution.  Employing an integrated workflow connecting labs between research and primarily undergraduate institutions, brain templates from confocal images will be computationally constructed to automate and thus rapidly quantify brain size and structure.  Scaling relationships of functionally differentiated brain regions and estimates of brain and body metabolic rates will be determined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some specific examples include locating underground caves and tunnels from gravimetric data, inclusion of different conductivity by electromagnetic prospecting,  underground seismic prospecting, and monitoring the volatility of financial markets. One of the goals is to use minimal gravimetric, electromagnetic, and financial data to develop cheap, fast, reliable, and safe diagnostic and exploratory techniques. Another goal is to increase the resolution when prospecting by (acoustic and electromagnetic) waves of higher frequencies without restrictive traditional assumptions of convexity on location of sensors. The PI will participate in the forthcoming Industrial Mathematical Clinic at Wichita State University as an outreach to local industrial companies and will continue to direct (female) graduate students to contribute to national human resources for contemporary science and technology.<br/><br/>The PI intends to study the fundamental issue of stability in the design of efficient numerical methods. Since prospecting by (almost) stationary fields (electromagnetic or gravitational) is severely ill-posed, he plans to find how many parameters of a source, a medium, or an obstacle can be identified in a stable way and what is the minimal amount of the data needed. When prospecting by stationary waves of higher frequencies, a goal is to achieve a better stability without convexity conditions on the locations of unknown objects and sensors and to use needed analytically a priori constraints as penalty/regularizing terms to design effective  numerical methods. A particular goal is to improve the electrical impedance tomography by 1) finding what is the best resolution at low frequencies and the optimal number and location of sensors to get this resolution and 2) determining how this resolution improves with higher frequency by using the complete Maxwell system and what are limitations  due to the  attenuation. Another research plan is to consider more complicated and realistic basket options and to design faster and more reliable methods for finding volatility from the market data.  To better understand and properly use stability one needs a substantial modification of available methods and new ideas. One of the challenges is to demonstrate the uniqueness and Lipschitz stability of an inclusion in gravimetry or in the electrical impedance tomography from a minimal boundary data. Another challenge is to show better stability for acoustic or electromagnetic sources without standard geometrical (convexity) assumptions. Finally, the PI expects to design a stable recovery of time independent coefficients of general (anisotropic) hyperbolic second order equations from the boundary data generated by many interior sources. Complex variable theory, energy (Carleman) estimates, Fourier analysis, and potential theory will be used as tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nowadays, large volumes of human event data, such as online TV-viewing records, domain name server queries, and electronic records of hospital admissions, are becoming increasingly available in a wide variety of applications including network analysis and services and healthcare analytics. Predictive modeling of those collective event sequences is beneficial for promoting nationwide economic and safety development. For example, in network traffic diagnosis, the analysis of user activities can be used to predict and control dynamic traffic demand, which improves risk response efficiency. In health informatics, the analysis of patient admission events can detect and optimize treatment for individuals at risks, which enhances public health preparedness and healthcare outcomes. However, by optimizing for the unitary goal of accuracy, machine learning algorithms trained on historic event data may amplify privacy risks. Studies have demonstrated that it is possible to infer private attributes such as demographics and locations from human activities such as online browsing histories and location check-in events. This project is to develop a trusting-based machine learning framework that better protects human privacy while minimally impacting utility for predicting dynamic events. Research and education on interdisciplinary topics of machine learning and privacy are integrated in curriculum development, student research projects, and academic seminars.<br/><br/>The project develops a series of novel models and algorithms to analyze dynamic human events in three synergistic research thrusts. (1) Besides time-stamped event sequences, additional marker information such as event types and tags can be utilized to better capture the dependencies between events. This project investigates novel point processes, multi-view learning, and deep learning methods for analyzing dynamic human events with event marker information. (2) To improve human understanding and trust of predictive modeling, the project develops interpretable algorithms to explain how their information is used in event prediction and what potential private information can be inferred based on their inputs. (3) Balancing between privacy and utility is of mutual benefit to both individuals and service providers. This project investigates a user-specific privacy-preserving approach for event prediction and addresses utility-privacy tradeoff by formulating it as a min-max optimization problem. These three research aims are complemented by a comprehensive evaluation in a number of application domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants can manipulate these microbial communities through the chemicals they release?root exudates?with subsequent consequences for soil functions. Characterizing root exudates and their relationships with other plant traits will improve understanding of plant effects on microbial communities and the ecosystem services that they provide. This project will use laboratory, greenhouse, field, and computational approaches to evaluate the effects of plant root exudates on soil microbial composition and function. The work will be conducted in the context of restored tallgrass American prairies, an endangered ecosystem, and deliver our results directly to land owners and natural resource managers responsible for the creation and maintenance of this landscape. Additionally, the project provides educational opportunities for members of the public ranging from high school students to retired adults and will train early-career scientists in cutting-edge techniques. <br/><br/>This project will develop a predictive, mechanistic framework to understand how phylogenetic and functional characteristics of plants and plant communities influence soil microbial communities and the ecosystem functions via root exudates. It will combine exometabolomic plant measurements, sampling in a biodiversity experiment, functional microbial characterizations, and machine learning approaches to forecast microbial community structure and function in a field setting. Exudate characterizations from a taxonomically and functionally diverse pool of plants will greatly advance knowledge of plant biochemistry. The use of exudates in mesocosm incubation and metabolic characterization experiments will demonstrate their direct impacts on microbial community structure and function.

For this, a team of researchers from four collaborating organizations proposed to develop BALLISTIC (Basic ALgebra Libraries for Sustainable Technology with Interdisciplinary Collaboration). The BALLISTIC project, through the leading-edge research it channels into its software deliverables, will lead to the introduction of tools that will simplify the transition to the next generation of extreme-scale computer architectures. The main impact of the project will be to develop, push, and deploy software into the scientific community to make it competitive on a world-wide scale and to contribute to standardization efforts in the area. BALLISTIC has the potential to become the community standard for dense linear algebra and be adopted and/or supported by a large community of users, computing centers, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) vendors. Learning to use numerical libraries is a basic part of the education of a computational scientist or engineer in many fields and at many academic institutions.

The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at the University of Delaware and Temple University, is to answer important questions about the informal understandings of fractions young children have before they come to school and what their relations are to fraction learning in more formal instructional settings. Proficiency with fractions dramatically increases the likelihood of students succeeding in math, which in turn increases participation in the STEM workforce. Importantly, large individual differences in fraction understandings are apparent at the start of fractions instruction in the intermediate grades. Early fraction misunderstandings cascade into more severe math weaknesses in later grades, especially when instruction may shift abruptly from whole numbers to fractions. There is a critical need to understand the roots of individual differences that arise before formal instruction takes place. Young children possess important informal fraction understandings before they come to school, but the range of these abilities and their role in formal fraction learning and development is not well understood. The goal of this project is: a) to investigate the extent to which individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first-grade children are associated with short- and longer-term fractions and math outcomes; and b) to see whether there is a causal link between level of informal fraction-related knowledge and the ability to profit from fractions instruction that directly builds on this knowledge. The findings from the project hold promise for informing early childhood educators how fractions can be incorporated in the first-grade curriculum in new and meaningful ways. Though the findings should be beneficial to all students, the project will specifically target members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields, including ethnic and racial minority and low-income students. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers. <br/><br/>The project design includes both an observational study and an experimental study. The observational study will: (1) document individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first grade; (2) determine concurrent relations between this informal knowledge and general cognitive and whole number competencies; and (3) examine whether informal fraction-related knowledge at the beginning of first grade uniquely predicts math outcomes at the end. The experimental study will explore the extent to which first graders? informal and formal fraction concepts can be affected by training. The researchers will test whether training on the number line, which is continuous and closely aligned with the mental representation of the magnitude of all real numbers, will help students capitalize on their informal fraction understandings of proportionality, scaling, and equal sharing as well as their experience with integers to learn key fraction concepts. Together, the synergistic studies will pinpoint the role informal fraction knowledge in learning key fraction concepts. All data will be collected in Delaware schools serving socioeconomically and ethnically diverse populations of students. Primary measures include assessments of informal fraction knowledge (proportional reasoning, spatial scaling, equal sharing), executive functioning, vocabulary, whole number knowledge, whole number/fraction number line estimation, formal fraction knowledge, and broad mathematics achievement (calculation, fluency, applied problems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During their tenure as Noyce Scholars, the students will have opportunities for early research experiences to expand their STEM knowledge and skills.  The Noyce Scholars will benefit from a modified teacher education curriculum that supports philosophies and strategies for teaching in high-need schools.  They will apply this knowledge in their teaching experiences in secondary STEM classrooms in a high-need school district.  Finally, the Scholars will participate in learning communities such as the Collaborative Professional Development Circle and ongoing mentoring that supports preservice and new teachers. The project expects to prepare the Noyce Scholars to implement student-centered teaching and STEM habits of mind, grounded in an understanding of the challenges of high-need school environments. <br/><br/>This project at Geneva College, located in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, includes partnerships with New Brighton School District (a high-needs school district) and the Urban Impact Foundation. The goals of the grant are to: (1) recruit, enroll, retain, and graduate 22 qualified biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics majors prepared for secondary education certification over the five-year grant period; (2) support and prepare highly qualified STEM teachers who are trained to work in high-need classrooms; (3) place and retain 100% of the Noyce Scholars in teaching positions in high-need local education agencies upon graduation; (4) evaluate the effectiveness of the Noyce Scholars in the classroom through successful completion of state-mandated induction programs; and (5) use the assessment and evaluation results to  institutionalize and sustain successful programmatic elements. The project seeks to generate new knowledge through creating a survey that will allow STEM teachers in high-need school districts to evaluate their teaching practices using effective evidence-based research. A high-quality evaluation and assessment process led by an independent evaluator will inform Geneva College and the larger academic and research community about the components that are most effective in STEM teacher recruitment, retention, and preparation. Results of the project will be widely disseminated to the local, academic, and research community via a project website, publications, presentations, and regional and national meetings and conferences. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Macrophages wrap themselves around a foreign particle, engulfing and digesting it. This process, called phagocytosis, involves both chemistry and physical forces. Though the process of phagocytosis has been well studied biochemically, this project takes a different perspective: it treats the macrophage as a machine and the phagocytic process as a mechanical event. What are the forces? How do they coordinate? How does the machine work?  Without understanding forces, we lack a complete scientific description of phagocytosis and, more broadly, the immune response itself. The project employs both advanced microscopic techniques as well as unique force measurement methods to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the macrophage in real time while simultaneously measuring the forces it generates. The data generated from this project will provide a more comprehensive model of this fundamental biological process that integrates the biochemistry, the structure, and the biophysical forces. Another critical component of the overall project is bringing the research to the public to help inform folks on the latest exciting science that is happening in the lab. Broader impact projects include a virtual-reality-based exhibit that will be developed at a local museum, and a week-long biophysics ?mini-term? that will be taught at a local high school. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to use advanced imaging and force measurement tools to reveal the mechanisms of force generation and mechanosensing in phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process through which macrophages, neutrophils and other cells engulf large foreign pathogen particles as a first line of immune system defense. To engulf a target particle, one or more distinct actin-driven mechanical processes draws in the target, surrounds and encloses it.  Along with biochemical signaling dynamics, phagocytosis is also driven by fundamentally mechanical processes involving forces and structural dynamics.  The most fundamental questions are unanswered: What forces does a macrophage produce? What actin dynamics and associated cell morphological dynamics give rise to them? How do external forces and mechanical environment affect decision making in phagocytosis? Measurements directly associating macrophage-target forces with actin dynamics are a crucial missing piece to developing models of the engulfment process. Within this project, a set of hypotheses will be tested that are guided by analogous mechanisms that have been proposed for other cell systems such as the ?molecular clutch? mechanism in mesenchymal motility which provides force generation as well as mechanosensing.  Measurements of macrophage force generation during engulfment will be performed along with accompanying high quality, live cell volumetric imaging of cell morphology and cytoskeletal dynamics. This will be complemented by use of soft beads as targets to measure local compressive and shear forces being imposed by the macrophage on the target.  Quantitative spatio-temporal correlation analysis of volumetric actin dynamics and force measurements will also be performed.  This will provide rich detailed data informing location and timing of the local dynamic actin remodeling that produce a specific macrophage force event. If successful, the project will produce a completely new dynamical atlas of the macrophage that maps the relationship of dynamic 3D cell morphology and actin dynamics with local force generation and mechanosensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New species are defined by the combination of traits that prevent them from mating with other species. However, these traits are not static ? they vary depending on the history of a particular population and across different environments. The researchers will use a combination of field and laboratory-based experiments to identify key traits that define two closely related species and test how those traits vary across space. They will then expand their study to other closely related species to test whether traits that define speciation are predictable across a group of species. The project will test new genome sequencing tools in wild populations, inspiring new areas of research in evolution, behavior, and conservation. It will also contribute to the understanding of how new species arise, how they persist across different environments, and whether comparisons between related species are useful to learn about speciation when applied to a broader group of organisms. Through this project, the researchers will provide critical training to undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers. The researchers will also develop public citizen science resources to help document species diversity across the Colorado Front Range. These resources will improve undergraduate science curriculum and public science education through meaningful scientific experiences.<br/><br/>Classic evolutionary theory assumes that species boundaries are fixed differences between species, but barriers between species vary over different temporal, spatial, ecological, and historical contexts. The extent and consequences of this variation on the evolution and maintenance of species boundaries is largely unknown and has not been studied comprehensively in a single system. The proposed research will connect patterns of population level variation to the origin and maintenance of reproductive barriers across a species complex. It will integrate studies of barrier phenotypes (temporal, habitat, behavioral, fertilization, and postzygotic isolation) with patterns of spatial variation in recombination, hybridization, and selection. The researchers will use replicate hybrid zones of North American field crickets to understand variation in reproductive barriers across different scales of biological diversity?within species, between species across multiple independent contact zones of different ages, and across a species complex with overlapping ranges. Key outcomes will be 1) integration of the ecological, behavioral, and genomic context for variation in species barriers, 2) an empirical test of the role of variable reproductive barriers in maintaining species boundaries, 3) a test of the repeatability of the evolution of reproductive barriers across multiple species pairs, and 4) meaningful research experiences for undergraduate non-STEM majors and the public that will increase public engagement with, and appreciation for, nature and science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participation is a key part of learning, but implicit biases can result in different opportunities for different groups of students to participate in STEM classrooms. Such differences can cause inequities in learning outcomes that may lead to underrepresentation of women, students of color, and other groups in the STEM workforce. By studying how to provide STEM faculty with meaningful data about the differential impact of their teaching on student participation, this project has the potential to improve teaching and learning in STEM at scale. This project aims to generate professional development methods and technologies that support equitable teaching across STEM fields. During the project, hundreds of faculty members will receive this professional development, which in turn will impact tens of thousands of students. The project will also develop supporting materials to enable university professional developers and teacher educators to effectively provide similar professional development to the educators they serve. Expected outcomes of this work include new knowledge about equitable teaching in STEM, effective methods for helping instructors teach more equitably, and widespread dissemination of these methods.<br/> <br/>This project will directly support over 100 faculty to address implicit bias, by utilizing (and further enhancing) the classroom observation tool, Electronic Quality of Instruction Protocol (EQUIP). EQUIP is a free, web-based classroom observation tool that provides visual representations of classroom participation by different social marker groups. The research plan includes a longitudinal study of a subset of faculty members as they engage in sustained professional development through three interventions: (1) systematic design of data visualizations; (2) a summer institute; and (3) faculty learning communities. Through a mixed-methods research design, this project will address fundamental research topics around how STEM faculty interpret data visualizations, how professional development may leverage visualizations to reduce bias and improve teaching, and the nature of the resulting impacts on student outcomes. The methods will utilize a combination of within- and between-subject comparisons, triangulating data from: classroom observations, data analytics, student outcomes, surveys, and interviews. The major theoretical contributions of this project are to develop knowledge about how data visualizations may improve equitable teaching practices, and to longitudinally study the process through which faculty members go as they learn to recognize and address implicit bias in their teaching. This project can contribute significantly to broadening participation in STEM, because it addresses implicit bias, which is a pervasive problem that limits the participation of women, students of color, people with differing abilities, and other underrepresented groups in STEM. Helping the faculty who participate in the study address their biases is expected to directly produce more equitable learning environments in undergraduate STEM. Moreover, this project will contribute broadly to educator professional development efforts, by documenting and disseminating a suite of tools and best practices for addressing bias and improving equity.  The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that supports early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education.

Calcific deposits lead to adverse consequences such as stiffening of arteries and disruption of normal blood flow, often leading to morbidity and mortality. The goal of this project is to understand where calcific deposits are formed in soft tissues. In particular, the investigators will examine how collagen fibrils (present in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells in the arterial wall) can facilitate pathological calcification. The insights gained will advance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing soft-tissue calcification especially in its early stages. This can help improve cardiovascular outcomes by designing new strategies for early diagnosis and treatment and aid biomaterials development for cardiovascular bioprostheses. In addition to advancing the field of extracellular matrix and vascular biology, the project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing graduate and undergraduate student(s) with multidisciplinary hands-on research experiences and under-privileged K-8 students with enrichment activities. Furthermore, new education materials and microscopy approaches will be developed to enhance education and research infrastructure for the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the role of the collagen fibril in mediating vascular calcification.  While it is accepted that pathological calcification is mediated by phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells into a ?bone-like? osteogenic phenotype, there is also evidence indicating that in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), a subpopulation of collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix undergoes a structural change as compared to the native (normal) fibrils. The project?s overall hypothesis is that structurally altered (abnormal) collagen fibrils in AAA serve as the major substrates for calcific deposits due to perturbations in their surface-charge distribution. To test this hypothesis, studies will be conducted at the single fibril level on human AAA tissue, beginning with mapping the micro and macro-calcifications in the excised AAA tissue using micro-computed tomography. The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST Aim is to test the hypothesis that structurally altered collagen fibrils in AAA are ?hot-spots? for negative charges in the ECM.  Surface potential and surface charge mapping of collagen fibrils in ambient air will be accomplished using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), a technique available on most commercial AFMs (Atomic Force Microscopes) that has been used for mapping surface potential and surface charge on metals and semiconductors, but is being uniquely applied in this project to the analysis of normal and abnormal fibrils in situ in tissue sections.  Surface charge distribution of collagen fibrils in a fluid environment will be measured using another AFM based approach based on recording force-distance curves, which can map both surface charge and sample topography at high resolution in physiologically relevant fluid environments (e.g. different salt concentrations).  The SECOND AIM is to test the hypothesis that both natural as well as bio-mimetically induced calcific deposits in AAA are localized on structurally altered fibrils. A biomimetic approach will be used to determine if abnormal fibrils can be a cause as well as an effect of vascular calcification. Biomimetic mineralization will be induced in a cell free manner (in mineral-poor regions) using ionic solutions (e.g. dental fluid) that mimic the native ion concentrations in plasma without its biological components and by incubating extracellular vesicles (EV) isolated from cultured cells with decellularized AAA tissue.  Spatial distribution and characterization of calcific deposits will be determined using analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) approaches to characterize the size, composition and location of minerals with respect to the collagen fibril at the ultrastructural level.  Abnormal fibrils are expected to be more prone to calcific deposits as compared to normal fibrils both with respect to percent of fibrils mineralized as well as number and size of calcific deposits present per fibril, and a similar trend is expected to be observed for biomimetic and naturally induced calcific deposits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In places, the plate boundaries must slide past one another to accommodate this motion.  Sometimes this occurs smoothly, but sometimes the plate edges are stuck together by friction and don't slide at all until enough stress builds to the point where the plates slip past each other suddenly in an earthquake. Over the past two decades, a different form of tectonic boundary slip has been studied in which built up stress is relaxed episodically, as in an earthquake, but at a much slower rate taking days, weeks, months, or even years to gradually slip.  These events are called ""slow slip events"" or ""slow earthquakes.""  Because the motions are gradual they do not generate seismic shaking (as normal earthquakes do), making them far less dangerous.  However, slow slip events occurring near areas that are frictionally stuck may trigger large earthquakes, a phenomenon that requires further study. This study focuses on searching for slow slip events in the offshore, shallow part of the Cascadia subduction zone, which lies offshore the western United States stretching from northern California to north of the Canadian border.  Here an oceanic tectonic plate is colliding with North America, producing very large destructive earthquakes and tsunamis every few hundred years. The lack of seismic shaking associated with slow slip events makes these events difficult to detect, especially offshore.  On land they are evident in precise, continuous GPS records which show plate motions of several centimeters that start and stop over a few weeks.  Such motions are much more difficult to observe on the seafloor because GPS signals do not penetrate sea water.  Consequently alternative methods must be devised to detect offshore slow slip events.  This research project will record very precisely the lengths of optical fibers stretched across the seafloor near the Oregon coast.  If a slow slip event occurs in the region near the optical fibers, the associated optical length change will be recorded by a battery powered laser system at the end of each optical fiber.  Studying such events offshore will help to build models of their influence on the timing and location of great earthquakes, and may lead to future advances in earthquake forecasting. The project supports the training of a student.<br/><br/>Widespread deployments of GPS sensors in the past decade have helped identify Slow Slip Events (SSEs), especially near subduction zone faults in Cascadia, Costa Rica, Japan, and New Zealand. Understanding SSEs presents an opportunity to gain new insights into the mechanism governing locking and unlocking of subduction zone and other faults, and may be important in assessing the hazard levels presented from potential great earthquakes and tsunami.  In particular, SSEs occurring at the downdip limit of the strongly locked zone may pose a risk of triggering large earthquake ruptures.  It is therefore critical to search for SSEs occurring at the base of the locked zone, which in Cascadia (as in most subduction zones) lies offshore.  In this study, two orthogonal optical fiber strainmeters will be installed on the seafloor above the Cascadia subduction zone to detect offshore SSEs.  A recent study of the cumulative effect of SSEs in Cascadia using onshore GPS data indicates possible offshore slow slip at the base of the locked zone which is hypothesized to occur simultaneously with onshore SSEs.  However, the detection of this slip using onshore GPS is very weak.  Confirming the presence or absence of offshore slow slip in Cascadia is important for understanding the potential role of SSEs in influencing the timing and location of the next great earthquake.  While GPS networks have sufficient sensitivity to map the location of SSEs onshore, they do not cover that portion of the crust under the oceans, nor are they able to distinguish the timing of sub-events because of the need for averaging over daily periods.  In contrast, optical fiber strainmeters can be deployed offshore and have their best signal to noise ratio at shorter periods, complementing onshore GPS both in location and frequency band.  Because SSEs evolve in complex patterns indicative of propagating stress fronts, it is important to resolve, both in scale and time, the deformation signals in order to understand more fully the evolution of the rupture plane.  In conjunction with GPS, the availability of highly sensitive and stable strainmeters offshore will enable such characterizations. The measurements in this study will be timed with an expected onshore SSE to capture the hypothesized offshore slip, testing this model and others that address the extent of an offshore locked zone. In addition to the detection of SSEs, a number of other studies will become feasible following the deployment of this offshore strainmeter, including investigation of strain from traveling seismic waves and tidal observations for inferring local Earth structure.  In addition, the work will advance the technology of optical fiber sensors and likely find applications in other disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way to better predict future climate is to study past natural changes in atmospheric CO2. Such changes occurred through the ice ages of the past 1 million years. The ocean is thought to have played a key role in ice age atmospheric CO2 changes because ocean uptake of CO2 contributes to global cooling and CO2 release by the ocean contributes to warming. One of the most useful tools for reconstructing past ocean CO2 cycles is the radioactive isotope of carbon, 14C. Radiocarbon is measured in marine microfossils which record the 14C of seawater. This study will develop microfossil 14C records from ocean sediment cores and use them to unravel the causes of a low-radiocarbon anomaly that occurred in the eastern North Pacific Ocean at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (roughly 20,000 years ago). Understanding this anomaly will improve our knowledge of ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange in the past, and thus will help us predict the impact of rising atmospheric CO2 on future climate. The project will support research participation by undergraduate students at UC Irvine. <br/><br/>The proposed work will use a set of new sediment 14C/ records along the Eastern North Pacific margin to address a long-standing paleoceanographic question?what is the origin of the anomalously low 14C in the Eastern North Pacific during the deglaciation? This feature has alternately been explained as evidence for: (i) an anomalously low seawater 14C/C advected to the eastern North Pacific sites, (ii) the local or regional addition of low-14C carbon from seafloor volcanism, or (iii) post-depositional alteration of the proxy record. The proposed analyses will yield four new benthic foraminifera 14C/C records from Eastern North Pacific core sites upstream of the sites with anomalously low deglacial 14C. These records will be synchronized using benthic foraminifera d18O records and will be used to create a new map of Eastern North Pacific deglacial seawater 14C. This map will be used to distinguish between advected and local sources for the low-14C signal.

They will then expand their study to other closely related species to test whether traits that define speciation are predictable across a group of species. The project will test new genome sequencing tools in wild populations, inspiring new areas of research in evolution, behavior, and conservation. It will also contribute to the understanding of how new species arise, how they persist across different environments, and whether comparisons between related species are useful to learn about speciation when applied to a broader group of organisms. Through this project, the researchers will provide critical training to undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers. The researchers will also develop public citizen science resources to help document species diversity across the Colorado Front Range. These resources will improve undergraduate science curriculum and public science education through meaningful scientific experiences.<br/><br/>Classic evolutionary theory assumes that species boundaries are fixed differences between species, but barriers between species vary over different temporal, spatial, ecological, and historical contexts. The extent and consequences of this variation on the evolution and maintenance of species boundaries is largely unknown and has not been studied comprehensively in a single system. The proposed research will connect patterns of population level variation to the origin and maintenance of reproductive barriers across a species complex. It will integrate studies of barrier phenotypes (temporal, habitat, behavioral, fertilization, and postzygotic isolation) with patterns of spatial variation in recombination, hybridization, and selection. The researchers will use replicate hybrid zones of North American field crickets to understand variation in reproductive barriers across different scales of biological diversity?within species, between species across multiple independent contact zones of different ages, and across a species complex with overlapping ranges. Key outcomes will be 1) integration of the ecological, behavioral, and genomic context for variation in species barriers, 2) an empirical test of the role of variable reproductive barriers in maintaining species boundaries, 3) a test of the repeatability of the evolution of reproductive barriers across multiple species pairs, and 4) meaningful research experiences for undergraduate non-STEM majors and the public that will increase public engagement with, and appreciation for, nature and science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these data often exhibit a paradox in that there is distance between those who own, curate, and control intelligence gleamed from massive data (e.g., companies owning mobile application databases) and those who broadcast it (e.g., users or communities). For open data in the public domain, this distance can be narrowed by directly involving communities, and training local cohorts of students and professionals to be able to interpret and translate data to answer questions of significance to the community. Using social innovations in energy systems and transportation, this CAREER project deploys big data analytics and experimental science to advance the design of incentives for resource conservation policies in both urban and non-urban areas. Buildings and transportation are important sectors of the economy; therefore, this research calls on human and machine intelligence to advance research on how large-scale civic data in combination with behavioral strategies can be used to increase resource conservation, while providing aggregate intelligence about infrastructure and localized impacts in near real time. <br/><br/>This research creates the necessary data infrastructure for a suite of information-based policy interventions. This includes linkages in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning prediction with methods of causal inference. Unstructured data that would take months of human processing will be interpreted and classified rapidly, while structured data that lives in disparate information systems can be linked and activated to enable policy analysis. Furthermore, this CAREER program integrates behavioral research, teaching, and the dissemination of computational tools as a means to broaden participation in analytic policy processes among historically under-represented communities. The research, will lies at the intersection of data science and policy, will deploy novel approaches to evaluate, engage, and disseminate open data to problems of resource efficiency and behavior changes for critical civic infrastructure and natural resource protection.

In addition to attributes like density and elasticity, materials have properties such as electrical conductivity and magnetism that result from the fundamentally quantum mechanical behavior of the dense gas of electrons holding the atoms together. Some of the wide variety of complex and technologically important properties of materials, such as superconductivity and magnetism, can only be understood using quantum theory. Unfortunately, the centrality of quantum mechanics to these properties means that simulating them with classical computation devices is either ineffective or inefficient. This award supports an alternative approach, wherein the awardee and his students are developing a simulator capable of modeling the underlying physics of materials using the quantum properties of atoms. In order to bring out the quantum effects in lithium atoms, they need to simultaneously cool the atoms to within one millionth of a degree above absolute zero and cause them to act like a solid material. Students will use one set of lasers to slow the atoms down to achieve the cooling, and another set of lasers to pin them in place. Critical to this award, scientists, including the awardee, have developed a technique to shake the pinned atoms, which coerces them into emulating a much larger range of materials than previously possible. This award will further scientific insight into materials of technological relevance, as well as support a new generation of students in understanding quantum interactions. In addition to supporting the training of graduate students, the award supports high school students and teachers from the Atlanta area to work in the lab over the summer on mechanical and electronic (?mechatronic?) automation tools to increase lab productivity. The skills and knowledge of state-of-the-art laboratory set up acquired will be used to develop similar tools for the high school physics lab.<br/><br/>This award supports a novel approach to quantum simulation of materials using laser cooled, ultra-cold lithium. Many of the details of debated importance in materials relate to the Fermi surface, where the conduction electrons live. The project will employ shaken optical lattices, which allow a great degree of control over the shape of the Fermi surface. Thereby, the Fermi surface will be tuned to favor or disfavor certain types of order. Important questions about how these different forms of order can compete or co-exist can be answered, and create complex phase diagrams generated from a well understood microscope model that can be directly compared with theory. The project team will use resonant optical lattice shaking in a gas of ultracold lithium atoms to tune the Fermi surface shape. The project goals include facilitating interactions with significant momentum dependence, demonstrating two merging Fermi surfaces at a neck closing (Lifshitz) transition, and creating models of nesting-driven density wave formation in a ?clean? scenario where no lattice phonon modes exist to provide an alternate mechanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This issue is exceptionally relevant for American Indians, who remain underrepresented as only 0.2% of the STEM workforce, even though they make up 2% of the U.S. population. In response to this need, this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project takes a community-driven design approach, a collaborative design process in which Indigenous partners maintain sovereignty as designers, to collaboratively create place-based storytelling experiences, stories told in historical and cultural places through location-based media. The place-based storytelling experiences will be digital installations at culturally, politically, and historically significant sites in the local community where the public can engage with Indigenous science. Partners will include Tribal Nations such as the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation (NWBSN), Utah's Title VI Program, and other Tribal educators throughout Utah. <br/> <br/>Initially, the principal investigator and the NWBSN will investigate: (a) what are effective strategies and processes to conduct community-driven design with Indigenous partners?; (b) how does designing place-based storytelling experiences develop tribal members? design, technical, and computational skills?; (c) how does designing these experiences impact tribal members? scientific, technological, and cultural identities? The goals are to establish a process of community-driven design, build infrastructure to support this process, and understand how this methodological approach can result in culturally-appropriate ways to engage with science through technology. The principal investigator will work with NWBSN to complete intergenerational design cycles (a design cycle is made up of multiple design iterations). Each design cycle will result in one place-based storytelling experience. Across partners, the goal is to include roughly 15 youth (ages 6-18), 10 Elders/Knowledge Holders, and 10 other community members (i.e. members ages 18-50, likely parents) in each design cycle (35 tribal members total). Some designers are likely to participate in multiple design cycles.  In Year 4, new community partners will be engaged to allow for iterative refinement and further development of the community-driven processes developed with the first partner. Over the life of the award the PI with partners aim to include at least 50 youth ages 6-18 across design cycles and at least 100 Tribal Elders, Knowledge Holders, and community members (as designers, storytellers, or to provide cultural artifacts or design feedback).<br/> <br/><br/>This CAREER award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at the University of Delaware and Temple University, is to answer important questions about the informal understandings of fractions young children have before they come to school and what their relations are to fraction learning in more formal instructional settings. Proficiency with fractions dramatically increases the likelihood of students succeeding in math, which in turn increases participation in the STEM workforce. Importantly, large individual differences in fraction understandings are apparent at the start of fractions instruction in the intermediate grades. Early fraction misunderstandings cascade into more severe math weaknesses in later grades, especially when instruction may shift abruptly from whole numbers to fractions. There is a critical need to understand the roots of individual differences that arise before formal instruction takes place. Young children possess important informal fraction understandings before they come to school, but the range of these abilities and their role in formal fraction learning and development is not well understood. The goal of this project is: a) to investigate the extent to which individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first-grade children are associated with short- and longer-term fractions and math outcomes; and b) to see whether there is a causal link between level of informal fraction-related knowledge and the ability to profit from fractions instruction that directly builds on this knowledge. The findings from the project hold promise for informing early childhood educators how fractions can be incorporated in the first-grade curriculum in new and meaningful ways. Though the findings should be beneficial to all students, the project will specifically target members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields, including ethnic and racial minority and low-income students. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers. <br/><br/>The project design includes both an observational study and an experimental study. The observational study will: (1) document individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first grade; (2) determine concurrent relations between this informal knowledge and general cognitive and whole number competencies; and (3) examine whether informal fraction-related knowledge at the beginning of first grade uniquely predicts math outcomes at the end. The experimental study will explore the extent to which first graders? informal and formal fraction concepts can be affected by training. The researchers will test whether training on the number line, which is continuous and closely aligned with the mental representation of the magnitude of all real numbers, will help students capitalize on their informal fraction understandings of proportionality, scaling, and equal sharing as well as their experience with integers to learn key fraction concepts. Together, the synergistic studies will pinpoint the role informal fraction knowledge in learning key fraction concepts. All data will be collected in Delaware schools serving socioeconomically and ethnically diverse populations of students. Primary measures include assessments of informal fraction knowledge (proportional reasoning, spatial scaling, equal sharing), executive functioning, vocabulary, whole number knowledge, whole number/fraction number line estimation, formal fraction knowledge, and broad mathematics achievement (calculation, fluency, applied problems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The behavior of earthquakes and volcanos, however, changes dramatically between regions along the coast. Some areas produce extremely large earthquakes, while other regions have only small to moderate-sized earthquakes.  Similarly, the chemistry and eruption styles of volcanos change along the coast.  Understanding the origins of these differences could lead to important insights into global earthquake and volcano hazards. Scientists believe that the key to understanding this system may lie in the structure and fluid-content of rocks 100-200 km beneath the surface, where the Pacific tectonic plate dives beneath the North America tectonic plate.  This study will use earthquake waves to image these rocks buried under Alaska?s coast.  These waves, called surface waves, travel across the earth near the surface and change speeds based on the characteristics of the rocks that they travel through. By measuring differences in wave speed based on location and the direction the waves travel, we will examine whether differences in earthquake and volcano behavior are connected to (a) changes in magma-production regions, (b) changes in the fluid content of rocks, or (c) changes in the direction that rocks slowly flow deep beneath the surface.  The work will be completed at a Primarily Undergaduate Institution and provides research experience for undergraduate students.

It has hosted several megathrust earthquakes, including the 1964 Great Alaskan Earthquake, the second largest earthquake in recorded history.  The seismic and volcanic behavior of the subduction zone, however, undergoes dramatic changes along strike, with some areas slipping in great (M>8) events while other regions deform primarily through creep.  Understanding the origins of this variability could lead to important insights into subduction zone processes and global geophysical hazards. Recent studies have highlighted the role that hydration of the subducting slab and the mantle wedge may play in governing these behaviors.  In this study, recently collected data from the Alaska Amphibious Community Seismic Experiment and the Alaska Transportable Array will be leveraged to build Rayleigh and Love wave velocity models and to solve for radial and azimuthal anisotropy of shear waves in the upper mantle beneath the Alaskan subduction zone.  These velocity models will be used to determine how forearc mantle structure, hydration of the incoming plate and the mantle wedge, and mantle flow combine to influence volcanic and seismic behavior along the subduction zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, the deep coverage whole genomes generated from this study will provide a reference panel for the people of the Americas, which will uncover rare alleles and genomic features unique to each region. These findings will be placed into a more complex demographic framework to provide a richer characterization of these evolutionary adaptations, while elucidating nuanced demographic histories complicated by disease and colonization.

Symbolic systems transmit information in a variety of applications, such as DNA sequences, synthetic biology, and combinatorial chemistry.  It also forms the backbone of music, which can be viewed as highly context-dependent sequence of symbols where each note or event foreshadows those yet to come.  The proposed technology offers new ways of engaging with music, for both music streaming service listeners and musicians (comprising 26% of the US population) alike.  This technology will address the music industry and for many additional applications. <br/><br/>The proposed project exploits nonlinear chaotic system variability to generate variations of context-dependent symbol sequences, such as those comprising musical works.  While many applications require methods to eliminate chaotic behavior, a dissipative system operating in its `chaotic regime? can be viewed as offering a natural mechanism for variability, due to the sensitivity of its solutions to initial conditions.  This built-in variability can be exploited by a chaotic mapping technique that transforms an ordered input into a variant-ordered output with potential outcomes ranging from high similarity to the original work to significant mutation.  The method includes parsing the input into an ordered sequence of original elements {Ni}, which are sequentially indexed by successive integer values i=1,?, Imax.  For each i, a selection algorithm determines whether Ni is a candidate for modification or replacement, thus becoming a ?receptor element.?  A substitution or modifying algorithm then operates on at least one of the receptor elements by varying or replacing it with a substitution element.  The resulting ordered set of original and substituted or modified elements comprises the variant output.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2019 the President issued an executive order announcing a national AI strategy involving the private sector, academia, and the public. Among other things, this strategy calls for investments in AI research and development, providing AI resources, and training an AI-ready workforce. Researchers are increasingly applying machine learning (ML) techniques to science and engineering problems including those from astronomy, climate modeling, extreme-scale systems management, cell biology, high energy physics, drug discovery, social science, satellite image analysis, among others. In addition to advances in algorithms and software, the performance of AI systems is heavily dependent on the underlying hardware. Evaluation of hardware optimized for AI algorithms is of keen interest to the AI research community.<br/><br/>To extend the application of AI to evermore challenging problems in science and engineering, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), working closely with their vendor partner Supermicro, will deploy Voyager, a high-performance, innovative resource for conducting AI research across a wide range of science and engineering domains. Based on AI processors optimized for deep learning (DL) operations, Voyager will be a first-of-its-kind system available in the NSF resource portfolio. This will give researchers the opportunity to explore Voyager?s unique hardware and software using well-established deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, Keras, and Tensorflow to implement deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Researchers will also be able to develop their own AI techniques using software tools and libraries built specifically for Voyager?s innovative AI architecture.<br/><br/>The project is structured as a three-year Testbed phase followed by a two-year Allocations Phase. During the Testbed phase SDSC researchers and collaborators will work closely with a small number of research teams to evaluate the performance of Voyager?s innovative deep learning (DL) hardware, specialized compilers, and system libraries. Semiannual workshops will bring teams together to share lessons learned, and develop the knowledge and best practices that inform future users who will be given access during the Allocations Phase. During the Allocations Phase, Voyager will be available to researchers with projects deemed meritorious by an NSF-approved allocation process. Lessons learned from the Testbed Phase is used to develop documentation, best practices, allocations models, and user support strategies. Semiannual workshops continue in the Allocations Phase. Through SDSC?s AI Technology Lab, the project will engage with industry to explore how technologies like those in Voyager can improve the global competitiveness of private sector companies, and prepare the next generation workforce.<br/><br/>SDSC will deploy Voyager in SDSC's energy-efficient data center on the UCSD campus. Voyager will be connected to multiple high-performance research and education networks at 100 Gbps. Supporting Voyager is a nationally recognized team of application and systems experts at SDSC. The Voyager External Advisory Board will assist in recruiting early users and providing guidance to the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AI enables information extraction and analysis of large datasets and the creation of high-fidelity models that can augment or replace more computationally expensive calculations in traditional simulation codes. In this way, AI can accelerate time-to-science by orders of magnitude. To reap these benefits, highly complex AI models must first be trained. Training is a computation-intensive process that takes days, weeks, or even months, requires optimization of both the network architecture and its hyperparameters, and limits the scope and complexity of challenges addressed. What if training time could be reduced to the point of being interactive, taking only minutes or hours even in the more extreme cases? The result would be transformative: scientists and engineers could rapidly develop and refine their ideas, enabling them to achieve high-impact solutions to the most pressing and complex issues.<br/><br/>To help advance knowledge by enabling unprecedented AI speed and scalability, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), a joint research center of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, in partnership with Cerebras Systems and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), will deploy Neocortex, an innovative computing resource that will accelerate scientific discovery by vastly shortening the time required for deep learning training/inference, foster greater integration of deep AI models with scientific workflows, and provide revolutionary innovative hardware for the development of more efficient algorithms for artificial intelligence and graph analytics. Neocortex will advance knowledge by accelerating scientific research, enabling development of more accurate models and use of larger training data, scaling model parallelism to unprecedented levels, focusing on human productivity by simplifying tuning and hyperparameter optimization, and providing a revolutionary hardware platform for the exploration of new frontiers.<br/><br/>Neocortex will introduce the most powerful AI processor to the NSF cyberinfrastructure ecosystem and will democratize access to game-changing compute power, otherwise only available to tech giants, for students, postdocs, faculty, and others, who require faster training turnaround to analyze data and integrate AI with simulation. It will provide a unique opportunity to explore the potential of a groundbreaking new AI hardware architecture, tapping into the revolutionary AI processor technology of the Cerebras CS-1 AI platform and the large in-memory scale up capabilities of HPE Superdome Flex to unlock new insights and accelerate time to discovery. The Neocortex project will additionally focus on building a strong community around these revolutionary capabilities, including collaborations with other leading national institutions and emphasizing inclusion and diversity. It will build STEM talent through training and internships, develop the U.S. workforce and national competitiveness through industrial outreach, and foster international collaborations. Public outreach and XSEDE campus champion and domain champion activities will help engage a wider audience.<br/><br/>The novel Neocortex architecture will couple two exceptionally powerful Cerebras CS-1 AI servers with an exceptionally large shared memory HPE Superdome Flex HPC server to achieve unprecedented AI scalability with excellent system balance. Each Cerebras CS-1 is powered by one Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) processor, a revolutionary high-performance processor designed specifically to accelerate deep learning training and inferencing. The Cerebras WSE is the largest chip ever built, containing 400,000 AI-optimized cores implemented on a 46,225 square millimeter wafer with 1.2 trillion transistors. An on-chip fabric provides 100Pb/s of bandwidth through a fully configurable 2D mesh with no software overhead. The Cerebras WSE includes 18GB of SRAM accessible within a single clock cycle at 9PB/s bandwidth. The Cerebras WSE is uniquely engineered to enable efficient sparse computation, wasting neither time nor power multiplying the many zeroes that occur in deep networks. The Cerebras CS-1 software can be programmed with common ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which for computational efficiency are mapped onto an optimized graph representation and a set of model-specific computation kernels. It also supports native code development. Support for the most popular deep learning frameworks and automatic, transparent acceleration will provide researchers with exceptional ease of use.<br/><br/>The HPE Superdome Flex HPC server of Neocortex will be an extremely powerful, user-friendly front end for the Cerebras CS-1 servers. This will enable flexible pre- and post-processing of data flowing in and out of the attached WSEs, preventing bottlenecks to taking full advantage of the WSE capability, and implementing advanced deep learning functions such as augmentation, hyper-parameter and model optimization, and ensemble learning. The Superdome Flex will be robustly provisioned with 24TB of RAM, 204.8TB of high-performance NVMe flash storage, 32 Intel Xeon CPUs, and 24 100GbE network interface cards to create the greatest flexibility for scaling applications across multiple CS-1 systems.  Internally, the HPE Superdome Flex is interconnected by a custom memory fabric ASIC for cache-coherent hardware shared memory sustaining 850GB/s of interconnect bandwidth. Its large and fast memory and high compute performance will enable training on very large datasets with exceptional ease, avoiding the laborious task of splitting and trying to load-balance datasets across worker nodes.<br/><br/>Each Cerebras CS-1 has 1.2Tbps I/O, and will connect to the HPE Superdome Flex via twelve, standard 100GbE links. This configuration will deliver the greatest possible performance and flexibility, including, via PSC-Cerebras and PSC-HPE research partnerships, exploration of scaling training to multiple CS-1 systems.<br/><br/>Neocortex will be federated via 16 InfiniBand HDR100 connections (an aggregate 1.6Tbps) with Bridges-2, an NSF-supported capacity resource. This federation will yield great benefits to the user community including access to the Bridges-2 filesystem to manage persistent data; general-purpose computing for data preprocessing and traditional machine learning; interoperation with data-intensive projects using Bridges-2; and high-bandwidth external network connectivity to other XSEDE Service Providers, campus, labs, and clouds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this, a team of researchers from four collaborating organizations proposed to develop BALLISTIC (Basic ALgebra Libraries for Sustainable Technology with Interdisciplinary Collaboration). The BALLISTIC project, through the leading-edge research it channels into its software deliverables, will lead to the introduction of tools that will simplify the transition to the next generation of extreme-scale computer architectures. The main impact of the project will be to develop, push, and deploy software into the scientific community to make it competitive on a world-wide scale and to contribute to standardization efforts in the area. BALLISTIC has the potential to become the community standard for dense linear algebra and be adopted and/or supported by a large community of users, computing centers, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) vendors. Learning to use numerical libraries is a basic part of the education of a computational scientist or engineer in many fields and at many academic institutions. BALLISTIC will have a correspondingly large impact on the research and education community, government laboratories, and private industry and support national efforts to build a workforce capable of employing state of the art tools in pursuit of science and engineering discoveries.<br/><br/>The goal of BALLISTIC is to create a layered package of software components that is capable of running at every level of the platform deployment pyramid and achieves three complementary objectives: (1) deliver seamless access to the most up-to-date algorithms, numerics, and performance via familiar Sca/LAPACK interfaces, wherever possible; (2) make advanced algorithms, numerics, and performance capabilities available through new interface extensions, wherever necessary; and (3) provide a well-engineered conduit through which new discoveries at the frontiers of research in these areas can be channeled as quickly as possible to all the applications from science and engineering communities that depend on high-performance linear algebra libraries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nitric oxide (NO) is a very important molecule in human physiology. It is, for example, a key immune defense agent released by cells from the immune system in response to encounters with bacteria that cause diseases. However, pathogenic bacteria have evolved defenses against NO.  These bacteria use enzymes called flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) to efficiently remove NO by transforming it into the less toxic molecule N2O. As a result, harmful bacteria can proliferate in the human body and can cause hard to cure infections. The research in Dr. Lehnert?s laboratory contributes to the elucidation of the mechanism of catalytic reactions by which FNORs break down NO by using molecules that mimic the active site of FNORs. Understanding the chemistry of FNORs can accelerate finding new cures against bacterial infections, in particular those caused by drug-resistant strains. The graduate and undergraduate students who do the research acquire knowledge and skills in advanced chemical synthesis, analytical and advanced spectroscopic methods, and become versed in how to approach and solve scientific problems. These skills help the students to successfully compete in the job market. Finally, outreach with Cass Technical High School in Detroit is integrated in this project. Here, underrepresented minority high school students participate in real research in the Lehnert laboratory over the summer.<br/><br/>This research project is aimed at using model complexes to gain insight in the active site of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs).  The focus is on the elucidation of the structural and electronic properties of the diiron active sites of the enzymes that influence the catalysis of the NO reduction to N2O. In previous work, Dr. Lehnert has synthesized model complexes that represent all three mechanistic possibilities of how FNORs could bind and activate NO. Next generation model systems are developed to investigate how the redox potential and the second coordination sphere of the diiron core of these enzymes affects the reactivity of the enzyme, and to determine the mechanism by which NO is bound and activated. According to DFT calculations, the key intermediate following N-N bond formation in FNORs is hyponitrite, but so far, researchers have not been able to trap these (or any) intermediates of the reaction. Here, model complexes are used to investigate the coordination chemistry of hyponitrite with non-heme iron centers and to establish relationships between the hyponitrite binding mode and the ability of the iron complexes to mediate N2O generation. Finally, previous work has shown that non-heme iron sites can form NO complexes in three different oxidation states, FeII/III/IV-NO(-). The corresponding FeIV-NO(-) species have recently been invoked as intermediates in biosynthetic pathways for natural products that contain the N-nitroso group. Dr. Lehnert uses the only known model complex for this species to investigate the biologically-relevant reactivity of FeIV-NO? type intermediates in N-N bond forming reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are fascinating soft matter systems that contain many surprises. The behavior of dissolved ions is quite complex, and some remarkable unexpected behaviors have been observed in such systems.  For example, dissolved ions that are thought to be very similar, such as sodium and potassium, affect polymer and protein molecules in completely different ways ----this is known as a ?specific ion effect?. Another unexpected phenomenon is known as overcharging or charge inversion: under certain conditions, molecules or oil droplets in water will change the sign of their electric charge, and thus start moving in the ?wrong? direction in the presence of an electric field. In this project, X-ray beams from synchrotron radiation facilities are used in order to gain a subnanoscale quantitative view of these systems and thus shed light on the origins of these novel phenomena. <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>This proposal addresses fundamental questions regarding the behavior of ions near aqueous solution interfaces. Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory describes the distribution of such ions, but does not properly account for the discreteness of ionic charge, and there is increasing evidence that it fails in many cases. However, there is no consensus about why it fails and how to develop a more universal picture. The goal of this project is to study the nanoscale ionic structures and processes underlying the nonintuitive phenomena of charge inversion (also known as overcharging), and specific ion effects (such as the Hofmeister series). The primary experimental probes used in this research are X-ray scattering and fluorescence spectroscopy, using synchrotron radiation. Ions in aqueous solution affect the behavior of colloids, polymers, batteries and some capacitors, and many other everyday materials and devices. Dissolved ions affect the physical properties of membranes and modify the behavior of proteins and DNA; indeed they are crucial to life. All these and other processes benefit from a better nanoscale understanding of how ions in aqueous solutions arrange themselves near interfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to their promising security guarantees, the cryptographic protocols for MPC have gained unprecedented exposure in the last decade. With the proliferation of large, distributed systems and computations such as Tor and blockchain, there is an urgent need for large-scale MPC to ensure security and privacy for these applications. However, large-scale applications pose some unique challenges for the design of MPC protocols. There are thousands of parties, often with unequal resources, and some number of parties are likely to fail during a protocol execution. This project proposes to design MPC protocols to address these challenges. The project?s novelties are the design of new MPC protocols satisfying the requirements of large-scale distributed applications. <br/><br/>Specifically, the investigators put forward a new framework for committee-based MPC for large-scale secure computations. These protocols distribute the computations across thousands of parallel committees to maximize the utilization of available resources for improved throughput. The designed protocols optimally choose committees and committee sub-protocols that optimize resource utilization and security. Additionally, they handle party failure and provide efficient oblivious access and search capabilities over data generated in these computations.  The team of researchers combines techniques from prior work on secure computation (MPC) and oblivious data structures to simultaneously achieve all of these goals. The project?s impacts are to enable new classes of privacy-preserving computation, analytics, and applications geared to the needs of real-world distributed systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, mathematics coaches in rural contexts frequently work in isolation with little access to professional learning opportunities to support their coaching practice. This project will create a fully online video-based model for mathematics teacher professional development focused on supporting mathematics coaches in rural contexts, building on the investigators' previous work focused on online professional learning opportunities for mathematics teachers in rural contexts.  Results from the previous project focused on rural teachers and their coaches show that the professional development model increased connections between what teachers notice about student thinking and broader principles of teaching and learning, that teachers were able to enact stronger levels of ambitious mathematics instruction, and that teachers who received coaching showed a stronger focus on math content and instructional practice. This extension of the model to coaches includes an online content-focused coaching course, cycles of one-on-one video-based coaching, and an online video club to analyze coaching practice.  The video clubs will be structured as a graduated model that will begin with facilitation by mentor coaches and move into coach participants facilitating their own sessions.<br/><br/>Three cohorts of 12 coach participants will be recruited, with one cohort launching each year.  In the first year, coaches will participate in four 2-hour synchronous content-focused course meetings, two coaching cycles with a mentor coach, and four video club meetings. In the second year, cohorts will conduct and facilitate four video club meetings.  Research on impact follows a design-based model, with iterative cycles of design and revision of the online model. An ongoing analysis of 15-20% of the data collected each year will be used to inform revisions to the model from year to year, with fuller data analysis ongoing throughout the project. Participating coaches will be engaged in a noticing interview and surveys to assess changes in their perceptions and practices as coaches.

In this project, the investigators will examine how chronic stress, age, health conditions, and immune status relate to the trajectory and severity of syphilis in a number of documented skeletal samples. The project will advance knowledge about factors that influence vulnerability to disease in the past, as well as the role of health and disease in shaping the human experience. The research findings may also inform clinical guidelines for the screening and diagnosis of modern cases of syphilis to more accurately identify host characteristics that are likely associated with persistent infection. In conjunction with the project, K-12 and public science outreach and education activities will be conducted by the research team in Kentucky, South Carolina, and Mississippi. The project will also enhance public and K-12 science education infrastructure through the creation of two permanent exhibits in the public Archaeology Museum of the Cobb Institute of Archaeology, Mississippi State University. As the museum has thousands of public and K-12 visitors each year, the exhibits will support efforts to broaden access to and participation in STEM fields.

In addition, mathematics coaches in rural contexts frequently work in isolation with little access to professional learning opportunities to support their coaching practice. This project will create a fully online video-based model for mathematics teacher professional development focused on supporting mathematics coaches in rural contexts, building on the investigators' previous work focused on online professional learning opportunities for mathematics teachers in rural contexts.  Results from the previous project focused on rural teachers and their coaches show that the professional development model increased connections between what teachers notice about student thinking and broader principles of teaching and learning, that teachers were able to enact stronger levels of ambitious mathematics instruction, and that teachers who received coaching showed a stronger focus on math content and instructional practice. This extension of the model to coaches includes an online content-focused coaching course, cycles of one-on-one video-based coaching, and an online video club to analyze coaching practice.  The video clubs will be structured as a graduated model that will begin with facilitation by mentor coaches and move into coach participants facilitating their own sessions.<br/><br/>Three cohorts of 12 coach participants will be recruited, with one cohort launching each year.  In the first year, coaches will participate in four 2-hour synchronous content-focused course meetings, two coaching cycles with a mentor coach, and four video club meetings. In the second year, cohorts will conduct and facilitate four video club meetings.  Research on impact follows a design-based model, with iterative cycles of design and revision of the online model. An ongoing analysis of 15-20% of the data collected each year will be used to inform revisions to the model from year to year, with fuller data analysis ongoing throughout the project.

For this reason, it is important to understand what happens to CO2 after it is emitted into the atmosphere ? does it stay in the atmosphere or is some of it taken up by the oceans or land? The complex group of processes that control CO2 in the environment is called the carbon cycle. The Arctic Ocean is a region where the carbon cycle is not very well understood. Sea surface warming and loss of sea ice are rapidly changing the Arctic Ocean but it is unclear how these changes affect the carbon cycle and ocean acidification (the decrease in ocean pH due to the formation of carbonic acid when CO2 dissolves in water). Scientists need more information to understand these changes but research accessibility in the Arctic is limited. It is a harsh environment, dark, and very cold for much of the year and where icebreakers are typically required to do ocean measurements. Hence, most Arctic Ocean studies are made only during the summer period when work conditions are feasible. This project overcomes these limitations by deploying autonomous sensors on moorings and drifters. Three moorings will be placed in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean with CO2, pH and other sensors. Drifters will also be deployed with CO2 sensors suspended below the ice. These sensors will provide valuable data throughout the year for understanding the carbon cycle and how it is changing. The project will also make all these data available to the research community and other stakeholders. <br/><br/>The specific goal of the study is to continue to operate an Arctic Observing Network (AON) for the measurement of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), pH, and dissolved O2 (DO) focused on the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean (specifically, the Canada Basin). The grant will support participation in the Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) project that includes annual cruises on the Canadian icebreaker, the CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent. Along with three more years of shipboard pCO2 data (2020-2022), this AON effort will collect up to a fifteen year-long mooring based time-series of pCO2, pH and DO data, and six ~year-long times-series of pCO2 and DO data on Ice-Tethered Profilers (ITPs). These high temporal resolution, long-term measurements will be used to quantify air-sea CO2 fluxes, the rate of ocean acidification, and to understand to what extent changing seasonal ice formation regulates sea surface pCO2. These data will also be used to improve coupled physical-biogeochemical models of the Arctic Ocean. Other researchers will have access to these data through the National Science Foundation Arctic Data Center and international SOCAT data repository.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The EEB acts like a railroad switch, controlling where that freshwater moves within the Arctic Ocean and sub-polar seas. The freshwater input from rivers is increasing as the Arctic warms. This makes understanding processes in the Eastern Eurasian Basin especially important. This study aims to understand how the EEB redistributes ice and fresh water between the eastern and western Arctic in response to changes in the atmosphere. Three biennial cruises, planned for August-September, will take measurements between Franz Josef Land and the central East Siberian Sea, following a path that moves from shallow water to the deep sea. The sampling program connects observations using moorings, ship sampling, and drifters. These efforts will inform the scientific community and the broader public about major changes in the EEB that could impact the state of Arctic ice cover, marine ecosystems, and areas further south. The proposed observations are also important for developing estimates for future summer sea-ice conditions, which are valuable information for national security, the transportation industry, and weather forecasting. A graduate student and a K-12 teacher will join the cruises to engage in research. Together with a researcher, they will share and reach out to classrooms and the general public. The project will support one graduate student. <br/><br/>The eastern Eurasian Basin (EEB), including its shelves distributes ice and Arctic riverine water between the Eastern and Western Arctic. This provides the shortest pathway for Arctic freshwater to the sub-polar seas where weak stratification leads to deep convection, a key mechanisms of global thermohaline circulation. Recent observations have captured unprecedented changes in the EEB, likely representing a fundamental shift to a new, less stable, more dynamic mode. The goal of our study is to develop a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of how the EEB functions, accumulating and releasing major Arctic riverine transports and redistributing ice and fresh water between the Eastern and Western Arctic in response to atmospheric and oceanic forcings. Quantifying EEB freshwater inventories and transports, following alternating atmospheric regimes, will be critical to future understanding of the Arctic Ocean's oceanography. This program will provide sustained measurements in critical areas; data and products, critically-needed benchmarks for Arctic satellite sea-ice and altimeter measurements, will be publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet the growing biotechnology workforce needs, the National Center for Biotechnology Workforce at Forsyth Technical Community College has been supporting nationwide education and training of technicians in biotechnology, bioprocessing, and related programs at community colleges. Biotechnology industries increasingly need workers with hands-on training in high-resolution mass spectrometry.   This project aims to expand the breadth and relevance of its support for biotechnology technician education by acquiring a high-resolution mass spectrometer. This state-of-the-art analytical tool can identify specific chemicals in a sample, even when the sample contains only a trillionth of a gram of that chemical.  Such information is used in industries ranging from environmental testing, and food and beverage production, to drug discovery and manufacturing.  The project proposes to use this spectrometer to train students and faculty in state-of-the art high-resolution mass spectrometry technology, thus aligning  technician education with emerging workforce needs.<br/><br/>The project has two goals.  First, it plans to acquire a high-resolution mass spectrometer and collaborate with industry partners to use real-world bioscience projects to provide students with skills-based instruction in how to use this technology.  Second, it plans to provide workshops that will help high school STEM educators increase their understanding of the bioscience industry, including the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry. These workshops are intended to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills they need to guide students into community college technician education programs that lead to bioscience careers. The College will partner with educators, employers, and entrepreneurs in and around Innovation Quarter in downtown Winston-Salem, NC, to develop instructional labs using high-resolution mass spectrometry on industry-related projects. Labs will include standard operating procedures on how to use the instrument to collect high-resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as how to interpret these data. This skills-based learning will serve faculty and students from the College and high school STEM programs, as well as those at other local universities. The workshops will also serve educators from across the nation who will be selected for their interest in and potential to develop advanced skills training that connects their local industry with the classroom. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project at Albany State University seeks to design, fabricate, and test a microwave absorber by engineering the electrical property  of materials that are commercially available and inexpensive. It provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>Operational frequency or absorbing frequency of a microwave absorber depends on permittivity, permeability, and thickness of the material. This research focuses on the complex permittivity of existing materials which can be enhanced by periodic inclusions of metal strips or patches on the material. Appropriate dimensions of the metal strips or patches are determined by a 3D electromagnetic simulation package (HFSS) to obtain pre-determined material permittivity required for perfect impedance matching between the absorber and free space. Once pre-designed metal patterns are printed on dielectric layers, stability in material property is analyzed experimentally by varying the number of layers. Finally, the desired absorber is fabricated by stacking up the required number of printed layers together and the performance is evaluated with free space material measurement equipment. The concept of tuning the material property with metal inclusions, as adopted in this project, can be applied to design any planer microwave devices such as resonators, filters, directional couplers, and antennas for improved performance and to protect the human body from 5G radiations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project at Vorhees College seeks to develop computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and segmentation methods using optimal sampling lattices and provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences in computer modeling. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at the University of South Carolina. <br/><br/>Computed tomography is an important tool to create the internal image of a physical body. Image reconstruction is to compute the internal image from the scanned data and image segmentation may help to locate the internal objects or their boundaries in the image. The usual CT computations are done on a Cartesian lattice whose pixels are squares or cubes. However optimal sampling lattices, such as 2D hexagonal and 3D face centered cubic and body centered cubic lattices, provide more efficient sampling and better adjacency relation than the traditional Cartesian lattices. In this project, for the 2D case, images will be reconstructed from scanned data using the filtered back-projection method over a hexagonal lattice and in a regular hexagonal region. Then image segmentation methods such as graph-cuts on the reconstructed images are applied. Because a CT machine rotates to perform scans from different directions, a 2D object to be scanned may be assumed to be circular. Since the circular region can be embedded into a regular hexagon more tightly than into a square, fewer number of lattice points may be involved and the lattice points can be efficiently indexed for image segmentation. Hence the computational time for image segmentation may be reduced and the quality may be improved. Computer simulations will be done to evaluate the new algorithms in terms of image segmentation quality and computational efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of this work will provide an opportunity to use the past to understand the present response of mammalian and plant communities to rapid warming events in the long term, information that is critical for the management of habitat resources. Additional broader impacts of this study include the development of scientific expertise in undergraduate students; science outreach at multiple museums via exhibits and modules; sharing data, methods, and results via scientific dissemination, open access publications and social media; and curriculum development for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO), increased global surface temperatures by 4 degrees Celsius, which is the same increase predicted for our modern climatic crisis by 2100.

Quantifying groundwater recharge is essential for groundwater management particularly in irrigated agricultural regions relying on streamflow and recharge from mountain watersheds. Precipitation (snow and rain) in California's Sierra Nevada is the dominant natural recharge mechanism for the Central Valley, a vitally important agricultural region. Frequent drought and changes in snowpack in the Sierra Nevada are expected to change recharge rates, posing challenges to water security, sustainable water management, and agriculture production. This project will integrate several research methods to investigate the most important drivers of groundwater recharge in the Kaweah River watershed in southern Sierra Nevada, and will quantify groundwater response to climate variability, droughts, and changes in vegetation. The project aims to improve hydrologic sciences education and problem-solving skills for groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines by engaging undergraduate and graduate students in research, and developing online learning modules focused on hydrologic processes of mountain catchments. The project will train high school teachers and design online educational resources for STEM teaching in high schools. By involving the Kaweah River watershed citizens in data collection, the project will increase public awareness of complex factors that affect water resources in California. <br/><br/>Although groundwater recharge supplies 66.5% of streamflow in arid and semi-arid mountain catchments, understanding of mountain system aquifer recharge rates and groundwater flow paths from mountains to valley aquifers is limited. This project will investigate groundwater recharge in a mountain-valley aquifer system in the Kaweah River watershed of California?s Sierra Nevada through field data collection, laboratory analysis and numerical modeling. A suite of hydrometric observations and hydrochemical tracers will measure catchment water balance dynamics, residence times of surface water and groundwater, and bedrock groundwater?s contribution to streams. An integrated hydrologic model informed by multiple sources of observations, will constrain groundwater flow paths from mountain to valley aquifers, and improve recharge estimation. Quantifying recharge and understanding the degree of connectivity between the mountain and valley aquifer system will provide understanding of the hydrologic contributions from mountain-valley systems for sustainable water resources. Results will inform development of a computationally efficient groundwater module of the Soil Moisture and Runoff simulation Toolkit (SMART), a semi-distributed hydrologic modeling framework. The novel SMART-G computational framework will investigate surface water-groundwater interactions in mountain watersheds, and predict impacts of climate variability and land cover changes on water resources. The project will engage undergraduate students in research and develop educational materials to prepare skilled workforce in hydrologic sciences. The project will train high school teachers to prepare students in STEM requirements for university admission, and involve citizen scientists to increase public awareness about water resources. Modeling tools will be disseminated worldwide and will inform policy and groundwater management decisions at the local and state level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to address this need in the context of elementary mathematics teacher preparation through the development and use of mixed reality simulations.  These simulations represent low-stakes opportunities for preservice teachers to practice research-based instructional strategies to support mathematics learning, and to receive feedback on their practices. Learning units that use the simulations will focus on two high leverage practices: teacher modeling of self-monitoring and reflection strategies during problem solving and using strategy instruction to teach students to support problem solving. These high-leverage teaching practices will support teachers engaging all students, including students with disabilities, in conceptually sophisticated mathematics in which students are treated as sense-makers and empowered to do mathematics in culturally meaningful ways.<br/><br/>The project work encompasses three primary aims.  The first aim is to develop a consensus around shared definitions of high-leverage practices across the mathematics education and special education communities.  To accomplish this goal, the project will convene a series of consensus-building panels with mathematics education and special education experts to develop shared definitions of the two targeted high leverage practices.  This work will include engaging with current research, group  discussion, and production of documents with specifications for the practices. The second aim is to develop learning units for elementary mathematics methods courses grounded in mixed reality simulation. These simulations will allow teacher candidates to enact the high leverage practices with simulated students and to receive coaching on their practice from the research team. The impact of this work will be assessed through the analysis of interviews with teacher educators implementing the units and observations and artifacts from the implementations. The third aim will be to assess the effectiveness of the simulations on teacher candidates? practices and beliefs through small-scaled randomized control trials. Teacher candidates will be randomly assigned to conditions that address the practices and make use of simulations, and a business as usual condition focused on lesson planning, student assessment, and small group discussions of the high leverage practices.

Even when the software running on embedded hardware is trusted, an attacker can still insert malicious code when the program is running to compromise system security. Therefore, to mitigate such software attacks on embedded systems, it is critical that both hardware and software are holistically combined into an effective system architecture to safeguard and preserve our nation?s interests. This project will systematically and comprehensively explore the implementation of dynamic security policies with high assurance on reconfigurable hardware with significant reduction in power and latency. This research project will foster new research directions in several areas, spanning programming languages, security policies, computer architecture, reconfigurable hardware and applications, with the potential to significantly transform the design of next-generation embedded manycore architectures. All the research findings and simulation toolkits will be disseminated to the community via conference and journal publications, and a dedicated website. The research will also play a major role in education by integrating discovery with teaching and training. This project will continue to expand outreach activities and broaden participation in computing by making the necessary efforts to attract and train minority students in this field. <br/><br/>The design and implementation of high-level language abstractions for specification, verification, and implementation of reconfigurable hardware monitors, with specific emphasis on low-overhead defenses against control- and information-flow attacks is proposed in this project. The overarching goal of this project is to dynamically update hardware in response to program behavior in order to monitor precise security policies with minimal overhead (power, area, time).  First, this project will develop high-level language abstractions for implementing dynamic security monitors, those that reconfigure at runtime to enforce precise security properties. To provide high assurance, a verified compiler to an idealized hardware description language together with associated tools such as a verified equational theory will be developed. Second, this project will explore the design and implementation of reusable hardware components against which the high-level language abstractions can be compiled both in uni- and manycore environments. The basic building blocks will be aggregated into coarse-grain reconfigurable arrays (CGRA) that can be tailored to program behavior via state and topology reconfiguration. Third, in software, this project will validate security monitors implementing defenses against code- and control-flow injection attacks, among others. In hardware, this project will extensively model and simulate security monitors using simulation tools to evaluate latency, execution time, power and area overhead on benchmark suites. Finally, this project will validate that the proposed hardware monitors that are generated by the high-level security policies will detect and mitigate attacks. This project will result in (1) novel high-level language abstractions for dynamic security policies implemented on reconfigurable hardware; (2) a verified compiler to an idealized hardware description language together with an equational theory; (3) the design and implementation of reusable hardware components (a basic block) that retain state while allowing policy reconfiguration; (4) the aggregation of basic blocks into CGRA that can be tailored to program behavior via state and topology updates for uni- and manycore architectures; and (5) extensive modeling and simulation of hardware monitors that implement defenses against code- and control-flow injection attacks using benchmarks and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to address this need in the context of elementary mathematics teacher preparation through the development and use of mixed reality simulations.  These simulations represent low-stakes opportunities for preservice teachers to practice research-based instructional strategies to support mathematics learning, and to receive feedback on their practices. Learning units that use the simulations will focus on two high leverage practices: teacher modeling of self-monitoring and reflection strategies during problem solving and using strategy instruction to teach students to support problem solving. These high-leverage teaching practices will support teachers engaging all students, including students with disabilities, in conceptually sophisticated mathematics in which students are treated as sense-makers and empowered to do mathematics in culturally meaningful ways.<br/><br/>The project work encompasses three primary aims.  The first aim is to develop a consensus around shared definitions of high-leverage practices across the mathematics education and special education communities.  To accomplish this goal, the project will convene a series of consensus-building panels with mathematics education and special education experts to develop shared definitions of the two targeted high leverage practices.  This work will include engaging with current research, group  discussion, and production of documents with specifications for the practices. The second aim is to develop learning units for elementary mathematics methods courses grounded in mixed reality simulation. These simulations will allow teacher candidates to enact the high leverage practices with simulated students and to receive coaching on their practice from the research team. The impact of this work will be assessed through the analysis of interviews with teacher educators implementing the units and observations and artifacts from the implementations. The third aim will be to assess the effectiveness of the simulations on teacher candidates? practices and beliefs through small-scaled randomized control trials.

Too many or too few bacteria may disrupt a sensitive ecological balance and proper functioning of environmental processes such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. The abundance of bacteria populations in any given environment is controlled by various biological, chemical and physical mechanisms. Among the biological agents are microscopic predators, or micropredators, of bacteria. The most studied of these are protists, viruses that infect bacteria, and a group of bacteria collectively known as the Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs).  These micropredators prey upon certain bacteria to obtain required nutrients or other cellular material for their replication. In the process, cellular products from the prey bacteria are released into the environment and utilized as nutrients by other microbes. Although the micropredators co-occur, and likely interact, in nature, most experimental studies have investigated their activities individually, rather than collectively. As a result, little is known about their collective role in controlling bacteria populations and the cycling of nutrients. The goal of the proposed research is to address this gap in knowledge by investigating all three as a collective group under simulated natural conditions representing a range of temperature, salinity and abundance of prey. This project is conducted at two Historically Black Universities (HBCUs) with strong records of training and mentoring students and postdocs from underrepresented populations in science.   The project benefits up to 100 students by providing unique and meaningful educational and research training experiences at the undergraduate and graduate student levels and for early-career scientist.  Specific activities include courses on scientific writing and presenting results at annual project workshops as well as national and international scientific meetings.  Graduate students are being trained in modern advanced methodologies in chemistry and microbiology.  There is an ongoing assessment module to document education and training outcomes.<br/><br/>Up to now, the two mainly accepted mechanisms of mortality in bacterial populations are heterotrophic protist grazing and viral infection. Increasingly, it has become evident that an understudied group of predatory bacteria, BALOs, can also contribute to bacterial mortality. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of BALO-prey interactions are poorly understood, as are the interactions among the micropredators, BALOs, protists and bacterial viruses. Ultimately, these processes may have contrasting influences on the structure and functioning of the microbial loop, including impacting higher trophic levels and biogeochemical cycles. The investigators hypothesize that environmental factors significantly influence how mortality in bacterial populations is partitioned among the micropredators. To test this hypothesis researchers are (1) investigating the interactions amongst the micropredators, (2) examining the molecular-level composition and dynamics of dissolved organic matter as the result of the different mortality processes by the NMR/ FT-ICR mass spectrometry (MS) hybrid approach, and (3) modeling these tri-trophic dynamics. Intellectual Merit: Results from this research will define a new mechanistic understanding of mortality dynamics that influence the microbial loop and oceanic biogeochemical cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several types of Earth science research require analyzing materials such as soil, rock, water, and microbes below the ground surface. Drilled boreholes also allow installation of instruments below the surface that improve our understanding of earthquake processes, or the movement of water below the surface, or processes that form different minerals and change rock into soil, or the best ways to harness geothermal energy. Over time, sediment layers are deposited in lakes, and each of the sediment layers contains information about the conditions around the lake at the time it was deposited. Collecting core samples from lakebeds allows analysis of the layers of sediment to understand how climate, water, ecosystems, volcanoes, and Earth?s plate motions have changed in the region near the lake, throughout the entire lifespan of the lake. Reaching these materials deep below the surface requires drilling and core sampling. These procedures are complex, expensive, and can be high risk, and the tools, instruments, and data systems are specialized. CSDF supports hundreds of research projects per year that involve short coring in lakes to deep drilling in crystalline rock.  Activities of the CSDF include: project development; logistics and contracting; field operations management; outreach and education; rental and sales of specialized equipment and supplies; core scanning, splitting/slabbing, subsampling, and description; subsample preparation and analysis; maintenance of repositories for stewardship of samples, data, publications, and reference collections; cyberinfrastructure development; physical infrastructure development; and community coordination.<br/><br/>Scientific drilling and coring are essential for the advancement of the Earth Sciences. They are the primary means to access fresh, unweathered materials that are not exposed at the surface. Core samples from lakes and other sedimentary basins provide archives of environmental and ecosystem history, allowing reconstruction of the Earth-life system through time to understand system changes and ecosystem response and resilience. Core samples and boreholes provide a means to understand hydrologic, geologic, and geochemical processes operating at depth, through sampling, in-situ measurements, and long-term monitoring. Subsurface microbiological communities may be sampled and analyzed to understand their role in rock weathering, fault mechanics, and other geologic and geochemical processes. Scientific motivations are diverse, including hydrology and fluid transport, geochemistry, geomicrobiology, paleorecords of the Earth-Life system, volcanology and magmatism, tectonics, geothermal, fault mechanics and seismicity, rock weathering, and bolide impacts. Coring and drilling operations that enable this science are often complex, highly technical, expensive, and entail substantial risk, and the equipment, tooling, instrumentation, and data management systems required are specialized. Although requirements vary between projects, the many commonalities allow economies of scale by leveraging shared expertise and resources, even as projects range in depth or cost by a factor of 100,000 or more.

In this research project, experiments will be performed to learn how protein molecules interact with each other.  Proteins often stick together  or bind to other proteins of the same type, or of different types, and these types of interactions are critical to protein structure, function, and stability.  Though it is fairly easy to ""see"" these interactions by determining structures of protein complexes, the rules by which the different parts of proteins bind are not known.  Here, a series of proteins have been identified in which the protein subunits that bind are all in a single protein chain, making studies of their interactions quite simple to study.  Studies will take advantage of the architecture of these ""tandem repeat proteins"" to learn the rules by which protein subunits stick together.  These rules will reveal not only why tandem repeats stick together, but also why separate protein chains stick together.  Thus these rules will provide an understanding of protein structure and function in complexes ranging from pairs of protein chains all the way up to the very large protein assemblies that give cells and tissues their shapes and mechanical properties and allow cells to communicate with each other. This research will help train students, both at the undergraduate and graduate level, in the methods of cutting-edge biophysics and biochemistry, both in the laboratory and through the use of computer simulations.<br/><br/>These studies will use experimental and computational methods.  Fragments of five different proteins will be prepared in the lab, and their structures will be studied with x-ray diffraction and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Fragment stabilities will be determined using optical techniques like fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy.  Computer simulations will also be used to learn what types of interactions promote interaction between protein subunits.  A key aspect of this research project is that the repeating structure of proteins studied here can be analyzed with a model called an ""Ising"" model.  This model allows the precise measurement of the strength of interaction between protein subunits.  The rules that are learned from this analysis will apply not only to other repeat proteins, but to non-repeating protein assemblies, which use the same types of interactions (packing, charge interactions, and hydrogen bonding) as repeat proteins do.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crustal formation within volcanic arcs is a profoundly important process that continually replenishes the mass of the continents, whose constant weathering and erosion provide the source of elemental nutrients that drive Earth's biogeochemical cycles.  Remarkably, the creation of new continental material and the recycling of material back into the mantle have remained balanced on Earth over hundreds of millions of years. Understanding this balance is key to understanding the habitability of the planet. All of Earth's crust is created from partial melts of the deeper mantle that rise upward and then freeze to form the crust.  The building blocks of continental crust form when water released from a subducting tectonic plate lowers the melting temperature of the mantle, creating magma that rises and accumulates in volcanic arcs.  The process of arc-crust formation has been the focus of many studies, but our understanding of these process is far from a complete.  Questions persist because arc processes are complex and episodic, they occur over a range of spatial scales and depend on variables such as the age of the subducting plate and the evolutionary stage of a given arc, which may never reach a steady state.  The study location of this project is the Andreanof segment of the Aleutian arc.  Coincidentally, this location coincides with the epicenter of the 1957 Great Aleutian earthquake, the third largest earthquake of the last century and with the largest aftershock zone of any earthquake ever recorded.  Active-source seismic techniques will be used to image the seismic velocity structure of the entire crust along and across this arc segment to address many of the unanswered questions of arc-crust formation.  These same methodologies can be used to address questions related to earthquake and volcanic hazards common to volcanic arcs.  The education component of this project will train a cohort of the next generation of scientists in the acquisition and advance analyses of these types of data.<br/><br/>Through this grant an active-source seismic experiment will be conducted in the Andreanof segment of the Aleutian arc in order to study arc-crust formation processes.  Many basic questions about arc-crust formation processes remain, including the source and variability of primary arc magmas, where and how these magmas fractionate to produce the characteristic arc geochemical signatures of crustal rocks, the role of water in all of these processes, the bulk composition of arc crust and its basic architecture and similarity to continental crust, the forcing functions for all of these processes and the temporal and spatial variability of those forcings, and the mass balance of the entire system.  Substantial advance can be made by focused, multi-disciplinary study of an arc segment that has simple, well known magmatic and tectonic histories, well studied geochemistry, and sufficient along-strike variability to capture many of the processes that are believed to control arc-crust geochemical and structural evolution.  The Andreanof segment is one of very few locations that satisfy these criteria. It consists of an intact, arc massif formed during three identifiable and dated magmatic episodes; it is only modestly deformed and exhibits along-strike variability in active volcanism from primarily basaltic in the east to andesitic/dacitic in the west.  The seismic experiment supported by this grant will consist of one transect along the entire length of the segment and two arc-crossing transects.  Multi-channel seismic (MCS) data, recorded on an 8-km-long streamer, and ocean-bottom seismic data, with instrument spacings of 10 to 15 km, will be acquired along each transect, and these data will be analyzed with advanced tomographic and MCS imaging methodologies to produce seismic velocity and reflectivity images that will reveal, for the first time, the full crustal architecture of an intact arc massif at a segment scale.  These images will provide estimates of composition that will inform models of melt emplacement and fractionation, and enable a number of specific questions to be addressed, including: What is the bulk composition, thickness and basic architecture of oceanic-arc crust, How are variations in factors such as primary magma composition and crustal processing of magmas expressed in bulk arc crustal composition and structure, and What is the fate of mafic/ultra-mafic cumulates?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Aim will: (1) study how different network optimization trade-offs sculpt the shape of plant shoot architectures using the theory of Pareto optimality, and how different trade-off objectives are prioritized depending on the environment and species; (2) determine the molecular mechanisms (genes) that drive prioritizations; and (3) determine what search algorithms are used by plant shoots to find resources and to strategize growth. These questions will be studied using 3D laser scanning of crop species (tomato, tobacco, sorghum, corn, rice) grown across multiple conditions and time-points, and of model species with different genetic backgrounds. Overall, this Aim will link network design principles commonly studied in computer science with those driving network formation and adaptation in plants, and may help design and evaluate breeding strategies to enhance crop yield. The second Aim is to develop models of network warfare to study plant-plant competition. This Aim will: (1) create ""gladiator-style"" arenas to study how two plants battle for limited light; (2) develop game theory methods to assess whether dominant or stable strategies emerge; and (3) quantify how competition strategies differ based on the species of the two plants and their growth environment. This Aim will lead to predictive models of plant social interactions that can inform the design of polyculture farming spaces based on which plants ""get along"" the best. The third Aim is to test the generality of these principles to other biological and engineered branching structures. This Aim will test if the branching properties learned from plant shoot architectures also dictate the structure of plant root architectures below ground and neural (axonal and dendritic) architectures in the brain. For example, are root architectures also Pareto optimal? What search algorithms do they use to find nutrients? How does competition affect these strategies? This will also lead to the first quantitative comparison of branching structures across two kingdoms of life, from plants to neurons. Finally, this Aim will also study human-engineered networks that also must adapt their structure to resource availability and demand in dynamic environments. Insights from biology could reveal new strategies for optimal reconstruction of damaged infrastructure after war or natural disasters, or extension of existing infrastructure into developing areas.<br/>    <br/> URL: http://www.snl.salk.edu/~navlakha/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
